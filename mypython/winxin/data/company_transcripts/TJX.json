Welcome to the TJX Companies' Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, November 18, 2014.", "I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Elan, good morning, everyone. Before we begin, Deb has a few words.", "Deb McConnell", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings including, without limitations, the Form 10-K filed April 1, 2014.", "Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies.

Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript.", "Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis. Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release in the Investor Information section of our website, tjx.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today's press release or otherwise posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Deb. And joining me and Deb on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg.", "So let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 13% over last year's strong 21% increase. This was at the high end of our expected range and as Scott will detail in a moment despite not having the foreign currency benefit we anticipated for the quarter.", "Consolidated comp store sales grew 2% also at the high end of our plan and over a 5% increase last year. This marks our 23rd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. We were also delighted that customer traffic was slightly up to the third quarter, as we continued to gain momentum from the first and second quarters.", "In addition, while we're pleased with our comp results, we believe they would have been stronger without the negative impact of the weather in the US and Europe. At Marmaxx, we saw solid trends in August and September, but with unseasonably warm temperatures across the country in October, apparel sales turned softer. That said, our Marmaxx home, jewelry and accessory businesses, which are less weather-sensitive, were outstanding for the quarter.", "Similarly, the weather turned extraordinarily warm across our European regions in September, which we believe hurt sales. With temperatures starting to cool in November, the fourth quarter is off to a very strong start for TJX overall.", "Before we share with you the numerous short and long-term growth opportunities we see for the company, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap some of the numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. As Carol mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 2%, at the high end of our plan and over a 5% increase last year, our strongest quarterly comp in 2013. Our third quarter comp was driven by an increase in units sold, while customer traffic was slightly up and ticket was essentially flat. We were pleased with the sequential improvement in traffic from the first half of the year. As a reminder, our traffic calculation is based on the number of customer transactions.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.85 compared with last year's reported $0.86. Last year's third quarter EPS included an $0.11 benefit. Excluding this benefit, earnings per share grew 13% over last year's adjusted EPS of $0.75. Foreign exchange was neutral to earnings per share, which is the same as last year. What our third quarter guidance had contemplated was $0.01 benefit. So clearly, FX was $0.01 worse than we expected.", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 13% for the quarter, up 40 basis points versus strong growth last year. Gross profit margin was 29.4%, up 10 basis points versus last year's strong increase. Merchandise margins were slightly down primarily due to TJX Canada, which was hurt by FX. I should note that our Canadian organization did a great job of mitigating that impact.", "SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 16.2% for the quarter, 40 basis points improvement versus last year's ratio. The favorability versus the prior year was due to items related to our new home office facility last year and expense favorability.", "At the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including the warehouses and excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were up 3% on a constant currency basis versus a 4% decline last year, as we transitioned into gift-giving a bit earlier this year. We are very comfortable with our inventory position with excellent liquidity. I should also note that our in-store inventories are planned to be down at year-end versus the prior year.", "In terms of share repurchases, during the third quarter, we bought back $448 million of TJX stock, retiring 7.5 million shares. Year-to-date, we have retired 21.5 million shares, buying back $1.2 billion of stock. We continue to anticipate buying $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of TJX stock this year.", "Now let me turn the call back to Carol, and I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year fiscal '15 guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Scott. Before moving to our near and long-term growth drivers, I will share some additional color on our third quarter performance by division, beginning in the US.", "I'll move straight to Marmaxx. Comps increased 1% over strong 4% increase last year. While we usually do not give color on monthly comps, I think it's important for some additional insight into the quarter. Again, we were very pleased with our comps and traffic in August and September. Trends in these months were significantly better than in October when we believe the unseasonably warm weather across the country had a dramatic impact on customer traffic and dampened demand for apparel. I would like to note that the fourth quarter is off to a very strong start.", "Also, our non-apparel businesses, including home, jewelry and accessories, were terrific in the third quarter. We are very encouraged by our customer traffic overall, which was slightly up for the quarter and represented sequential improvements from the first and second quarters. We are pleased that segment profit margin was 14.5% on a 1% comp, including the de-leverage from our e-commerce businesses.", "I'm confident about Marmaxx heading into the fourth quarter. We see a marketplace absolutely loaded with quality brand and merchandize and we are well positioned to buy into these opportunities. We also have great initiatives planned, which I'll discuss in a moment.", "HomeGoods delivered an outstanding quarter. Comps were up 7% over 10% growth last year, and segment profit margin was 13.9% million or up 80 basis points. We are thrilled with HomeGoods' continued excellent performance. I can't tell you how many people asked me when are we going to open a HomeGoods in their area. We are doing a lot of work on our supply chain to support the future growth of HomeGoods, which we believe still has tremendous potential.", "Moving to our international divisions, at TJX Canada, comps increased 3% versus and segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was down 10 basis points. Profit margins were well above our plan as our Canadian organization did an excellent job mitigating the foreign exchange impact on merchandize margins despite the significant decline in the Canadian dollar.", "Further, we are pleased with Marshalls' consistent strong performance in Canada, as it gives us another vehicle to grow our off-price concept in that country. TJX Europe's comps decreased 1% versus a 5% increase last year. We believe TJX Europe was dramatically hurt as temperatures turned unseasonably warm across our regions in September and dampened sales of apparel. TJX Europe's positive momentum continued through August, which was seasonable when we saw the change as soon as the warm weather hit. We were also encouraged to see sales trends improve as we started the fourth quarter. The upside to the warm weather at the marketplace in Europe is flooded with amazing deals on amazing merchandize.", "Segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was 10.4%, flat to last year. We are extremely pleased that TJX Europe drove merchandize margin increases on a negative 1%. This speaks to the flexibility and the resiliency of our off-price model.", "As to e-commerce, we continue to be pleased with our online businesses in the US and the UK. We recently passed the one-year mark with tjmaxx.com and we feel very good about the progress we've made. We've added a number of new categories, including juniors, men's and jewelry, and hundreds of new vendors to the site. Customer response has been terrific and we plan to continue adding new categories and brands to create an even more exciting shopping experience for our customers.", "We are beginning to roll out permanent signage promoting tjmaxx.com in our stores and have integrated it in all of our T.J. Maxx marketing as we are now confident we can service our customers well.", "Now to the near-term growth drivers for the holiday season and fourth quarter. First, our gift-giving initiatives, which I believe are the best ever, will be focusing even more heavily on gift giving this year and shipping our stores with fresh selections throughout the holiday season. We see this as a major differentiator between us and other retailers. Shoppers can expect to see the unexpected every time they visit. I hope by now that you've seen our new tri-branding commercials. We love them.", "Second, we have many unique and exciting in-store initiatives planned, which take advantage of our flexibility. You have to shop our stores to see what they are. And third, we are raising the bar on our marketing campaigns again this year. Our television campaigns will run every single week in North America and throughout the holiday season. We are also bringing tri-branding to Canada for the first time this year. Further, all of our divisions are using a multi-layered approach to reaching more consumers including television, radio and digital advertising.", "As I mentioned, we continue to be more aggressive marketing e-commerce. Online will be part of our TJ Maxx brand marketing now and in the future. Most importantly, we remain focused on allowing shoppers with outstanding values on quality branded and fashionable gift collections. We are convinced this is what will drive shoppers to our stores this holiday season.", "Moving to our longer-term opportunities, I'll recap our four pillars for growth. These give us great confidence that we will continue to drive profitable growth for many years to come. Starting with our first pillar, driving customer traffic and comp sales, we continue to see enormous opportunities to gain market share. We are still underpenetrated versus US department stores and see huge opportunities internationally. We have many initiatives underway to attract new customers and encourage existing customers to shop us more frequently.", "Let me address the question of competition, which we've been hearing a lot lately. Do I worry about the competition? No more than I have before. Let me be clear, we are extremely focused on getting a bigger piece of the pie regardless of how big that pie is. We offer customers a treasure hunt of constantly fresh and eclectic assortments of exciting brands and merchandize source around the globe, which we see as a major differentiator. Further, we work on executing our business model every day so we can be better than the competition.", "To drive customer traffic, we are leveraging our global marketing capabilities. We have expanded our TJX rewards loyalty program and are pleased with the customer response to our non-credit access loyalty card, which we rolled out across the US in the second quarter. To retain shoppers and encourage more frequent visits, we continue to work on making our stores better every day. We are on track with our plans for our new Marshalls prototype and are pleased that our overall customer satisfaction scores increased versus last year. In addition, we see big opportunities to engage with more customers by e-mail.", "Our second pillar is our enormous brick-and-mortar potential. With almost 3,400 stores today, we see the potential to grow to 5,150 stores long term with our existing chain in our existing countries alone. In North America, we have built a strong foundation with over 2,900 stores and see the potential to add over 1,300 new stores. We are one of only a handful of retailers who know what it takes to succeed in both US and Canada, and we are building upon that successful foundation.", "Internationally, we have built the European platform over two decades that is not easily replicated. With 440 stores today, we believe we can almost double that to 875 total stores in just our current countries with our current chains alone. Beyond this, we see a tremendous retail landscape for us in other European countries. We are excited about expanding to our next European country, Austria, with our first few stores opening planned in the first half of 2015. And we will have more to come on Europe on our year-end call.", "Our next pillar is e-commerce expansion. While e-commerce is still in its infancy and a little over 1% of total sales, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing and believe in it as a growth vehicle for the future. Our plan remains to grow smart and take a deliberate approach to building our online business to ensure that our growth is incremental to and not at the expense of our very successful brick-and-mortar business.", "Further, we are focused on differentiating our merchandize mix to both attract new customers and encourage existing customers to buy more. Our strategy is to offer customers an endless treasure hunt and always deliver outrageous value.", "Our fourth pillar is innovation. We strive to be better every day and constantly move forward. Every year, we work to upgrade our mix and offer even more exciting brands and merchandize from our universe of more than 16,000 vendors worldwide. We are constantly testing ideas that could turn into businesses of hundreds of millions of dollars.", "An example of our innovation is bringing Sierra Trading Post successful online business to a new brick-and-mortar format. We opened two new Sierra Trading Post stores in the Denver area in the third quarter and we're thrilled to see hundreds of customers lined up for both grand openings. While it's still early, we're certainly pleased with their performance to date. I truly believe we are leaders in innovation and that will never stop and we will never be complacent.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance of both sales and quality of earnings. We feel very good about our gains in traffic and units sold as customers are buying more items. Further, we continue to grow our businesses, delivering comp increases over comp increases and profit growth.", "The fourth quarter is off to a very strong start and we are pursuing many opportunities for the holiday season. We see a marketplace full of incredible brands and fashion and are in a great inventory position with plenty of liquidity to buy into those opportunities.", "We love our holiday marketing campaign as much as we do and we believe our gift-giving selection is better than ever. We see exciting prospects for our business in the fourth quarter and are confident we will deliver another strong year on top of many. Longer term, we see our four pillars as our runway for future growth.", "As we look ahead, we see many key advantages to our business that differentiate us from other retailers and we believe set us up extremely well to achieve our goals. We are leveraging our business on a global scale. We have decades of US and international experiencing building teams and infrastructures, a world-class buying organization of more than 900 people and growing, enormous off-price flexibility and an extremely wide customer demographics.", "Above all, in today's competitive landscape, we're convinced our ever-changing and eclectic mix of brands and merchandize from around the world all at amazing value truly sets us apart. To support our growth, we continue to invest in new stores, to our remodels, e-commerce, supply chains, talent and training. We see a lot of room to grow our business and believe we're doing the right things to build to the future. We always look at the short, medium and long-term.", "Lastly, as part of our culture to always analyze what we did right, what we did wrong and what we can do better, we still see opportunities in every division and category where we can improve. This is how we think. We're always looking at the glass as half empty, so we can raise the bar and execute even better. I truly believe this is a major factor in our long-term track record of success and why we will execute on our vision of becoming a $40 billion company and beyond.", "So now I'll turn it over to Scott to go through our guidance. And then we will be opening it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks Carol. Now to guidance beginning with the fourth quarter. We now expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.90. This would be a 6% to an 11% increase over last year's $0.81 per share. This guidance now reflects a $0.02 negative impact from FX versus our prior assumption of FX being neutral. It also assumes a $0.02 negative impact due to a combination of additional expenses and investments.", "These include increased costs related to our supply chain and in-store marketing to improve the customer experience. We're also assuming some incremental expenses and additional investments as we prepare to open Austria and our next new country. It's important to note that our assumptions for comp sales growth and merchandize margin increases remain unchanged for the fourth quarter and full year.", "We're assuming fourth quarter consolidated sales in $8.1 billion to $8.2 billion range. This continues to be based on comps sales growth in the 1% to 2% range both on a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx.", "Fourth quarter pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 11.9% to 12.2% range, down 10 basis points to up 20 basis points versus the prior year. We're anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margin to be in the range 27.6% to 27.9%, flat to up 30 basis points versus the prior year. Again, this guidance continues to assume merchandize margins will be up and reflects our opportunities for improvement based on our learnings from the last year.", "We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be about 15.6%, flat with last year. Again, foreign currency rates are expected to have $0.02 negative impact on EPS this year versus $0.01 positive impact last year and our prior assumption of FX being neutral. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of around 37.8% and net interest expense of about $11 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximate $696 million.", "Now to our full year guidance. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. On a reported basis, we now expect fiscal '15 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.11. On an adjusted basis, excluding the second quarter debt extinguishment charge of an estimated $0.02, we expect EPS to be in the range of $3.09 to $3.13 over $2.94 in fiscal '14. As a reminder, fiscal '14 included a tax benefit of $0.11. Excluding this benefit, our guidance for the full year adjusted EPS would be up 9% to 11% over the prior year's adjusted $2.83.", "Foreign currency exchange rates are now expected to have $0.03 negative impact on full year EPS. This is $0.02 worse than our prior assumption of $0.01 negative impact and compares to our $0.01 positive impact last year. This outlook continues to be based on estimated consolidated comp store sales growth of 1% to 2% for the full year.", "For the year, we expect pre-tax profit margins to be about 12.1%. On an adjusted basis, excluding the second quarter debt extinguishment charge, we expect pre-tax profit margins to be 12.1% to 12.2%. This would be flat to up 10 basis points versus 12.1% in fiscal '14. This reflects expected gross margins of 28.4% to 28.5%, which would be down 10 basis points to flat versus last year. Again, we continue to expect merchandize margins to be slightly up.", "We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 16.1%, a 20 basis points improvement versus last year. Finally, our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter.", "Now we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we're going to continue to ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. We appreciate your cooperation with this. Thanks and we will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin-William Blair", "Just wanted to see if I could just parse through some of the weather and just ask if you could give your best sense for what would be underlying comp rate over the last couple of months through thus far in the fourth quarter in, let's say, Europe and Marmaxx.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Daniel, obviously we're not going to give the numbers out. But as I said, August and September for Marmaxx were pretty damn strong. October, when we saw that extreme warm weather, we got hit pretty hard. It came back very strong opening November. And Europe, again we're seeing Europe turn as soon as November's weather start to get a little bit cooler across the board and more consistent. So we're feeling pretty good about our start.", "Daniel Hofkin-William Blair", "So Europe, you would say, back to positive territory. Is there anything aside from weather that you felt was an issue either domestically or overseas?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No. You could read it month-to-month. I mean August in Europe was sensational. August and September in Marmaxx was very strong as soon as we saw the change. And we had incredibly high comps in the accessory, jewelry. Those areas that were not weather-affected were high-single digits.", "Daniel Hofkin-William Blair", "And then if I could just ask you to clarify within the $0.02 impact in the fourth quarter, what specifically were the expenses as opposed to the kind of investments for the future? What specifically were just the added expenses in the fourth quarter?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It is strictly math. You have $0.02 of FX. The $0.02 were really we have a slightly lower ticket in Marmaxx, which is very positive. We're giving a great value and we're shipping gift-giving a little bit earlier. Freight that was one part of the combination. The other is a little bit of systems and I'll talk more about it at our year-end call to get ready for the possibility of another country.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Lejuez.", "Tracy Kogan-Wells Fargo Securities", "It's Tracy filling in for Paul. Could you guys give us merchandize margin by division? I think you mentioned Canada was hurt by FX. But what were the merchandize margins at the other divisions?", "Scott Goldenberg", "I'm not going to break it down by division. But excluding Canada, again just as we had said earlier that we were relatively flat when you exclude Canada. Or said another way, we had some increases in freight. Again we're deliver to our stores more frequently than we have before, had a bit of cost due to the port slowdown. But again, I think we got ahead of that and really had very little impact. But overall, our mark-on and markdowns were relatively flat with last year. So we felt good about major components.", "Tracy Kogan-Wells Fargo Securities", "Is it fair to assume Marmaxx was up slightly?", "Ernie Herrman", "Very slightly.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Again if you exclude the freight portion of it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson.", "Lorraine Hutchinson-Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I wanted to follow-up on your commentary around the new loyalty card, see that built through the quarter and if you view that as a big traffic driving opportunity for 4Q.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We saw a fairly dramatic increase in our soft loyalty program. We saw very dramatic increases. So we're very pleased with the program thus far. So we think that that is going to be certainly a part of our future traffic driving.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mike Baker.", "Mike Baker-Deutsche Bank", "I wanted to ask you what you're seeing competitively from department stores. What we've seen is that their inventories are a little bit cleaner. Their gross margins look a little bit better. Are you seeing them being a little bit less promotional or have a little bit less clearance? And how does that impact you guys or your thinking heading into the fourth quarter?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think there is a lot of dynamics going on. One is the port, and there is a bit of a payoff there, and that's not a wonderful thing, except for TJX it does tend to yield very positive things. We feel that we are incredible value. As I said, our average ticket is down, because we think we're giving very extreme value for the fourth quarter. So we're pretty excited about that. Our packaways are also up over last year, which is showing that slight increase in inventory. If you took that out, you'd be fairly flat. So we're feeling pretty good about value and we're feeling pretty good that our distance between everyone else out there is going to be very positive going into the fourth quarter.", "Mike Baker-Deutsche Bank", "You do sense in terms of your pricing, you mean?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, our value.", "Mike Baker-Deutsche Bank", "Scott, sometimes you give your margin expectations by the segments. Is that something you can talk about for the fourth quarter?", "Scott Goldenberg", "We can give it out for the full year, our updated full year guidance. So we don't give out division and so forth. So for the full year, I'll start with Marmaxx to be doing, excluding FX when I talk about Canada and Europe, the comp increase for the full year for Marmaxx is 1%. The segment margin is 14.6% to 14.7%. Again, this is unchanged at the high from the last time we gave guidance. HomeGoods 4% to 5% for the year, 13.1% to 13.2%, again up from last time where we had 13% at the high.", "I'll go back to Marmaxx for a second for the sales. The sales are planned to be $18.6 billion to $18.7 billion. At HomeGoods, the sales for the full year are $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Moving to Canada, again ex-FX, the comps are planned 1% to 2%, the segment margin 13.1% to 13.2%, again higher by 30 basis points than the last time we gave the guidance on 08/19 on sales of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion.", "At Europe, 3% to 4% comps, segment margins 8.2% to 8.3% on sales of $4.1 billion to $4.1 billion, again for out total numbers 1% to 2% comp at 12.2% to 12.3%. So on ex-FX, we're 20 basis points better than last year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Stephen Grambling.", "Stephen Grambling-Goldman Sachs", "Now that you've lapped the e-commerce launch, you mentioned that you're also looking at some new vendors and categories. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you've seen over the year and what you're expecting going forward? And were there brands that were unwilling to sell to you online that are now opening the doors after seeing your results?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, slowly, but surely we're definitely adding more brands. As I said, we've added hundreds of vendors, which we're pretty excited about. And we're loving the momentum. I mean we have huge increases, however that's on top of a very small business, but we're very pleased. It's better than we thought thus far. You'll see some new categories beginning next year or the first half of next year that I think will be very exciting. So looking forward to that. And we just continuously keep learning, but we're excited. The returns are going back to the stores. All the things we wanted not to cannibalize and to differentiate, we're feeling good about.", "Ernie Herrman", "If you've been shopping at Citadel, you will see that over the last, I'd say, three months, there's been more categories and vendors. And again, that's kind of an open book, so you can shop by yourself and see the growth in the amount of categories.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think the other positive fact is that the average order keeps going up. So we're pretty happy with the overall spend.", "Stephen Grambling-Goldman Sachs", "And one follow-up to an earlier question just on inventory. With inventory in total up around 8% versus the in-store up low-single digits, how much of that delta is e-commerce versus in-transit?", "Scott Goldenberg", "In terms of the inventory, looking at the balance sheet inventory, they were up 8%. If you exclude the incremental packaways, total inventories would have been up less than the total sales growth of 6%. So we do have some incremental packaways versus the previous years.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We also have more opened by dollars than we had a year ago.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Roxanne Meyer.", "Roxanne Meyer-UBS", "My question is on the investments that you're making incrementally. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on those incremental investments related to supply chain. And while early, how are you thinking about investments for next year, whether you think that it's going to follow through and we should see a step-up in investing going forward?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So, Roxanne, we're actually working on next year's plan while we speak, but our investments are pretty focused on making sure that we can open additional countries in Europe on our supply chain, so that we can deliver more frequently to our stores. We really believe that there is a benefit to shipping less more frequently to our stores. We continue to feel that there're better weather-proofing opportunities throughout the chain. Last year, I think we had some missteps in maximizing some of our sun belt business that we're focusing on this year.", "We're going to continue our in-store investments. We're learning a lot from our customer surveys and we'll continue to upgrade our stores. We have a Marshalls new prototype. It's one of my favorites actually. And we're going to be starting to roll that out. And we just believe upgrading the in-store is really, really important. We have some things going on in long term, so that it's easier for the customer to shop us.", "So those are really the primary things that we're focusing on. And obviously a big part of our capital goes to new stores, which we'll talk more about again at the end of the year, what our plans are for Europe and domestically or North America. And we'll continue our investment in the e-commerce carefully, but I think we're doing the right things. I feel very comfortable about the pace that we're keeping.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Omar Saad.", "Omar Saad-ISI Group", "I wanted to ask some follow-up questions on the weather. It feels like not just The TJX Companies, but the industry in general, is having bigger impacts from weather changes over the past year and I'm wondering if I'm correct in assuming this. Are you guys feeling that in your business versus history and is there any possible explanation why the weather would be impacting the consumer more now than it has in the past or maybe I'm just off my rocker and it's kind of always been this way?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "There's always volatility in weather. I look at the full year. And you're going to have days that are positive and you're going to have days that are negative. For the fourth quarter, obviously we like to plan conservatively. So if you look at the back-half of last year a year ago, I think we had eight major snowstorms and around major snowstorms you have deep freezes. So we know last year that we ran into December, we had pretty strong comps and January was very dismal. So we think there's certainly an opportunity there.", "But I think in the aggregate year-over-year by time you finish the year, there's going to be some impact. But I don't look at it by month; I look at it by how is the year. And I think what we learned from it is how to mitigate the weather. So we have huge, huge presence in the middle of the country and south I call it the cloud belt and the sun belt. So we have new initiatives this year to maximize those in addition to changing some categories up north that we know we can drive even through some tough weather.", "So you learn from that every single year. We call it weather-proofing and I look at it as an opportunity.", "Omar Saad-ISI Group", "And then the flexibility of your open-to-buy, does that help you maybe flow the right weather-appropriate product into the stores?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Absolutely. I mean we have a whole coat strategy that's very different from last year, because we ended up with the end of December, which is why our margin in the fourth quarter last year wasn't where we liked it to be. We certainly hope to mitigate that this year.", "Ernie Herrman", "Omar, our model does allow us to flex more, because we buy so close in. So I think in some cases when the weather goes this way, we would have taken a hit worse than what we do take, because we're able to mitigate it with our liquidity. And that creates additional opportunities in the market. So yeah, we'll get hit on traffic initially like anyone else, but in the end, we can advantage of the other opportunities like in cold weather purchases. So it kind of evens out over time like Carol was saying.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And I think the other thing is Europe is an unbelievable example to have a negative 1% comp on top of 5% comp a year ago and have the same 10.4% against 10.4% is really to reach the flexibility of the model. Those guys just kept their inventories in line. They switched categories. And that market is just loaded with goods. So the flexibility of our business is incredible.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bob Drbul.", "Bob Drbul-Nomura", "I just have two questions. On categories, on the accessories category, are you seeing an increased availability of product? And can you talk a little about the denim category and sort of trends that you're seeing there and availability of product as well?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Ernie can chime in. There's so much product out there that the two of us are doing our hammer act around the building. It is so plentiful in beauty. It's so plentiful in all the accessories areas. And there's isn't an area that there isn't.", "Ernie Herrman", "Bob, both categories you just talked about, I mean accessories have also a lot of different categories. We have big availability really across the board. So our challenge, like I think Carol was alluding to, is just pacing it and controlling how much we buy, how fast. And in denim, we can't give specifics, but denim performs really by a vendor and a fabrication issue. So we can't really get into specifics of what works there. But it works when you have the right item. I mean the availability is very strong there as well. It's really hard to find a category right now where there isn't a fair amount of goods.", "Bob Drbul-Nomura", "And then just a question on the marketing. With increased aggressive marketing on e-commerce, both in the stores, but also the media and the TV side, is that percentage of sales, is it stable? Is it increasing? How should we think about that, the way the business is operating today?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think we're more focused on where we get the better bang for the buck. So like in Canada, we've increased TV. In the United States and Marmaxx, we're doing a little bit more social media. So we're changing it up a bit. And then we do leverage. Now we have our tri-branding. And then in Canada, we leverage commercials from the US. So we're really able to keep our spend flat to slightly up, but we think we get a bigger bang to the buck. And the same thing in Europe as they're learning and leveraging between the UK and Germany.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Jaffe-Stifel Nicolaus", "Carol, I had two questions. One, you mentioned the dock strike and availability. I've got to believe that that's got to make your life a little bit easier. We've seen dramatic developments in e-commerce both in the technology, the look of the sites, the ability to blend store experience plus online experience. And you guys have been a late adopter. You watched, you saw. And now there's great visibility on what's working, what's not. Should we anticipate an acceleration in the investment in bringing the e-commerce business in terms of look and integration closer to the 21st century, closer to what some of the industry leaders are doing?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think we have to balance everything. That's what we're digging in and looking at very carefully, because as you know, our brick-and-mortar business makes so much money that we want to balance where we make our investments. So we're running all of our returns on investment and we're going to lay out next year's plan and decide where we feel we are doing the right thing. However, I think as we go along the way with tjmaxx.com, if you'll see on our site the site changes, the size of the pictures change, we have a lot of initiatives. And we will certainly look at the investment and if we feel that we should increase the investment, we will. But we want to make sure that we communicate what we're getting for that investment.", "Richard Jaffe-Stifel Nicolaus", "So it's really a wait-and-see approach than a change in the strategy you've had to date.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, I'm not going to sit there and come back to you and say, let's just throw $1 billion at it. Europe is very exciting and the idea of opening additional countries, we make a lot of money with our brick-and-mortar. So we have to really balance our spend. See our trading store, the two stores we're very pleased with. It's another big opportunity. It's kind of a wonderful problem to have, but we want to be very smart on how we do all of this.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Stein.", "Jeff Stein-Northcoast Research", "Carol, a question on packaway. Several of your competitors have a much higher percentage of packaway inventory relative to what you have had historically. And I'm wondering in the latest quarter with the increase you're seeing in packaway, are you doing that for defensive reasons to try to get the first call on goods that are out there or was this just opportunistic? And second question I have is I'm wondering if you could just address the issue of inventory turns in your e-commerce business compared to brick-and-mortar.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah, well, we don't talk about our turns in our e-com business. But our packaways are all about great deals. And the guys will go out there for the fabulous brand. It's the right fashion, they're going to do it. However I don't like packaways being too high a percent of our business, because I want us to be as current as possible. I want these guys going in every single week and being very current and making the best deal possible. So you always have to again balance what the premium brands are, what we love. We know that with the ports, there'll be a lot of goods coming at us, and we just want to make sure that we're current, we have an incredibly eclectic mix. And it's all about balance, Jeff. That's what it is.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Patrick McKeever.", "Patrick McKeever-MKM Partners", "So my question is on Sierra and how the acquisition has affected your Marmaxx business. Just without mentioning any brands, I would say that I've seen some really high-end brands in outerwear, particularly at Marshalls, thinking brands you might see when you're climbing up Mount Everest.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So you know about that. I said so you know about that?", "Patrick McKeever-MKM Partners", "And I've seen some kayaks on display at Marshalls. So I've got to assume that merchandise is coming through Sierra in some way. And I would think that would be just a huge win for Marshalls, for Marmaxx, just given the growth in active lifestyles and active wear and that sort of thing?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah, it's all about the category. Sierra and Marmaxx do share information and they'll go to show it together, so that again we leverage as a corporation. But Marmaxx is definitely on the outdoor theme, and it's another great opportunity. It's another initiative.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yeah, Patrick, I would say it's really been an independently-driven situation like the Marmaxx merchants have, and I think Carol just pointed to, some of that outdoor goods. Whether we had Sierra Trading or not, we would be going after that. So even the kayaks that you saw, that was something they actually initiated at Marmaxx and it had nothing to do with Sierra. And some of the outerwear pieces you were talking about, which I feel I like some of those goods there, personally appealing and I think you probably find it exciting merchandize. They communicate, but they don't really drive each other's buys that way.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Patrick, you know what else is happening is a lot of the brands is German. There's some fantastic brands from Europe. And now they're all collaborating and vendors in Europe are now used to doing business with us. So that's helping too back and forth. Same thing in Europe, some of the American brands. So it's a combination of everybody globally working together. Again, you want that assortment in Sierra. You want Marmaxx hitting all the brands. You want the European brands. So that's what's making the mix exciting.", "Patrick McKeever-MKM Partners", "How do you think about your outerwear assortment just today versus a year ago overall?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think it's definitely upgraded.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yeah, we're happy with it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ike Boruchow.", "Ike Boruchow-Sterne Agee", "The Marmaxx Group continues to outperform in the US clearly when you look at the specialty apparel guys. But based on your guidance for Marmaxx, the 1% to 2%, this would be the slowest comp that Marmaxx has seen since '08. And I'm just curious, Carol, when you think about the off-price industry, there's a lot of footage, there's a lot of competition, there's online players that are trying to jump into it. At a very high level, how do you think about the industry over the next five years?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Again, I think every year there's always competition. We're not players that go out and say we expect these huge comps. However, I would certainly believe that Marmaxx can do pretty well in the fourth quarter, and I really love their initiatives. And as I said, they're off to a good start. So would I be happy with that comp? Probably not.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Pam Quintiliano.", "Pam Quintiliano-SunTrust", "So just quickly on gift-giving, it looks really great what we're seeing in the stores right now. Can you talk a little about the changes in timing in terms of the flows into the stores from where you would be historically and just thought-process behind gifts and what you're doing differently there?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So, Pam, every year we look at our gift-giving and we also do a lot of research with our customers, which is why our marketing campaign changed quite a bit. So we know where the opportunities were by category. So we re-evaluated all of that and we made a decision that we wanted to convert a little bit earlier. We like the flow and we're going to continue that flow. But the guys have done an incredible job of a combination of just globally getting together. And every single week, it's going to change into more and more of an exciting mix. So you saw those kayaks as an example. I'm holding my open-to-buy, because I just think it's going to be spectacular, and we worked very hard on it. So I'm very proud of the guys.", "Pam Quintiliano-SunTrust", "As one with children, I can say not only the kayaks, but also the amount of frozen merchandise you have is pretty phenomenal and full price everywhere else.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Just keep coming.", "Pam Quintiliano-SunTrust", "And if I could ask one to follow-up, when I think about this year with October being unseasonably warm and the port delays and you've been talking very favorably about the opportunity for product, so incrementally it seems like every call you always say there's so much opportunity out there for product. But it sounds like there's even an uptick from how much you normally see out there. Is that a safe assumption to make in terms of the quality?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "A little disruption usually yields very positive for TJX. I mean it's not a good thing in the world. But, yes, and we will take full advantage of it.", "Pam Quintiliano-SunTrust", "And that's a benefit near term and longer term, right?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Mann.", "David Mann-Johnson Rice", "In terms of HomeGoods, can you talk a little bit about any of the drivers behind the acceleration there and whether you think you're just catching a tailwind from the industry or really taking a lot of share?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think HomeGoods is probably one of the most unique businesses out there, and I don't think there's anybody that does business the way HomeGoods does. And I think they are so global in their sourcing and so unique, their turns are just insane. And it's a brand that everybody loves and I think it's got a long runway. And I'm excited about it. I think some day, it will be both online. And we give a number of how many stores, but I keep looking at the other home businesses and the number of stores that they have out there is far greater than HomeGoods. So I just think it's an amazing group that executes very well, and we have created an extremely exciting brand. So we all love it. And that's all we hear. I have to stop telling people I can't put a HomeGoods near their house.", "David Mann-Johnson Rice", "Just curiously on Marmaxx during the quarter, were there any regional call-outs when you think about some of the trends that occurred during that quarter?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, definitely, the northeast, the cooler climate weather, it got very warm, got hurt the most.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Montagna.", "Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners", "A couple of questions about the ports and also winter coats. So first, the ports. I just want to verify, the port delays that are being experienced in the industry, it sounds like that has raised the amount of availability greater than what you had anticipated back in August when you hosted the last call. And then regarding winter coats, you alluded to some negative issue in the winter coats last December. Can you just remind us of what that negative issue was?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think last year honestly, we just shipped too many too late. And we have a different strategy. And also, the weight of the coats. We've looked at it really by region, from the north to, I call it the cloud belt, to the south, so that we're much more regionally weight-wise appropriate. And that was a big opportunity. I think the ports are going to be a greater opportunity going forward. We did bring our gift-giving. Part of that increase in expense was bringing in our gift-giving early and making sure that we weren't caught by the ports. So we're in great position. But I think later, we're going to yield a great opportunity from the goods that haven't gotten through for most vendors and retailers as of yet.", "Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners", "And then just getting back to the issue at the winter coats, historically when you have in the early cold fourth quarter, like we're having right now, does the industry have a run-out of winter coats, because so many retailers over the past 10 years have been burned on winter coats and it seems like a lot had cut back?", "Ernie Herrman", "It hasn't. Over the years, Mark, I've watched that cycle. We try to predict that as well based on the one year that's warmer, will they cut back, because they think next year will be warm again. Across the whole industry, it all kind of evens out, because some guys know that you can't predict it that way. It's not that simple. The weather doesn't always follow like in every other year, you know what I mean, which I think is what you're getting at, every other year pattern. We have run into maybe not the exact specific coats, but we haven't run into like enough coats in total if we wanted to continue to do it, and to drive the business.", "In addition, our relationships in Europe are just at a different level than they've ever been. And Europe offers a number of new resources for us in the outerwear area that we've been already capitalizing on. But when it comes to fourth quarter, we can go after some of those vendors even harder. So I think we have more doors to open now. And that's not really a concern.", "One of the things we have been doing also is starting off with a little different weight of goods. I think Carol mentioned that. So that's also helped us to have a better flow in the way we go in. And I think probably some of the vendors realizing they're trying to draw a middle ground in the type of goods they carry, and I think that probably helps in getting a little more bullish on cutting goods as well.", "Operator", "Our final question today is from Laura Champine.", "Laura Champine-Canaccord Genuity", "So, Carol, it sounds like you're pretty excited about the holidays and availability is great, but you've maintained the guidance for sales for Q4. Why not go ahead and raise Q4 sales guidance?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Why would I do that? I would rather beat it. It's important to be conservative. We feel very good and our job is to try to beat it.", "Laura Champine-Canaccord Genuity", "You don't give monthly comps anymore, but is there any color you can give us on how the quarter progressed last year?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "The only thing I can tell you is we had a strong November, but as I said, we're off to a very strong start. We had a strong December last year, and we got hit very hard in January with the weather. So I do think that we probably won't get hit as hard in the weather, because there were a lot of storms. I think our strategy is much better in terms of weather-proofing and where we're shipping our goods. I think our gift-giving is much stronger than a year ago. I think our flow is better than a year ago. And I think our marketing just in general is a lot stronger. So I look at all of those as opportunities.", "Laura Champine-Canaccord Genuity", "Got it. Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, everyone, and I look forward to reporting the fourth quarter to you. And have a great holiday.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today.

Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Good morning, everyone. And before we begin, Sherry has a few words.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 27, 2012.", "Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by the TJX Companies.

Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website, www.tjx.com. Unless otherwise indicated, the adjusted numbers we refer to in today's remarks exclude the impact of the A.J. Wright consolidation in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today's press release or otherwise posted on our website, www.tjx.com, in the Investor Information section. Thank you.", "And now I'll turn it back to Carol.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "So good morning again. And joining me and Sherry on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg. Scott, who, as you know, was promoted to CFO earlier this year, will be reviewing the financial results and answering the financial questions on today's call and going forward. Jeff will be continuing in his current role as Chief Administrative Officer, focusing a bit more of his time on long-term strategies.", "So let me begin by saying, I'm extremely pleased with our first quarter performance. Consolidated comps increased 8% on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share grew 41% over last year. It is great to see our strong performance continue and be so broad-based with all of our divisions delivering excellent results in the U.S., Canada and Europe.", "We saw significant increases in customer traffic in the first quarter over last year. We believe this speaks to our wide customer demographic reach, our values and merchandise mix being right. We are convinced value remains a top priority across the board, and we continue to strive to raise the bar on offering the right fashions and right brands at the right prices.", "As proud as I am of our first quarter, our focus remains on execution and doing a better job in every area of our business to drive sales and margins. We have many exciting growth opportunities and are convinced as ever we can grow TJX to be a $40-billion company and beyond.", "But before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our first quarter results.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I just want to say how excited I am to be in my new role. As Sherry noted at the top of the call, unless otherwise indicated, the adjusted numbers we refer to in today's remarks exclude the impact of the A.J. Wright consolidation in the first quarter of fiscal '12.", "Now to recap first quarter fiscal 2013 results. Net sales reached $5.8 billion, an 11% increase over last year. Consolidated comparable store sales were up a very strong 8%. As Carol mentioned, significant increases in customer traffic drove this growth, with average ticket slightly up. Diluted earnings per share were $0.55, a 41% increase over last year's adjusted $0.39 per share and well above our original guidance of $0.45 to $0.47.", "Foreign currency rates had a positive impact on year-over-year comparisons with a $0.01 negative impact on earnings per share this quarter versus last year's $0.02 negative impact, primarily related to mark-to-market adjustments on our inventory-related hedges. I should note that the $0.01 negative impact this year was not contemplated in our original guidance.", "The consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.8% for the quarter, well above our expectations and up 220 basis points over last year's adjusted margin. Strong flow-through of our above-plan sales to the bottom line drove the large majority of this increase, with 40 basis points due to the positive FX impact I just discussed. With a comp of 8%, we would typically expect pretax margin improvement of 120 basis points.", "In the first quarter, excluding the impact of FX, pretax margins improved 180 basis points, with almost half of the increase from merchandise margins. Gross profit margin was up significantly, 130 basis points over last year's adjusted margin. Most of the increase was in merchandise margin, with some buying in occupancy leverage on the above-plan comp. Further, there was the positive impact of foreign currency I just mentioned.", "On an adjusted basis, SG&A expense was 90 basis points favorable from last year, driven by expense leverage on the above-plan comp. During the first quarter, we had $250 million of incremental sales above the high end of our expectations combined with adding very little incremental SG&A dollars.", "Another factor was the timing of certain expense items in last year's first quarter, including absorbing talent and certain costs from our A.J. Wright division, which we did not anniversary this year. This essentially offset the impact of our investments in the first quarter in growth-related initiatives.", "As to inventories, at the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the warehouses, were down 7% versus a 12% increase last year. We are extremely happy with our inventory levels. We entered the second quarter in a great position to capitalize on the opportunities we are currently seeing in the marketplace and continue shipping fresh assortments to our stores.", "In terms of share repurchases during the first quarter, we retired 6.5 million shares, buying back $250 million worth of TJX stock. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of TJX stock this year.", "Now let me turn the call back to Carol, and I will recap our guidance for the second quarter and the full year at the end of the call.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Scott. The major themes I want to highlight are the strong momentum we continue to see, how we're striving to raise the bar throughout our business and our exciting growth opportunities.", "First, 2012 is off to a great start in all our businesses. We saw significant increase in customer traffic at every division in the first quarter over last year. While warm weather did boost demand for spring apparel, sales were still strong throughout the U.S., including regions where weather is generally less of a factor. Similarly, our comps in Europe were very powerful, despite the very unfavorable weather and challenging consumer environment in the U.K. We believe this speaks to the importance of value to the consumers and our exciting merchandise selections. We are convinced that we will continue to attract new customers to our stores.", "Now to highlight our divisional performance. Our U.S. divisions delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. Marmaxx comped up 8% over growth over 4% last year and 10% the year before that. HomeGoods comp sales increased 9% in the first quarter, over 6% and 15% increases in the past 2 years, respectively. With above-plan sales and strong flow-through to the bottom line, both of these divisions delivered record first quarter profit segment and segment profit margins.", "Our international businesses achieved excellent results. TJX Europe delivered its highest first quarter segment profit in the history of this division. Comps increased by a very strong 13%, and segment profit increased 700 basis points. We were particularly pleased with the broad-based strength in our European businesses from the U.K. and Ireland, Germany and Poland. Even more encouraging than the continuation of strong trends in TJX Europe is that we see lots of room for further improvement.", "At TJX Canada, comps increased 6% and segment profit improved significantly. We feel very good about this business today and to the future. We opened another 6 Marshalls stores in the first quarter. And I'm delighted to report that as with our first group of stores, they are beating our performer expectations.", "It is great to see our international businesses back on track. We are very confident about these businesses going forward, both in 2012 and beyond. To continue our great momentum, we must raise the bar. Let me be clear here, I do not mean changing the fundamentals of our business. What I mean here is doing an even better job at delivering the right product at the right value at the right time to each store in our chains.", "We are convinced we will continue to attract more U.S. and international customers. Our customer transactions have increased in the mid-teens over the last 3 years, and we have dramatically widened our demographic reach. Our customer research tells us we're attracting younger customers as we grow our customer base for the future. As much ground as we have gained, our research indicates our market penetration is still well below most U.S. department stores, which translates to 10s of millions of untapped consumers in the U.S. alone.", "In Europe, where we have learned so much, we are the only major off-price retailer and believe we can trade in a very wide demographic band. In Canada, we see Marshalls as another vehicle to gain new customers and are clearly off to a good start.", "We are also raising the bar with our marketing and store remodels to attract and retain new customers. We are leveraging our marketing abilities on a global scale and clearly increasing customer traffic. We are aggressively reaching customers through television, digital and social media. We expect e-commerce will be another platform to draw in new customers when we are ready.", "Our store remodel programs have succeeded in lifting sales by offering customers an upgraded shopping experience. By the end of this year, we expect to have 75% of Marmaxx stores in the new prototype and across the company, plans to remodel approximately 300 stores in 2012. However, we believe we are far from finished in terms of improving our in-store customer experience.", "We plan to expand our global sourcing to offer customers even more brands and gain even more, even greater flexibility. As great as our supply chain is, we believe we still have significant room to improve. We are investing significantly in our supply chain and systems to run even leaner and faster and become more pointed in shipping the right fashion and seasonality to the right stores at the right time. A more efficient supply chain supports more freshness and excitement in our stores, which we believe, in turn, will drive stronger sales and margins.", "Now to our exciting global growth opportunities. Beginning with store growth, over the next 3 years, we plan to grow overall square footage by 4% to 5% annually. Importantly, as we pursue our goals for global growth, our management team is focused on fewer, bigger businesses all operating on the same business model, with a very wide demographic reach and very strong short- and long-term economical potential.", "At Marmaxx, this positions very strong new store performance over the last several years and success in both moderate income, as well as densely populated urban markets, gives us confidence in its potential to become an even bigger business than we thought just over a year ago.", "HomeGoods is becoming more and more powerful brand everyday. Our customers cannot stop talking about how much they love HomeGoods. We have over 100 markets in the U.S., where we operate a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls without a HomeGoods store, which speaks to the potential for this chain. Further, the stores we have opened in new markets last year are performing very well, which is extremely encouraging.", "In Europe, we remain convinced we have vast growth potential. While we will proceed slowly with store growth, with other retailers closing stores, we see great real estate and market penetration opportunities in Europe.", "In Canada, as I mentioned, our new group of Marshalls stores has been terrific, which is very promising for our future growth in Canada. We believe e-commerce will be another major growth catalyst for our future. We see e-commerce as a vehicle to make our brands even more powerful. As always, we will be testing many of our ideas prior to launching. As a reminder why we continue to invest in our new e-commerce initiative, we have no top line benefit planned from it in 2012. Since we're not ready to talk timing yet, we'll keep you posted as we progress.", "As we discussed in our last call, we are making strategic investments to support our future growth. In addition to the supply chain and systems improvements, as well as e-commerce, as I just mentioned, we are investing in store growth infrastructure, expanding our home office and developing the talent to bring TJX to the next level of growth. Importantly, as we are investing for the future, we are maintaining our 10% to 13% annual EPS growth model. As always, we will strive to surpass it.", "Before closing, I'll spend a moment on financial strength, which gives us great confidence. Our business model delivers outstanding financial returns and generates tremendous amounts of cash, and we remain committed to distributing excess cash to shareholders. During the first quarter, we raised the per-share dividend 21%, marking the 16th consecutive year of dividend increases and a compound annual growth rate of 23% over that same period.", "We continue with our outstanding share buyback program. And after reinvesting in our businesses and returning excess cash to shareholders, we still expect to end the year with approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in cash. This, combined with our strong credit rating and low level of debt, provides us with significant financial flexibility.", "Summing up, we enter the second quarter with great momentum in all our businesses, and May is off to a strong start. Our stores look extremely fresh with great brands, fashion and color at exciting prices, which we are convinced will continue to attract and resonate with our customers. Our inventories are in great shape. Our marketing is becoming even more powerful as is evident by the increase in customer traffic. All of our businesses are on track with exciting prospects for 2012 and certainly the future.", "We remain laser-focused on execution of our off-price model and are raising the bar to position TJX to be the retailer of the future. Our management team and organization are excited and motivated to pursue our many opportunities for 2012 and to ultimately grow TJX to $40 billion and beyond.", "Now I'll turn the call back over to Scott to go through some guidance, and then we will open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol. Now to fiscal '13 guidance, beginning with the full year. We are raising our outlook for full year earnings per share to be in the range of $2.27 to $2.37, which represents a 14% to 19% increase over the adjusted $1.99 last year. As a reminder, this guidance includes a 53rd week in the fiscal '13 calendar, which we will -- which we expect will benefit the year and fourth quarter by approximately $0.07 per share. On a 52-week basis, excluding the $0.07 benefit, full year EPS would be $2.20 to $2.30, up 11% to 16 % over the adjusted $1.99 in fiscal '12. 4", "Let me recap the key changes versus the guidance we provided on the February earnings call. We now estimate consolidated comp store sales growth of 2% to 3% for the full year compared to our original guidance of 1% to 2%. We also expect pretax margins of 11.1% to 11.5%, which is 20 to 30 basis points above our original guidance and 40 to 80 basis points higher than last year's adjusted margin of 10.7%. This excluded 30 basis points from the negative impact of the A.J. Wright consolidation versus the reported margin of 10.4%.", "Now to Q2 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.50, a 4% to 11% increase over last year's $0.45 per share. We're assuming a second quarter top line in the $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion range. This is based upon comp sales growth in the 2% to 4% range both on a consolidated basis and at The Marmaxx Group.", "Now to monthly comps. With May off to a strong start, we are planning comp sales to increase approximately 5% for the month on a consolidated basis and at The Marmaxx Group. For both TJX and Marmaxx, we are planning comps to be flat to up 2% in June and 1% to 3% in July. Pretax margins for the second quarter are planned in the 10.0% to 10.4% range, down 20 basis points to up 20 basis points over the prior year. This assumes a 10 basis points negative impact from FX.", "Second quarter year-over-year comparisons are also negatively impacted by 30 basis points due to the timing of incremental investments to support our growth. It is important to note, we are expecting the SG&A rate in the back half to leverage slightly on an estimated flat to 1% comp increase. Further, there has been no change to annual spending for corporate expenses since we provided guidance in February.", "We're anticipating second quarter gross profit margins to be in the range of 27.2% to 27.4%, down 10 to up 10 basis points versus the prior year. We are planning merchandise margins to be up, partially offset by an expected negative 10 basis points impact from FX. We're expecting second quarter SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the 16.8% to 17.0% range, down 10 to up 10 basis points versus last year's ratio of 16.9%. As I just mentioned, this guidance reflects 30 basis points of incremental growth-related investments.", "Foreign exchange rates assuming current levels are expected to have a $0.01 positive impact on EPS in the second quarter, the same as the 1% positive impact on Q2 last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.5%. It should be noted that this is a higher tax rate than last year's second quarter, which has about a $0.01 negative impact on Q2 EPS this year.", "Net interest expense is estimated to be in the $8 million to $9 million range. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately $752 million. [Operator Instructions]", "And we will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A question about marketing and ad spend for the balance of the year, wondering how you see it might play out in terms of investment on TV versus print versus new media, electronic and social media, and then if you could help us understand the dollars, the increased investment that you think you'll be spending. And then just a quick question for Scott about debt.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "You know what, I may ask you to repeat some things because it's very low. I think you asked about marketing ad spending to the back of the year and a breakdown of how we're spending that, the investments. And what was the third?", "Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I just have a question for Scott about debt.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Debt, okay. We're having a hard time, I don't know what's going on. But we'll do our best here. [Technical Difficulty] In terms of the marketing spend, our marketing spend is pretty flat. However, our impressions are up as we're leveraging all of our corporate marketing initiatives, you're going to see it's a lot more in the back half. So I feel like we're really, really doing a terrific job of leveraging. As last year, we've really kicked it up for our gift giving in fourth quarter. And I think this year, we're going to have a really fantastic campaign, so we're excited about that. We don't give -- we don't break down how we're spending social networking versus how we're communicating to the customer. And quite frankly, that's something we keep a little bit private. In terms of our investment for the year, I'll have Scott go through it, but we are on plan. It's -- we have a little bit of an increase in the second quarter, which is timing. But to the year, our investments are right on plan, including all of the elements we've talked about from supply chain to e-commerce to the office to the infrastructure. So we have a little bit of a timing. And then, Scott, I think the other question was on debt. So Rich, could you just -- can you just repeat the last question, I apologize.", "Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Oh, sure. Just looking at the relatively small amount of debt that TJX has, wondering if Scott has any expectations of putting more debt on the balance sheet and leveraging up the company a bit?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Hey, Richard, I think in terms of our long-term debt, as you know, we have $775 million, with nothing coming  due in the at least short term. We have no plans at this point in time. We enjoy our financial flexibility that we have. Having said that, we will always keep ourself open for what we'll do in the future. But what I think the major factor right now is keeping the financial flexibility.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jennifer Davis.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could -- if there was any way you could see how much of the increases in traffic is being driven by new customers? And then also, your increase in segment margins at Marmaxx is very impressive. Just wondering how much of the margin benefit or how much of that is coming from stores that are in more moderate income areas or how much of that is just overall strength across the chain?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, absolutely across the board and that includes new stores and old stores, so we're really pleased. I mean, it's straight across the country and in all demographics. In terms of the traffic, we analyzed that, and we are seeing new customers in that our average age is decreasing a little bit and a large percent of our new customers are younger customers. But I don't have the exact percentages, but a lot of the traffic is new customers.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "So you spoke of expanding the global sourcing organization. I'm just wondering where do you stand now in terms of number of buying offices throughout the world? What's your goal? Maybe if you put that in terms of number of buyers, where are you today and where are you going? And I think maybe related to that, just thinking about T.K. business, can you maybe talk about how much inventory is being sourced from within Europe for that business and how that's changed over the past year and how that might be likely to  change?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay, well in terms of the stores sourcing, I mean that is our secret sauce. But a very high percent of our sourcing is done in Europe, and it is very specific by country. So we have really learned what the mix needs to be by country. In terms of our merchants, we keep needing -- adding offices. And again, we're not going to discuss the countries that we're going to be adding people in, but what we're trying to do is obviously make a very unique, exciting assortment. So when you look at HomeGoods, we're in countries that you would never expect us to be in. But it's all about the excitement. We talked about 700 people in our merchandising organization. We're continuing to grow that. We have a huge, huge training program. We bring in hundreds of kids each year, and that's being built -- we're putting a lot into our bench strength and infrastructure because that is what's going to make us really special to the future. But in the end, it's the sourcing and it's our vendor relationships that make us special.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Carol, how many offices do you have now around the world, from a sourcing perspective?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I don't know what the number is because we have Australia. We have India. We have...", "Ernie L. Herrman", "It's more like, I would say, like 6 or 7 main ones.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Main ones, yes. And then we have plant satellite offices.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "A few satellites. We try not to get specific. They're not as meaningful. Some of smaller ones, but we do have this coverage and it flexes. Sometimes, we flex with the smaller offices in terms of how many people are there. Yes, we do.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "So is the growth in the number -- where are you growing? Will you be growing the number of satellite offices, primary offices, just number of buyers within each office? Just trying to think of where the growth comes from.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Paul, I would say it's a little of both. But really some of the growth is, we've already positioned these other hub offices, I would call them, in places we're happy. So the growth is actually happening in those satellite -- the current offices and a little less so really in opening more satellite offices. So I would say, the growth is more in our current offices.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Paul, in addition to that, our guys travel constantly. So a big, big piece of our sourcing is not just people being on the ground but groups traveling quite a bit together. I mean, a buyer's life here is a lot of travel.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Tunick.", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I guess, our question really was around the T.K. business around Europe. So just trying to understand a little more, maybe talk through the improvement despite the economic pressures there. So I know you've made a lot of your own internal changes. You can maybe update us there. But on the external side, where is the market share coming from and where do you see sort of a normalized growth rate from a store perspective coming out of T.K. now that the business has turned? And in what parts of Europe should we expect to look for the growth to come from?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay, well, first of all, we -- I'm going to put the economy aside because we always believe that it has nothing to do with the economy, it has to do with our execution. And I think you got to remember that we're really the only off-price vehicle in Europe. So I'm going to come back to it's all about our execution. The highest -- Europe has been over 7%. I think we're certainly making headway, and Scott will go through what we're thinking for the year for Europe. We don't know what the end game is. I can only tell you that we have a long way to go, and I think both Ernie and I feel there's tremendous opportunity there. We're happy with what we're accomplishing. I think we still have a long way to go. I would not sit here and say that we're there and everything is perfect. It's far from it. We've learned a tremendous amount. So I don't know what the endgame is. Ernie, you want to comment on...", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes, Brian, I think a couple of things we feel much better about in Europe are that the people overall, the merchants and the field organizations are more seasoned than they were a year ago. So that's been a big plus, and that's been a mission. We put in place a couple of additional training people to help with that. As Carol mentioned earlier, even on other businesses, our secret sauce is the way we buy goods. And so we have really ramped up the way we are going to train our younger merchants there and bring them onboard. When we had the dramatic growth we talked about this before on the calls and when we had the dramatic growth earlier; we had a little bit of strain on the organization in that respect. I feel much better about the way we're positioned now in terms of the -- again, the experience of the people and the management and the training programs we have in place to keep those people on track. And we're back on, certainly, I would say, in that environment on delivering the better value to the stores, which is how we're capturing, I think, market share in those environments just like we did in the states when that happened. So where is it coming from? I guess we don't concentrate too much on that as much as we expect when we deliver the right value and stick to the core fundamentals of the off-price business, that we will capture that incremental market share. So we're feeling better.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "So Brian, our traffic is very high. We have very high increases in our traffic patterns right now in Europe. And very similar to Marmaxx, it's going to be interesting. As we get better at our mix and better at understanding the customer, my guess is we have more and more opportunity to increase our store count. So obviously, we're not going to do it today, but we are taking advantage of the real estate opportunities that we're seeing because it is pretty substantial right now. But again, as we get better, we really don't know where that endgame is. I suspect it's probably greater than what we think it is today. Scott, you want to give the full year numbers for Europe?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Sure. For the full year, we're now guiding Europe to a 5.2% to 5.8% segment margin. Segment margin again, 5.2% to 5.8%, just went up, pause for a second, say that, that's -- these numbers are on a 53-week basis. That's a 280 to 340 basis points improvement over last year on a 4 to 5 comp. And again, an improvement over our original guidance for Europe, which was 4.9% to 5.4%. So embedded in these numbers for the last 9 months for Europe is a segment margin of 6.2% to 6.8% versus last year's 4.4% on a 2 to 3 comp. So just again a reminder, going back a few years, our segment margin profit for Europe was as high as 7.2%. So we're making progress to reach that level again and then hopefully exceed it, and we're pleased with the current momentum that we now see in Europe.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "However, I don't think there are any -- or I would be happy with these comps. So hopefully, we'll beat them.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Adrianne Shapira.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Maybe I understand your -- the online plans are you're keeping it close to the vest understandably, exactly. But if you could share what learnings you're finding in the early European online efforts? If you can share with us what you're seeing in offline there and what gives you confidence in terms of how to translate those learnings in the U.S.?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It's certainly teaching us categories. It's teaching us how to work in the off-price sector, which is a little bit different. But we are understand -- we are learning about the customer. We're learning about average order. We're learning about number of in-baskets. We're learning about communication. So the fact that we started in Europe has been terrific. And again, I'm not going to share my secret sauce, but Ernie has done some very interesting things over there. And their e-commerce business is getting stronger and stronger.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And Carol, could you give us a little bit more specifics in terms of the type of growth, the type of traffic, the type of spend that you're seeing online in Europe?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Of course not. I'm sorry, Adrianne. Probably when we do launch, we're going to be very happy. And that's our goal, that we feel really good about what we're launching.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "All right. So let me squeeze in one more then. The Marmaxx comps, obviously spectacular. We're obviously seeing a lot of shift from the competitive landscape, especially across the mid-tier department stores. Maybe talk about what you're doing, anything, I know not differently, but opportunities that you're looking to seize as some share shifts are coming -- shares is coming up for grabs in the mid-tier?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I just think that we're focusing on doing a better job of what we do every day. The market is absolutely loaded. We're very particular. I think we're building our relationships. And I think, to me, I always look at how special our stores look, and I'm proud of our stores. I think there's still room to bring our inventories down. I think there's still room for more freshness. I think there's still lots of room for improvement. But I always measure it and say, \"Do we look better than we looked a quarter ago? Do we look better than we looked a year ago?\" And that's really how we look at our business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Carol, the segment margins just across all of your businesses, Marmaxx, Canada and HomeGoods are hitting new record highs. And I'm wondering if there's anything standing in your way of delivering similarly record-high margins throughout the rest of the year. Are there any factors that we should keep in mind, out of thinking about the opportunity for upside as we progress through the year?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, as you know, we're planning our comps conservatively. If you look at the back half, the last 9 months, for every comp, it's about $0.05. For the back half the last 6 months, for every comp, we're looking at $0.02 to $0.03. We like the plan conservatively. Ernie and I want very much to beat our plans, and that's what we've strive for. And it's all about execution. So it's execution. I think there's still have room, as I said before, to decrease our inventory level. But it's just doing a better job everyday. So we think we have good conservative numbers in the back half, and we won't be happy if we don't beat them.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. That's very helpful, Carol. And I just wanted to follow up, Scott, on one of your comments on the call. You mentioned a 180 basis-point increase, I think, in the operating margin here in the first quarter, with almost half due to the increased merchandise margin. I'm getting more like a 220 basis-point increase in the operating margin here in Q1. I'm wondering if there -- what the differential is, if you could help us with that?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "The 220 basis points increase in margin has a 40 basis points benefit from FX. So x FX, it's the 180 basis points.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeffrey Stein.", "Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research", "Question, the big boxes are really having a lot of trouble selling to that millennial customer. And I'm wondering, when you speak of a younger customer, are talking about more of a junior customer? And if so, do you presently have the vendor relationships to adequately serve that customer or if that needs to be better developed?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, it's really the 18 to 35 year old that we're gaining that range. So it's really right in the sweet spot of where you want the future consumer to be. And obviously, we're keeping our older customer, the Maxxinistas of the world.", "Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research", "And in terms of the vendor relationships to service that younger customer, do you presently feel that you've got those relationship in place...", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We feel very good about it, yes. Very good.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Omar Saad.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to see if you guys could give an example or maybe some anecdotes in the business. From either the fashion trends that you're seeing and your being able to respond to so well given the flexibility and scale of your supply chain or the weather trends have been a little bit uneven the last several months. Can you talk about how the supply chain works in your favor in those situations and maybe help give us some color around that?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, as I said, we're really strong across the board. Both apparel and home has been really terrific. I think there's tremendous color changes this year. I think we're feeling pretty good about the fashion. But Ernie will tell you, men's, kid's, it's really strong across the board.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "It has been. And I think one of the -- I think you're asking about how does it tie in to the model and the way we operate. The advantage to this model, and we talked about it before, is the flexibility and the close-ins tying it, it allows our buyers to capitalize on fashion trends or even weather trends. So if the weather is working one way or another, it can create opportunities in the marketplace for us to get goods at a different or a better value. In terms of the fashion, we're able to read products. We're north, south, everywhere in the states, so we can read products and buy close-in purchases and still take advantage of those fashion trends in all the different fashion areas of the company. And interestingly enough, that happens to be a place that Carol and I have talked about as an opportunity for the back half here and just to do a little bit better job in our fashion areas. But the model plays well in allowing us to do that.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It's a very good weather-proofing model, and that's a different way to look at it. It mitigates the risk factor.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "It really does.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Howard Tubin.", "Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "When looking at maybe comps for the rest of the year, do you think the majority of comp improvement is going to continue to be driven by traffic increases or maybe will we get some out of average ticket? What are your plans for average ticket going forward?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It's going to be slightly up, but most of it should come from traffic. And again, remember, we are planning our comps flat to 1%. So we're betting on beating that, and I think we have some great plans in terms of our marketing and our mix to drive that. But it's going to be mostly traffic, slightly in tickets.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Weiner.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So just picking up on kind of the theme of the call, it seems to be Europe largely. So I'm just looking at your Analyst Day in October last year and I think the long-term segment margin potential guidance that you gave for each of the individual segments. So at the time -- and maybe these have changed internally, but at that time, it looks like Marmaxx had kind of -- you were thinking that Marmaxx could have a couple 100 basis points larger -- greater potential than Europe over time. I guess my question is, as you move further into Europe and you start to integrate the online business there, is there anything structurally that you can foresee that over time would prevent you from getting margin parity there to the Marmaxx business here in the U.S.?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, some of it is going to depend on the real estate because that's certainly was a big chunk in the past, so that remains to be seen. It's going to depend on the combination of pan-European and leveraging. So as I said before, we're not sure how high is high. I think we're going to learn more over the next several years. Scott, you have a...", "Scott Goldenberg", "I think, David, the one thing, there's nothing structurally in the store expenses and margin that Carol was talking about. I think it's just getting to the size of the Marmaxx business with the almost 2,000 stores where you're getting that leverage. I think that's the only -- that's the fundamental difference. But everything else in Europe, as we've stated, other than merchandising is that we're leveraging behind the scenes, distribution, et cetera.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "[indiscernible] 875-store mark within the countries we're in so, again, that remains to be seen. If that number increases within the countries that we're in or neighboring countries then, again, that will change.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right. Okay, so that makes sense. Certainly, the store size leverage makes sense. But I guess, how about from just a pure-pricing perspective for -- on comparable product? If you think about it that way, is there an opportunity there to maybe charge a little bit higher than you would here in the states?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "No, we create value.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes, we were about to answer the question.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Or it's something like that, so go ahead.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "David, we're always very cognizant here value as we are here on what the out-the-door value is relative to all the competition. So we never -- that will always determine that. We weren't just saying, we can get this for our retail. Having said that, that would be, I'll just echo what Scott said, our issue there will not be on pricing. It's more just the scale, I think, of the whole business. And as Carol alluded to, we don't know but we are -- again, as you can see, we are on the track now where we can start to look for real estate opportunities down the road here.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "But certainly exciting is the fact that real estate is a lot less than it was many years ago.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Right.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, for sure. And your location qualities have been pretty good so -- if not, very good.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Roxanne Meyer.", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I just want to follow up on Europe. Are you able to provide us even qualitatively how -- what the performance has been like among the regions, among Germany, Poland versus the U.K.? And what role, if any, tourism is playing in each of those markets?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "No, we really don't break it down, the same thing in Canada. So we -- I really -- I can't break it down for you. We do it as a total segment.", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then are you able to share, when you think about the back half year, your guidance to leverage SG&A on a flat to 1% comp, what factors are allowing you to do that in this back half?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Scott?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Sure. Let me give you just some color in terms of corporate expenses and expenses in general. Corporate expenses were up $13 million in the first quarter. They're planned to be up approximately $20 million in the second quarter. And that, again, as we've talked about in the script today, the largest increase, with the majority of that increase due to investment spending. If we break the year into the first and second half; the first half increases are in the $30 million to $33 million range, with the back half a little less than $10 million. So we've had as I stated earlier, fundamentally no change to our annual spending for corporate expenses since we originally gave guidance. So really, it's all about timing related to the spend. And as we've, I think, talked about earlier, most of the investment spending is reflected in the corporate expenses. So in the back half, we're able to leverage this, as we've stated, on the 0 to 1 comp, that we're able to leverage our SG&A slightly. And as we mentioned, I think we've talked a little bit about before, as we move further on, going even past the second half of this year, we expect our incremental investments to level off in fiscal '14 and beyond. So I think it's a timing issue and, again, at the leveraging in the back half of the year on that 0 to 1 comp.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Montagna.", "Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Question just about, when you are talking about the movement of stores into the rural and urban areas, wondering of the 2,300 to 2,400 stores that you talked about for Marmaxx, what percentage of those are you factoring as these more rural- and urban-type stores? And then, the second question just dealing with traffic. first quarter traffic was up a lot. Is that a bigger traffic increase this year in the first quarter compared to last year's first quarter traffic increase?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It's pretty much been running consistently, year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Right, Scott?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. I don't have that right in front of me. Maybe I'll get back to you.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think the 3-year trend was the high-teens, and the quarterly trend is pretty similar to that, Mark. Yes, in terms of -- we don't have the numbers on the rural -- on a breakdown of all the stores within Marmaxx, and we don't usually break that down. But I can tell you that, again, as we go into the rural areas, we're finding that we, again, see more and more possibilities for additional stores. You got to remember that even our $4 million and $5 million stores make tons of money for us. So that's what we're finding more exciting. However, I'll keep coming back to we're learning, and I believe we can still do a better job at targeting the stores, the right goods, the right stores and still bringing our inventories down a bit.", "Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. When looking at, say, the rural locations and more of the urban locations, do you think you have a chance with HomeGoods to go into the rural locations or the more urban?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, we do. And Scott has a point too, on the rural. Yes, you want...", "Scott Goldenberg", "I just -- a point on the rural stores. The volumes are less than the chain average, but the quality of the margin that we get in those stores is equal to the chain average we are quite good in those.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "And so that's why your leveraging just keeps coming in, especially in the Marmaxx chain and, hopefully, HomeGoods will be doing the same.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Glick.", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Some interesting comments, Carol, about the progress you're making in that 18- to 35-year old customer. I'm wondering what you're attributing that gain in market share to from a marketing perspective? Do you think it's more your broadcast TV or maybe some things you're doing from a digital perspective? And does it lead you to kind of rethink your mix of marketing spend going forward?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think in the end, it really comes down to mix. You know how viral things are and word-of-mouth. And I listen to the kids, and they talk about us now. And years ago, you didn't hear as many young people talking about us, and we're kind of a cool place to go now. So I think it's very different. And I think that's, again, what Ernie and I keep working on is making that better and better every day.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Marni Shapiro.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "And I don't want to add to many questions. I'm going to ask one simple one. Are you seeing anything new and different at HomeGoods that's making it really power up all of a sudden or is it just steady as it goes and excellent execution on the buying?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We're going to answer that by saying, yes, everyday. I mean, seriously, their mix and their freshness, they're such an exciting store. I filled up my trunk last week, and I have to stop doing that because my husband is going be furious with me.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "I keep purging my closet so I can keep buying more. Are you seeing the same 18 to 35 year old in HomeGoods that you're seeing at TJ's?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We aren\u2019t -- yes, we\u2019re starting to see a younger customer, and it's a great vehicle for young people who are starting out and getting their first apartment. We've seen some amazing things. People coming in with u-hauls and trucks, and it's absolutely fascinating. But it's a fun, fun brand. It really is.", "Operator", "And our final question today is from Laura Champine.", "Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And I appreciate your comments, Carol, about how your performance in Europe will be determined by your own execution and not the macroeconomic environment. But have you thought about where the stress points are and how bad things could get that would keep you from hitting those margin goals? And maybe conversely to that, do you actually perform better if the economy is weaker in Europe? What's your opinion on that front?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "No, no, because obviously in the past, we've performed very well when we execute. I don't -- look, Europe is pretty bad right now. If you look at Ireland and you look at outside of London, the economies are -- it's pretty devastating, and we're performing pretty well. So again, I don't think we -- I keep coming back to execution. I just keep coming back to that. And whether it's a good economy or a bad economy, if we do our job, we do well.", "Thank you, everyone, and we look forward to reporting our second quarter to you. Thanks.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. You may all disconnect. Thank you for participating.", "Carol M.

Welcome to the TJX Company\u2019s third quarter financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, President and CEO for the TJX Companies.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Good morning. Before we begin, Sherry has a few words.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company\u2019s results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company\u2019s plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings, including without limitation the Form 10-K filed March 26, 2008, as well as risks related to the current economic environment. Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by the TJX Companies.

", "Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third-party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript. ", "With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s press release posted on our website, www.tjx.com. ", "Thank you and I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Trip Tripathy, Jeff Naylor, and Ernie Herrman. ", "I\u2019ll start by saying that our third quarter performance is a real example of the resiliency of our off-price business model at work. We have always said that we hold our own and do better than most in tough times. It is equally important to understand that we will get through these difficult times and believe when the dust settles we will have greater opportunity to grow for the future.", "We have said many times that we have one of the most flexible business models in the world and we are seeing the benefits of that flexibility right now. This flexibility has enabled us to grow even through the recessions of the early 80s, 90s, and in 2001, and I can tell you that in today\u2019s difficult times, we are fortunate to have such flexibility and we are capitalizing on it in several major ways.", "We are extremely focused on how and when we buy. We are running with leaner inventories and have much more current open to buy than last year. We are aggressively managing expenses throughout the organization and lastly, we are taking advantage of tremendous real estate opportunities, which are coming our way and should bode well for the future for TJX.", "Let me highlight some of the key points of the quarter. Customer traffic was up across virtually all our divisions with the exception of a few regions in the U.S. we believe this indicates that we are gaining market share in this environment. We remain extremely lean on inventories where strategic and redeploying purchase dollars to the strong sales drivers and saw faster inventory turns than last year. We bought better brands as well as opened new vendors and bought very close to need. We were harder-hitting in our marketing and offered customers great compelling values. ", "We have been extremely focused on keeping expenses lean in this extremely difficult economic environment and will be even more aggressive going forward. ", "In addition, many of you have been asking us about real estate opportunities, and while we have previously not seen a significant benefit, those opportunities are really beginning to present themselves to us now. We are taking full advantage of the exceptional real estate deals out there which should be very positive for the future, both domestically and in Europe.", "All of these factors that we believe will continue to help mitigate the impact of the challenging macro factors we are up against in the short term along with all retailers. In the longer term, I believe this difficult environment will provide TJX great opportunities as the retail landscape changes. I will talk more about this later in the call.", "Before I move to the numbers, I also want to emphasize that our core businesses continue to be the cash engines that are driving our growth vehicles. Our international businesses continue to be very strong and our younger and new businesses, which have the most growth potential, have all performed extremely well.", "A. J. Wright has begun to gain traction and T.K. Maxx continues to be very strong. Our German T.K. Maxx stores are outperforming and show great promise for growth.", "In addition, our new stand-alone Shoe Megashop by Marshalls and our new StyleSense stores in Canada are starting off above expectations. ", "Finally, although there has been a lot of focus on the impact on foreign exchange rates on our numbers, the fundamentals of our business are extremely solid and our strong financial foundation gives us the ability to take advantage of opportunities in tough times and act strategically for the long-term growth of our company.", "Now to recap the consolidated numbers. Net sales for the third quarter increased to $4.8 billion, 2% above last year. Consolidated comp store sales decreased 1% versus last year\u2019s 3% increase on a reported basis. This year\u2019s results includes a 2% negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which was not contemplated in our plans. Excluding the foreign exchange impact from both years, consolidated comp store sales were up 1% for the third quarter this year versus the 1% increase last year.", "Fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.58 in the third quarter on a reported basis. The overall net impact from foreign exchange was a $0.03 per share benefit. Trip will go into more detail on the impact of foreign currency exchange in a moment. Excluding the net impact of FX and the reduction in the computer intrusion reserve, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.54.", "Overall pre-tax profit  margins on a reported basis was 8.8%, excluding the impact of inventory-related hedge adjustments from this year and last year and the intrusion-related reserve reduction, third quarter pre-tax margin declined by just under 1%, primarily due to deleverage from the below-planned comp.", "Gross margin on a reported basis was above last year. While inventory-related hedge adjustments positively impacted gross margins, it is important to note that merchandise margins increased 20 basis points over last year\u2019s very strong margins, excluding fuel cost increases.", "SG&A expense was 17.2%, impacted by the deleveraging of the below-planned comp, as well as certain favorable expense items last year that did not recur this year. ", "In terms of inventories, at the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories, on a per-store basis, was down 1%, excluding foreign currency exchange. Again, we are very well positioned with extremely lean inventories and purchase commitments down year-over-year, which positions us well as we begin the fourth quarter.", "To recap the first nine months. Consolidated comp sales increased 2% for the nine months over 3% last year, with a neutral foreign exchange impact. ", "EPS from continuing operations for the first nine months was $1.50. These results reflect the factors detailed in today\u2019s press release. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the first nine months was $1.43, up 8% over last year\u2019s adjusted $1.32.", "Now to our divisional results. Let\u2019s begin with our Domestic Concepts. At the Marmaxx group, comp sales were flat in the third quarter, which was below our plan. Segment profit was $279.0 million and segment profit was 9.1%, both below prior year and our plan. Again, this was due to deleverage on the comp, a slightly lower average ticket, as well as certain favorable true-up last year that I just mentioned.", "With all this, merchandise margins held firm to strong margins last year. While Marmaxx comp sales were below plan, by bringing inventory levels down and focusing on inventory dollars in the right categories, this division held a flat comp in an extremely difficult environment with unseasonably warm weather for a good part of the quarter.", "Shoes and accessories continued the strong trends we have been seeing with shoes comping up 4% and accessories comping up 5% versus strong increases last year. ", "Juniors are starting to show positive results as we continue to roll out the cube and marginals, which is approximately 330 stores today.", "Home fashions continue to comp negatively, but as we have discussed on prior calls, we have strategically brought down inventories and are seeing higher inventory turn. We will continue to keep our home areas very lean, as we believe the macro environment is negatively affecting this category to a greater degree.", "Importantly, customer traffic overall at Marmaxx was up, despite declines in areas of the country with weak housing markets. ", "The opening of our first Shoe Megashop by Marshalls in Yonkers, New York, was very exciting. We just opened another Shoe Megashop in Glendale, California. Although it is a test and still early we are encouraged by the excitement around the Shoe Megashop as it is another vehicle for us to leverage, capitalizing upon our opportunities in footwear and grow Marmaxx in the U.S.", "As I mentioned before, we are also seeing some exceptional real estate opportunities, some of which could play into our strategy for future Shoe Megashops.", "Now to Home Goods, which continues to struggle. Comp sales at Home Goods decreased 5% in the third quarter versus two years of strong comparisons. Segment profit was $15.0 million, which was lower than last year and our expectations.", "The macro environment is definitely affecting our home businesses more than any other category. Home Goods is experiencing the brunt of the weak housing market. Going forward, we are planning conservative comps and lean inventories in Home Goods and focusing our open to buy in the key areas that are working.", "The Home Goods organization has done an extremely good job of managing their open to buy and are wide open for great deals coming their way in the fourth quarter.", "On the positive side, we had a strong opening in September of our Westport, Connecticut, Home Goods store, which tests the new larger footprint. This larger layout would allow us to expand certain highly productive categories that our existing square footage cannot accommodate. ", "We also continue to see solid results in a few new categories and will be expanding on new initiatives while pulling back on underperforming categories.", "Moving on to A.J. Wright, which delivered excellent performance in the third quarter. Comp sales increased 5%, which was at the high end of our plan. On the bottom line, A.J. Wright was close to break-even, which was a significant improvement over last year. We are feeling very good about A.J. Wright as we continue to see it gain traction. We are seeing many of our initiatives taking hold and believe we have a much better understanding of this customer, which is leading to more effective marketing and merchandise strategies.", "In terms of store contributions at A.J. Wright, they continue to move closer to the levels that would give us confidence to accelerate the roll out of new stores and possibly move into a new market or two. We will, as always, expand conservatively.", "Now to our international division, which performed very well in the third quarter. We continue to build our organization for the future, having recently added more top talent in our merchant ranks. ", "Starting with our Canadian businesses, which had a very strong third quarter. For the third quarter comp sales in Canada decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and local in currency, which we believe better reflects our operating performance, comps increased by 5% over 5% increase last year, which was well above our plans.", "Segment profit was $110.0 million and segment profit margin was 19%. These results include the 5% benefit from mark-to-market adjustment on the inventory hedges that I mentioned earlier.", "Prior year results were also reflected by a similar hedge-related adjustment, which had a negative 210 basis point impact on last year\u2019s segment profit margin. Excluding the impact of the hedge-related adjustment in both years, segment profit was essentially flat to last year and segment profit margin was close to last year\u2019s historically high level.", "Winners delivered excellent over strong comparisons to sharp execution of our off-price fundamentals. This organization flowed great values, great brands, and great fashion to our stores, which resonated well with our customers. Further, HomeSense in Canada continued to perform well.", "We are recently excited about the strong launch of StyleSense, our test concept in Canada, which offers family footwear and accessories. We opened our first two stores in Toronto in September and customer response has been fantastic. We will be prudent in our approach to rolling out new stores, as we are with any new business, but as StyleSense continues to show strong trends, it offers an additional vehicle to grow our presence in Canada.", "Let\u2019s now move to our European businesses, which we continue to be extremely pleased with. Beginning with T.K. Maxx in the U.K. and Ireland, third quarter comps decreased 8% in U.S. dollars but increased 4% in local currency, which again, we believe better reflects our operating performance.", "Excluding our investment in new European businesses, segment profit at T.K. Maxx in the U.K. and Ireland increased to $53.0 million in the third quarter and segment profit margin was 9.6% compared with 7.9% last year. Excluding the impact in both periods of making our inventory hedges to market, segment profit margin was 8.3%, well above last year and on plan.", "Including the investment in T.K. Maxx Germany and HomeSense in the U.K., our total segment profit in Europe in the third quarter increased to $48.0 million, which was above last year.", "Even with these investments and excluding the mark-to-market adjustments from both years, segment profit margin was up 10 basis points over last year and well above our plan.", "As a reminder, in the third quarter we anniversaried our investment in T.K. Maxx Germany last year.", "It is worth noting that T.K. Maxx delivered another very solid quarter as the retail environment in the U.K. [break in audio] tougher. ", "Again, it\u2019s all about execution. This organization is doing an excellent job of remaining focused on the fundamentals and is gaining market share. Although we are feeling the impact of a weaker pound to the dollar when we translate results into U.S. dollars, operationally the real story here is about how well our business model is suited for tough consumer environments as well as strong ones.", "The performance of T.K. Maxx in Germany continues to be outstanding, on the top and bottom lines. Our German stores continue to exceed our expectations in the third quarter and inventory turns were [break in audio] to those in the U.K., which is pretty remarkable.", "As to store growth, we plan to end 2008 with 10 stores. As in the U.S., we are seeing exceptional real estate opportunities for T.K. Maxx in the U.K. as well as Germany. HomeSense, which we launched last spring, continues to perform well and we expect to end the year with 7 of these stores in the U.K.", "Now to our financial strengths, which in this credit crisis and time of extreme market volatility becomes even more critical than usual. Our very strong balance sheet and extremely solid financial foundation gives us the ability to more than meet our short-term needs and the confidence in our ability to continue growing our company for the future.", "Our strong operations generate significant amounts of cash and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders after reinvesting in our businesses.", "In terms of our share repurchase program in the third quarter, we repurchased $226.0 million of TJX stock, retiring over 7.0 million shares. Through the third quarter this year we have spent a total of $676.0 million in share repurchases and bought back over 21.0 million shares. We continue to expect to repurchase at least $900.0 million of TJX stock in fiscal 2009.", "Moving to guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the current retail environment we are taking a conservative approach. We are planning comps more conservatively and are being extremely disciplined in maintaining lean inventory levels, expecting to turn inventories faster. Further, we are aggressively looking at expenses across the company to take cost out of businesses. ", "Let me be clear, however, that while we are being conservative in our approach, this management team and our entire organization are motivated to surpass our goals.", "Now to the numbers. First, let me remind everyone that we have several factors impacting comparability, which we have detailed in today\u2019s press release. Among these it is important to note that we have a 53rd week in our fiscal calendar year of this year, which impacts fourth quarter and full year results.", "In the fourth quarter we now expect a reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.62, which includes the anticipated $0.09 per share of benefit from the 53rd week and the other factors detailed in today\u2019s press release. ", "Excluding the factors, effecting comparability from both years, we now expect adjusted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.72. I remind you that this range includes the anticipated $0.09 per share benefit from the 53rd week.", "This outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales of flat to down 2, excluding the anticipated negative 500 [basis point] impact from foreign exchange.", "For the full fiscal 2009 year we now expect reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.07 to $2.11, which also includes the $0.09 per share benefit from the 53rd week as well as the factors detailed in today\u2019s press release.", "Excluding other factors from both years, we now expect adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the full year in the range of $2.11 to $2.15 compared with last year\u2019s adjusted $1.92. Again, this range includes the 53rd week benefit.", "This outlook is based upon an estimated 1% consolidated cost store sales increase, excluding the anticipated negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Trip will provide more details on this guidance in a moment.", "Before closing I want to spend a moment on how I see the turbulence of the current environment benefiting TJX in the longer term. I have mentioned the real estate opportunities that we are seeing. We are taking a strategic approach to determine which ones hold the greatest potential for growing our concepts for the long term.", "Even more broadly, there is a great deal of shaking out going out in the retail landscape that has already occurred and that we expect to continue, especially in the home fashion arena. ", "I can assure you that with a flexible business model and our financial strengths,  TJX is here for the long term. We plan to take full advantage of the opportunities presented to us and emerge from this difficult macro environment an even better company with a stronger competitive position.", "Summing up, let me recap some important points. We have one of the most flexible business models in the world and these are the times when you need all the flexibility you can get. Our business has stood the test of time and our value equation plays well in tough times as well as good ones. ", "We have just closed a quarter in which we were up against probably the worst retail environment in our 31-year history. Comp sales were slightly positive, excluding currency, and profitability remains strong.", "Customer traffic is up, which we believe indicates that we are attracting new customers and gaining market share in a tough environment. Our cash engines, MarMaxx and Winners, are very strong. By not taking our eye off of these core businesses we continue to grow them for the future while they simultaneously fund the growth of our younger and newer businesses.", "T.K. Maxx in Germany and A.J. Wright are performing well and hold great potential for the future of our company. In addition, we are optimistic about our new stand-along shoe and accessory concept in the U.S. and Canada and we continue to test new initiatives all the time.", "We are taking the current retail environment head on. We are setting conservative comp sale plans while striving to surpass our goal. We are bringing inventory levels down and focusing purchase dollars in the right places to turn inventories faster and maximize our gross margins. ", "We are in an extremely aggressive cost-cutting mode and focusing on cost-saving opportunities in every business. We are being more pointed and targeted in our marketing as we benefit from what we have learned in this last year.", "Further, our strong financial foundation gives us the ability to manage through tough times while we continue to successfully grow TJX for the future.", "We entered the fourth quarter with great liquidity in our inventories and are seeing amazing deals. We have established our brands over the last several years as some of the most exciting gift-giving destinations and we intend to live up to that reputation. ", "We believe the consumer will buy for the holiday season but more carefully and may shift some of their big-ticket gift giving to the incredible values that TJX can offer.", "Finally, I can\u2019t say it enough, in a tough retail environment like this one, our best defense and offense continues to be execution. Throughout our history we have succeeded when we remain focused on the fundamentals of our off-price concept and delivered great values to our customers.", "Although cautious, we believe there is opportunity for the fourth quarter and certainly for the future. I look forward to updating you on our progress. And now I will turn it over to Trip.", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "First I want to spend a moment on TJX\u2019s strong financial position and ample liquidity, from both internal and external sources.", "Our operations generate huge amounts of cash, which give us the ability to meet our short-term needs and fund our long-term growth. Beyond our cash, we have no maturities of long-term debt for at least a year as well as a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. We have a great deal of flexibility in our capital structure and believe the changes taking place in the retail landscape will continue to afford us a good deal of opportunity.", "As we are in the process of putting our plans for fiscal 2010 together, I am not in a position to say very much about them, but do think it bears mentioning that we continue to have great confidence in our company and remain committed to repurchasing TJX shares as a means to return value to our shareholders.", "Secondly, while we are aware of all of the focus on the impact of foreign exchange currency rates on our reported results, we want to make sure that the strong fundamentals of our business are not getting lost in the details. Our businesses are holding up extremely well in these difficult times.", "Thirdly, I wanted to emphasize our commitment to contain costs. We continue to pursue major areas such as non-merchandise procurement and store labor efficiencies. We have also cut back on discretionary spending across all of our businesses. We will continue to be extremely focused on managing expenses wherever possible for the foreseeable future.", "Moving to the numbers, let me remind everyone that we have included charts in today\u2019s press release to reconcile items impacting EPS results for comparability, both for the third quarter and nine-month results and for guidance for the fourth quarter and full year.", "So before moving to guidance, let me once again recap the apples-to-apples comparison on the third quarter to last year.", "Excluding the comparability items we detailed in today\u2019s release, primarily the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted third quarter EPS this year was $0.54 versus the adjusted $0.56 last year. However, it is important to note that with a higher tax rate in the third quarter this year, which negatively impacted EPS by about $0.015, our EPS results were essentially flat to last year on comp sales that were lower than our plan.", "I mention this because it speaks to our ability to hold or grow earnings at low comp levels and out third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance reflect this.", "So now on to guidance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 Carol recapped the guidance on a reported basis. Now let me give you the apples-to-apples EPS comparison.", "Excluding the expected $0.09 per share benefit from the 53rd week and other items detailed in today\u2019s press release in both year, we expect adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter to be $0.59 to $0.63 compared with the adjusted $0.63 per share last year.", "Now to the details. Before I begin, please note that the numbers that I am about to discuss all include the positive impact of the 53rd week in our fiscal calendar this year. Again, we estimate the 53rd week will benefit our results by $0.09 per share, or for modeling purposes, about 60 basis points in the fourth quarter.", "So we are assuming a fourth quarter top line of approximately $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. In terms of comps, we are planning consolidated comp sales to be flat to down 2%, excluding a 5% negative impact from foreign currency exchange translation. ", "At the Marmaxx group we expect comps in the fourth quarter to be flat to down 2%.", "As to monthly comps, on a consolidated basis, we are planning comp sales in the range of down 3% to 6% in November and flat to up 2% in both December and January.", "Again, it is important to note that these ranges exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange translation. On a monthly basis we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact consolidated comp store sales by 6%, 5%, and 4% in November, December, and January respectively.", "For Marmaxx we are planning on comp sales of down 5% to 8% in November and flat to up 1% in both December and January.", "We are planning fourth quarter gross margins on a reported basis to be in the range of 23.4% to 23.6% versus 24.5% last year. It is important to note that these numbers include the impact of mark-to-market adjustments in both years, a negative impact this year compared with a positive impact last year.", "Excluding the mark-to-market impacts from both years, we expect gross margin to be essentially flat.", "SG&A as a percent of sales is planned to be 15.7% to 15.8%, essentially flat to last year\u2019s 15.7%.", "Reported pre-tax profit margins are planned in the range of 7.5% to 7.8% versus 9.1% in the prior year. Again, these numbers include the impact of mark-to-market adjustments in both years, a negative impact this year, versus a positive impact last year.", "Excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments in both years, as well as the benefit for the computer intrusion adjustments in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we are planning a pre-tax profit margin to be 8.1% to 8.5% compared with 8.4% in the prior year.", "For modeling purposes, we are planning a tax rate of approximately 38.7% and weighted average outstanding shares of 432.0 million.", "Before going to questions I want to reiterate Carol\u2019s message that while we believe it is prudent to plan conservatively at this time, we are managing the business as aggressively as we can to do better.", "To keep the call on schedule we ask that you please limit your questions to one person. We will take questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "I was hoping you could address the SG&A. It looks like you are holding the absolute dollar growth rate down, but could you talk about the major contributors of the increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales? And just remind us at what comp level corporate-wide you need in order to hold that SG&A rate flat going forward.", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "I assume you are talking about the third quarter and I will also talk about the fourth quarter very briefly.", "In the third quarter, again apples-to-apples, 52 weeks, excluding mark-to-market, of course the third quarter doesn\u2019t have the 53rd week. So SG&A delivered 60 basis points, primarily because of a low comp, but in the third quarter of last year, you know typically in the third quarter we do a number of true-ups, primarily for insurance and benefits that happens every year, last year we got quite a big pop out of it and this year we didn\u2019t get as big a pop out of it, and as a result of that, that contributed to the deleverage. ", "So those are the two reasons primarily for SG&A deleverage in the third quarter.", "And then just looking at the fourth quarter, we are basically flat to last year, but there is actually a little bit of deleverage. I won\u2019t go into a lot of detail there, but essentially we are flat to last year and the reason for that is that we have a lot of cost initiatives going on that are kicking in and we have actually planned those numbers in the fourth quarter.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "The fourth quarter, is it flat to last year, SG&A including the extra week or excluding the extra week?", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "It is actually the same on both basis, so that\u2019s the relative things to look at. It\u2019s the same percentage on both.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In the third quarter we did have a slight decrease in retail, which going into the fourth quarter our on order is pretty flat in retail which will benefit us a little bit.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "And that helps just lower the processing cost at the stores?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Exactly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan.", "Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan", "Just more color on the Marmaxx operating margin pressure here in the third quarter, just so we understand, how much of that came from the occupancy versus SG&A?", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Marmaxx occupancy was really the biggest piece of it. In terms of gross margin, they actually had improvement in their merchandise margin but the bulk of deleverage actually occurred in buying and occupancy. They had a little bit of deleverage on SG&A as well. And that is typically what would happen with a flat comp in the third quarter.", "Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan", "I\u2019m just trying to understand your guidance here. For November comps, you\u2019re down 5% to 8%. Is that primarily because of the calendar shift or is there something else happening that we need to know about?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It\u2019s a combination of the environment, the shift in the calendar of Veteran\u2019s Day and Thanksgiving, and we just felt that we should be fairly aggressive in taking the comp very conservatively for November.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "We estimate that home goods has about a 40% store overlap with the 370 Linens & Things stores that are being closed. Can you comment on whether or not you think the liquidation sales there have been having a negative impact on home goods performance?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Probably if you were in the same center. I mean, we\u2019re sitting here in Framingham and when you see a huge liquidation sale on a big banner, it is going to affect it. I don\u2019t know the exact number of the overlap. It probably has some effect. ", "But again, over time we believe, as the landscape is going to be changing, we still believe that home goods is very well positioned for the future.", "Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "In the press release this morning you detail a negative 5% impact from the currency translation. What assumptions are you making behind that to get to that 5% negative impact?", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "We typically don\u2019t try to project foreign exchange rates forward. So what we have done there is taken the spot rate for the end of the third quarter and used those numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Morris - Wachovia Capital Markets.", "John Morris - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Question on the advantageous real estate deals that you\u2019re seeing, are you open-minded at this point to considering taking advantage of those as soon as calendar 2009? I ask only because we are hearing a lot of companies talking about their real estate growth plans and I\u2019m wondering if this is something that would be on the horizon for you in calendar 2009 or is it something that really is extending beyond that? Your timing.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "As far as we\u2019re concerned, as I said before, we are in a very good solid financial position so our strategy in terms of real estate is going to be to take advantage of anything that is opportunistic. So we are not looking at drastic cut-backs in store count but we are seeing some deals that are stronger than we have seen in the past in some terrific locations. And we will take advantage of those.", "John Morris - Wachovia Capital Markets", "And also in inventory, I know we don\u2019t really talk about what the plan is, go forward quarter-to-quarter, but is your thought process here when you talk about continuing to run with leaner inventory than usual, that that is your assumption that would continue to be on the order of magnitude of the minus 6% that we saw for the end Q3?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "That includes foreign exchange. It\u2019s really down 1%. So we are being aggressive in taking inventories down. It\u2019s not going to be something drastic like 6% without foreign exchange. But we are running with much greater open to buy and we are going to be a lot more liquid in terms of our open to buy. ", "I\u2019ll give you an example. The next two months, which is pretty critical to our business, we have the largest open to buy we\u2019ve ever had in the history of the company, which is pretty exciting at this moment. And we are seeing a lot of people cancelling goods and we will take full advantage of it.", "Going into the first quarter we will lean up our inventories, but do it very strategically by category and by region. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it. We\u2019re really diving into the details.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Would the department store group likely to be obviously intensely promotion, I\u2019m wondering what level promotional response that you\u2019re factoring into your Marmaxx comp guidance in the fourth quarter.", "And you mentioned some cost items in SG&A, that benefitted last year but not this year. Can you remind us what that was and how significant that was and whether or not that will occur in any other quarters?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In terms of the department store groups, I think it\u2019s going to be promotional and I know this is an unusual environment, every year they become promotional. I think their inventories will be leaner this year than they probably were a year ago. But again, our ability to go in in the month of December and buy goods for Christmas puts us in such an incredible advantage and we intend to take this opportunity and be even more aggressive than we ever have been before.", "So we think our value equation versus the department stores and the specialty stores will still be very strong.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Does that affect your average unit pricing as well? Your average unit retails.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Our on order is actually pretty flat to last year because we are in categories. We strategically went after certain categories that, the shift in the mix, the shoes, accessories, sometimes you have a slightly higher retail, a little less home, which is a lower retail, which is keeping our average ticket in a pretty good place.", "And again, we are seeing some very nice high-end goods at crazy prices. So we are pretty excited about it.", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "And to answer your other question, in general, in the third quarter of every year, throughout the year we\u2019ve been accruing insurance and benefits and some other items like that and typically it all sort of comes together in the third quarter of every year, when we look at actual experience and do some true-ups. So typically third quarter of every year there\u2019s, in the last few years there has been a fairly good benefit, and this year as well. ", "The difference is this year wasn\u2019t as good a benefit as last year and that\u2019s why you see some deleverage along with buying and occupancy deleverage coming from the zero comp at Marmaxx in the quarter.", "So I\u2019m not spreading out the exact numbers on both but it is primarily buying and occupancy deleverage and then to a lesser degree it\u2019s the favorable true-ups last year versus this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "I had a question with regard to the segment margins for the fourth quarter. Could you discuss, either qualitatively or a little bit of granularity by the major segments, how you might expect the segment operating margins to compare year-over-year in the fourth quarter, including the 53rd week. ", "And then with regard to your commentary about increasing real estate availability, net-net would you expect to end up 2009 and 2010 with fewer locations than you might have six to twelve months ago when you maybe adjust for fewer foundation-up new openings? Or do you think it might come out similarly given the number of real estate opportunities out there?", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "I\u2019ll give you comps on margins. And just on an overall basis, fourth quarter 53rd week impact is typically $0.09, and 60 basis points on pre-tax margins. So I\u2019m actually going to do the math for you and give you the 52 week numbers, along with the comps by segment.", "At Marmaxx, in the fourth quarter, the comp is zero to minus 2%. And obviously those are all on 52 weeks. And then the Marmaxx segment profit is 8.6% to 8.9% versus 9.5% last year. And as I mentioned, there is buying and occupancy deleverage on a zero to minus 2% comp that is reflected in there.", "At Winners, on a U.S. dollar basis, the comp is a high of 4%, a low of 2%. And the segment profit there is 10.3% on the low side to 10.5%. That compares to 12% last year. Just to give you a little flavor on that difference, the year prior was 10.4%. We had an outstanding year last year. We hit a historically high number. So what you are seeing reflected in the Winners number is sort of moving back down a little from the historic high, as well as some impact of FX on purchases from the U.S., because they do buy a significant number of goods from the U.S. So that\u2019s what\u2019s in the Winner\u2019s number.", "T.K. Maxx, I guess I\u2019m going to split out U.K./Ireland and then the total segment. The U.K./Ireland comp is a high of 5% to a low of 3%. And then their segment profit, U.K./Ireland, would be on a 52-week basis, would be 11.2%. So 11.4% was the standpoint 1% last year and basically I think just terrific execution, good improvement in merchandise margins, good leveraging on the expense side there. ", "On a segment profit in this quarter we are also lapping last year\u2019s numbers, so the investments in new businesses are essentially flat. So T.K. Maxx segment would be 9.7% on the low to 10.2% on the high, on a 52-week basis versus 9.2% last year. So very good improvement on the segment.", "Home goods, which is a 5% to 8% negative comp, translates into 4.2% to 4.6% on a 52-week basis versus 7.2% last year. And that\u2019s all sales driven deleverage.", "A.J. Wright, on a 3% on the low side to 5% on the high side comp, on a 52-week basis would be a 2.4% to 2.6% range versus 2.7% last year. Basically they\u2019re running a lot more transactions, they\u2019re working on their value proposition. It is driving a lot more traffic into the store but it is also putting some pressure on VC costs and they\u2019re in the process of figuring out how to manage through a higher through-put scenario.", "The good news on A.J., if I might just mention this, is that store contribution is up year-over-year, about 160 basis points this year, and that\u2019s really exciting, terrific news combined with the positive comps.", "And then just moving down, corporate expenses, we are assuming $38.0 million to $39.0 million. That\u2019s a little more in line with prior history because last year\u2019s number was $49.0 million and we had some non-recurring items last year, so once, again, comparable numbers last year was $49.0 million, this year will be $38.0 million to $39.0 million.", "So boiling it all down for the company, what we are looking at is a zero to minus 2% comp, excluding FX. And then we told you we have a 5% impact due to FX, so with FX we\u2019re looking at minus 5% to minus 7% on the comp line.", "And on the profit line it\u2019s 7.5% to 7.9%, which compares to 8.4% last year.", "And that\u2019s all on a 52-week basis.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "And just to be clear, those segment comparisons for the international operations.", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "I should also mention just one more thing. The Winners numbers and the T.K. Maxx numbers that I just gave you, again, we\u2019re talking to apples-to-apples here, so I have excluded the mark-to-market impact.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "That was exactly my question. Thanks.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In terms of the real estate, we are pretty similar to last year. And we\u2019re pretty much on plan. We are going to continue our real estate strategy, probably similar to this year, in terms of growth. But again, we will be flipping some of the, in terms of home goods, we will probably take down the store count for next year. We see some greater opportunity in Marmaxx and some of the other divisions with the real estate deals, but we are staying wide-open because, again, we think some things are going to come our way that we are going to absolutely want to take advantage of.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "So ex that, you still might expect the overall change in store count to be similar, ex any additional opportunities?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffery Stein - Soleil-Stein Research.", "Jeffery Stein - Soleil-Stein Research", "Question on finances. Not too many retailers have been buying their stock back this year. You have and obviously have the cash flow to do so. Any thoughts in terms of your appetite to continue to buy back stock at this level as we move into calendar 2009?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Obviously we really believe in our buyback program and we will continue our program for next year. We are looking strategically at all the opportunities to use our cash. Fortunately we have a lot of flexibility with tremendous liquidity, especially in today\u2019s environment. So we are evaluating it.", "Jeffery Stein - Soleil-Stein Research", "In the third quarter was your average ticket down because your customers were spending less or was the average unit retail down in the third quarter?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "No, it was just the average unit retail was down. And part of it was a bit of mix.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "A question on the opportunity and then share repurchases, the dividend, and what could be pressure on cash flow. Just wondering how you are evaluating some of the opportunities next year and how you will evaluate a real estate acquisition, whether it\u2019s at a bankruptcy court or from a real estate developer, and your willingness to forego some of the buyback to take advantage of real estate, or dividend for that matter.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Quite frankly, I don\u2019t think we have to make that decision today. I think we\u2019re in a very solid position. In terms of real estate, we look at every single store, the same way we would look at a buy, and take full advantage of it. If in fact we feel we want to wait and it\u2019s coming at us so quickly, we\u2019re also going to be very careful. As I said before, we believe in our share repurchase program and we\u2019re going to continue it.", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "As Carol mentioned earlier, we\u2019re in a very strong liquid position. Our borrowings are a fairly low level. We don\u2019t have anything coming due for at least 12 months, if not a little more. We have lots of flexibility in terms of borrowing capacity. We\u2019ve got a $1.0 billion credit line. And on top of all of that we have very strong cash flows.", "So, as Carol mentioned, it gives us a lot of options and opportunities and we are certainly not done with planning next year, which is why I don\u2019t want to talk a lot about next year. But you can be sure we are going to be looking at every opportunity to build a much more solid foundation for the future. And we\u2019ve got the cash to do it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse.", "Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "Just thinking longer term, given some of the changes that you\u2019re seeing across the retail landscape, does this change your view on what is the right number of stores for the Marmaxx division? Is it increased in your mind? Just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that over the long term.", "And can you give examples of some of the real estate opportunities you\u2019re being presented with and how they are different from last year?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We are always evaluating the Marmaxx chain and I think almost every year we bump it up a little bit. So we\u2019re still in the 2,000 store range today. Obviously the MegaShoe, we only have two of them that have started out pretty strong, gives us another opportunity. So we will take probably a good five or six months to evaluate that before we determine the number of stores that that could possibly be.", "In addition, we continue to differentiate Maxx and Marshalls. You see with the cube and MegaShoe in Marshalls and a bigger accessory department in Maxx and fine jewelry, that as we continue to differentiate it, it gives us the opportunity to possibly put those two boxes closer to each other and there\u2019s not as big a transfer. So we continue to work on that.", "For today we\u2019re sticking with the 2,000. We think the MegaShoe is a great opportunity in high demographic areas. It gives us the ability to go into certain areas that we couldn\u2019t necessarily get into before with 8,000 square feet to 10,000 square feet, so that\u2019s pretty exciting. So we will see what that ends up yielding for us.", "The specific real estate opportunity deals, I really can\u2019t talk about that. You know what\u2019s going on in the landscape. Sadly, there\u2019s a lot of brands that are going out of business. So we\u2019re taking each one at a time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "As you think about merchandise margin and pricing, given that the department stores have become that much more promotional, it sounds like you are still able to maintain and get your good merchandise margin, even with your pricing being 30% or 40% less than the current discounted price of the department stores. Just wanted to follow up on that.", "And also what about marketing? How are you thinking about marketing investments this year, given the challenging environment? And traffic trends, where they\u2019ve been up, has it been consistent throughout the company by division?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In terms of margin and pricing and value, my answer to that is absolutely. Again, we are really buying close to need and it is a bit of a blood bath out there. And again, I think the department stores are going to have promotions, as they always do, but they are going to keep leaner inventories. ", "And to tell you the truth, I\u2019m the most excited about our mix. Our mix just covers the most amazing brands and I think we are so focused in the right areas. And that\u2019s what I look at every day and the value of that mix.", "Our marketing for the year, we\u2019re probably going to be pretty close to flat, but I think we\u2019re spending it in the right ways. We learned a lot in the fourth quarter. We are better positioned than we probably were in the third quarter because we were still experimenting. I think next year we will even be better and I think there will be buckets where we will not be spending any dollars and we will be shifting those buckets to other areas that we\u2019re seeing better results.", "The traffic speaks for itself. I think people are buying less. I think it\u2019s the reality of the environment today. I think the fact that our traffic is up means that they are excited about shopping our stores and I think that will bode well for the holiday season. And more importantly, absolutely for the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company  .", "David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company  ", "The last couple of quarters you talked a lot about fuel impact. Can you just give us an idea on how fuel and freight maybe hurt you in the last quarter and what you\u2019re projecting for Q4?", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Fuel had about a 20 basis point impact this last quarter and we were able to offset that with merchandise margin improvement. Or put another way, we got merchandise margin improvement, which helped offset the 20 basis point fuel. As you know, fuel costs have been coming down so we do expect a smaller impact versus last year. And right now we are projecting about a 10 basis point impact for the fourth quarter.", "David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company  ", "In terms of the MegaShops, the shoe store, I\u2019m just curious, how do you plan to differentiate that, if at all, from your in-store locations and if you are not going to differentiate, how will you avoid cannibalizing your existing stores?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Again, what I said before, is what is very intriguing about the MegaStore, the MegaShoe, is that we can go into places that, we can\u2019t go into New York City that easily with a 25,000 square foot or 30,000 square foot store. Rents are very high. This gives us an opportunity to go into high-demographic neighborhoods which just gives us another vehicle that really isn\u2019t very close to a Maxx or a Marshalls.", "We are also testing some stores. The one out in California is pretty close to our other store and we did that on purpose to see what the cannibalization is and we will read that over time and then we will be able to evaluate that.", "But I think you\u2019ve got two possibilities here. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessarily going to cannibalize that much, but I think it just gives us another real estate opportunity that we really could not have without something like this. I think it\u2019s a terrific vehicle.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Black \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Jeff Black \u2013 Barclays Capital", "What are you seeing in the U.K. business now and are we seeing the same kind of trends we\u2019re seeing in the U.S.? Because it seems like October we saw a pretty big drop off in two-year trends, at least at T.K. Maxx and I\u2019m wondering why your guidance, it seems optimistic both on the comp line and on the margin line, to us, on the Europe division. So just a little color on what\u2019s going on there.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In terms of T.K., first of all, first of all for the quarter they had a pretty strong comp. They had a 4% versus a 6% last year. They also, for October, we did plan slightly off so we had a break in terms of a vacation we didn\u2019t plan in. There was a little bit of a shift. They are also very lean in inventory and their turns are spectacular. And as you can see, it floated to the bottom line. So I am not concerned about T.K.\u2019s business at all. I think their business is pretty strong.", "Again, the retail environment there is as tough as it is here. It\u2019s incredible what\u2019s going on there. And T.K. Maxx is competitively a very unique business there and their traffic is also way up. So we think they are positioned very well for the holidays and I think they\u2019re going to continue to have pretty strong business.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from David Glick - Buckingham Research.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "You touched on it briefly, but what we have seen in the last couple of months in the top-tier retailer, the luxury channel, is very different than an environment you\u2019ve been operating in for the last few years. Does that change your outlook on how you approach goods in the designer channel and would that change your approach to merchandising, to marketing, space allocation in the stores? It seems like it might be a unique opportunity that you really haven\u2019t had up until this point.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We are taking full advantage of opening some doors that we may not have been able to open, which we\u2019re always doing. But again, I think this does give an opportunity. And as I said before, we probably have one of the most exciting assortments going into the holiday season. So I think the consumer is going to see that.", "", "Thank you very much and I look forward to reporting fourth quarter.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Since Trip has been with us such a short period of time, Jeff Naylor will be handling the financial questions today. ", "Let me begin by saying on an operating basis we just delivered the strongest second quarter in the company's history. Our 31% increase in EPS from continuing operations, excluding the intrusion charge, was achieved on top of a very strong second quarter last year, and continued our trend of strong operating performance that began in late 2005. Importantly, virtually all of our divisions delivered significant top line and bottom line improvement that was in line or above plan. Also, I'm particularly pleased with the consistency of the quarter, with comps for all three months coming in above plan. In addition to strong comps, we saw strong profits across virtually all of our businesses in the second quarter on top of last year's strong gain, and this continues to be a focus for us. It is a never-ending process, and our goal is to continually improve in this area. ", "I'm sure you have all seen in today's release that we have learned enough information that we are now able to estimate the computer intrusion-related liability and have taken a charge in the quarter. This charge represents costs incurred during the second quarter, as well as a reserve for our estimate of the total potential cash liability related to the intrusion. We also noted our expectations for future non-cash charges beyond the charge we are currently taking. Together, these cash and non-cash charges represent our best estimate of all of the losses we expect to incur as a result of the intrusion. ", "I would like to thank our customers and shareholders for their ongoing support through this period. We have worked diligently to further strengthen our computer security and are committed to providing a secure shopping environment for our customers. I would like to point out that everything we can say about this charge is in our press release today, and there is really nothing more we can add to it on this call. ", "Now, to recap the consolidated numbers, second quarter consolidated net sales increased to $4.3 billion or 9% above last year. Consolidated comp store sales increased by a very strong 5%. Foreign currency exchange rates benefited comp sales by 1 percentage point, which is what we had expected. Fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on a reported basis were $0.13, which includes the $0.25 per share after-tax charge related to the computer intrusion. Excluding this charge, second quarter EPS from continuing operations was $0.38, again a 31% increase over the prior year. ", "Overall, pretax profit margins were 2.1%. Excluding the intrusion charge, pretax margins were 6.7%, a very strong 90 basis point increase versus last year and on top of last year's 80 basis point improvement. Gross margin was 24%, up 60 basis points, due to the improved merchandise margins as well as buying occupancy leverage. SG&A expense improved 10 basis points over last year, due to our focus on cost reduction as well as leverage on the 5% comp, partially offset by our planned increase in marketing expense. Excluding the incremental marketing spend, SG&A improved 30 basis points over last year. ", "In terms of inventories, at the end of the second quarter consolidated inventories on a per-store basis was up 2%, approximately half of which was due to foreign exchange versus being down 4% at this time last year. We are very comfortable with our inventory position, with fewer dollars committed at this time last year on a total inventory per store basis. This includes the warehouses, stores and merchandise on order. ", "To recap the first half, which was also above expectations, EPS from continuing operations for the first six months was $0.47 on a reported basis, which includes $0.27 of charges related to the computer intrusion. Excluding this charge, EPS from continuing operations was $0.74, up 17% over the prior year. Comp sales increased 4% in the first half, over a 3% increase last year. We also saw strong profit margin gains on top of similar gains during the first six months last year, again demonstrating our ability to drive strong performance on top of strong performance. ", "Now, I will briefly recap divisional results for the second quarter. Marmaxx had an outstanding quarter. Comp sales increased 3% in the second quarter. Segment profit was $252 million, up 21% over the prior year, and segment profit was 9%, up 120 basis points over the prior year, both of which were well above our plan. I should emphasize that we achieved these strong results on comp sales that were in line with plan, the improvement in Marmaxx's profit margins being driven by merchandise margin coupled with cost containment and expense leverage. ", "At Winners and HomeSense in Canada, comp sales increased 12% in US dollars. In local currency, which we believe better reflects our operating performance, comps increased by a strong 7%, which is well above plan. Segment profit was $48 million or up 15% over the prior year, and segment profit margin was just slightly below last year's very strong results. Our Canadian businesses are executing very well and adding newness to their stores every day, and we believe our momentum will continue. ", "In the UK and Ireland, second quarter comps at T.K. Maxx increased 15% in US dollars. The local-currency comp, which again, we believe better reflects our operating performance, increased by a strong 7%, slightly above plan. Segment profit in the second quarter was $16 million in US dollars, and segment profit margin declined versus last year. Profitability was impacted by higher markdowns on women's apparel, the result of a cold, wet summer; as well as lease termination charges as we have relocated stores into larger, higher traffic locations. That said, T.K. Maxx continues to deliver strong comp growth on top of difficult comparisons, and has become established as a well-known brand in the UK and Ireland. I have to say, having spent a few weeks ago, a week in the UK, I never saw the sun shine and that has been for several months. So I think we performed extremely well. ", "Back in the US, HomeGoods also had an outstanding quarter, with Q2 comp sales increasing by a strong 5%, which was above our plan. HomeGoods segment profit was $9 million, more than double last year, and segment profit margin improved 130 basis points, both of which were above plan. HomeGoods has been bucking the softness in the industry for quite a while, which we attribute to strong execution, including a constant flow of new and exciting merchandise. ", "A.J. Wright's second quarter comp increased 6%, which was in line with plan. Bottom line results at A.J. Wright improved over last year, and were at the high end of our plan. I believe we have the right team in place now at A.J. Wright, and our strategies are beginning to take hold. I would like to reiterate that we believe A.J. Wright can be a great growth vehicle for TJX. ", "Finally, at Bob's Stores, comp sales increased by an above plan 10% over positive comps last year, and bottom line results improved over last year. ", "Now, I would like to turn our focus to the TJX business model, which has been successful for 30 years and why we have great confidence that it will continue to be successful. As you know, or three-year plan calls for 12% annual EPS growth, but I want you to know the goal in everything we do is to surpass this. I'm going to outline for you the major themes and reasons for our confidence in the business today and in the future. ", "First, our confidence is rooted in who we are, which is simply stated, about value. Our value equation plays in all kinds of retail environments. When we execute well, the consistency of our performance is hard to find elsewhere in the industry. We have proven time and again that we can achieve top and bottom line growth through both strong economic times and weaker ones. In our 30-year history, we have achieved comp sales increases in all but two years, including during recessions. ", "The performance of our home businesses in the second quarter really make this point. HomeGoods achieved a 5% comp increase over strong comps last year, and nearly doubled its segment profit margin. This was achieved despite a tough home environment. HomeSense and the home businesses at T.K. Maxx also did very well in the second quarter. ", "We're also hearing a lot of discussion about gas prices and the impact on the consumer but our experience in the first and second quarters are examples of what we have seen throughout our history. Macro consumer pressures have not typically impacted our business. In weak environments, new customers tend to find us, and when times improve, they usually stick with us because they love our values. That said, make no mistake that we prefer a strong environment. The point is that in weaker times, we tend to hold our own and do better than most. ", "Second, our ability to drive comp sales gives us great confidence, because we have a solid strategy through which to do so. This includes execution of our flexible business model, our improved marketing strategy and our constant injection of new merchandise initiatives. Now, let me elaborate. We have an amazingly flexible off-price business model that allows us to buy opportunistically and make purchase decisions very close to need. When we execute well, this gives us a huge competitive advantage, as we can constantly adjust to market trends and customer demand. ", "A great example of how we benefited from this flexibility in the second quarter is what we did with dresses. Entered the quarter with significantly more open-to-buy versus the prior year, which gave us the flexibility to shift some missy dollars at Marmaxx into dresses. The results: dresses comped up 64% in the second quarter on top of 23% comp increase the year before. We had a decrease in missy apparel overall, but we planned it that way. This not only happened in Marmaxx but across all of our apparel divisions. ", "The next piece of our strategy to drive comps is our constantly improving marketing. We have increased our investments which our cost reduction efforts are more than funding. We are also doing a much better job of being harder-hitting in our messaging and connecting our customer with our brands. They are loving our Maxx Moments campaign, and we're very excited about our new campaign for Marshalls, which is breaking in September. T.K. Maxx does an excellent job of branding, and is now an accepted premium brand in the UK and Ireland. We plan to make T.K. Maxx a European brand, and we will begin with our expansion into Germany, which I'll say more about in a moment. ", "At A.J. Wright, we are looking forward to what we believe will be a breakthrough marketing campaign that you will see both on TV and outdoor billboards, and that's beginning this week. At Bob's, we continue to work on improving marketing, and have a new agency that we believe will help us do a better job of reaching that customer. ", "The last piece of our strategy to drive comps is merchandise initiatives, and we have many underway in various stages. There's always something in the pipeline, so that we're ready to roll with a new initiative when one before it begins to reach maturity. This is what we do. We're always testing new ideas. Some stick and some don't, but we learn from them all. I'll highlight just a few. ", "At Marshalls, we really like the results we are seeing at The Cube, our juniors shop. We will be adding 80 to 100 of these just in the first half of next year. One of the things that excites us most about this initiative is that we are building a loyal base for the future. The Cube really appeals to both the younger customer as well as the more contemporary 40-plus-year-old. I should say that I'm a big shopper of The Cube, and I am more than 40. ", "Footwear and accessories are also doing well at Marmaxx. Shoes comped up 11% in the second quarter, and we are on track to add over 200 expanded footwear departments at Marshalls this year. Shoes and accessories were exceptional at Winners in the second quarter, and we're adding more of both initiatives to this chain. ", "The Runway, our designer department at T.J. Maxx continues to perform, and we are fine-tuning this concept before rolling it out to more stores. Also, we now have 14 Runway departments at Winners in Canada, and we are seeing very good results. Another example of what we're doing with kids' departments throughout the company, HG Kids is a success at HomeGoods. We're going to be testing Little Winners at Winners, and Kids Maxx is doing really well at T.K. Maxx. ", "The third major reason for our confidence in our ability to deliver growth is our emphasis and progress on cost reduction. We continue to build cost structures around conservatively planned comps to position us to drive more to the bottom line if we beat the comp plan. We also have a senior executive dedicated to the cost reduction, leading a cross-divisional team that is drilling into the big costs. Some examples are non-merchandise procurement, store operating costs, supply chain, markdown optimization and a store-ready project. While some of these efforts will deliver in the shorter term, others are medium-term efforts that will require some re-engineering of existing processes. ", "The fourth major reason for our confidence is everything we're doing to drive growth in selling square footage at attractive financial returns across the company. We have opportunities to expand into new countries and new concepts. We have proved that our value equation plays well in four countries and Puerto Rico, and we plan to capitalize upon that by opening our first stores in Germany. Our T.K. Maxx team is very excited, and we are on track for our first five openings this fall. International expansion is something that we continue to look at very seriously and believe is in our future. ", "Larger footprints are another growth opportunity. We are testing our first 40,000-square-foot box at HomeGoods. Also, we have been very aggressive with relocations into larger footprints at T.K. Maxx, which have had great ROIs, and we are also looking to do this at Marmaxx. We are also looking at testing a separate home business in the UK. Interestingly enough, the UK home business was up 25% over last year's very strong 18%. ", "Lastly, in our reason for being confident, I truly believe that our no-walls approach is and will continue to be key to our success. This is about exceptional talent, sharing new ideas and best practices. Having no walls in our stores has always benefited us by allowing us to be opportunistic and flexible. We have taken this no-walls idea to an organizational level, and have knocked down many of the walls between divisions in order to increase knowledge sharing, communication and talent. Divisional teams are visiting with each other's divisional teams. I can already see, in tangible ways, how the company is benefiting. I also feel great about the management team we have in place, who really embraces this openness and intelligent risk-taking. ", "A recent example of the benefit of our no-walls approach is how we worked together to fix our soft home business. We have had companywide meetings on this. The results have been exceptional, and we are seeing big lifts in soft home in most of our divisions. Another important example is or dedicated cost reduction team, which consists of a leader from each of our businesses, and best ideas are being shared throughout the company. ", "Now, I would like to move onto our financial strength. We expect to continue to generate significant amounts of cash from our strong operations, plan to continue to put our cash to use in increasing shareholder value through buying back our stock, which should account for about 3% to 4% of our annual EPS growth. In the second quarter, we repurchased $345 million of TJX stock, retiring 12.2 million shares. We continue to expect to repurchase a total of $900 million of TJX stock in fiscal 2008. ", "Now to guidance. Beginning with third quarter guidance, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $0.53 to $0.55, which represents a 10% to 15% increase over $0.48 per share in the prior year. This outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of approximately 3% to 4%. It's important to note that last year's third quarter was exceptionally strong, with a 6% comp increase and over 50% growth in EPS over the prior year, and we're being prudent as we plan against this. ", "Now, to the full year. We are now expecting fiscal year 2008 earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $1.57 to $1.61. Excluding costs related to the intrusions of $0.27 recorded in the first and second quarters, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $1.84 to $1.88. These estimates are based on an estimated comp-store sales increase of approximately 3% to 4% for the full year, and assumes fourth quarter EPS in the range of $0.57 to $0.59. Excluding the intrusion charge, this represents a 13% to 15% increase over the $1.63 per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2007. Jeff will provide more detail on this guidance in a moment. ", "Summing up, let me recap the major points and reasons for our confidence. First, our value equation plays well in all kinds of environments, and we have a proven history of consistency through both strong economies and weaker ones. ", "Second is our confidence in our three-pronged strategy to drive comps through solid execution of our flexible off-price business model, improving marketing and merchandise initiatives. ", "Third, our emphasis and progress on cost reduction gives us great confidence. Cost reduction is going to be a continuous process, and we see it as a focus for the next several years. ", "Fourth, we have growth opportunities not only in unit growth but also concept growth and square footage growth. ", "Fifth, our no-walls approach to the business is an exceptional strength to the company and is already benefiting us in many tangible ways. I have said it in the past, but I think it's important to note that our senior group gets together every single Monday and talks about the business. So this is all part of our breaking all our walls down. ", "I'll conclude by saying that I am very excited about our business today, and I am even more excited about the future. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the third quarter. Now, I like to turn it over to Jeff. ", " Jeff Naylor", " Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few moments to cover the third quarter guidance. For the third quarter of this year, the company expects earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $0.53 to $0.55, which represents a 10% to 15% increase over the $0.48 per share that we earned last year. ", "In terms of some of the components, we're assuming a third quarter top line of approximately $4.8 billion. So that's $4.8 billion in sales, with a comp sales increase in the 3% to 4% range on a consolidated basis. I think it's worth pointing out that in that 3% to 4% comp guidance, that includes roughly a 1 point benefit from foreign currency. It also assumes a 1% to 2% comp sales increase at the Marmaxx Group, and obviously assumes no additional intrusion charges. ", "As to monthly comps on a consolidated basis, we expect comp sales increases in the range of 3% to 4% in August, 2% to 3% in September and about 4% in October. So that's for TJX on a consolidated basis. For Marmaxx, we're planning on comp-sales increases in the range of 1% to 2% for August, flat to 1% for September and 2% to 3% for October. ", "Pretax profit margins are planned in the 8.4% to 8.6% range, which is flat to 20 basis points up over the prior year. A little color on that, I think it's important to note that we had extremely strong merchandise margins last year relative to our history and as Carol mentioned, we're planning this component prudently. The other thing I would point out is that our third quarter pretax margin guidance also reflects a 10 basis point reduction which is attributable to the launch of the T.K. Maxx business in Germany. As Carol mentioned, we're on track to have five stores open in October. ", "In terms of the P&L, we're anticipating third quarter gross margin in the range of 25.4% to 25.5% and SG&A as a percent of sales to be about 16.7% to 16.8%. For modeling purposes, we're planning a tax rate of 38.5%, and also for modeling purposes we plan the weighted average outstanding shares at 465 million for the quarter. ", "To keep to call on schedule, we would ask that you please limit your questions to one per person. I think, with that, we'll open it up for questions now. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley. ", " Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", " Can you first talk about availability of product in the current environment, how it compares to the same time last year, and speak specifically about the impact of continued weakness of the converted May Company doors? Then if you can just touch upon The Runway, how many stores is this in currently, and what margin impact did it have in the second quarter? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " First of all, as far as availability, Ernie is here with us today, and he'll comment, but the market is very plentiful. Obviously, there is a lot of confusion out there, especially in the apparel world, which tends to work out pretty well for us. So I think we are feeling very positive about going forward. In addition to that, we have more open-to-buy than we had a year ago. We don't state the exact numbers, but I think we're in a great position today. ", "In terms of The Runway, again, we don't usually give margins in terms of our initiatives, but we are seeing a lift in our stores. We have taken The Runway to Winners. As I said, we have 14 stores there, and we continue to work on it. I think the biggest benefit to The Runway, honestly, has been that we have opened new vendors and we have been able to spread some of these even higher-level brands to all of our stores. So we are pretty excited about that, so we get a win-win. ", " Ernie Herrman", " I would just jump in on the availability of the goods. At the last call I think I talked about this a little. Our biggest challenge in Marmaxx right now is really keeping that open to buy and making sure we are in the market all the time, because there's really an availability that's so great out there, we're having to really manage how quickly we spend. So availability is a non-issue. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Tunick \u2013 JP Morgan. ", " Brian Tunick - JP Morgan", " Congrats on a tough environment. One's pretty much for the sector, and it has to do with the Supreme Court decision that we keep hearing about. How does that affect you guys relative to the decision that it give the brands the potential to enforce the lowest price at which their products could be sold. Is that something we need to worry about? Secondly from a T.J. Maxx perspective, your new loyalty card and private label credit card, can you just talk about maybe some opportunities there for the back half, and if you're seeing any early results? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " In terms of the pricing, it doesn't really affect off-price. First of all, I don't think it's really going to go through and affect the industry. Secondly, the off-price sector really is not going to be involved in it. So I don't see that as an issue going forward for us at all. ", "In terms of our private label card, we are planning in this fall time period our in-store launch, which we are pretty excited about. Our soft launch has been pretty productive, and we are just beginning that. We have the opportunity, we believe, in the future to have several million customers join us. So again, we think that's going to be a benefit, but probably starting to hit us more towards the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Black \u2013 Lehman Brothers. ", " Jeffrey Black - Lehman Brothers", " Let me add my congrats on the nice quarter. I have a two-pronged question on the SG&A front. I just wanted to understand, is the amount of spend that's going to hit the back half, does that still keep the hurdle rate to get some leverage in that 2% to 3% range on the comp? ", "Carol, on the spending itself, what are you doing differently in terms of the programs you're implementing on the marketing front, specifically? Is it driving traffic? Are there any differences you can tell? Are we getting better results, in other words? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " I'll start with your second question and then I'll hand it over to Jeff. Obviously, our cost initiative involves all the divisions, and it more than leverages the marketing. Our marketing spend for the second quarter was about 20% up or about 15 basis points so obviously, that's self-funding. Our traffic was slightly up, and our average basket is up, so we think it is really benefiting us. Our plan going forward for third quarter is a slight increase, slightly above sales, and the same thing for our fourth quarter. So we're seeing pretty positive results. Obviously, it's momentum and we think that we will reap the benefits as we continue with a very aggressive program. ", " Jeff Naylor", " Yes, we look at the third quarter and the fourth quarter would line up this way too, we are looking at 10 to 20 basis points of leverage at a 3% to 4% comp. I'd point out two things there. That's also including 10 basis points of advertising deleverage as we continue to invest in advertising, some of the cost savings that we're realizing. So if I were to adjust that out, it would be 20 to 30 basis points of SG&A leverage at a 3% to 4%. So I think we feel comfortable that the leverage point, through continued cost reduction, that we are taking that below 3%. As you know, our plan with Marmaxx calls for a 2.5% comp being the breakeven point, which would begin to lever SG&A. Is there a chance to take that lower? I think, clearly, you look at the second quarter performance, and at Marmaxx we've got 40 basis points. ", "We actually haven't broken this out for you. Maybe it's worth just quickly covering. In the second quarter at Marmaxx, there was 120 basis points in segment profit, 90 of that was merchandise margin and 40 of that was expenses. That was on a 3% comp, and then we had 10 basis points of advertising going the other way. So as you look at the second quarter, we had 40 basis points of leverage at a 3% comp. So clearly, there's a lot going on in the cost reduction area that is helping us drive flow through here to the bottom line, and we would expect that to continue. ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " We've baked a certain amount in our plan, but obviously we hope to beat that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez \u2013 Credit Suisse. ", " Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "Quickly, lease termination charges at T.K., can you quantify that? Second, I believe at A.J. you have picked a few categories that you are really focusing on. Can you just remind us what those were, how they performed once you gave them your focus, and what are the next targets at A.J.? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", "In terms of T.K., it's worth about 70 basis points. Obviously, the repositioning, we're going to continue with that, moving into larger stores, as it's really beneficial to us. Jeff, do you want to comment on that? ", " Jeff Naylor", " Yes, it's about GBP 2 million to GBP 2.5 million pounds, just to give you a sense of the hit. I think what's important to note here Paul is that we're really talking about timing, because typically, when we relocate a store we will get an inducement from that new landlord. What happens is that to get out of the existing lease, we take a hit. That hit impacts the current period, and the inducement to go into the new space gets spread out over the lease. So in most of these cases, we're actually getting money from the new landlord to cover the hit with the old landlord. But, because of the way we account for it, it results in a hit. Again, in this case, it was about a 70 basis points impact in T.K. ", "But the spaces we're moving into are generally, we're taking stores that are 16,000 to 18,000 square feet that were stores that we opened very early on T.K. Maxx's history, and are moving those into much larger, higher-traffic areas on the High Street that are from a financial standpoint very, very attractive. They help drive comp, a lot of incremental profit and terrific ROIs. So it's something we feel very, very good about, but it has this short-term profit impact because of the way the accounting works. ", " Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", " Could we see more of that in the second half? ", " Jeff Naylor", " We're going to continue to do this. You might recall last year in the fourth quarter we had a pretty significant impact on T.K.'s P&L from this kind of activity. So obviously, as we continue to do it, we are anniversarying numbers where it's already included so it shouldn't have as much an incremental impact as we get into next year as we might see this year. Again, it's all incorporated and was incorporated in the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " In terms of A.J.'s, we're really happy because we have seen a lot of businesses turn around. Our footwear business, which was pretty weak, is exceptional in the second quarter; it's up almost 22%. The junior and the missy businesses is very strong. So we are really seeing the apparel businesses pick up. Dresses was exceptional, and men's and kids' continues to be strong. ", "I think the one area where I'm really not happy with the execution is home. So, quite frankly, we are putting a focus group together and we are going to work on fixing this area. I think obviously, when we focus on something, we do fix it. So we're pretty happy with what we're seeing at A.J.'s. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup. ", " Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup ", " Congratulations on a great quarter. Carol, I'm hoping that you can talk to us about how you're thinking about advertising. Obviously, you're beefing up the advertising budget as you were able to cut costs in other areas. Optimally, what's the end game here? Is there a target percent of revenues that you think you will be happy with? ", "Then, if I could just ask one question on Bob's, we got a 10% comp in Bob's this quarter, which was fantastic. But the operating loss was only cut by about $500,000. What do you think it takes to get that business to full year breakeven or profitability? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " I'll start with Bob's, then I'll talk about advertising. We did put heavy emphasis on marketing Bob's and we really wanted to see what kind of traffic it would drive. It certainly did drive traffic and comps. The positive is that we think that we can look at the marketing in a slightly different way and do a much better job in terms of the qualitative piece of it. So we think that we can, in the future, reduce our advertising expense and have just as strong quality. We obviously funded this through merchandise margins, which again, I've said in the past that we have been able to leverage TJX, and we continue to. So I think we have picked up 150 basis points in margin that really helped fund marketing. What's exciting is the traffic and the comps that we're seeing because if we can drive comp over comp, then obviously it becomes a much more interesting business to take forward. ", "In terms of advertising globally, the back half we don't have as large an increase. But we are really focusing on the qualitative piece of it and building the brands, which we're really trying to make our campaigns exceptional. We've seen that with T.K.'s, and we have seen it with Maxx Moments. We need to do the same thing with Marshalls. We think we're going to achieve it with A.J. Wright, and we do have a new campaign for Winners and HomeSense. Their business is pretty strong right now, but I think we can even take it up a bit. So that's how we think of advertising, and it's really a combination of being harder-hitting but really brand-building along with that. ", " Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup ", " Thanks and good luck here in the second half. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets. ", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Kudos to the team and welcome, Trip. First, on forex, it helped the comp by 1%. Was there a benefit to the earnings, and does your second half guidance incorporate any further forex benefit, comps and/or earnings? ", " Jeff Naylor", "Half a penny impact on earnings in the second quarter. It tends to impact sales more than earnings, because the earnings impact is whatever the pretax margin is for that individual business. So, while it was a big impact on the comp line, it's about $0.005 on the bottom line. In terms as we look out over the third and the fourth quarter, we would expect a similar kind of scenario to play out here, where it would be maybe $0.005 in each of those quarters. So it contributes, but not materially. ", " Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", " With regards to Germany, could you remind us what makes you so attracted to that market, where Wal-Mart and Gap couldn't succeed and pulled out? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " I think we've learned from the past, in the Netherlands and I think we learned from watching other companies around us. But what we're doing differently in Germany is we are really doing it with a German team, with German brands, really understanding that customer. We took a lot of time and energy. I actually met with 20 of our people that are going to be our German operators and merchants a few weeks ago. They really understand the customer. We are very, very excited about the value equation. We even understand the nuances of the difference in fashion between the UK and Germany. So it's very fine-tuned. There are 82 million people in Germany, and I guess we look at T.K.'s, which is 60-something million people, and we think there's a tremendous opportunity for a branded value equation entity. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Margaret Mager \u2013 Goldman Sachs. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs ", " I just wanted to ask about the gross margins in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter but the third quarter in particular, given your comments about last year being so strong, we were modeling flat gross margin. Would you take that down? So are you expecting a down gross margin in the quarter? Then looking into fourth quarter, would you expect a similar setup? If you could get a little more specific, that would be great. ", " Jeff Naylor", " In terms of the third quarter, we're planning the gross profit margin flat to down 10 basis points, so that 25.4% to 25.5% we gave you was against 25.5% last year. So it's flat to down 10 basis points. I'd point out within that, that we have got the merchandise margin planned down a little bit more than that, and it's being offset by some expense leverage on the buying and occupancy costs that we group with gross profit. ", "The reminder there is, last year, we had an 80 basis point increase in our merchandise margins in the quarter, and they were the highest merchandise margins we had seen as far back as we could look for the third quarter. So we just felt it was prudent to plan them conservatively. I think that said, as Carol mentioned earlier, we come into the quarter with significantly more inventory dollars to place this year than we had at the same time last year. So we've got significant open to buy. With an attractive market, that gives us the ability to chase. So we are not giving up on it. We think there's some opportunity there, but we've planted it a little bit conservatively, based on how last year came out. ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " I have to say, I'm very happy where we are in terms of our open to buy. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs ", " Yes, that's clear. One quick question on the bigger picture, where you commented that your company hasn't experienced declines even during recessions, but there were two periods where you were down on your same-store sales. What were the circumstances around that, if you could remind us? Do you think the macro environment has shifted and is more challenging, and it will play to your strengths and advantages? What is your take on the macro? Thanks. ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " I'm going to tell you that the two years that we had negative comps, I'm going to tell you, was clearly an execution issue. I come back to that, and I can't say it any stronger, that when we execute well, we have positive comps. That's what our focus is. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs ", " Do you think the macro has shifted at all? Is that your take? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " No, again, you'll have to elaborate on that. ", " Jeff Naylor", " Yes, in what way are you asking? What kinds of shifts are you talking about, I guess? ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs ", " You are pointing out that you tend to do well in a more challenging environment. ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " We do well in a challenging environment, but I think obviously, we want a healthy environment. But we tend to be a business with great value, people will come down a level or, I should say, are looking for more value in tougher economic times. In good times, still it's a very positive for us. We are really saying we are more recession-proof. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Montagna \u2013 C.L. King. ", " Mark Montagna - C.L. King", " When you talk about the buy environment being as good as it is, is there any way you can put it in perspective as to when was the last time you saw the buying environment this good? Can you categorize have the home buying environment is versus say the apparel buying environment? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " Let me talk to home. Obviously, home business out there is soft. So whenever it's soft, we tend to see a lot of goods. So we have a combination in our home business of a lot of new initiatives going on and plentiful goods out there, so, more than we can probably ever be hungry enough to be able to buy, so that it allows us to really raise the bar on the quality of our inventory. ", "In terms of the level of goods out there, we get asked this question again and again. I think I really have to state this very clearly, that we have more of a problem controlling our buyers. We have 440 buyers on the ground, and so we never have a shortage of goods. It's about focusing those buyers on the right goods at the right times, and that comes back to the execution. ", " Ernie Herrman", " I'd go back to that point that Carol just said, as well as what we talked about earlier. The market in apparel, which I think was part of your question, the apparel markets really have a lot of goods. One reason we strategically wanted to get to this place on this open to buy that we have, which is significantly more than last year, is we could feel the soft apparel business out there. We're kind of a barometer; we kind of keep a pulse on it. As Carol talked about, our buyers are out there all the time. So we, by design, wanted to be in this place, knowing that there was going to be so much goods. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Patrick McKeever - Avondale. ", " Patrick McKeever - Avondale Partners", " Good morning, everyone. I have a question about your urban apparel business. What percent, even ballpark figures would be helpful, of the business would you consider to be urban apparel at A.J. Wright? About what percent would it be at T.J. and Marshalls, and how did that business do for you in the quarter? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " First of all, our urban business has been very strong. It's obviously a smaller percent in Marshalls than it is at A.J.'s. But we really don't like to discuss the specific percentage of our business. But it is a higher percentage of our A.J. Wright business versus Marmaxx. ", " Patrick McKeever - Avondale Partners", " Have you been adding merchandise in that area, just in urban, at the different divisions? Is there more today than a year ago? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " It depends on specific areas. So in young men's and A.J.'s, we are. In kids', what we have been doing, again, is trying to raise the bar on some of the vendors. So there are some vendors in A.J. Wright that we really went after in urban, and they're doing extremely well. So obviously, we are feeding that in. So, again, it depends on the category. But urban has been pretty strong generally. ", " Patrick McKeever - Avondale Partners", " Was the tax rate 38.5% in the quarter? ", " Jeff Naylor", " Yes, it was 38.5% in the quarter. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dana Cohen \u2013 Banc of America. ", " Dana Cohen - Banc of America", " I just wanted to go back on the SG&A in the quarter because as I look back at Q1, you got 40 basis points on a 2% comp. Then you were planning SG&A on a 3% to 4% comp to be 17% to 17.4%. That better comp in SG&A rate was at the high end of your guidance. So intuitively, you should have gotten more leverage. So what changed, inter-quarter? ", " Jeff Naylor", " Well, it's sort of hard to comment on the specifics there. I think we look at it and we got 30 basis points of pickup, excluding advertising, on a 5% comp. About 100 basis points of that is generated by currency that you really don't get the full amount of leverage on. So I think that 30 basis points on that level of comp, I think we feel comfortable with that. Then, if I look at the actual rate itself, it was at the high end of our guidance. ", " Dana Cohen - Banc of America", " Right, but your comp was better so intuitively, you should have gotten more leverage. I'm just wondering, was there some sort of SG&A project that you elected to spend as you saw the comps come in, such that the spend was higher than you thought? Or is it all currency-related? ", " Jeff Naylor", " I think it's more currency-related. There's nothing that we would call out there. There's a little bit obviously, there's some spending that's going on relative to systems, as we have invested in to improve the security of our network. So you've got some of that, that's going to have an impact, but not more than 10 basis points. ", " Dana Cohen - Banc of America", " So as you look into the back half, though, originally coming into this year, I believe you said you could lever on a 2.5% comp. Is that correct? ", " Jeff Naylor", " That is correct. Again, as we look at the back half, in the third quarter, we've got 10 to 20 basis points with 10 points of investment in advertising. So we have 20 to 30 basis points on a 3% to 4% comp. So if you think 20 basis points of leverage at a 3% comp, we're leveraging there somewhere between a 2% and a 2.5%. ", " Dana Cohen - Banc of America", " And in Q4? ", " Jeff Naylor", " The other place you see that, by way, is in the Marmaxx guidance for the third quarter, where we are planning Marmaxx 10.5 to 10.6, against 10.6 last year. So we've got it flat to down 10 basis points, and that's on a 1% to 2% comp. So, again, we feel pretty comfortable there. ", "The one other thing that was probably impacting the third quarter is that we have investments in Germany, as we look at both second and third quarter. So that may be what you're seeing there and why you're not seeing as much leverage. ", " Dana Cohen - Banc of America", " Do you know what the basis point impact of Germany was in Q2? ", " Jeff Naylor", " Yes, it's in that 5 to 10 basis point range. ", " Dana Cohen - Banc of America", "And SG&A leverage in Q4? ", " Jeff Naylor", " Well, Germany has a 10 basis point impact on the third quarter, as well. ", " Dana Cohen - Banc of America", " I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. SG&A leverage in Q4? ", " Jeff Naylor", " We're really not providing guidance on fourth quarter at this point, other than to give you the EPS. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Morris - Wachovia. ", " John Morris - Wachovia", " Carol, I think this is for you. A.J. Wright, you did talk a little bit more about the categories and what you were happy with and what you want to work on there. But during the course of your prepared remarks, you did talk about the strategy taking hold. So I'm just wondering if you can go a little bit deeper on that. What is it about the strategy, maybe remind us or bring us back up to date, that really seems to be working there, not so much in terms of the results by category but what's going on behind it. Maybe elaborate little bit more about the marketing campaign for A.J. Is it going to be brand-driven, the way that it is at T.J., or is it going to be more price-specific? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " First of all, A.J.'s, we've really found works in markets that have a significantly high ethnic mix. Our new stores are performing extremely well, which again, we have the ability to understand where our stores need to be, which was a big focus in understanding where the future real estate would go. It is a slightly higher urban mix that I discussed before, and we're finding that is working. We have initiatives, kids' is very strong; special sizes is very strong. As I said before, the one place that I still feel we're not executing very well is the home business. ", "The campaign you are going to see is about expressing yourself. It's called The Real Deal. So it's a combination of the self-image of what that brand needs to be, along with brands in fashion. So we have gone after some real A brands, especially in urban and fashion. We found that A.J. Wright is really a combination of both. In addition to those two elements, basics are very, very important. A customer wants to come in and they want to find their kids' underwear available. I suspect there will be things that we find in home the same way, and I think we will be able to focus the home a little bit more on some of the needs. ", "So I think we're really beginning to understand this customer. As I said, our comps have been improving. We are very happy with the apparel business. More importantly, I think we really have the right talent running that business, and I think they understand it. So we have a more seasoned team that's learning every day. So it gives me a lot of hope for A.J. for the future. ", " John Morris - Wachovia", " Carol, a quick follow-up on the advertising, what is the difference between the campaign that's out there for T.J. versus what you're launching for Marshalls? How will you differentiate the message and the campaign? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " Well, we want the message to resonate as strong as T.J. Maxx, and we did not have a campaign that did that. We believe that we will have a campaign this back half that will be just as strong. So we are pretty excited about it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research. ", " David Glick - Buckingham Research", " Congratulations to the team on a great quarter. I wanted to follow up on the missy and the accessories business. Clearly, missy is tough industry-wide. Are you seeing any hope beyond dresses? Do dresses continue to be important in fall? Is there anything that gives you hope, that might give you the confidence to start planning that business up? Then in the accessory business, outside of footwear, are you're still seeing strength and, for example, handbags is a key category for you? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " Yes. Our accessory business is still very strong. We are seeing some trends in missy that we think is going to give us a lot of hope, and we are going after them, except that I'm not going to tell you what those are. But we do see a light there, and I think we're very, very focused on the back half. I will tell you that, just in general, there's a more trouser/missy trend going on, which does very well for our customer, since our customer's average age is in the mid-40's, low to mid-40's when there tends to be a very slim-fitting or very junior look in the market, it's great for the younger customer, but it isn't as great for the missy customer. That trend we see changing, so we are getting a lot more excited about the back half. ", "Ernie, do you have any comment you want to make? ", " Ernie Herrman", "To your question, we see accessories overall being pretty strong as we continue forward here, and it has been. I know you mentioned handbags. I think the shoe business again, we've continued, as we talked about, with shoe rollouts. The shoe business we think still offers pretty big opportunity in both T.J. Maxx and Marshalls; not just in Marshalls, by the way. I think we've talked about that before. ", "In the ladies business, yes, it's tough around the board out there. But again, I go back to the model we have also allows us, I think, some flexibility there. So even though we're not specifying some of the trend items per se, as much, I think our model there will allow us in missy to react as we start shipping some of the fall goods. We can react in our model closer in to some of these trends. So we think we will work at that business and make it happen, because it is a bellwether business for us. ", " David Glick - Buckingham Research", "Thanks for that color. Finally on Bob's, it sounds like you're a little more optimistic. Should we still expect kind of a go/no-go decision at the end of the year? Do you think that decision will extend into next fiscal year? Can you give us a sense of that? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " I think we should have a better feeling about the business by the end of the year. I think if we have a strong back half, that's going to tell us a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group. ", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", " You had mentioned expense control obviously being a key element of the drivers of earnings growth going forward. In the past, you've talked about merchandise margin, non-store procurement expense and also markdown optimization as being some of the key drivers of that expense control. Is there priority in terms of which comes first and what you're doing in those areas and how they are progressing? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " Actually, what we have is five project teams and each of those teams consists of a key person from each division. So we're simultaneously working on all five projects and we are absolutely making headway. As I said before, we've baked some of it into our plans. I think you saw margins in terms of looking at the Marmaxx numbers, what they did in the second quarter, a piece of that is seeing some of this. We've planned our back half conservatively against pretty aggressive numbers a year ago. But again, I'm hoping to beat those numbers and I'm hoping to see some additional cost reduction. So there's tremendous focus. As I said in the prior call, we have an SEVP that is basically really running this project, and that's a key component of his job. So everyone is on board and very focused on this cost reduction project. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker. ", " Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", " Congratulations. I hear your buyers are having a grand old time in the market. If you could talk a little bit about the real estate strategy, just two questions. Are you on track with all your planned store openings for the full year, or have any shifted into or out of those plans? ", "Then if you could just also talk about the relocation, resizing, refreshing at the Marmaxx division, I guess if you look at the overall base, how would you break it down between we're really thrilled with the way the stores are and we would love to, ideally, upgrade these stores percentage-wise? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " First of all, we are on plan in terms of store openings. We actually had a more aggressive first quarter. In second quarter, I think we had five. But we are basically on plan for the first half in terms of opening new stores. ", "Marmaxx, again, we look at everything on an ROI basis. We're being a little more aggressive in the number of stores we are closing in Marmaxx, and we are obviously with all of the initiatives, and I call them with all of our tools in our toolbox, we have better reason to be able to handle larger stores, and we think we can get better productivity out of it. ", "So it's really a real estate opportunistic situation. When we have the ability to move into a better market or a power center that's new and it makes sense on the ROI, we do it. So we are being a little more aggressive in closing stores. On Marmaxx's base, it's a big base and it's not going to really move the needle dramatically. ", " Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", " Then on the refreshing of those stores, where you're in a good location but you can maybe add Runaway or things like that, are you being more aggressive that way as well? ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " We're being very aggressive. Ernie will talk to you about The Cube. Ernie, do you want to comment on that? ", " Ernie Herrman", " As we've talked about before, over 200 shoe megas. I think you get a refreshed look in the store when we do that. I think we've talked about The Cube lines as well, which you will have noticed that a fair amount of the stores have been converted to the Cube lines. When we do that, I think we get a fresher look to the store. ", " Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", " Yes, I would agree. ", " Ernie Herrman", " Those have been pretty aggressive, in addition to continuing on our remodel program, which we are always looking at. But again, I think that is the way you look in today's environment and convenience to the customer is all important. ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " Jeff would like to just clarify something in regard to Dana Cohen's question. ", " Jeff Naylor", " I want to make some clarifying comments on the SG&A, because I don't think I answered that question very well to Dana. So as we're looking at the second quarter SG&A, the question really was we have a 5% comp, and the question was, why do you only have 10 basis points of SG&A leverage on a 5%, comp with everything you've got going from a cost reduction standpoint, and particularly in light of some of the performance we saw in the first quarter. So, while we reported 10 basis points of leverage, as I mentioned, advertising, if you pull out the planned increase in advertising, we actually levered 30. The write-offs on T.K. that we've been talking about to reposition that real estate, that's flowing through the SG&A line. That's costing us about 10 basis points corporately, and then Germany is costing us another 5 to 10. ", "So if you actually adjust our SG&A for the planned investment in advertising, the one-time hit or the hit from some of the T.J. Maxx repositioning charges and the investment we're making in Germany, we're actually getting about 50 basis points of leverage on a 5% comp. We obviously feel very, very comfortable about it. ", "Now, as we look at the third quarter, I mentioned we had planned 10 to 20 basis points of G&A leverage. Again, that is with a planned investment in advertising which negatively impacts SG&A by about 10 basis points. So if we adjust for that, that would suggest 20 to 30 basis points of SG&A leverage. I would also point out that we're going to continue to invest in Germany in the third quarter. So adjusting for advertising and the German investments, we would be expecting about 30 to 40 basis points of G&A leverage at a 3% to 4% comp. ", "I threw a lot of basis points at you there. I would be happy to go through it a little bit slower off-line. But I think it's important, because it underscores all the things that are going on within the company in the area of expense management that I didn't want to get lost in this discussion today. ", "One other technical point, Patrick McKeever asked was our tax rate 38.5%. It was, excluding the intrusion expense. With the intrusion expense, it was 35.9%, because there's a couple of items in there that are not deductible. That's all the clarifications I had to make. ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " We have time for one more question. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice. ", " David Mann - Johnson Rice", " Congratulations on the computer intrusion at this point, in terms of getting passed the uncertainty. I just have one corollary question on that. Your results in the first half suggest you've had very little impact on traffic from all that publicity. But can you talk a little bit about what you've seen and heard in any of your customer research? Do you have any plans to reach out to your customers, now that you're at a point of understanding what the damage was? I guess you wrote in some of your filings you had 11 million folks who had some stolen information, and another 0.5 million where you had to communicate with them about some information as well. ", " Carol Meyrowitz", " In terms of traffic, I can only say that we have been pleased with the business and we have been pleased with the business in the Northeast, it has been pretty strong. So I hope that answers your question. ", "In terms of the customer, I really can't go into detail. I can only tell you that the customer and obviously our shareholders have been very, very important to us. We feel that we are doing the right thing by our customer. I really can't get into the detail of it. ", "Thanks, everyone, and I look forward to reporting the third quarter.

Jeff Naylor will be handling the financial questions today andTrip will be answering those questions on our year end call.", "Let me begin by saying that our third quarter performance isan excellent example of the power of our off-price model when all of theelements of the model are executed well. Despite the pressure on sales fromunseasonably warm weather in many regions of the US,Canada and UKand concerns about a weak consumer, we delivered bottom line results that werein line with our expected range. Further, our 13% EPS increase was achievedover a 50% increase reported in EPS last year, demonstrated our continuedability to deliver sustained earnings growth even with difficult environmentsand tough comparisons.", "There is so much concern out there about retail, so I wantto be very clear: the story of our third quarter is simple and straightforward.It is about weather, it is about keeping inventory very clean and it is aboutkeeping costs down.  I should say again,it is about a very tough comparison to last year. We were very disciplined inmanaging our open to buy, which allowed us to take advantage of the greatmarket environment. Great deals generated improved merchandise margins even aswe aggressively took markdowns to clear inventory and enter Q4 extremely clean.We also remained focused on managing costs, which helped mute the impact of thewarm weather.", "I should note that Marmaxx\u2019s negative 1 comp leveraged well,resulting in only a 30 basis point hit to segment profit margin, which was lessthan you might expect. Further, other divisions, particularly HomeGoods and theinternational businesses, really kicked in with strong contributions to thebottom line.", "Now to recap the consolidated numbers. Third quarterconsolidated net sales increased to $4.7 billion, 6% above last year.Consolidated comp-store sales increased by 3% over a 6% increase last year.Foreign currency exchange rates benefited comp sales by 2 percentage points,which was slightly more than we had expected. Fully diluted earnings per sharefrom continuing operations were $0.54, a 13% increase over $0.48 per share lastyear.", "Overall, pretax margins were 8.5%, which was up 10 basispoints on top of last year's 200 basis point increase. It is important to notethat 2 points of comp coming from currency generated pretax margin improvementon what was essentially a 1 comp increase.", "Gross margins declined 20 basis points. With prospective managementof our inventories and open to buy, merchandise margins increased 20 basispoints in a challenging sales environment. This improvement was more thanoffset, however, by a mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related foreigncurrency hedges, which will revert in the fourth quarter. Jeff will providemore details on this later.", "SG&A expense improved 20 basis points; the favorableimpact of cost management partially offset by a planned increase in marketingspend.", "In terms of inventories, at the end of the third quarter,consolidated inventories on a per store basis were down 1% and down 3%excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We are very happy with the liquidityin our inventory. We have fewer dollars committed forward than at this timelast year on a per-store basis including the warehouses, stores and merchandiseon order. ", "Again, we entered Q4 very clean and in a tremendously strongposition to react to the marketplace, which is flush with very desirableproduct in all categories.", "To recap the first nine months, which was above our plan,EPS from continuing operations for the first nine months was $1.00 on areported basis, which includes $0.28 of charges related to the computerintrusion. Excluding this charge, EPS from continuing operations were $1.28 orup 14% over the prior year. Comp sales increased 3% in the first nine monthsover a 4% increase last year. So a strong profit margin gain on top of stronggains during the first nine months last year, which again demonstrates ourability to consistently deliver sustained earnings growth.", "Now I will briefly recap divisional results for the thirdquarter. Marmaxx comp sales decreased 1% in the third quarter, which was belowour plan. Despite being aggressive with markdowns, we maintained merchandisemargins that were virtually flat on top of strong margins last year. Segmentprofit was $309 million and segment profit margin, which was planned flat toslightly down versus last year's very strong performance, was 10.3%, which wasslightly below plan.", "Two factors impacted Marmaxx results. First, as I mentioned,warm weather hurt apparel sales particularly of cold weather apparel likeouterwear. Our cold weather categories, including outerwear, represented alarge portion of our sales loss to plan.", "Second, home was soft, which was an execution issue. We arevery focused on it and I can tell you that we are committed to fixing it. Inaddition to improving our mix, we have tested a new home prototype and are veryexcited with the results. We will start to roll out this new concept next year.", "On the positive side, categories that are not as weathersensitive did very well. Dresses posted a 22% comp increase on top ofdouble-digit comps last year. Accessories and shoes continue to be strong andour category initiative also performed very well, which I will talk about in amoment.", "At Winners and HomeSense in Canada,we saw exceptional execution across the organization. Comp sales increased 15%in US dollars and in local currency, which we believe better reflects ouroperating performance, comps increased 5%, which was above our plan. Segmentprofit was $68 million in line with plan. Segment profit margin declined 40basis points, but was adversely impacted by 210 basis points by themark-to-market adjustment for hedges that I mentioned earlier. Excluding thisadjustment, segment profit margin was up by a very strong 170 basis points,again reflecting strong merchandise margins and expense control.", "The impact of weather was also obvious in Canada.Overall apparel sales trailed the chain, particularly outerwear. As was thecase at Marmaxx, less weather-sensitive categories like shoes, jewelry,accessories and dresses were exceptionally strong. ", "Winners\u2019 home categories were very positive and ourHomeSense business continues to be exceptional and is making contributionshigher than we ever thought possible for this business. To sum up on Canada,we are very confident in our Canadian businesses and they are very well positionedfor a strong fourth quarter.", "In the UKand Ireland,T.K. Maxx continues to stand out and deliver tremendous performance. Third quartercomps increased 13% in US dollars. The local currency comp, which again webelieve better reflects our operating performance, increased by a strong 6%,which was above our plan and over an 11% increase last year. ", "Segment profit margin declined 70 basis points to 7%,primarily due to the impact of our new German business, which impacted T.K.Maxx by $5 million, or 90 basis points. Excluding Germany,profit was up 22% and segment profit margin improved 20 basis points. I was in Germanyrecently for the openings of our first stores there and I can tell you it wasvery exciting. It is still early, but we view Germanyas having great growth potential for our business, which I will elaborate on ina moment and we will keep you posted on our progress.", "Back in the US,HomeGoods had an outstanding quarter. This division continues to buck the trendof softness in the home industry, which really reinforces the resiliency of ouroff-price model. Comp sales increased by an above 4% over last year's 5%increase. Segment profit was $25 million, up 43% over last year and segmentprofit margin improved 150 basis points, well above plan. Further, we areseeing broad-based strength for strong comps across most categories. We arevery pleased with the continued momentum in HomeGoods as we head into theholidays.", "At A.J. Wright the warm weather really took its toll. A.J.Wright is heavily concentrated in the Northeast and Midwestand has a customer base that shops very close to need, more so than any otherdivision. However, as the weather turned cool, A.J. Wright's sales dramaticallygained momentum. Third quarter comps were flat, which was below plan; however,with excellent expense control and execution of our off-price model, A.J.Wright achieved a 30 basis point improvement in merchandise margin and a flatsegment profit on this flat comp.", "I want to reiterate that we are very committed to A.J.Wright's concept. We still have more to do on execution, but I believe that weare moving in the right direction as we are seeing strong comps in categoriesin which we have focused. Importantly, we are also seeing strong new storeperformance.", "Finally on our divisional performance, Bob's Stores' compsales decreased 2% and bottom line results were below plan and last year, withits store base totally in the Northeast and a mix that is heavily tiltedtowards cold weather categories. We did see sales come back when the weatherturned cooler and especially when the Red Sox won the World Series. As you haveheard me say previously, we need to see Bob's Stores deliver positive comps ontop of positive comps. Year-to-date comps are up 2% and the fourth quarter isoff to a very strong start.", "Before moving on, I would like to spend a moment on theconcern over the consumer because I don't think we can say this enough: ourvalue equation plays in all kinds of retail environments. While we are notimmune to everything, macro consumer pressures have not typically impacted ourbusiness as they do other retailers. In weak consumer environments, upper enddepartment store shoppers gravitate towards us and once they find us they staywith us, even when times get better because they love our values.", "If it is promotional out there, we navigate throughplentiful buying opportunities. In full-priced environments, in which I havenever seen a lack of product or opportunities, we may have to pay a littlemore, but we maintain our merchandise margins since we are operating in a lesspromotional environment. ", "It is all about execution and our values. When we executewell, the consistency of our performance is hard to find elsewhere in theindustry. In our 30-year history, comp sales have declined in only one year andwe have achieved comp sales increases during recessions. Make no mistake thatwe prefer a strong environment. The point is that in weaker times, we hold upand tend to do better than most.", "Now I would like to turn the discussion to our confidence inthe TJX business model. I talked about this on the second quarter call andthere are several points I want to reiterate again today. As you know, ourthree-year plan calls for 12% annual EPS growth. Of course, as a managementteam, we strive to surpass this and we have done a good job at this.", "Let's talk about what gives us the confidence in our abilityto continue to execute our growth model to drive profitable sales. I will beginby reviewing the reason for our confidence in driving comp sales as part of ourgrowth strategy and relate that to the third quarter. First is the execution ofour flexible, off-priced business model. The flexibility of our model allows usto buy opportunistically and make purchase decisions very close to need. Thisgives us a huge competitive advantage as we can constantly adjust to markettrends and customer demand.", "In the third quarter, I was happy with our flexibility andthe goods that we had in our stores, but unfortunately the weather did notcooperate. Our flexibility allowed us to take aggressive markdowns, maintainmerchandise margins and set us up for a strong fourth quarter.", "The second reason for our confidence is our many merchandiseinitiatives, which continued to deliver strong performance in the thirdquarter. The results at The Cube, our junior store within a store, wereexceptional in the third quarter and we plan to roll out 300-plus of thesedepartments at Marshall\u2019s nextyear. ", "Shoes were outstanding. We are on track to complete 200 plusshoe expansions at Marshall\u2019s thisyear and are planning another 200 next year. ", "Accessories also outperformed and The Runway at T.J. Maxxcontinues to be strong. We have several new initiatives showing positiveresults, which we will expand in fiscal 2009.", "The third piece of driving comps is our consistentlyimproving marketing. We launched our Shop On! campaign for Marshall\u2019s,which is resonating with the customers as is our Maxx Moments campaign at T.J.Maxx. At A.J. Wright, we have increased our investment in marketing and haveseveral tests underway, because I believe we still have a lot to learn in termsof reaching this customer.", "Company-wide, we have increased our marketing spend, whichwe are funding with cost reductions. We have become more sophisticated inanalyzing what is working and what is not working. Also, we are now utilizingtechnology more effectively and getting smarter about which vehicles work bestto reach our audience.", "Now I would like to spend a moment on driving profitablegrowth through selling square footage expansion. I want to strongly emphasizethis point: we are far from being a mature company. At our largest division,Marmaxx, we believe there is room to grow this chain by an additional 400stores, which is a bit more than we had previously believed. Beyond this, wehave opportunities and relocations into larger footprints, particularly withthe success of shoes in Marshall\u2019s.", "At HomeGoods, we have a strengthened infrastructure and haveseen consistent execution and performance, which gives us the confidence in ourability to add 300 stores over time. Also I have mentioned before that we aretesting a larger footprint, a 40,000 square foot box,which we believe may give us another avenue for potential growth.", "Internationally, within the UKand Ireland, weare expanding the footprint of stores to approximately 30,000 square feet as werelocate them from older, smaller boxes. Also next year, we are taking theHomeSense brand across the pond to the UK.", "We also have more opportunities to grow in Canadathrough expanding our existing chains and through new concepts that would playon our strengths. Beyond this, we see international expansion as a bigopportunity and while we will make some investment in the short term, we willinvest in what we believe will be right for the long term.", "Let me assure you that we are committed to building a strongfoundation and infrastructure before we accelerate growth and we will testthings before we roll them out. Ultimately, we believe that Germanywith its population of 82 million, will support 250 to 300 stores. We also seeopportunities to expand into other European countries longer term.", "Back in the US,we continue to view the A.J. Wright customer demographic as having tremendousgrowth potential for TJX. We believe that the UScould ultimately support 1,000 A.J.Wright stores, but if 500 stores is the right number to deliver strong returnsfor shareholders, we will do what is right for the company. Again, we will growprudently and we will reaccelerate growth only when we are confident that wehave the right model and the right business traction.", "Cost reduction is the next major piece of our strategy toachieve profitable growth and was a key part of our third quarter results. Aswe have discussed on prior calls, we have an SEVP and a cross-divisionaldedicated team focused on non-merchandise procurement, store operating costs,supply-chain, markdown optimization and a store-ready project.", "Some opportunities are short term. For example,non-merchandise procurement which is an area where we have already madeprogress, as well as our efforts at the division as we plan around a lowerexpense structure. Other opportunities are medium and long-term efforts thatwill require some process reengineering.", "Finally, on the reasons for our confidence in our growthstrategy, we continue with our no walls organizational approach, which has ledto many new ideas as we enter the fourth quarter. We continue to conduct globalmeetings and travel between divisions on a regular basis. Our knowledge sharingand open communication have led to new merchandise initiatives, leveraging ofbuys, as well as best practices and cost-cutting initiatives, to name just afew of the tangible ways the businesses are benefiting.", "Another great example of talent sharing across borders, weare currently relocating one of our head merchants from HomeSense in Canadato become the new head merchant of HomeSense in the UK.", "Moving on to our financial strength, we continue to generatesignificant amounts of cash from our strong operations in the third quarter. Weremain committed to our share buyback program as an excellent way to returnvalue to shareholders and in the third quarter, we purchased $300 million ofTJX stock, retiring 10.3 million shares. Year to date, we have spent a total of$650 million repurchasing TJX stock, retiring 22.7 million shares. It remainsour plan to repurchase $900 million of TJX stock in fiscal 2008.", "Now to guidance. Beginning with the fourth quarter guidance,we now expect earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of$0.58 to $0.60, which represents a 14% to 18% increase over $0.51 per share inthe prior year. Last year's fourth quarter results included a $0.01 per sharecharge related to the unauthorized computer intrusion. Excluding this charge,our estimated range for Q4 represents a 12% to 15% increase over prior year'sadjusted $0.52. This outlook is based on an estimated consolidated comparablestore sales growth of approximately 4%, with approximately 2 points due tocurrency, so it is not as aggressive as it appears.", "It is important to note that last year's fourth quarter wasvery strong with a 5% comp increase and we are being prudent as we plan againstit. That said, I should note that the month of November is off to a very strongstart with a solid lift in businesses as the weather has turned cooler.", "Now to full year guidance. We are now expecting fiscal year2008 earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $1.58 to$1.60. Excluding costs related to the intrusion reported in the first andsecond quarters of $0.28 per share, we expect earnings per share fromcontinuing operations in the range of $1.86 to $1.88. This represents a 14% to15% increase over the $1.63 per share from continuing operations in fiscal2007. These estimates are based on an estimated comp-store sales increase ofapproximately 4% for the full year. Jeff will provide more details on thisguidance in a moment.", "Summing up, let me recap the major reasons for ourconfidence in our strategy for growth. First, our value equation plays well inboth weak and strong environments and are our best defense and offense againstmacro trends. The beauty of our flexible off-price model is that it gives us somany tools to work with offensively to drive comps and defensively protect ourbottom line.", "Second, it is our confidence in our ability to drive compsthrough execution of our flexible off-price business model, our merchandisinginitiative and improving marketing. ", "Third, we have opportunities to expand selling squarefootage in new stores, new concepts, new geographies, as well as largerfootprints.", "Fourth, cost reduction continues to be a major focus areaand will be an ongoing process for us. ", "Fifth, we see our no-walls approach to the organizationalready benefiting us in many tangible ways and generating new ideas.", "I will conclude by saying not only have we executed wellthus far this year, but we are in a very strong position as we enter the fourthquarter. We have great inventory liquidity and I can tell you that the leveland quality of goods out there is amazing. Our emphasis on gift-giving hasserved us well in recent years and we have notched it up considerably thisyear.", "For one, we have new and more aggressive gift card programs,which we will be doing in every division for the first time this year. Ourmarketing strategy is positioned well to support our key initiatives and we arevery excited. I believe we are set up and poised and ready to go. ", "I look forward to updating you on our progress in the fourthquarter and beyond.", "Now I will turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeff Naylor", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everybody. Before I get intothe guidance, I thought I would provide some additional detail on the thirdquarter, particularly around currency. I think first regarding thismark-to-market adjustment that we talk about, it is a mark-to-market adjustmenton hedges that relate to our inventories. ", "These are routine hedges we enter into to lock inmerchandise margin whenever Winners or T.K. Maxx purchase goods from USsources. We have been doing really for as long as anyone can remember. When thehedges settle, there is a gain or a loss, but this gain or loss is offset inthe cost of the merchandise, so the hedge just really protects our margin.", "We have these mark-to-market adjustments every quarter, butin the past, they have never been close to the magnitude they have been thisquarter due to the surge in the Canadian dollar at the end of October. As Carolmentioned, this adjustment reverses in the fourth quarter and will positivelyimpact the fourth quarter and we've reflected that in the guidance.", "In terms of overall currency impact on the third quarter, itwas negative. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted the translation ofWinners and T.K. earnings into dollars by about $0.01; the negative impact ofthe mark-to-market adjustment was about $0.015 so that offset the favorabilitywe had from translation. We also picked up about three-quarters of a penny intax rate favorability, so between currency and the tax rate, the overall impacton earnings and earnings per share from these non-operating items wasessentially neutral.", "Let me now turn to the guidance. For the fourth quarter offiscal 2008, as Carol mentioned, we raised our expected range for earnings pershare from continuing operations to $0.58 to $0.60 and that represents a 14% to18% increase over the $0.51 per share that we reported in the prior year. Theincrease in guidance primarily reflects the positive impact of reversing thismark-to-market adjustment, which I described earlier, so it's currency-related.", "Prior year's results included a $0.01 per share chargerelated to the computer intrusion. Excluding that charge, on a comparablebasis, our guidance represents a 12% to 15% increase over last year's adjusted$0.52. In terms of some of the underlying mechanics, we are assuming a fourth quartertop line of approximately $5.5 billion with a comp sales increase of about 4%on a consolidated basis, which includes roughly 2% benefit from foreigncurrency and also contemplates a 2% comp sales increase at Marmaxx.", "As to monthly comps on a consolidated basis, we expect compsales increases of approximately 5% in November, 3% to 4% in December and about4% in January. For Marmaxx, we are planning on comp sale increases in the rangeof 2% to 3% in November, approximately 2% in December and about 2% in January.", "Pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 7.8% to 8% range.That is up 20 to 40 basis points over the prior year, excluding the intrusioncharge that we took last year, so again on a comparable basis. Our fourth quarterpretax margin guidance, I should also note, reflects a 10 basis point hitattributable to the T.K. Maxx Germanybusiness.", "Pretax income is planned in the range of $428 million to$442 million. That is up 11% to 15% over prior year, again excluding theintrusion charge from the prior year results. We are anticipating fourth quartergross margin in the range of 23.2% to 23.3%. That is up 20 to 30 basis pointsover last year and SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 15.3% to15.4%, which is 10 to 20 basis points favorable to last year.", "For modeling purposes, we are planning a tax rate of 38.4%and weighted average outstanding shares of 459 million. I should note that thetax rate is negatively impacting EPS growth by approximately 4 percentagepoints because last year's rate included some favorable nonrecurringadjustments. This tax rate, the negative impact basically offset the favorablebenefit we are expecting from currency in the quarter, so again, the non-operatingitems essentially net each other out in the fourth quarter guidance.", "To keep the call on schedule, we ask that you please limityour questions to one per person. Thank you and we will now open it up forquestions.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Kimberly Greenberger \u2013Citigroup.", "KimberlyGreenberger  - Citigroup", "Very nice way to manage through the third quarter. Carol, ifyou could comment on traffic versus ticket that you are seeing out there? If itis varied by brand that would be helpful. What is your view on those metrics aswe go through the fourth quarter?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Our traffic was slightly down and our average basket wasslightly up, but again, I will tell you that when we did see a change in theweather pattern, the traffic started to increase. We hope to see that continueinto the fourth quarter.", "KimberlyGreenberger  - Citigroup", " So is there any wayyou could attribute a percent or two of your traffic to weather or have youdone that kind of analysis on it?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We don't analyze it by weather, but I can tell you that as Isaid in the speech, that a very large portion of the A.J. Wright business andthe Marmaxx business was attributed to the cold weather categories being a bigchunk of the sales mix.", "KimberlyGreenberger  - Citigroup", "Lastly on Bob's, it has had one good quarter this year, twosort of mediocre quarters. Can you just talk about what kind of leash Bob's ison at this point?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I said that at the end of the year we would talk to Bob'sand again, we are looking for comp over comp. Business really opened up to themin the beginning of the fourth quarter as we saw the weather change, but we aregoing to definitely get back to everybody probably at the end of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Randy Konik \u2013 Bear Stearns.", "Randy Konik  - Bear Stearns", "A question on the cost side of the equation. You talkedabout the third quarter costs were reigned in. Can you just talk about whatcosts were most reigned in, in the quarter? If you think about your costreduction programs across the corporation and by division, just let us know howfar along are we from an inning perspective in each division?", "Finally, can we just get a little clarity on what is drivingthe variability in the general corporate expense? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", " I will start and thenI am going to hand it over to Jeff. Obviously, our merchandise margins werepretty strong but in terms of the total cost reduction, the innings continue.It is a long process. It is probably a three-year process of which we areseeing some benefit already. Part of that benefit is baked into our plan. Partof it isn't. It has also helped us pay for some of the additional advertisingcosts, which we think absolutely drive our business. So again, it is anongoing, long-term process.", "The short-term piece is more on the non-merchandiseprocurement side, which we will see benefits earlier; supply chain and some ofthe other things I mentioned we will see a little bit longer term.", "Jeff Naylor", " Maybe I will broadenthe question a little bit because, as Carol mentioned, we had 20 basis pointsof SG&A improvement and we had a 20 basis point decline in our gross profitmargin and that was on a 3 comp. I'd point out that 2 points of the comp camefrom currency. Typically, you don't leverage on currency because currencyinflates the top line, but it also inflates your expenses. So in terms of thinkingabout the leverage in the model, you would really think of it as more of a 1 comp.", "Now if I break those elements down, so SG&A, we had 20basis points of leverage on a 1 comp, which we are very pleased with. That isactually even stronger when you look at advertising. Advertising delevered by10 basis points, so we basically had 30 basis points of SG&A leverage on a 1comp and we took 10 of that and we reinvested it in advertising. So that wouldexplain the SG&A.", "In terms of our gross profit margin, we had a 20 basis pointimprovement in merchandise margin. This hedge that I talked about, themark-to-market, hit us about 30 basis points and then we had slight deleverageon our buying and occupancy costs of about 10 basis points. So that is sort ofpeeling back the onion underneath the gross profit margin.", "In terms of individual categories, I would say it is reallyspread out across a lot of categories. We are seeing some particular savings ininsurance, we have seen some nice savings there. We have seen some savings, asCarol mentioned, in non-merchandise procurement. We are starting to see some ofthat flow through the P&L and we are seeing good solid cost management fromour divisions as the COOs and directors of stores in those organizations havereally focused on costs and made it a priority. So that has led to a lot ofsmall savings across a lot of different categories. It is really across theboard and pretty widespread in where we are getting the benefit.", "In terms of corporate, the variability year over year, lastyear we had a contribution to the TJX Foundation of approximately $10 million,so that drives some favorability year over year. I would tell you that thisyear we have had a number of items similar to that that would in essenceneutralize the impact that has on the comparability. In particular, we havemade some investments in computer security that have added costs this year thatweren't in the base last year, and those combined with some other items havemore or less offset the benefit we are getting from not having the contributionrepeat this year.", "Randy Konik  - Bear Stearns", "Would you expect the general corporate expense to remainabout flattish going forward to model it? Would you expect to just continue toleverage SG&A on a 1% comp going into the future into '08?", "Jeff Naylor", " I think right now wefeel comfortable that SG&A leverage point for Marmaxx is 2.5% and we feelcomfortable overall for the company in that 2.5% range is where we canleverage. Now obviously, as Carol mentioned, we are doing everything we can todrive a higher level of cost reduction to lower the leverage point even furtherand build margin at that 2.5 points. But I think right now that is based oneverything we know and there is a lot we don't, but based on everything we know,that is where we feel comfortable.", "In terms of the corporate expense, our guidance in thefourth quarter, let me just quickly look at that. The guidance in the fourthquarter is about flat year-over-year, slightly up. I'd think of that as aninflationary increase year over year as you model it out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Black \u2013 Lehman Brothers.", "Jeff Black  - Lehman Brothers", "I had a question for you on A.J. Wright. It is the firsttime we have heard you talk about 500 stores versus 1,000. I don't know if thatis a goal that's set in concrete, but what should we look for there? I mean wehaven't seen profit. When do you think we would see an operating profit out ofthis business and when do you think we would start to grow this? Can you talkabout the new stores? You said those are performing better. What overall givesyou confidence that we get this A.J. Wright division on better footing as agrowth vehicle longer term? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Jeff, I am going to say stay tuned to the fourth quarter. Wehave been working really hard at A.J. Wright and we have had many customerfocus groups. We have been testing a lot of marketing ideas. Actually in thethird quarter we did put additional money into marketing I think to the tune ofabout $800,000. We have a lot of tests underway.", "We are really starting to see progress in the categoriesthat we are focusing on, be it shoes, the kids business. We saw a fairlysubstantial change in home the last three weeks after we did our focus groupsand started to work on these initiatives and change them.", "The new stores are performing pretty well, which gives us alot of positive feelings about going forward and understanding where thesestores need to be. As I said, highly ethnic areas, highly mixed. We are very,very focused. When we have our campaign, the Real Deal, this is a very pricesensitive customer and very close to need. ", "I think we are getting our arms around this business. Ithink again, in the beginning of last quarter, I started to talk to that and Ithink we are seeing better results now and I think we will start to see verypositive results going forward.", "Jeff Black  - Lehman Brothers", " Any thoughts on whatkind of margin this business can deliver if the new stores worked in the areasyou are talking about?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well long term, we are looking at about an 8% business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dana Cohen \u2013 Banc of AmericaSecurities.", "Dana Cohen  - Banc of America Securities", "Jeff, you went through so many numbers, just aclarification. You said something about marketing offsetting some of theSG&A and then something about a charity contribution last year. Could youjust clarify that quickly?", "Jeff Naylor", " Yes, I will gothrough it slowly. We had a 10 basis point improvement in our pretax margin.Let me just walk through some elements. In terms of the gross profit margin, acomponent of that, we had merchandise margins improved 20 basis points yearover year. We had a 30 basis point negative impact from the mark-to-marketadjustment on the hedge that I described. We had 10 basis points of deleverageon buying and occupancy, again on a comp currency of 1%, levered by 20 basispoints. ", "We had a 10 basis point increase in advertising expense thatgets baked in there. So if you back that out, everything else was 30 basispoints better, if you will, in the SG&A line. So 20 basis points ofimprovement in SG&A.", "Dana Cohen  - Banc of America Securities", " Despite advertising?", "Jeff Naylor", "-- advertising. And then interest and corporate expensebetween them were worth 10.", "Dana Cohen  - Banc of America Securities", "What was the impact to T.K. specifically for the hedge?", "Jeff Naylor", "There was actually no impact at T.K. It was really primarilyan issue with Winners because of the run-up in the Canadian dollar. In the lasttwo weeks, the Canadian dollar went from mid-90s to almost 1.06. As that ranup, two things happened. One is we have losses in the underlying hedges but wealso have cheaper goods that we are buying because they are using a highervalue Canadian dollars to pay for US goods. So it all offsets itself in theinventory.", "Dana Cohen  - Banc of America Securities", " It's just a timingissue?", "Jeff Naylor", " It's just a timingissue and it will reverse in the fourth quarter. There is no impact to T.K., itis just very modest. In the case of Winners, it is about a 210 basis pointimpact.", "Dana Cohen  - Banc of America Securities", "So the impact on T.K. was really the 90 from Germany?", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes. With T.K. we had 90 from Germany.Excluding that, it was a 20 basis point improvement.", "Dana Cohen  - Banc of America Securities", "Carol on the environment, there is always a lot of goods. Soon a scale of one to 10, where are we right now in terms of availability? It isjust I had never heard you guys say there are no goods, so on a relative scale?", "Ernie Herrman", "I would say given the whole weather pattern that most of thecountry experienced, it is on the higher end of availability. How's that, withoutputting a number on it? So more than we typically see and I think Carol haseven mentioned before how one of my biggest challenges is controlling theliquidity situation so we were able to do that through the third quarter, justrealizing what we were up against with this weather and there just continues tobe just a lot of goods and to answer your question, more than in the past.", "Carol Meyrowitz", " Dana, moreimportantly, Ernie really strategically ramps his inventories down at the endof the third quarter to really take advantage of it.  I think they have done a fabulous job inmanaging that and again, I said they are really poised to go forward in thefourth quarter.", "Dana Cohen  - Banc of America Securities", "We are waiting because there is probably going to be moretomorrow than there is today?", "Ernie Herrman", "That is correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard CapitalMarkets.", "Todd Slater  - Lazard Capital Markets", "You guys are really knocking the cover off the ball domestically.As you invest in your German platform, can you just talk a little bit aboutproduct sourcing for Europe? You're going to have I amsure accelerated product needs as you continue to grow that store base. Justgive a sense of what the market challenges and opportunities are there and howthat compares to the USin terms of sourcing product for those businesses and even as you expand thehome business across the pond, as you said?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Germanyis presently driven, a large percentage of German product and we believe thatwe are more than able to get our hands on 200 to 300 stores worth in thefuture. So we are seeing a very, very positive response to this product that isspecifically bought out of Germany.", "Product categories like home, the UKproduct is doing very well and the product from the States is doing well, so itreally does differ by category. But we are feeling very positive about beingable to source what we need for the German customer predominantly out of Germanyand again, we have had such a terrific response.", "We are seeing some things. Apparel is very, very strong. Theshoe business is very, very strong. The outerwear business is a much higherpercent than it is in the UK.So we are clearly seeing some signals and some real clarity in terms of thecategory. But we feel pretty good about the sourcing and we have got severalpeople on the ground. We have a buying office in Germany,so I think we are in a really good position there.", "Todd Slater  - Lazard Capital Markets", "Carol, you talked about some new merchandising ideas for thefourth quarter. Are these new relative to what we already know about? Are yousurprised? Care to share anything there on what those might be?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "You will see some new categories, just shop our stores. Wehave elevated our gift giving to a more luxury level. I'd say we have reallyraised the bar. Our shoe initiative is just phenomenal and the guys have reallystrategized how to flow that through the fourth quarter. Last year, we did notflow shoes that dramatically in December and we will this year.", "Our gift card program, we have ramped up and if you walk inour stores this holiday, I think you'll be really surprised at some of thethings that you are going to see. So we are pretty excited. You will see a lotof new things and you will see a lot of ramping up of some of the things thatwe have already tested and are working.", "Todd Slater  - Lazard Capital Markets", " So the availabilityof product you are seeing out there has also included or increasingly includedthe luxury category?", "Carol Meyrowitz", " Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Tunick \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It is hard to pick at anything, but we were just curiousabout your views of why HomeGoods is doing so well and why home at Marmaxxcontinues to be weak? How long do you think we should start to see some of yourchanges happen there? ", "A second question on how we should think about the marketingbudget plans for next year versus this year and talk a little about how theloyalty credit card launch has gone so far? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", " I am going to startwith the marketing and the loyalty and then I will get back to HomeGoods. Ithink marketing in the fourth quarter we are probably going to again plan for thebusiness to equal sales between that 9% and 10% range. I think for next year, Ithink I mentioned John Gilbert has been on board for a while. We areunderstanding some places where we probably didn't need to spend money andplaces where we can do a better job and be more focused. ", "I really don't think our marketing budgets will have thekind of increase that they have this year. They will probably be slightly up,but again, I think we can do a better job with that next year. So we arelearning a lot. We are pretty excited about that.", "In terms of our credit program, our private label program,we have a soft launch going on right now. We are offering the in-store credit,instant credit in stores in a test mode. We are very happy with the resultsthat we are seeing and I'm going to talk more to that probably at year end andgive you a real view of what that can mean to us because I think it can mean alot to next year. So we are in test mode right now.", "As far as HomeGoods goes, , again, it is what we are allabout. I can say it 100 times. It is execution, it's excitement. It is nothaving last year fever; it is about risk taking and they have done a terrificjob.", "Marmaxx we believe is a fix. It is very fixable. I am goingto have Ernie talk to that in a moment, but I think it just comes right back toexecution and we know that when we focus on something, we know how to fix it.", "Ernie Herrman", "I would say, Brian, that the focus in Marmaxx home right nowis on, and Carol alluded to it a little there, lack of newness. So what wedidn't have and I won't get into the specifics on the categories, but innumerous categories, we looked too much like last year or like we did three tosix months prior to that and it is just not the way we like to run our home business.So HomeGoods I think did a much better job on that end and it really is whatCarol is saying, execution on our part. ", "I think if you look a few months out, I think you had asked,when do you think it is going to be better? I would say 60, 90 days I think weare going to see some turnaround here, but affecting that business is a littledifferent because some of that business is a little further out. Newness isreally what we are going to attack and I think that is where we stubbed our toeon execution.", "Carol Meyrowitz", " Brian, in addition tothat, we have tested a new home prototype that we have in a few stores and weare seeing very positive results. Ernie has given me a plan that looks veryimpressive on rolling that out for next year. We are pretty excited about thatand the turns are a lot faster than they are in the other stores. So that saysa lot also.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Morris \u2013 Wachovia CapitalMarkets.", "John Morris  - Wachovia Capital Markets", "A little bit more color on the marketing. Carol, you talkedabout marketing at A.J. Wright, so I'm curious to know a little bit more colorthere. If you step back and you look at it, you started to allude to it in yourprevious response, but what have you learned so far by the marketing that youhave seen that you're going to change for next year? In other words, you talkedabout John Gilbert and team probably looking to spend more efficiently or in alittle bit different places. So if you can kind of elaborate there. Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", " John, I will try toanswer that but I really don't like to talk about our marketing strategy. Ireally can't go into detail. When I talk about what works and what doesn'twork, there are places where we have spent a fair amount of money on directmail where today we realize we may not be getting the response. There are otherthings that we have focused on in terms of our initiatives that are workingvery well, so that gives you a little bit of places where we see some shift.", "We also have a couple of things up our sleeve that I reallydon't want to talk about, but they are very, very exciting in terms ofinteraction between the customers and so we are quietly experimenting on somethings that could be really exciting going forward.", "In terms of A.J. Wright, we just started really some testsat the end of October and we are reading those results and we are seeing somevery positive things from it. The Real Deal is our concept at A.J. Wright andit is definitely resonating with the consumer and this customer, so we sort ofhave our arms around a key focus and now we are going to build on that campaign.We understand, again, I will come back to how important price is and time ofneed and this campaign is going to be based around that for that customer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Jaffe \u2013 StifelNicolaus.", "Richard Jaffe  - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks very much, guys and my congratulations as well. Pullingout a strong quarter out of a tough, tough environment. If you could just commenton cost savings, what you've achieved this quarter and its sustainability, howmuch of it is in response to a tough market? Is it really a one quarter sort ofsavings? How much of it could we look forward to continuing through fourthquarter and through 2008?", "Carol Meyrowitz", " Richard, in terms ofour cost reductions this is a pretty big, long-term project, so it is not justgoing to be a quarter and as I said, we are just starting our non-merchandiseprocurement. We will actually be looking for a chief procurement officer. Todaywe are a bit siloed in how we spend our dollars, so we see a fairly substantialopportunity there to leverage across all of the divisions. As I said to you,some of the other projects we're working on are a little bit more long term,but what is happening is the divisions are meeting together and all theoperators, they are working on things such as even just store cleaning, verysimple things, but big savings. ", "So this is going to be an ongoing process. It is under anSEVP; that is how important it is to our business. Jeff, do you want tocomment?", "Jeff Naylor", "Year to date, we have driven 20 basis points of improvementon a 3% comp, so we are encouraged by that and then last year, we also had a 20basis point improvement. As we look forward, Richard, we have planned Marmaxxflat on a 2.5% comp for them to really hold the margins. When I say flat, theirsegment margins. For them to hold that margin flat on a 2.5% comp, they reallyhave to generate $25 million, $30 million in cost savings.", "So there are some cost savings already implied in our modeland what we hope to do with all the projects, the cost-savings projects that wediscuss, as well as the focus of the people at the divisions, which frankly iswhere we are getting a lot of the savings today, we would hope to be able to dobetter than what we have in the model. But 20 basis points two years ago, 20basis points this year and our hope is that we can continue to keep it going. ", "But going forward, it gets harder because we do have toidentify ways to go after some of the more structural costs. There are fewerquick hits and low-hanging fruit.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Stein \u2013 KeyBanc CapitalMarkets.", "Jeff Stein  - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Carol, I am wondering if you could differentiate for us thedifference between the customer at HomeGoods and the home customer at Marmaxx?I am wondering with your no walls approach, don't these divisions talk to eachother a little bit and I would think that by now perhaps they could share someof the benefits with the successes you are seeing at HomeGoods and maybe seethe results a little bit sooner rather than later?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Jeff, right on. Actually, we have made quite a few changesin home in Marmaxx and they are basically living together right now. TheHomeGoods group and the Marmaxx group, as well as HomeSense. So talk aboutleveraging. Winners and HomeSense are helping Marmaxx with home and Marmaxx isreally helping Winners with men\u2019s. They are spending a lot of time together. Ido think that we will see the benefit of this fairly quickly. ", "Winners has also I think done a very good job ofdifferentiating HomeSense from Winners home and I think again, Marmaxx willleverage that knowledge. So it is a great question and the answer is yes and itis presently being done.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Patrick McKeever \u2013 MKMPartners.", "Patrick McKeever  - MKM Partners", "A question about the overall apparel industry right now. Is thereany concern that it is just so bad out there in the apparel space and there isso much inventory and whatnot that the promotional environment could be veryintense over the holidays and maybe offset some of the incremental buyingopportunities that you are seeing?", "Carol Meyrowitz", " Ernie, do you want totalk to that?", "Ernie Herrman", " Patrick, goodquestion. I think it is why we very strategically and consciously wait laterand later each year and in this environment, we specifically went back intoOctober and September knowing that there was going to be more goods, we havebeen holding off later and later so that we buy the goods accordingly and thatwe keep our gap in terms of value between us and the other stores out there,because that is really the critical issue. The customer has no reason to cometo us unless we show a significant value relative to the other retailers outthere. So a great question. We are staying very cognizant of that situation andwe are buying later because of it.", "Patrick McKeever  - MKM Partners", " How late can you buymerchandise for the holidays?", "Ernie Herrman", " I mean we are buyingas we speak, so we have been buying all the way through and with our DCs, wehave a very flexible situation. We can also ship the goods the way we need toship the goods.  I would say we arebuying later than ever before. We will be buying into really late November,beginning of December.", "Carol Meyrowitz", " Note that we havedone a week before Christmas and we have actually been able to get them inbecause we can feed it through very quickly at the end.", "Patrick McKeever  - MKM Partners", "Are you buying any more merchandise these days, let's saythis year versus last year, directly from the department stores and specialtyretailers? ", "Carol Meyrowitz", " Pretty much the sameI would say.", "Patrick McKeever  - MKM Partners", " Same as usual?", "Ernie Herrman", "Same, maybe a little bit more, same to a little bit more Iwould say; kind of with everything else.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Keller \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities.", "William Keller  - FTN MidwestSecurities", "Coming back to the foreign exchange and looking at theimpact on the cash flow statement. It seems to be more negative this quarterthan previously. Is that related to the mark-to-market? Thank you.", "Jeff Naylor", "Can you maybe expand a little bit on that, because I am notseeing it on the cash flow statement?", "William Keller  - FTN MidwestSecurities", "Cash flow from foreign exchange. I know it's a year-to-datenumber.", "Jeff Naylor", "On cash was $2 million positive this year and it was $7million positive last year, so it's not really a big swing year over year. Thebigger thing as we look at the cash flow statement is that we have a strongincrease in cash from operating activities that is a function largely of lowerinventories year over year because we have done a great job. Inventories, lastyear, we had $470 million of net cash outflows. This year, it is $310 millionin terms of the change in those inventory balances. So that has been asignificant contributor to cash, the fact we have lower inventories. ", "We have taken that favorability or that higher cash, some ofit has gone into CapEx and then of course in the cash flow statement, you cansee we have a higher buyback than we did in the past and that was all planned,so I think an opportunity to buy our stock at prices that we consider to bepretty favorable.", "William Keller  - FTN MidwestSecurities", "Not to beat a dead horse, but understood that cash flow fromforeign exchange is not that different year-to-date, but looking at the changefrom the end of the second order this year versus the end of the third quarterthis year, that is the difference that I was referring to.", "Jeff Naylor", "We will have to look into that and get back to you. Itshould not be a significant item on our cash flow statement though, relative tothose larger components that I just discussed. So maybe we can just follow upwith you offline on that if that's all right.", "", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey AdvisoryGroup.", "Dana Telsey  - Telsey Advisory Group", " Good afternoon,everyone and congratulations. Can you talk a little bit about Runway at Maxx,The Cube, some of the other departments that you have been working with latelyand what you're seeing there? ", "Jeff, can you just talk about your thoughts on operatingmargins by division in terms of this year, if they have changed at all in termsof what you are looking for? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", " Dana, first of all,the results on The Cube are very strong. I think we are probably going to berolling out 300 plus next year. Runway, we love The Runway, but we love TheRunway more because it is opening doors and we are tending to spread again thatnext level of specialness to our stores. Our plans are not to expand TheRunway, our plans are to really continue buying for it and then spreading someof those categories. ", "As we see fit, such as in Winners, we are expanding a fewstores and T.K. is probably going to test a version of it going forward.", "Shoes have been exceptional. We rolled out over 200 thisyear. We are going to continue next year to roll out another 200 and we havesome other things up our sleeves for next year that again we will talk about aswe get into the year end and start talking about next year.", "Jeff Naylor", "Dana, in terms of the operating margin, you are referring tothe operating margin potential of the business?", "Dana Telsey  - Telsey Advisory Group", " The divisions,because at the beginning of the year you gave out your thoughts on what youthought the operating margin targets would be for this year. Any differences tothat given that we are nine months through the year?", "Also, yes, an operating margin target potential if there areany adjustments?", "Jeff Naylor", "If you look at the trend last year, the pre-tax marginimproved 80 basis points from 6.4% to 7.2%. This year, Q4 implies full-yearguidance of 7.5% to 7.6%. So we are looking to 30 to 40 basis points ofimprovement this year. A piece of that, a smaller piece is gross profit. Mostof it we are getting in SG&A through some of the cost reduction focuses andinitiatives that we have.", "As we look by business, Marmaxx this year we have at 9.5%.That is up 10 basis points over last year on a 1% comp, so we are seeing greatexpense controls at Marmaxx. We have always said Marmaxx we saw as a 9% to 10%potential business, but over the last several years, we have seen that marginimprove. So I think as we plan it going forward, we are going to plan it at a2.5% comp and a flat segment profit margin and then hope to beat that througheither higher comp or through improvements in cost and cost reduction.", "Winners this year we have at 10.5% against 10.4% last year,so we are seeing improvement at Winners. That business we see as a 10% to 11%business. That remains unchanged, Dana. ", "T.K. this year, excluding Germany,we have got it at 6.1% to 6.2%. We continue to see T.K. as having the potentialto deliver 8% as it gets closer to its full complement of stores.", "HomeGoods, huge progress over the last year. Last year, wewent from 2.5% to 4.5% segment margins. This year, we have it pegged at 5.2%,so we have seen a 70 basis point lift and again, HomeGoods is barely halfway toits full store potential, so with the leverage of additional units, we can seethat business getting to 8%.", "A.J., that business is just slightly below breakeven iswhere we have it currently forecast for the year. As Carol mentioned, that is abusiness that we could see getting as high as 8%. The key there is really twothings. One is getting the store contribution margin up about 100 to 200 basispoints over where they are now, which we think is very achievable with theright mix driving comp. Once we have got that model correct, then we will startrolling out stores, which is where we really start getting the leverage andmoving towards that 8%. So that is just kind of a little snapshot business bybusiness.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you, everyone. We look forward to reporting our fourthquarter and year end.

Welcome to The TJX Companies\u2019 fourth quarter and year-end financial results conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. At that time if you have a question you will need to press *1. ", "As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Wednesday, February 20th, 2008.", "I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, President and CEO for The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, Ma\u2019am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you. Good morning. Before I begin Sherry has a statement to make.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements (inaudible) that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company\u2019s plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings, including without limitation the Form 10K filed March 28th, 2007, and Form 10Q filed August 24th, 2007.

The numbers we discuss today are from continuing operations. ", "Thank you, and now I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Good morning. Joining me on the call today are Jeff Naylor, Trip Tripathy, Ernie Herrman, and Sherry Lang. Trip will be handling the financial questions today.", "So let me begin by saying that we did extremely well in 2007 and I am very proud of our performance. I believe the strategies we put in place yielded strong results in a challenging retail environment. Having said that, we believe our strong execution would have lead to even stronger results in a more robust environment. ", "Our adjusted pre-tax profit margin, excluding the intrusion charges, was the highest we have achieved in six years and the highest of all but two years in the company\u2019s history. Merchandise margins were extremely strong and drove virtually all of the adjusted profit margin improvement. ", "With solid expense control we maintained slack SG&A on a consolidated cost that, excluding two percentage points of foreign currency exchange rates, was up 2%.Further, we achieved a flat SG&A despite our planned increase in marketing investment and certain one-time items. All of this leads to our delivering a 17% increase in ETS on an adjusted basis over a very strong increase in the prior year. ", "We achieved these results by keeping to our very focused goal of driving profitable sales. Driving profitable sales has been, is, and will continue to be our number one goal and our mantra. I want to make sure that everyone understands that, while we have a wonderful business model that helps us to combat a weak retail environment, we know that at the end of the day it\u2019s about driving sales. ", "People ask us all the time about how we change our strategies to address the weak environment. The answer is simple: we don\u2019t. We stay focused on executing the fundamentals of our off-price business model, which is one of the most flexible business models in the world. ", "The greatest risk to our success would be our missing on execution. In over 30 years we have seen only one comp decline and have posted comp sales increases even during recession. I want to be clear on something, however: while we can hold our own and do better than most in tough environments we always prefer and we indeed do better when the consumer is strong.", "Our strong performance in 2007 was all about our persistent pursuit of our fundamentals. We were extremely disciplined in managing our inventories, which gave us the flexibility to chase market opportunities and slow great brands to our stores. At the same time, we took intelligent risks, we tested new ideas and new initiatives. We also improved our marketing and I still believe we have more opportunity. Further, we remain focused on expense control, which supported our increased marketing investment and the improved the bottom line.", "Looking ahead, we view ourselves as a global off-price value company with tremendous growth opportunities I will discuss later on in the call.", "Now to recap the consolidated numbers on a continuing operations basis beginning with the full year. Consolidated net sales for the 52-week fiscal year increased to $18.6 billion, 17% above last year\u2019s $17.4 billion. Consolidated comp store sales for the full year increased by 4%, which was above planned and over a 4% increase last year. As I mentioned, foreign currency exchange rates benefitted comp sales by two percentage points.", "Full year diluted EPS was $1.66 compared with $1.63 on a reported basis last year, a 2% increase. Results were negatively impacted by charges from the previously announced computer intrusion, which totalled $119 million after tax or $0.25 per share this year and $3 million after tax last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding these charges from the respective periods, fully diluted EPS was $1.91, up 17% over last year.", "Our overall pre-tax profit margin for the year was down 50 basis points to 6.7% and excluding the intrusion charges was up 50 basis points to 7.7%, driven primarily by merchandise margin improvement.", "Now to recap fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter we achieved a 23% adjusted EPS increase, including the intrusion charges, again over a very solid prior year result. We have seen fourth quarter results grow significantly over the last three years on a comparable adjusted basis demonstrating our ability to deliver sustained earnings growth.", "Fourth quarter consolidated net sales increased to $5.5 billion or 8% above last year. Consolidated comp store sales increased 4% over a 5% increase last year. Foreign currency exchange rates benefitted comp sales by two percentage points, which is what we had expected.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.66, a 29% increase over $0.51 per share last year on a reported basis and above our expectation. This year\u2019s fourth quarter includes the benefit of $0.02 per share from a reduction of the intrusion reserve compared to a $0.01 per share charge last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding the intrusion numbers from both periods, EPS was up 23% to $0.64, over $0.52 per share the prior year. ", "On adjusted consolidated pre-tax profit margin, excluding intrusion charges, improved 100 basis points to 8.5% due to 130 basis points of merchandise margin expansion, partially offset by 50 basis points of SG&A deleverage. I should mention that SG&A would have been flat were it not for our planned investment in marketing and several other items that Trip will discuss later.", "In terms of inventory, at the end of the fourth quarter consolidated inventory on a per store basis were up 2%. Excluding foreign exchange rates, inventories were essentially flat on the same basis. We have fewer dollars committed forward than at this time last year on a per store basis, including the warehouses, stores, and merchandise on order. We exited the quarter with very clean inventory and we are well positioned to take advantage of a marketplace with many opportunities.", "Now I will recap divisional results. For the full year Marmaxx comp sales increased 1%, which was slightly below our plan. Segment profit was up 7% to $1.2 billion. Segment profit margin, which we had planned flat to last year, improved 30 basis points to 9.7%. ", "We hear a lot of discussion out there about when Marmaxx will return to historically peak operating levels. In 2007, segment profit margin at Marmaxx was at its highest in six years. Marmaxx achieving this growth on a 1% comp reinforces the power of our off-price model. ", "Our discipline and sharp execution lead to a 40 basis point expansion in merchandise margin in a difficult environment. We\u2019re aggressive in pursuing hot categories, shifting purchase dollars from one category\u2019s bucket to another to take advantage of opportunities and mitigate mark-down risks. A great example are dresses, which comped up 36% in 2007 over double-digit increases last year. In addition, shoes and accessories were well funded.", "In the fourth quarter Marmaxx comp sales increased 1%, which was slightly below planned. Despite this, segment profit was $324 million, up 13% over the prior year. Segment profit margin was well above plan, increasing 70 basis points to 9.5% driven by significant merchandise margin expansion.", "Again in the fourth quarter Marmaxx took a strategic approach to categories and we saw dresses, shoes, and accessories outperform. Merchandise margins improved significantly, growing 80 basis points over last year. ", "We have a plan in place to improve Home, which struggled in 2007. As we have discussed on prior calls, we believe this is an executionist issue and we are addressing it. Also tested a new prototype for Marmaxx Home and we expect to see Home improve in the first half with more opportunity in the back half of the year. ", "At Winners and HomeSense in Canada excellent execution lead to another year of outstanding performance in 2007. The full year comp sales increased 14% in US dollars. In local currency, which we believe better reflects our operating performance, comps increased by a strong 5%, well above plan, and over a 5% increase last year. Segment profit was $235 million, which was above plan. Segment profit margin increased 110 basis points. ", "For the fourth quarter comp sales at Winners and HomeSense increased 23% in US dollars and in local currency increased by a strong 5% above our plan and over an 8% increase last year. Segment profit was $92 million, well above plan. Segment profit margin was 14.9%, up 450 basis points over the prior year, 290 basis points of which was due to the inventory related hedges referred to in today\u2019s press release.", "Disciplined execution of our off-price strategies lead the day at Winners. This division maintains a constant flow of freshness and excitement to our stores even with the negative impact of weather we saw in Canada during much of the year. Further, HomeSense is now an established national brand in Canada and we are very pleased with its strong top-line and bottom-line contributions in 2007 and the fourth quarter.", "In Europe T.K. Maxx also delivered excellent results in 2007. For the full year comps increased 14% in US dollars. In local currency, which again we believe better reflects our operating performance, comps increased an above-planned 6% over a 9% increase last year. Segment profit increased 16% and segment profit margin was 5.7%. Excluding Germany, segment profit was up 27% and segment profit margin increased 40 basis points to 6.3%. ", "For the fourth quarter comps increased 9% in US dollars and by a strong 5% in local currency, which was above our plan and over 10% increase last year. Segment profit margin increased 50 basis points to 9.2%, including our investment in Germany, which negatively impacted segment profit margin by 100 basis points. Excluding Germany, segment profit was up 33% and segment profit margin increased to 10.2%. ", "T. K. Maxx continues to deliver remarkable results in the face of a challenging market in the UK and Ireland. I\u2019ll say it again, it\u2019s about execution. This division did a terrific job of flowing great brands and the right fashions to our stores, creating excitement for our customers every day. It is terrific to see T. K. Maxx now as a recognized brand in the UK and Ireland and a destination for European shoppers. ", "We are very pleased with how T. K. Maxx is doing in Germany. Launched last fall with our first five stores, our off-price concept has been very positively received by the German consumer. While it is still very early and we will go slow, adding five stores in 2008, we believe that Germany with its population of 82 million holds great long-term growth potential for our business.", "Back in the US, HomeGoods delivered very healthy results in 2007. For the full year comp sales increased 3%, which was in line with our planned range, and over 4% increase last year. Segment profit was $76 million, up 25% over last year, and segment profit margin improved 60 basis points. ", "HomeGoods comp sales for the fourth quarter were flat with last year\u2019s 5% increase. Segment profit was $32 million and segment profit margin was 7.2%, very slightly below the prior year. ", "HomeGoods\u2019 solid performance in 2007 bucked the weak trends of the home industry and other retailers. The HomeGoods organization drove strong comp sales over solid comps in the previous year. ", "In the fourth quarter we believe our own missteps were in execution, specifically in seasonal holiday products which lead to comp weakness, and we already put a new strategy in place for next year\u2019s holiday season. One of the great things about our flexible business model is that we can respond quickly to execution issues and enter a new season with a fresh start.", "Heading into spring, I feel good about the great product in the pipeline and the way HomeGoods looks. We are also working hard to fix the few businesses that are not on track. ", "A.J. Wright made solid progress in 2007. Although A.J. Wright\u2019s full-year comp increase of 2% was below planned, from the bottom-line perspective we saw significant year-over-year segment profit increase.", "In the fourth quarter A.J. Wright\u2019s comp sales increased 1%, which was below planned and caused in part by our decision to de-emphasize toys which are important to this business. Having said that, A.J. Wright improved their fourth quarter segment profit by $6 million from last year\u2019s loss, which was above plan. ", "We tried many new ideas at A.J. Wright in 2007, both in merchandise and the marketing areas. Organizationally we also made many changes. We have a much stronger infrastructure heading into 2008. Further, we have seen improvement in the categories we have focused our attention. However, we still have work to do. In terms of marketing we learned a lot about communicating with the customer, but I believe we can do even better.", "I want to reiterate that we continue to believe very strongly in A.J. Wright as a growth vehicle for TJX. This is a business model that we, as the largest off-price retailer in the world, should get right. Its moderate income customer demographic holds enormous potential for TJX. We continue to be prudent in our approach and have about five new stores in our 2008 plan. We will reaccelerate growth as this business gains more traction.", "Finally, on division performance, Bob\u2019s Stores achieved a full-year comp sales increase of 5%, which was in line with our planned range, and over 2% increase last year. On the bottom line, excluding the impairment charge that Trip can elaborate on, Bob\u2019s Stores nearly cut in half its loss from last year and significantly improved its merchandise margin. ", "In the fourth quarter Bob\u2019s Stores performed exceptionally well. Comp sales increased 10%. In terms of profitability Bob\u2019s Stores moved from a prior year loss to a segment profit of $3 million in the fourth quarter, again excluding the impairment charge. We learned a lot in terms of leveraging marketing in the fourth quarter of Bob\u2019s and will continue this strategy into 2008.", "In general we said before that we needed to see Bob\u2019s Stores post comp on top of comp. They have begun to do this and we will continue to evaluate the business. ", "Now, let\u2019s delve into the fundamentals that drove profitable sales in 2007. These included off-price buying, merchandising initiatives, marketing initiatives, cost control, and our no-walls approach. ", "Beginning with off-price buying, the heart of our business. In the last two years we have become even more flexible. We are taking more aggressive, intelligent risks and our entrepreneurial spirit is very strong. ", "In 2007 our relentless management of inventories allowed us to take advantage of a marketplace overflowing with terrific products. Great off-price buying lead to an infusion of better brands and we were more strategic in our up-front buying to make critical fashion statements in our stores. All of these strategies lead to great values and excitement for our customers every day and drove strong merchandise margins. ", "Next is merchandising initiatives. Just so you know, when we say initiatives we mean a lot of things. Not only rolling out new departments, we mean expanding hot ones and contracting others. We also mean in-store events and other ideas to increase traffic and create excitement. To give you a sense, we tested over 50 new ideas in 2007. Some worked and some did not. Some will be rolled out, some we will target demographically, and others that did not deliver satisfactory RLIs will be shelved. The point is that we are constantly taking intelligent risks that are leading to tangible results.", "Just to recap a few: the Cube. Our junior store within a store at Marshall\u2019s was very strong in 2007. We plan to roll out 300-plus of these to the Marshall chain in 2008. ", "Our Marshall\u2019s Mega Shoe Expansion has been a huge success. We rolled out 240 expansions in 2007 and have another 200 planned for 2008. ", "The Runway Designer department at T. J. Maxx is working well in the demographic markets we targeted and benefits the entire chain as we open new vendor doors. In addition, the Runway has lead us to another new idea that we will test in 2008.", "We also have a new Home prototype for Marmaxx which we will begin to slowly roll out towards the back half. And we are testing many more ideas domestically and internationally.", "This is what I mean by the entrepreneurial spirit, as well as our no-walls approach. ", "Marketing was a big focus for us as well in 2007. As you know, we increased our marketing investment and I am very pleased with the progress we have made. Our new chief marketing officer has been on board for a little over a year and we have been working on new ideas and campaigns for several of our brands. Importantly, we completed a great deal of testing and analysis in 2007 and gained a lot of knowledge about how and where to shift marketing dollars to be more productive. So what we\u2019ve learned from the investments we\u2019ve made in 2007 will be applied to driving sales in 2008 without a significant increase in marketing investment. ", "We launched our TJX reward card in 2007 and we saw impressive sign up, as well as positive response from customers in terms of their average basket spend. ", "In 2007 we continued to manage expenses aggressively, we\u2019re prudent in capital spending, and identified new ways to reduce costs. These efforts helped drive bottom line improvement while funding our increased marketing investments and mitigating rising fuel, utility, minimum wage, and other costs. ", "As we have discussed on prior calls, we have a senior executive and a cross-divisional team focused on the big rocks. These include non-merchandise procurement, which is the largest short-term opportunity. We also have mid- and longer-term opportunities and store operating costs, supply chains, mark-down optimization, and a store-ready project, which we will require some re-engineering of processes.", "Finally, I wanted to spend a moment on our no-walls approach. In the same way that we have no walls in our stores, we have open communication between divisions. We conduct global meetings on a regular basis to share best practices and new ideas which has lead to better execution in all of the areas I just discussed, including leveraging buys, merchandise initiatives, improved marketing, in-store procedures, and cost-saving initiatives.", "Now that I\u2019ve talked about how we executed our off-price model in 2007 I\u2019ll review in broad terms our three-year plan for growth, which remains unchanged from what we have communicated in the past.", "For the next several years our model calls for 12% annual EPS growth. Of course, this management team is motivated to surpass this as we have done in the past. The following factors will drive our growth. ", "A 6% to 7% compound increase in sales. This is based on a comp sales increase of about 2% to 3% and consolidated square footage growth of approximately 4%. ", "Continue our approach of planning to a lower comp in order to drive incremental sales to the bottom line to the extent we surpass our comp sales goals. ", "Segment profit margin expansion should contribute an additional 1 to 2 points of growth as we believe we will continue to expand pre-tax margins at the 3-comp level. ", "Also contributing to our EPS growth is the additional benefit we will realize from our share repurchase program, which is funded by planned excess cash generated by our very strong operations and should add about 4 points to our EPS growth.", "Narrowing this down to fiscal 2009, I will give you the big picture for our financial plan and Trip will go into more detail in a moment. Please note that we have a 53rd week in our fiscal \u201909 calendar which will benefit our fourth quarter.", "For the year we expect net top-line growth of approximately 8%, including the 53rd week impact and based on a 2 to 3 comp sales increase and approximately 4% growth in selling square footage. Excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, we expect net sales to grow by approximately 7%. ", "We expect EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.25 including the impact of the 53rd week. This represents a 15% to 18% growth over $1.91 earned in fiscal 2008 on an adjusted basis. Excluding the 53rd week impact, our EPS outlook is in the range of $2.11 to $2.16 or a 10% to 13% increase over prior year on an adjusted basis.", "Now some points about our financial strengths. There\u2019s a solid foundation that supports our future growth. With our strong operations we continue to generate significant amounts of cash in 2007, all of which was returned to shareholders through the buy-back program and dividends. After reinvesting in our businesses our excess cash allowed us to spend $950 million to repurchase TJX stock and retire 33 million shares at an average price of $28.55 per share. Despite spending nearly $1 billion in share buy backs, we exited the year with over $730 million in cash on our balance sheet.", "Our board recently approved a new $1 billion program, which is in addition to $486 million remaining in our existing program at year end. In 2008 we expect to continue our significant share repurchase program with planned spending of an additional $900 million. ", "Finally, our financial returns, specifically return on invested capital, return on assets, and return on equity, we were already in the quartile of all retailers based on these metrics and achieved even stronger returns in 2008.", "Now I want to talk a moment about our growth. You\u2019ve heard me say this before and it bears repeating. We are far from being a mature company. We are investing for the future and have many growth initiatives under way. Some of these include growth through selling square footage expansion, including unit growth and expanding into larger footprints within our existing markets and concepts. ", "We believe we have room to grow our largest division, Marmaxx, by 400 stores, which is 200 more than we had previously estimated. We also have opportunities with relocations into larger footprints, particularly with the success of shoes at Marshall\u2019s. At HomeGoods, we believe we can grow that chain by around 300 additional stores over time. Also, as we\u2019ve discussed on prior calls, we are testing a larger 40,000-square-foot box at this division.", "In the UK we are standing the T.K. Maxx footprint to approximately 30,000 square feet as we relocate from older, smaller boxes, and have five of these relocations planned in 2008. ", "We continue to view the A.J. Wright customer demographic as having great growth potential for TJX. While we believe that the US could ultimately support 1,000 A.J. Wright stores, if we determined 500 stores as the right number to deliver strong return for shareholders then we will grow to 500 stores. Again, we will grow this division prudently.", "Our vision is that TJX is a global off-price company. This growth strategy allows us to drive our business by country. We saw tremendous strength in Canada and the UK in 2007 and took full advantage of these opportunities. Germany is off to a good start. It is hard for customers to resist great brands at great value anywhere in the world. We clearly see the potential for growing by an additional 1,500 to 2,000 stores in our current market without expanding into our next country. ", "For now our plans for international growth are as follows. In Germany we are very much on track and believe we can grow to 250 to 300 stores over time. Again, we will open five additional stores in 2008 and we will evaluate, grow, and invest carefully.", "Also in 2008, we are taking the HomeSense brand on the road to the UK. We have five HomeSense stores slated in the UK in 2008. ", "In Canada we will be testing a new off-price concept this year that plays to our strengths. ", "We see more opportunities for international expansion of our brands into the future, but are not ready to share them publicly yet. ", "Coming up I want to say that, having funded new talent at the corporate level in 2007, we now have in place a management team that combines fresh talent and perspectives with the best of TJX experience. Our no-walls approach is generating ideas and leading to tangible results. It also allows us to share talent across divisions. ", "In terms of growth, we are a global off-price value company with a concept that plays in many countries and in many categories. Our top priority remains driving profitable sales. I want to reiterate that we have one of the most flexible business models in the world. Flexibility and resiliency of our model continue to service well in 2007 as it has done throughout our history and I am confident that it will continue in 2008 and beyond. I feel bullish about the future and I\u2019m looking forward to updating you on our progress through 2008.", "Now I\u2019m going to turn it over to Trip.", "Nirmal K. \u201cTrip\u201d Tripathy", "Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Before I outline our plans for fiscal 2009 let me provide some additional detail on our fiscal 2008 and fourth quarter results, which I believe will help you understand our numbers better. ", "First let me discuss the full-year SG&A rate, which was flat to last year on what was a 2% comp increase excluding foreign exchange. We achieved this flat rate despite increased investments in marketing at 10 basis points and another 10 basis points due to the combination of Germany and the Bob\u2019s Stores impairment charge. Without these items we would actually have had 20 basis points of expense leverage for the year. Overall I think we\u2019re very pleased with this expense performance, which reflects our continued focus on cost containment.", "Second, SG&A for the fourth quarter was up 50 basis points. If you exclude the Bob\u2019s impairment charge, which was 20 basis points, our planned marketing investments at 10 basis points, and 20 basis points that primarily reflect the timing of funding of the TJX foundation, SG&A was essentially flat. We achieved this despite a 1% comp increase at Marmaxx and a 2% comp at TJX, ex foreign currency, from which we would normally expect some deleverage.", "Third, I would like to provide some colour on the mark-to-market inventory hedge adjustments in the fourth quarter. This had a 30 basis point favourable impact on the TJX gross margin for the quarter which was up 150 basis points in total. It also bumped up the Winners segment margin by 290 basis points during the quarter. You might recall that in the third quarter we took an accounting charge for inventory hedges at Winners in Canada to mark these hedges to market. The benefit to the fourth quarter was about the same as the charge to the third quarter and primarily reflected a reversal of this adjustment. These mark-to-market adjustments are required by accounting rules and recently have been accentuated because of dramatic currency movements. ", "A final comment on the quarter. Overall currency favourably impacted the quarter by about $0.04 per share. This was essentially offset, however, by a $0.02 per share negative impact from a higher tax rate during the quarter and a $0.02 per share negative impact from the combination of the Bob\u2019s impairment charge and timing of the foundation contribution. So overall the impact on EPS from no-operating items was flat.", "Let me now turn to our fiscal 2009 plan. As Carol indicated, we expect EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.25, which represents a 15% to 18% increase over the adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.91 earned in fiscal year 2008. ", "As Carol mentioned, we have a 53rd week in the fiscal 2009 calendar, which we expect will benefit the fourth quarter by approximately $0.09 per share. Excluding this benefit, we expect EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.16, a 10% to 13% increase over the adjusted $1.91 earned in fiscal 2008. This is based on a consolidated top-line sales assumption of about $20.1 billion to $20.2 billion including the 53rd week. ", "For consolidated comp store sales we\u2019re assuming a 2% to 3% increase without the 53rd week. We are planning foreign exchange rates to have a favourable impact of about half a percentage point. So net our foreign exchange our comp store sales assumption is about 2%. ", "For the year we expect pre-tax profit margin to be 7.9% to 8%, up 20 to 30 basis points over the adjusted pre-tax profit margin in fiscal 2008. This guidance includes approximately 20 basis points of benefit from the 53rd week.", "We expect gross margin to be 24.6% to 24.7%, which is 10 to 20 basis points better than fiscal 2008. We anticipate SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 16.7%, which is better than fiscal 2008 by roughly 10 basis points.", "It\u2019s important to note that our guidance calls for profit margin improvement on a 2% to 3% comp. In essence, we continued to build our plans based on a conservative comp, which requires us to control expenses and inventory very tightly. And this in turn positions us well to flow incremental sales to the bottom line as we have done in each of the last two years.", "To help with modelling, we\u2019re planning corporate expense for the year to be in the $139 million to $142 million range, interest expense to be about $5 million to $6 million, and our tax rate to be 38.5%.", "From a cash flow perspective for the year we expect capital expenditures to be about $575 million. We\u2019re investing in store initiatives, remodels, and relocations, as well as in-store initiatives to drive sales and continued investments in systems. We expect depreciation to be about $389 million. We\u2019re planning our consolidated inventory levels to be flat on a per store basis.", "Our guidance is based on an average share count for the year, up approximately 445 million shares, assuming a stock buy-back of $900 million.", "Moving to the divisions for fiscal 2009. As a reminder, we will present all of our comp sales increases without the impact of the 53rd week. The division segment margins we are projecting for fiscal 2009 are on a 53-week basis. As I just noted, the 53rd week benefits margins by approximately 20 basis points. ", "We anticipate that Marmaxx will do about $12.6 billion in sales with a comp sales increase of about 2%. Segment profit margin at Marmaxx is planned at 9.9% to 10%, which is 20 to 30 basis points above last year. ", "For the combination of Winners and HomeSense we\u2019re anticipating sales of approximately $2.3 billion US with a comp sales increase of 2% to 3% in local currency. We\u2019re planning Winners segment profit margin in the range of 10.8% to 11%. The year-over-year comparisons for Winners segment margins are negatively impacted by a non-recurring benefit of 50 basis points from foreign exchange rates.", "At T.K. Maxx in Europe we\u2019re planning sales of about $2.5 billion US with a key to 4% comp sales increase in local currency. We expect segment profit margin at T.K. Maxx in the range of 5.7% to 5.8% including Germany and our new HomeSense business, which combined we expect will negatively impact results by about $20 million or 100 basis points. Excluding Germany and HomeSense, segment profit margin at T.K. Maxx will be in the range of 6.7% to 6.8%. ", "At HomeGoods we\u2019re planning a top line of about $1.7 billion with a 3% comp sales increase. We expect segment profit margin for HomeGoods to be in the 5.5% to 5.7% range. ", "At A.J. Wright we\u2019re planning for sales of $674 million to $679 million with a comp store sales increase of 3% to 4%. From a bottom-line perspective we\u2019re looking for a profit of $1 million to $4 million.", "At Bob\u2019s Stores we\u2019re planning sales of $321 million to $323 million and looking to reduce its loss to $4 million to $5 million.", "Now moving to first quarter guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.41 worth $0.34 per share last year on a reported basis. Last year\u2019s results included $0.03 per share of intrusion related costs. So excluding these costs our guidance represents an 8% to 11% increase over prior years adjusted $0.37. ", "The resuming of first quarter top line of $4.4 billion with a 4% to 5% comp sales increase on a consolidated basis and a 1% to 2% comp sales increase at the Marmaxx group. In the first quarter we expect foreign exchange rates to have a favourable impact of two percentage points, so that\u2019s a net comp of 2% to 3% on a consolidated basis excluding foreign exchange. ", "For the month of February we\u2019re planning for a consolidated comp sales increase in the range of 3% to 4%. We\u2019re anticipating a 2% to 3% increase in March and a 6% to 7% increase in April. Easter occurs two weeks earlier this year and in March instead of April. For Marmaxx we\u2019re planning on a zero to 1% comp in February, a zero to 1% comp in March, and a 4% to 5% comp in April.", "Pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 6.7% to 6.8% range, down 10 to 20 basis points from the prior year on an adjusted basis. We expect the first quarter to be negatively impacted by lower interest income, 10 basis points, and by investment in the new European businesses, another 10 basis points. ", "We\u2019re anticipating first quarter gross margin in the area of 24.2% to 24.3% and SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 17.5% to 17.6%. I should note that the SG&A guidance reflects a 20 to 30 basis point increase primarily due to our investments in the new European businesses, the timing of certain corporate expenses, as well as initiatives that we expect will generate savings in future quarters. ", "I\u2019ll wrap up with our store growth plans for fiscal 2009. Beginning with Marmaxx, we plan to add 2% in selling square footage to this division, an increase of store base by about 45 stores net of closing, for a total of 1,668 stores by the end of fiscal 2009.", "In Canada we plan to expand selling square footage by 6% adding a net 16 stores to end the year with a total of 278 stores in that country.", "In the UK we plan to expand T.K. Maxx\u2019s selling square footage by 9% and add 10 T.K. Maxx stores, as well as five HomeSense stores for a combined total of 236 by the end of the year. We also expect to open an additional five stores in Germany for a total of 10 in that country by the end of the year.", "At HomeGoods we plan to expand selling square footage by 9% and add a net of 25 stores for a total of 314 HomeGoods stores by the end of the year. As a reminder, with HomeGoods back on the right track we made the decision to re-accelerate our growth strategy at this division last year.", "We will continue to grow A.J. Wright prudently, as Carol mentioned. In fiscal 2009 we anticipate netting five additional stores for a total of 134 stores by year end. ", "And at Bob\u2019s Stores, as we continue to evaluate this business, we are not planning new store openings in fiscal 2009.", "To keep the call on schedule, we ask that you please limit your questions to one per person. Thank you and we\u2019ll open it up for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question today is from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you and congratulations on a very nice 2007.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "Carol or Trip, can you address what financial metrics you\u2019re looking for A.J. Wright to achieve before you would consider accelerating growth in that division?", "Nirmal K. \u201cTrip\u201d Tripathy", "Well, I think first of all we\u2019ve put a model out there for A.J. Wright which I believe is in the 8% range in terms of the target we\u2019d like that business to get to. And obviously with A.J. Wright at or close to breakeven we have a little ways to go. ", "One of the key metrics that we look at is store contribution. And typically we would look for a store contribution in the 17% to 18%, mid-teens, basically, Kimberly, range before we would look at the store model and say, yup, this works. So that\u2019s sort of the financial metric we look at, obviously in addition to comp store sales performance at the division.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah, Kimberly, we did a lot of work this year with A.J.\u2019s and I think this year is really going to be a year that we see profit. We also understand, we have a better understanding in terms of the real estate and where we want to plant our stores. The progress in the new stores have been terrific. So I think this year\u2019s going to tell us a lot about A.J. Wright. I\u2019m very pleased with their performance in the last several weeks in opening the season. ", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "Carol or Trip, where is the current store contribution if you\u2019re looking to get 17 to 18? Can you just comment on where it is now?", "Nirmal K. \u201cTrip\u201d Tripathy", "Well, I think we\u2019ve got a couple more percentage points to go, Kimberly. And I would say more likely mid-teens is where we would be able to, you know, start thinking about pulling the trigger. So we\u2019ve got a little ways to go still. But we\u2019ve seen improvements in that store contribution number and that\u2019s very encouraging. ", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "Great. Thanks and good luck in \u201909.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Montagna.", "Mark Montagna \u2013 C. L. King and Associates", "Hi. Just a question about merchandise availability. For 2007 and apparently probably for the first half of this year you\u2019ve got a lot of great availability. When you look out to the second half of the year do you anticipate having the same level of high quality availability of merchandise?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Mark, I can tell you this: we went through it last year and the year before, and Ernie will give you a little more colour to this, we have never had a lack of merchandise. We have buyers all over the world and we have over 400 buyers out there. If anything, what I hear is constantly, we\u2019ve got to keep them home because there\u2019s just too much availability and we try very hard to keep very liquid. I think we\u2019ve opened a lot of new doors this year. I think the Runway has brought us new vendors. I think there\u2019s a whole contemporary world out there that we haven\u2019t even tapped. In sportswear we probably opened 30 or 40 new vendors. We don\u2019t see this being an issue at all. ", "Mark Montagna \u2013 C. L. King and Associates", "Yeah. Just to clarify, I\u2019m not so concerned about availability because I know you\u2019re always going to have it, but it\u2019s more over the past year you\u2019ve stepped up the quality or the appeal of a lot of the brands. So you\u2019re going to keep that going?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Absolutely.", "Mark Montagna \u2013 C. L. King and Associates", "Okay. All right. So you don\u2019t really see that declining at all.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No.", "Ernie Herrman", "Mark, I\u2019ll jump in here. To Carol\u2019s point, I don\u2019t see in the short term or the longer terms, and we talked about this I think on the calls the last couple of times. I think you\u2019re getting at the branded discussion and quality level and there we don\u2019t see, if anything, there could be more of that availability happening. So we certainly haven\u2019t seen any indication that that would change.", "Mark Montagna \u2013 C. L. King and Associates", "Okay. Just lastly. Just say you\u2019ve reduced expenses a lot, would you say that you\u2019ve pretty much picked all the low- and medium-hanging fruit and now you really have to just focus on bigger picture opportunities with expenses?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No. Not at all. I think we have mitigated wages, we have mitigated fuel, we have invested in businesses. We have not even brought on a chief procurement officer that we\u2019re getting close to for non-merchandise procurements. We think that this is going to continue. I think we\u2019ve done a fabulous job in \u201907 and we are, everyone has stepped up to the plate and we have a great game plan for \u201908.", "Mark Montagna \u2013 C. L. King and Associates", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Black.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff Black \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Hey, how\u2019s it going? Congrats on a good strong quarter. I guess my question is on home. We\u2019ve seen weakness start to creep into the story here. What\u2019s got you convinced that we don\u2019t have a longer-term problem at HomeGoods? What\u2019s working there specifically? What\u2019s not? Do we have any regional differences in the performance of the store base? And then in the core business, how long do you think it takes to write the ship in the home business? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, getting to HomeGoods. I will tell you that the issue with HomeGoods is purely an execution issue in the fourth quarter. We were just too mundane and too LY in our seasonal and that hurts in the fourth quarter. This group has spent many hours together and, as I\u2019ve said, we have a completely new strategy for fourth quarter for next year. I\u2019m liking very much what I\u2019m seeing flowing into HomeGoods currently. So I really think this was our own misstep in terms of execution.", "As far as Marmaxx goes, we are beginning to see some positive results. We have made many changes in terms of people. Ernie, would you like to comment on home?", "Ernie Herrman", "Just in line with what Carol mentioned with HomeGoods in the fourth quarter, Marmaxx I think was a lack of newness throughout most of the year. And that was our execution challenge in the home area at Marmaxx. To Carol\u2019s point, we\u2019re seeing signs of light, some healthy signs over the last couple of months. And I think we\u2019re also going to make improvement at driving some of the hotter fashion categories where we\u2019re seeing some of the newness taking place. Again, it was more of an execution issue for Marmaxx, but we seem to be turning the corner. To Carol\u2019s point, I think in the first half here we\u2019ll see an improvement.", "Jeff Black \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Fair enough, guys. Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I can just also add that, you know, HomeSense I really believe and T.K. executed home very well and their business was very good. I don\u2019t see this as an issue in terms of the economics. I really think it\u2019s definitely an execution issue.", "Jeff Black \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Great. Good luck, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hey. Thanks, guys. Just looking at gross margin. It was up so much in fourth quarter, merchandise margin driven, and it looks like you have fairly easy comparisons coming into the first quarter. So just trying to understand, is that gross margin guidance somewhat conservative? Is there anything that you saw in the fourth quarter from a merchandise margin perspective exceptional buys that you don\u2019t expect to continue? Just trying to get my arms around that a little bit.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "My answer to that is I hope so. I think we are, you know, it\u2019s the first quarter. It\u2019s our obviously lowest sales quarter in the year. We probably have the most volatile weather. I think we\u2019re being conservative and I think we\u2019re being prudent. Again, I will tell you that the market is very loaded and I do believe we have some opportunity here. ", "Paul Lejuez \u2013 Credit Suisse", "All right. And then just one follow up. Where do you think you\u2019re underpenetrated on the Marmaxx side? You said 400 new incremental stores, 200 more than you originally had planned. Where are you underpenetrated?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, we don\u2019t talk specifically about our real estate strategy, but we\u2019re very confident in being able to add 400 stores.", "Paul Lejuez \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Great. Best of luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Slater.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hey, Todd.", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Hey, there. Just impressive all around. Well done.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Just given the enormous amount of products and supply out there, when you look at the direction in \u201908 where do you see your incremental investment in inventory? If you could just maybe talk broader categories at Marmaxx, and even at A.J. Wright, given that this is maybe an opportunity to upgrade or continue to upgrade. We\u2019re hearing about a lot of bridge inventory out there. What are the sort of areas of opportunity? You\u2019re entering some big dress numbers in the spring and summer; what do you see in that category? Can you still cycle that and comp positively there? What else you might see or we might see tangibly in terms of in the store environment in terms of the product assortment?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, let me start with A.J.\u2019s and then I\u2019ll make a few comments about Marmaxx and then I think Ernie might have a few comments, too. ", "A.J.\u2019s we are much more focused on the Hispanic and the African-American customer. I think that\u2019s a big piece that we can go after that we haven\u2019t necessarily maximized in the past. The real core drivers of that business is basics, it\u2019s denim, urban, shoes, and juniors, and kids. And we see again tremendous opportunities there. I think we\u2019ve fine tuned it. I don\u2019t think we maximized it by any means last year and I think we are just so much more focused. I\u2019m far from being concerned about availability. ", "I also can tell you that our pack-away numbers are pretty substantial even though we have fairly lean inventory. And that business will thrive very much on pack-aways. And it should be terrific.", "As far as categories, like dresses, we haven\u2019t even hit the peak dress years that we had a strong dress cycle. We haven\u2019t even gone near those numbers. So I think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity in earnings from the brand perspective.", "Ernie Herrman", "You know, I think, and again Carol mentioned this earlier in shoes and accessories. I think those two arenas are places, although last year very healthy, I think there\u2019s just more opportunity in this coming year to maximize those businesses. They both have a lot of good brands, but they have a lot in terms of quality in those goods. I would say those would be a couple of areas that will continue to be a push for us in Marmaxx.", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "And how about contemporary? You mentioned contemporary versus, let\u2019s say, the more traditional, you know, the Bridge (sic), the Neal and Tracy\u2019s (sic) of the world. Whatever. ", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It\u2019s really about fashion, Todd. We have a very large group in California. Our job is to bring newness and excitement every day. That\u2019s what they\u2019re focusing on. So we see some pretty good trends happening.", "Ernie Herrman", "Todd, the good thing is when you have a fair amount of availability like this, which we see no one in sight on, is you get a lot of fashion goods in there too. So with Calsite (sic) we have to kind of manage the amount we buy and the selectivity, but it does yield I think more fashion excitement as we go through that process. ", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Perfect. Look forward to it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick.", "Brian Tunick \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "Thanks. Hey, guys. I think the obvious question is, with your number one competitor dramatically slowing down their growth and perhaps delaying their entry into the East, can you maybe talk about what was the reaction in the executive suite regarding your thoughts about real estate expansion, buying, marketing? What usually do you expect to happen when your number two competitor dramatically slows their growth?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I don\u2019t even, we don\u2019t put our number to competitor, Brian. We run our own business. We run TJX and we run an off-price business. So we are not concerned. I mean, we have great plans for the future and that\u2019s how we run our business. ", "Brian Tunick \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Marni Shapiro.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Hey, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter and a great year. ", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Marni.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Could you talk a little bit about the larger footprint HomeStore? You know, a little bit of problems on the home space. What were you envisioning in the larger store? Is there a specific category that you\u2019d like to add that you\u2019ve tested or is it just a little bit more of everything?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Now you\u2019re going to ask me to give the secrets away. Yeah, we\u2019re going to have new categories as well as expansions. We\u2019ve got a lot of new ideas in home goods for the future. So it gives us an opportunity to not only expand the things that are working so well, like in HG Kids, but it gives us an opportunity to test new categories. So we\u2019re pretty excited about this. If anything, in many of our stores we would like a little more room to expand certain areas. ", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Are they ideas that can translate to the Marmaxx stores as well?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Some of them. Some of them will be new categories, but again, some of them will require additional space that you don\u2019t want to necessarily put in Marmaxx because we already have some initiatives in Marmaxx that we think are more suitable for the chain.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Right. I guess that makes sense. Well, guys, good luck. And I just have to make one comment. I love how the New England-based team is so suddenly quiet on the sports front with no commentary about Bob\u2019s business on the Superbowl T-shirts. So maybe next year?", "Ernie Herrman", "(Inaudible) as we speak, Marni.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Have a good one, guys.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hey, Marni, I\u2019m from New York.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "I know, Carol. You\u2019re on my side. Have a good one, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus and Company", "Thanks very much, guys. Just a follow up. If you could provide some more colour on the pack-away in terms of the quantity and quality and the amount of time you think the product will spend in pack-away. And then if you could talk about the internet business. Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We don\u2019t comment on specific numbers. But part of our strategy with A.J. Wright is to increase pack-aways as part of their total buys. Marmaxx is just opportunistic and we\u2019re all opportunistic and this year particularly was a year that it made sense to do more pack-aways.", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus and Company", "And that was just for A.J. Wright, is that correct?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, across the board.", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus and Company", "And could you quantify it over prior years?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah, no, that\u2019s what I was just saying, Richard. We don\u2019t usually quantify how our inventory is broken up. But we tend in the Marmaxx world to stay under 5% and in A.J. Wright it\u2019s greater than that.", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus and Company", "Okay. Any thoughts on the internet?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Right now we are using the internet very aggressively, you know, in terms of communicating to the customer, but in the short term we\u2019re not looking to sell product on the internet. We think that we have some ideas in marketing how to better utilize it to drive sales. ", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus and Company", "All right. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dana Cohen.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hi, Dana.", "Dana Cohen \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Hey, guys. Congrats. Just some clarification here. As you look at Winners and the improvement in operating margin this year versus last year can you just clarify for the year and the quarter sort of all of the noise running through? So, like, what is the real underlying number that we should be thinking of as the go-forward number?", "And second, on the gross margin, up 150, I think you said it was up 80 at Marmaxx. Were all the other businesses clearly up significantly more than that? Just a little more clarification on the dramatic improvement in gross margin.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. I\u2019ll have Trip run specifically through the numbers with you.", "Nirmal K. \u201cTrip\u201d Tripathy", "Dana, let me first talk about fourth quarter because in the fourth quarter the Winners margin was up 450 basis points from 10.4% to 14.9%. A huge part of that, which was 290 basis points as I\u2019ve mentioned, was the inventory hedge that reversed from the third quarter, as we told you during the third quarter. That hurt their margins in the third quarter and we told you it was going to reverse in the fourth. And it did.", "But that apart, I think they had excellent, excellent margin performance. Their gross margin was up a total of 160. Their pre-tax profit was up 160 basis points above and beyond that inventory hedge. It came from a combination of merchandise margin improvements, as well as expense leverage. ", "So that\u2019s all the story within the quarter. And then if you look at full year on Winners, you know, Winners\u2019 margin, pre-tax margin was up 110 basis points and once again it was a function of a number of things, including merchandise margin improvement, expense leveraging, etcetera.", "Dana Cohen \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "You mentioned 50 though from FX. ", "Nirmal K. \u201cTrip\u201d Tripathy", "I mentioned 50 from FX and that again goes back to the foreign exchange impact on the hedge. You know, reverting out and not coming into this year. That\u2019s what that was.", "Dana Cohen \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Okay. So of the 110, there was a contribution of about 50 from the noise of the hedges. ", "Nirmal K. \u201cTrip\u201d Tripathy", "There was roughly about 30 from the hedge and then some FX impacts coming out of that too.", "Dana Cohen \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "So on an underlying basis it\u2019s 60.", "Nirmal K. \u201cTrip\u201d Tripathy", "Underlying basis is 60 to 70.", "Dana Cohen \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Okay.", "Nirmal K. \u201cTrip\u201d Tripathy", "And again, combination of merchandise margin and expense leveraging, which was the same story in the fourth quarter in an even bigger way.", "Dana Cohen \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then merchandising margins for the entire company.", "Nirmal K. \u201cTrip\u201d Tripathy", "Merchandise margin for the entire company was up 40 basis points. And what we saw, and once again in the fourth quarter, it was up 150 basis points gross margin, merchandise margin was about 120. And I would say it was pretty even across every business. Much stronger in some, for example Canada and the European businesses, but certainly nothing to sneeze at in Marmaxx in terms of very strong margin improvement there as well. So I would say it was across the board, across almost every business.", "Dana Cohen \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And most of this from better markdowns?", "Nirmal K. \u201cTrip\u201d Tripathy", "I think it was a combination of better mark-up performance, as well as better mark-down performance.", "Dana Cohen \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Perfect. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dana Telsey.", "Kristina Westura \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Hi. It\u2019s actually Kristina Westura for Dana Telsey. Just a question on marketing plans. Your spend going forward in 2008 relative to last year. And maybe you could just give us a little bit more flavour in terms of which divisions are benefiting the most from your marketing investments.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Kristina, last year we increased our marketing spend about 17% on top of about 18% the year before. We will be slightly, slightly up in our marketing expense for next year, but more importantly the last two years has given us a lot of information on. As I said, John Gilbert\u2019s been on board for a year, which has really allowed us to look at and analyze our spend a little bit better. So we think we\u2019re much, much more focused for next year in where those dollars go. I think it\u2019s going to benefit all divisions. I think A.J. Wright will be a tremendous, it\u2019ll really benefit A.J. Wright because we\u2019ve learned a lot this year. I also think Bob\u2019s and you can see it that they\u2019ve spent their spend in terms of their marketing tree was very high in the first half, came down fourth quarter, and they were very focused and they really drove the fourth quarter. So truly across the board I think we\u2019re much more pointed and focused this coming year than we were a year ago. I think we\u2019re going to be very happy with what we see.", "Kristina Westura \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Glick.", "David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", " Well, I can say good afternoon now and congratulations. Carol, we\u2019re seeing a lot of signs of inflationary pressure in apparel accessories and home goods. Can you give us a sense how this might be impacting the portion of your business that you\u2019re buying up front and is that particularly focused in home? Is it in wool? In leather-based products? Where is it? Is there a way to look at this as a potential opportunity for you guys as you continue to offer greater relative value versus your department store and specialty store competition that obviously doesn\u2019t have the same value proposition?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "David, you just answered your own question. Thank you. ", "David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "I just want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about that correctly.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, but really, truly it is about the value and it\u2019s always about the gap between us and the department stores and the competition. Obviously if there is inflation and the average ticket goes up, you know, your units through your DCs go down and you can obviously leverage that on the expense side. But having said that, I think the inflation is happening in certain categories and not in others. I\u2019m not so sure we\u2019re going to see so much in apparel as people think this year. They may be a little bit in shoes and I think it depends on the category. We\u2019re really not seeing it in homes. And again, I\u2019ll just keep coming back to our formula, which is really showing the value versus someone else. So inflation isn\u2019t a key factor in our business.", "David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "Okay. Great. Thanks and good luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question today is from David Mann.", "David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice and Company", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning. My question\u2019s on Bob\u2019s. It\u2019s definitely doing better this past year, but I guess looking back it was supposed to break even in \u201905 and we\u2019re still several years later and you\u2019re not forecasting profitability. So can you just give an update on sort of the time table for profitability and your views on Bob\u2019s future?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah. Well, I can tell you I\u2019m very pleased with their fourth quarter performance. They did cut their loss in half. Our goal is to keep improving Bob\u2019s and we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate the business.", "David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice and Company", "Okay. And then \u2013", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We don\u2019t have a time frame I can, you know, there\u2019s been vast improvement. I mean, when you look at the fourth quarter and you see really they made $4 million if you take the impairment charge out. Which is a tremendous step in the right direction. So really my answer is we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the business.", "David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice and Company", "Okay. And then if I can ask sort of a follow up on that. When you bought Bob\u2019s, being that that was your last acquisition, how are you taking that experience towards your willingness and any criteria for additional acquisitions just given that there seems to be a lot of opportunities, I\u2019m sure, that are being presented to you given your cash flow and your management team.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah, David, we are very, I mean, we are wide open. Obviously we are investing in three new businesses for next year, which we really believe in. As I said before, strategically we see ourselves as a global off-price value company that plays in obviously many countries. Having said that, we\u2019re certainly very financially sound and this is a very interesting landscape. So we are looking at everything around us for possibilities.", "David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice and Company", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I want to thank everyone for today and I look forward to reporting on our first quarter.

", "Thank you and now I\u2019ll turn it back to Carol. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Sherry. Good morning. Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Trip Tripathy, Jeff Naylor, and Ernie Herrman. Let me begin by saying we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. While the unfavorable weather in February and March hurt apparel sales and the challenges of the consumer environment did not help, we achieved these results by sharply executing the key elements of our off price business model and taking a strong strategic approach. We maintained our inventory discipline, which allowed us to mitigate our markdown risks and put us in an excellent position to take advantage of great buying opportunities in the marketplace. ", "When the weather turned seasonable in April, we were ready to do business. We had freshness and excitement in our stores and offered our customers great brands and great value. While we believe that there was pent-up demand, our apparel business came back stronger than we had expected and we saw traffic increase during the quarter. As a reminder, we have always said that our business is weather sensitive because we have a buy-now, wear-now customer. That said, typically the weather evens out over a give year. ", "I want to focus for a moment on the fact that since late 2005, we have delivered quarter on top of quarter of strong performance. We are well beyond the phase of fixing what was not working in the business and have proven the staying power of our strategies. ", "While the numbers speak for themselves, I want to spend some time on this call sharing with you what is harder to see from the outside. As we have been delivering consistently strong performance, we have simultaneously been pursuing new growth opportunities and building and developing our organization to support that growth. ", "First, however, let\u2019s recap the consolidated numbers; net sales for the first quarter increased to $4.4 billion, 6% above last year. Consolidated comp store sales increased 3% over last year, slightly below our plans. Foreign currency exchange rates benefited comp sales by 1.5 percentage points, which was about what we had expected. Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.43 this quarter. This result includes a tax benefit of $0.02 per share, which Trip will discuss in a moment. Last year\u2019s results include a $0.03 per share charge related to the computer intrusion. Excluding these items, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.41 or 11% above last year and at the high-end of our range, despite our slightly reduced comp. ", "Overall, pretax profit was 6.6%, just slightly below plan. Excluding the intrusion charge taken in the first quarter last year, pretax profit margins were 30 basis points below prior year, due to a slightly lower gross profit margin and reduced interest income versus last year. ", "Gross profit margin was 24%, which was 10 basis points below last year. Through solid execution of our off-price fundamentals, merchandise margins increased 30 basis points in a challenging retail environment and over strong increases last year. This would have been even stronger were it not for the increases in fuel costs. In addition, investments in our European business and deleverage from buying and occupancy costs offset the merchandise margin gains. ", "With all of this, we held segment profit margin flat to last year at 7.4% on what was essentially a 2% comp without currency. Trip will provide more details on this later. ", "SG&A expense was flat to last year as we gained leverage on the 2% comp without currency due to effective expense management. In terms of inventories, at the end of the first quarter consolidated inventories on a per store basis were down 3%. We exited the quarter with very clean inventories and more open to buy than at this time last year. We continue to be in an excellent position to capitalize upon a marketplace that is certainly full of opportunities. ", "Now to our divisional results, let\u2019s begin with our domestic concepts. At the Marmaxx group, our largest division, comp sales were up 1%, segment profit was $278 million, up 2% over prior year, and segment profit was 9.9, down 10 basis points from prior year. ", "Marmaxx achieved its 9.9 segment profit despite a 1 comp increase which speaks to its strong merchandise margins and expense control. Merchandise margins increased 10 basis points and were it not for increased fuel costs on freight, would have increased 20 basis points. We attribute our strong merchandise margins to very solid execution by the Marmaxx organization. As much as the cold weather in February and March hurt apparel sales, the warm weather boosted business in April. We navigated through the volatility by maintaining lean inventories, remaining flexible and taking advantage of buying opportunities. In this way, we mitigated our markdown risks and improved mark-on in a challenging retail environment. We are making amazing deals and are very encouraged by the amount and the scope of product, from the high-end to the moderate product. ", "Some quick highlights on categories: dresses continued to be exceptional, with a double-digit comp increase over huge increase last year, which bodes very well for the summer selling season. We also are very pleased with the continued strong performance of our mega shoe shop and customer response to the cube at Marshalls. Accessory also continued to perform well above the chain during the quarter.", "As to home fashions at Marmaxx, while comps were down 4%, we lowered our inventory levels and are identifying areas that are working. We seeing faster turns and greatly improved gross margins. We are beginning to see positive comps in several areas and are strategically building inventory in those categories. ", "Now to HomeGoods; comp sales at HomeGoods increased by 2% in the first quarter. Segment profit was $9 million and segment profit margin was 2.4%, which was lower than last year and our plan. HomeGoods flowed in an exciting mix during the first quarter. In April, we were pleased that HomeGoods did well, as they were up against one of their highest comps comparisons for the year. ", "From a bottom line perspective, HomeGoods really felt the negative impact of rising fuel costs to a greater extent than our other divisions, [due to] the higher costs for shipping home product. We have initiatives in place to mitigate the freight impact and expect improvement in the back half. ", "It\u2019s important to note that while the weak environment never helps, we do not attribute HomeGoods\u2019 shortfall in the first quarter to the weak home environment that other retailers are feeling. ", "We continue to offer customers an exciting treasure hunt for unique home d\u00e9cor at compelling value. As we begin the summer sealing season, we like the freshness in our stores and the product in our pipeline and we are seeing nice momentum in the business. ", "Moving to A.J. Wright, where we saw tremendous progress in the first quarter. Comp sales increased 6%, which was above our plan. On the bottom line, A.J. Wright was close to breaking even, which was significantly better than last year. We were very encouraged by the quarter and the strong April sales at A.J. Wright and we are feeling very good about this business for the following reasons. ", "Customer traffic increased significantly as A.J. Wright builds its customers base and brand awareness. We have made key investments in order to operationally strengthen our infrastructure. In terms of the organization, we are in a great place with a team of A players on board. We continue to see good results in the categories where we have focused our attention. We feel much better about our marketing campaign and believe our new techniques are driving customer traffic. We were also very encouraged by the improvement we saw in A.J.\u2019s store contributions, which was up 200 basis points. As we\u2019ve said before, improvement in this metric is key to accelerating our rollout of new stores. ", "In terms of store growth at A.J. Wright, in 2008 our plans call for netting five stores. We will continue to fill in existing markets but as we believe this business is in a very good place, we are considering opening one or two of these stores in new markets. As we have said previously, we will proceed prudently as this business gains traction. ", "Longer term, we continue to view A.J. Wright as holding enormous growth potential for our company. ", "Finally on our domestic divisions, at Bob\u2019s Stores comp sales decreased 3% in the first quarter. In terms of bottom line results, Bob\u2019s Stores segment loss was equal to last year. We believe their performance in the first quarter was completely a weather story. With a store base concentrated in the Northeast, Bob\u2019s Stores was disproportionately hurt by the unseasonable weather during the first part of the quarter. Here again we were pleased to see sales increase dramatically when the weather warmed up in April. ", "Now to our international division, which continues to be exceptionally strong. Let\u2019s start with Canada, where first quarter performance at Winners and HomeSense was truly outstanding. For the first quarter, comp sales in Canada increased 20% in U.S. dollars and increased 4% in local currency, which we believe better reflects our operating performance. Segment profit was $41 million, which was well above plan, and segment profit margin increased 160 basis points to 8.4%. ", "Our Canadian division achieved these great results through excellent execution of our off-price fundamentals. The Winners organization did a tremendous job of maintaining flexibility in its inventory position, find the right fashion at the right time, and flowing great brands at exciting prices to our stores. ", "Our HomeSense business continues to perform very well and is making strong top line and bottom line contributions. Winners and HomeSense both have great momentum going into the second quarter. ", "Moving to our European businesses, we are very excited with the progress we have made in the first quarter. Beginning with T.K. Maxx in the U.K. and Ireland, first quarter comps increased 6% in U.S. dollars and increased 5% in local currency, which again we believe better reflects our operating performance. ", "Segment profit in Europe in the first quarter decreased to $1 million from $5 million last year. Excluding investment in our new European businesses, segment profit was $7 million, up by a strong 62%, and segment profit margin increased 50 basis points to 1.5%, both above our plan and over strong increases last year. ", "T.K. Maxx continues to achieve remarkable results over strong comparisons in the U.K. and Ireland in the face of a challenging retail environment in those markets. I will say it again -- it\u2019s about execution. The flexibility and resiliency of our business model is hard to beat, even when times get tough. ", "In our T.K. Maxx stores in Germany, we are seeing inventory turns in our German stores that took us 14 years to reach in the U.K. This gives us great confidence that the German consumer is really getting our concept. Since our last conference call, we opened one additional store in Germany and again saw exceptional turns. We now have a total of six stores in Germany and by year-end plan to have a total of 10 stores in that country. ", "We are also excited about our launch of HomeSense in the U.K. As we introduce the concept of off-price home fashions to that country, our first two openings were very strong and we plan to have a total of five HomeSense stores in the U.K. by year-end. It is very early but the early response was beyond what we had anticipated. I will speak more about the European expansion in a moment. ", "At the top of this call, I said I was going to talk to some important things that are happening at TJX that may not be so visible. While we are busy executing extremely well on a day-to-day basis and delivering strong results, there is a great deal going on at TJX to position us for the future. ", "It\u2019s important for everyone to understand that we do not view ourselves as a mature company. Our vision for TJX is simple -- maximize and expand our concept globally; in other words, to be a global off-price value company. We have plentiful opportunities to grow domestically and internationally and we have solid strategies in place to achieve our goals. ", "Unlike most retailers, we have developed organizations in several European countries, including the U.K., Germany, and Italy, which is a tremendous advantage in terms of future growth. Ultimately, we believe we can grow to more than 4,300 stores with our current portfolio in the countries where we currently operate. ", "Let me share with you some key points. First is the flexibility of our business model which allows us to change with the taste of the consumer. Our entrepreneurial spirit is strong and we are taking intelligent risk and testing new ideas to change it up for our customers. We are well-positioned to attract a broad range of customers from the high, medium, and lower income demographic. We have great potential to grow domestically and in Canada, including unit growth and expanding into larger footprints. ", "As we have discussed on our prior calls, we now believe we have the potential to grow our Marmaxx division by 400 additional stores. We are growing HomeGoods this year by 25 stores and believe the U.S. can hold about 550 to 600 HomeGoods stores. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we are feeling good about A.J. Wright and view this concept as a major growth vehicle for TJX in the U.S. ", "In Canada, as we have discussed, we are starting a new concept later this year. ", "Now I want to talk about our European growth opportunity, so that you really understand the potential that we see through our future. With a population close to that of the U.S., Europe can support thousands of stores and there is no competitors who can offer the value that we provide on the scale upon which we can provide it. It\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019ve built very successful businesses in Canada, the U.K., and Ireland, where other retailers have failed. And as I just mentioned, we are more pleased with the response from the German customers. We know how to do this. ", "There\u2019s another important point that I\u2019d like to make here, and that is that Marmaxx, our cash engine that is funding our growth. While Marmaxx may be generating low single digit comps, it consistently performs as increased merchandise margins and throws off enormous cash. We do not take our eyes off the core business for one moment. We will continue to execute at Marmaxx while we pursue what we see as tremendous growth opportunities internationally. ", "More specifically, we believe that Germany with is population of $82 million holds the potential for 250 to 300 T.K. Maxx stores. In the U.K. and Ireland, we believe we have the potential to grow HomeSense to 100 to 150 store chain. We also have opportunities to expand in the U.K. and Ireland with larger footprints T.K. Maxx stores. ", "Longer term in Europe, we see more opportunities for expansion into new markets. ", "To support our European growth, we have been doing a lot of strengthening up of our organization and infrastructure. We have dedicated significant resources to recruiting and in hiring the best of the best. We also have a new European shared service structure in order to support our new businesses as they grow. This new structure will allow us to leverage our business for the future across all of Europe. ", "Building the team and developing the organization is one of my favorite priorities. We are funding new talent at the corporate level and have added a new Senior Vice President Procurement Director since our last call. We have also added several new merchants, creating a great balance between new ideas and in-depth off-price knowledge. We are also putting great emphasis on training future merchandise executives. ", "I am very excited about our newly enhanced training program for merchants. This is a world-class, comprehensive program to support the development of people and talent for the future and our focus is on both the short-term and the long-term. ", "Finally, I think it\u2019s important to share with you how we approach growth. Our strategy is to be very methodical and I view myself as a builder. We are evolutionary, not revolutionary. We do a lot of testing, going step by step to build our businesses gradually to ensure that our foundation is secure, the infrastructure is strong, and we have clear visibility into financial returns before we accelerate growth while at the same time we make sure that we are not too risk adverse. ", "We believe that this measured approach to grow combined with intelligent risk taking will continue to serve us well. ", "Now to our financial strength, which is the solid foundation that supports our plans for the future growth. We continued to generate significant amounts of cash from our strong operations in the first quarter. We remain committed to our share buy-back program as an excellent way to return value to shareholders and in the first quarter, we repurchased $225 million of TJX stock, retiring 7 million shares. It remains our plan to repurchase at least $900 million of TJX stock in fiscal 2009. Additionally, in April we raised the dividend payment by 22% over the last dividend paid. ", "Moving to guidance for the second quarter and the full year -- beginning with the second quarter, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.42. This compares to $0.13 in diluted earnings per share in the prior year, which includes $0.25 per share intrusion charge. Including this charge, our guidance represents a 5% to 11% increase over the adjusted $0.38 per share in the prior year. This outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of approximately 3%. ", "While we believe these are prudent goals for the second quarter, I can tell you that we are motivated to surpass them and may have gotten off to a very good start. ", "For the full fiscal 2009 year, we are maintaining our diluted EPS range of $2.20 to $2.25, including the benefit of the 53rd week. This range represents a 33% to 36% increase over reported EPS of $1.66 in the prior year, which includes a $0.25 per share charge related to the previously announced computer intrusions. ", "Excluding the 53rd week impact and the prior year\u2019s intrusion charge, our guidance is in the range of $2.11 to $2.16, a 10% to 13% increase over the adjusted $1.91 earned last year. I should note that while the $0.02 tax benefit in the first quarter does flow to the full year, with only one quarter behind us we are not updating our fiscal year guidance at this time. ", "Summing up, let me recap the reasons for our confidence and our continued successful growth of TJX. First, our strong performance over the past two years plus demonstrates our ability to drive consistent and sustained earnings growth. At the same time, we remain focused on reducing costs and are reinvesting for the future. ", "Second, we have one of the most flexible business models in the world and can respond and evolve along with our customers\u2019 changing tastes. ", "Third, we have huge opportunities to grow both domestically and internationally. Our new European businesses are off to a truly terrific start. ", "Fourth, we have a strong management team in place that combines TJX experience with new talent and we are developing a worldwide organization to support that growth. ", "Fifth, we are building platforms step by step both structurally and organizationally to support our growth and at the same time taking intelligent risk. ", "And lastly, we continue to leverage our no-walls policy across divisions where ideas, initiatives, and best practices are bin shared. We continue with our mantra of execution, execution, execution to drive profitable sales growth. We are very excited about our opportunities and we believe we have solid strategies to support our growth. ", "I would like to say that we are proud to have ranked number 132 in the most recent Fortune 500 rankings. Among all of the 500 companies listed, TJX ranked number 89 in total return to shareholders over the last 10 years and number 44 in return on equity and number 64 in return on assets. ", "I look forward to updating you on our progress in the second quarter and now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Trip. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Thank you, Carol and good morning, everyone. Before I outline our plans for the second quarter and full year, let me provide some detail on first quarter earnings results. First, a brief comment on the tax benefit of $12 million. This is a reduction in the tax reserves established under FASB interpretation 48 accounting for uncertain tax positions, which we did not anticipate when we entered the first quarter and updated our guidance in April. The benefit to EPS rounded to $0.02. ", "Next, some additional color on our EPS results -- we delivered solid EPS growth despite a tough retail environment and increased cost pressures, notably fuel. Our operating businesses held a flat consolidated segment profit margin despite a comp that ex currency was 2% and increased fuel costs and investments in new businesses, which combined cost us about 25 basis points. ", "These increased costs were offset by other improvements in our merchandise margin, as well as expense control. ", "While pretax profit margin was down 30 basis points, it was just slightly below plan and on a segment basis, is virtually all due to corporate expense and interest income. Corporate expense was up $8 million versus last year, primarily due to the timing of expenses last year. If we look at fiscal years 2007 and 2006, this year\u2019s numbers are very much in line with those levels. ", "Interest income was down this year due to unusually large cash balances last year which, as you will recall, was due to suspension of the buy-back. This year we are buying back stock, have less cash, and therefore less interest income but are seeing a significant EPS lift in the share count which more than offset the lost interest income. ", "So once again, we are very pleased with these results. ", "Now to guidance -- for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the company expects earnings per share in the range of $0.40 to $0.42, which represents a 5% to 11% increase over the adjusted $0.38 per share in the prior year. We are assuming a second quarter top line of approximately $4.6 billion, which a comp sales increase of approximately 3% on a consolidated basis, which includes approximately 50 basis points due to foreign exchange and a 2% comp sales increase at the Marmaxx group. ", "For the months of May, June, and July, we are planning for consolidated comp sales increases in the range of 1% to 2% in May, 3% in June, and 3% in July. For Marmaxx, we are planning on comp sales increase of flat to 1% in May, 2% in June, and 2% to 3% in July.  ", "Pretax profit margins are planned in the 6.5% to 6.7% range, flat to down 20 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to our investments in new European businesses, which we will begin to anniversary in the third quarter. Excluding these investments, we plan the business down 10 to up 10 basis points on a 2% to 3% comp ex currency. ", "For modeling purposes, we are planning a tax rate of approximately 38.7% and weighted average outstanding shares of $447 million, and interest expense of $3 million this year versus income of $1 million last year, a 10 basis point increase. ", "For the full fiscal 2009 year, as Carol discussed, we are maintaining our EPS range of $2.20 to $2.25, including the benefit of the 53rd week. Excluding the 53rd week impact and the prior year\u2019s intrusion charge, our guidance is in the range of $2.11 to $2.16, a 10% to 13% increase over the adjusted $1.91 earned last year. ", "Again, while the $0.02 tax benefit in the first quarter does flow to the full year, with only one quarter behind us we are not updating our fiscal year guidance at this time. We are confident in our ability to achieve 10% to 13% EPS growth. Again, we have set prudent goals for the second quarter. It is also important to note that again, in the third quarter we will begin to anniversary the investments in our European businesses, which is contemplated in our guidance. And as Carol said, May is off to a good start. ", "To keep the call on schedule, we ask that you please limit your questions to one per person. Thank you and we will take questions now. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brian Tunick. Please go ahead. ", "Analyst for Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan ", "Good morning. It\u2019s [Evelyn Copelman] for Brian. Our question is about comp growth at Marmaxx. Looking at the past three quarters, it\u2019s been relatively weak and your guidance for the second quarter at 2% is better than Q1 and the past three quarters, despite tougher comparisons. So if you could talk a little bit about maybe the challenges for comp growth, aside from weather, that you\u2019ve seen over the past three quarters and maybe your confidence about the second quarter comps, that would be great. Thank you.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well first of all, Marmaxx, their merchandise margins have been very, very strong and their segment profit has been very strong. We have basically been keeping Marmaxx between planning at a 2 comp for the year, you know, leveraging the bottom line pretty strong. And I\u2019ll have Ernie talk a little bit to it but we are feeling pretty good about Marmaxx. ", "Ernie Herrman", "I think the -- we had a decent fourth quarter I think where the sales were kind of in line with the second quarter guidance here. I think what happens is part of this weather issue that we ran into in first quarter, we anticipate that that kind of comes out of the equation. I think Carol mentioned before that over the course of the year, that always evens out and I think in second quarter, we anticipate that a lot of the exciting deals that also I think Carol mentioned in the release here are going to take place, so that\u2019s one reason we\u2019re feeling like it\u2019s still a prudent guidance, even though we are up against a decent number last year. But I think we are pretty optimistic, given a lot of the buys that we\u2019ve made recently. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think we are positioned very well and as you can see in April when the weather broke, Marmaxx had a huge comp and very strong apparel sales. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. ", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Good morning, everybody. Can you talk a little bit about the levers of merchandise margin improvement? How are you seeing it, how does it vary by division? And also, the strength in Europe, Carol, what are you seeing there in terms of traffic and just the assortment there versus what you have here? How are you looking at it? Thank you. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, in terms of margin, actually we have margin improvement pretty much across the board. Some  pretty staggering results in Winners, Marmaxx being very strong, T. K. -- I mean, we can give you -- Trip can give you that specific numbers sort of offline but really very, very strong across the board. So we are, as you can see, very open to buy, very liquid, and truly taking advantage out there. So we are positioned extremely well. ", "I am very happy to say that our traffic for the quarter was up, which bodes very well for the future as well as our transactions being up, traffic being up, and our average basket being slightly up. We\u2019ve also introduced our TJX credit card, which seems to be stimulating additional traffic, which again is going to be very strong for the future. So we are feeling pretty positive about that. ", "Dana, what was your second question? I apologize. ", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "The international business, the assortment there, perhaps in Germany and the U.K., how it differs from the U.S. and the buys there?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, Germany is off to an amazing start. I mean, if I say that we are turning the German business as fast as the U.K. business and it took us many, many years to be able to achieve those kinds of turns. We have a very solid team. We have over 14 people established in Germany that are buying predominantly German product. In addition, that German product is working very well in the U.K. So it\u2019s really helping both businesses. The U.K. buyers buying for Germany and the German buyers buying for the U.K. and they really take the best of the best vendors. So it\u2019s opened many, many doors for us. The other piece that is pretty exciting is the vendor community is very, very open to us and excited about us entering that market, so we haven\u2019t had any barriers there. ", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Slater with Lazard Capital Markets. Please go ahead.  ", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Thank you very much. Hello, everybody. My one question is on A.J. Wright, since it has such potential to really move the needle and you have a positive $4 million profit swing there and you\u2019ve done a lot to enhance the management team with a lot of like A level merchants and you targeted a number of areas. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about what those targeted investments are yielding, what has to happen next for you to consider this more aggressive rollout? Thanks. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, as I said before, this is really the first time that we are sort of opening the door to looking at some additional markets and as we said, we are -- our performance, our four-wall performance has increased dramatically over 200%, so we are starting to look at that right now. The areas that we focus on -- accessories, shoes, juniors, young men\u2019s, and kids, are all very, very strong. Our customer count is way up, our turns are better, so we are starting to feel pretty good about this business and are evaluating it and are expanding and looking at some additional markets. ", "Again, we will be very opportunistic in terms of the real estate, which I think today is very interesting because there are a lot of doors shutting, which may give us some opportunities that we may not have had a year or two ago, so we are wide open for this. ", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with KCIT.  ", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Good morning. It\u2019s Kimberly Greenberger from Citigroup. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I thought you were from Citigroup, Kimberly. ", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Fuel costs, you mentioned some initiatives to offset rising fuel costs. When do you expect those to kick in and secondarily, Trip, if you could give us a little bit more detail on the breakout on the gross margin, how much did buying and occupancy delever, what was the deleverage due to the European investment and then the fuel cost component? That would be great. Thanks. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, Kimberly, we\u2019ve really been able to mitigate the fuel. As you can see, we\u2019ve done a great job in terms of managing expenses. We have -- we are looking at many areas in terms of fuel and our network, how we deliver to the stores, the timing of the way we deliver to our stores, so I think we will see a little bit of -- we\u2019ll have a little bit of an advantage in the second quarter in terms of mitigating it and I think in the back half, we\u2019ll see a little bit more, especially in home goods where there are very strong initiatives in place, and Trip will go through the numbers with you. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "So Kimberly, you asked about gross profit and buying and occupancy, deleverage, et cetera. So first of all, gross profit was down 10 basis points through last year as we mentioned, and between buying and occupancy deleverage and investments in the new businesses, you are looking at about 25 basis points there, along with some other expenses, which obviously drove it to almost 40 basis points. But that was more than offset by 30 basis points in merchandise margin improvement and I would just point out that the merchandise margin number included the impact of fuel costs, so frankly the merchandise margin performance was even better and helped to offset the fuel costs. ", "So overall, I think we are very pleased with our offsets that we\u2019ve been able to achieve on the cost lines on gross profit in particular, and then in addition, SG&A was flat to last year which once again, we are very pleased about. We talked earlier about segment profit being flat, once again very pleased about that, and interest went the other way once again as we mentioned, about 10 basis points. So that helped us, although we were 30 basis points below last year we were just slightly below plan and overall, that\u2019s the reason we are feeling good about the quarter. ", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Great. Thanks and good luck here in the second quarter. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Cohen. Please go ahead. ", "Dana Cohen - Banc of America Securities", "If you could just clarify a bit on the corporate expense, the timing issue and how we should think about it as we move through the year. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "If you go back to \u201906 and \u201907, as I mentioned, you\u2019d see we are about in the $30 million range on corporate expense. And then what happened in \u201908 was we had a number of things going on, some of it timing of some corporate expenses and that\u2019s primarily the reason why we had about a $10 million swing in that year. ", "You will see we are back to -- I hate to call it a normal level but we are certainly up to a more normal level this year at $31 million, and that\u2019s after making various investments in talent and training and other things that Carol had talked about. And then you will see in our second quarter guidance, we are really back to a year ago. ", "So I would just call it out as an anomaly, if you would, last year and a reduction because of various factors but I think we are just back to a more normal level right now. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Dana, in addition we had several high level openings that we again, you know, filling in our talent -- a director for Germany, two GM [mems] in HomeGoods, relocations, our Chief Procurement Officer, so we had a lot of that spread out through the year but of course we -- again, we were able to find some terrific talent that really came in in the first quarter and those positions are filled, and that is also part of the corporate expense. ", "Dana Cohen - Banc of America Securities", "Thank you. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "And Dana, just to talk to timing, if you look at full-year last year, you will see we were about flat to the prior year. ", "Dana Cohen - Banc of America Securities", "Got it. Okay. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "-- it\u2019s a timing issue in the first quarter last year. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Black. Please go ahead. \t", "Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. I guess just a couple of longer term questions on Europe, since you called it out so much. On sales, how fast are we talking about ramping Europe up? I mean, what do we look like in terms of percent of sales contribution in 2010, 2011 for example? ", "On expenses, I know you just talked short-term but is there going to be an impact longer term as we look at ramping up that division?", "And finally on the operating margin, is there anything structural over there that would lead us to a lower operating margin than we are used to at the Marmaxx division, or do you think that sort of 10-ish rate is possible over in Europe over time? Thanks. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, first of all with Europe, and I\u2019m going to say that we are surprised at the response in Germany and in HomeSense. We weren\u2019t expecting that to happen quite as quickly. We have put out there and we have thought in our model that we would start to break even or make money in year four. We probably see that happening earlier than that. We are obviously because of this going to sit down and strategically looking at it as we are building in a shared service structure that is going to answer number two, which we think is really going to leverage the combination of HomeSense, Germany, and the U.K. ", "So are we going to hit a 10%? You know, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll hit a 10% but I can tell you that we are probably in the 8 range and we are also seeing some interesting things happening on the rent side of the business, where we are seeing -- where we used to have caps. We are taking advantage of some situations in the U.K. now and German real estate is less costly than the U.K. real estate. ", "So we will probably look to get more aggressive in terms of adding stores and we do see the profit bottom line probably accelerating faster than we had thought previously. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Morris. Please go ahead. \t", "John Morris - Wachovia", "Thanks. Congratulations on a great quarter. A question relating to advertising, Carol, in terms of your marketing approaching. You all have been doing some pretty creative things in the past and I\u2019m wondering if you can update us on some of your marketing and advertising initiatives on a go-forward basis and if there is a change year over year in spending there. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In dollars, we are slightly up. We think again we are using our dollars more wisely. Each division is a little bit different and in A.J. Wright, we have dramatically changed. Last year we were on television and this year we are not, but we found a great approach to get to our consumer and it\u2019s really working. I really cannot go into detail because these are really obviously trade secrets. ", "And in Marmaxx, we\u2019ve been testing again targeting a little bit different and we are pretty excited about it and we are going to be rolling out some things in the back half that we are finding are working in the first half, so we\u2019ve taken a group of markets and we are experimenting. And as I\u2019ve said before, with John Gilbert on board, he is really helping us to target a lot better. So we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive but the first half and really the first quarter was about learning are these things going to work. We are finding some things that are working and then we will start rolling it out in the back half. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez. Please go ahead. ", "Tracy Cogan - Credit Suisse", "It\u2019s Tracy [Cogan] filling in for Paul. I was hoping you guys could give us a little more color on the SG&A line. How were you able to do better than plan this quarter? And if there are initiatives in place or continuing initiatives as the year progresses, if you could detail those. Thanks. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I\u2019ll have Trip talk to the SG&A but we have many, many initiatives. Again, our Chief Procurement Office is on board and we\u2019ve probably seen non-merchandise procurement as one of the earlier quick ways of us finding some low hanging fruit -- supply chain, in-store labor, and markdown optimization will probably be a little bit longer term but I think we\u2019ll have some quick wins earlier on. And Trip, the SG&A. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "So SG&A first quarter, as I mentioned, was flat to last year and we are sort of expecting that in the second quarter as well. And I would just say I think the divisions are doing a great job of controlling expenses. It\u2019s a combination of short-term, tighten-the-belt stuff but also as we\u2019ve talked previously, both short-term and long-term, more programmed initiatives, like the non-merchandise procurement fees, like store payroll, the longer term initiatives around supply chain. ", "So I think what you are seeing is some of those programmed initiatives kicking in and helping to offset risings costs but also short-term as you would expect, tighten-the-belt stuff taking place at the divisions and corporate, and that\u2019s what generate the SG&A results. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Glick. Please go ahead. ", "David Glick - Buckingham Research ", "Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Carol, just to follow-up on Marmaxx, the home business, it seems like the turnaround of that business is really key to sustaining the momentum in that division and you\u2019ve made some progress over the last couple of months. Can you give us a little more specifics on what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not working, the mix changes there? Does that help you or hurt you from a margin perspective in terms of the mix of those business? Because you can see some variation within the home store. Just some color on that would be helpful. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay, well, David, I\u2019ll have Ernie comment. Just overall, they have brought their inventories down as we strategized it and the turns in our home are a lot stronger. They are very, very focused on bringing fresh new product and I think if you walk the stores today, it\u2019s a lot more exciting and there are certainly places that we are seeing it working. We will start to strategically invest more inventory. ", "We\u2019ve also tested our new home prototype and Ernie can talk a little bit more about that. ", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, David, as Carol was saying, I think one of the keys has been we\u2019re a little more eclectic in the mix today than we were. We are more assorted. We are not -- really we don\u2019t have a lot of looks that we had a year ago and that was one of our problems with the execution. So we are seeing better turns obviously on less inventory and that\u2019s really the first sign of help we wanted to see.", "I think, as Carol also mentioned, we are surgically going in at certain categories and putting back some more inventory and buying more goods where we are having success. So there are some categories there, which I wouldn\u2019t want to give you specifics on, but that we are going to chase over the next quarter because we are getting some good reads. ", "As far as the new prototype goes, we\u2019ve tried that in a few stores and a little early to read results but that combined with the mix seems to be like it\u2019s a positive direction for us, and so I think we will continue on that path. The first primary mission here is to make sure the mix is more exciting than it has been in the path and we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. ", "David Glick - Buckingham Research ", "What\u2019s a reasonable amount of timeframe to get this business back to break-even, flat comp and hopefully moving into positive territory?", "Ernie Herrman", "Well, I would tell you, David, that actually what we are seeing now -- in this business, when you are seeing turns kick in the way it is, the customer is voting that they are liking now what they see out there. We\u2019ve had less inventory so I\u2019m seeing right now the sign of heading already in the right direction. By the way, we talked about this last fall, we were hoping to get to this point and I would say over the next six months-ish, I think we will be getting better comps out of the area. ", "David Glick - Buckingham Research ", "Great. Thanks very much. Good luck. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Jaffe. Please go ahead. ", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus  ", "Thanks very much. A follow-on question, I guess, about Europe; in the past, we\u2019ve heard about what Europe has taught you, particularly the U.K. business and bringing footwear into Marshalls, some other learnings. Are there other things that we can -- that you guys have gleaned from Europe that will apply to the Marmaxx business to help that grow and are there other initiatives within the Marmaxx box like Runway and Cube that we can look forward to in the current year?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, I think we have quite a few initiatives in Marmaxx in place now and I think as far as initiatives go, the go both ways across the ocean. The U.K. is just getting into jewelry and their accessory business is huge. Marmaxx has many, many tests underway and are in process of a new home prototype, the Cube, which is going to be over 300 and hasn\u2019t even launched yet, which we are seeing positive results. And there are many other categories that we are testing new things in and Ernie, you want to comment? Because I think there\u2019s a lot of new things going on in Marmaxx. ", "Ernie Herrman", "Yeah, I think within the business, we still feel very good obviously about our accessory business. I think that was mentioned earlier, so we\u2019re looking at different ways to accelerate that. As far as some of the other little test, I would hesitate to comment on any specifics at this point, as some of the results are too early to talk about, I think. ", "Certain ends of the fashion business obviously -- you know, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about our men\u2019s business and there were certain pockets of opportunity there. And I think the shoe mega rollout we will continue with aggressively. I think you guys are already aware of that. ", "So as Carol would say, it\u2019s marketing -- I think one of the big takeaways, I don\u2019t know if Carol touched on this a little earlier, is one of the big attitudes, the strategies we have in Marmaxx right now is looking at marketing where we actually get the results. And John Gilbert, who is on board right now, is really helping us with our finance area to determine where we get a pay-back, you have to be a little careful on this front because there is a bit of an art-form involved in marketing, but that to us is an initiative in itself, which is taking the marketing spend that we already have in place and being more efficient and more productive with it. So I think that could be a key -- a key [change] for us really down the road here this year and I think we can get some big payback. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think the other piece is in terms of home, the divisions are all working very close together and that is really terrific shared knowledge, which I think is helping Marmaxx get back on track in home. You know, Winners\u2019 business is very strong and HomeGoods has a lot going on, so they are spending a lot more time together, which I think is helping all the businesses. ", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus  ", "Great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michelle Clark. Please go ahead. ", "Analyst for Michelle Clark ", "It\u2019s actually [Chi Li] calling. Two quick questions on Germany, the first is can you quantify what the negative margin impact was from the German stores in the quarter? And second, in order to break even in Germany, how many stores do you need? Thanks. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Germany was about 10 basis points impact on margin. And for the second quarter, we expect that to be about the same, a little more. What was your other question?", "Analyst for Michelle Clark ", "The second question was how many stores in Germany do you need to start to break-even.", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Oh, I see. Okay. Well, right now all I can tell you is we have a three-year plan that projects, with the addition of about five stores a year, projects a break-even at the end of year three. That\u2019s the model we have out there. Obviously we will do our best to outperform that. ", "Analyst for Michelle Clark ", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Mann. Please go ahead. ", "David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company", "Thank you. In terms of gross margin, can you update your full year guidance for gross margin and also provide what you expect the gross margin range to be for Q2? And then in light of that, can you just also talk about the prospect for continuing merchandise margin growth as your compares get a little tougher in the rest of the year?", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Well, the full-year guidance right now, which obviously we haven\u2019t changed, is still at 10 to 20 basis points above last year, so we\u2019ve got a gross profit right now in the plan which is a low of 24.6 to 24.7, versus 24.5 last year. So since we are just -- we\u2019re not changing our guidance. That\u2019s what the numbers are at this point in time. ", "And as far as merchandise margin goes, we will just continue to be focused on driving that as we have been for many quarters now. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "David, some of the opportunities we still have, obviously now and in the back half and even coming up against a stronger second quarter, is we are much more liquid. We are very strategic seasonally and transitioning our businesses, and we see opportunity there. In addition, we are getting better and better on the supply chain in terms of customization and what goes to what stores and how we transition each store. So we still see some pretty good opportunity on the merchandise margin side of the business.", "David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company", "And the second quarter gross margin expectation?", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Second quarter gross margin right now what we\u2019ve got is a flat to minus 10, and keep in mind -- and the actual numbers are 23.9% to 24% versus 24% last year. And I would just ask you to keep in mind that we are continuing to face to a greater degree in the second quarter than the first the impact of fuel costs on merchandise margin, as well as the investments in the new businesses and buying and occupancy deleverage. So I think at the high end, a flat gross profit would be -- is what we are shooting for with all these [cons to the upset]. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "And our goal is certainly to beat that. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Absolutely. ", "David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. That was our last question and that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Please go ahead and disconnect at this time. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thank you very much and we look forward to the second quarter call.

(Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, President and CEO for the TJX Companies. Please go ahead.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Good morning. Before we begin, Sherry has some opening comments. ", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning.

", "Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third-party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript. ", "With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s press release posted on our website, www.tjx.com. ", "Thank you and I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Trip Tripathy, Jeff Naylor, and Ernie Herrman. I\u2019ll start by saying that we are very pleased with our second quarter performance. Our 24% increase in adjusted EPS excluding the charges detailed in today\u2019s press release was achieved on top of record results last year on an adjusted basis. The second quarter demonstrates once again our ability to deliver quarter on top of quarter a strong performance and continues our trend of strong results despite a highly promotional retail environment. ", "We executed well and marketed well and when the favorable weather in June boosted demand for summer apparel, our great values appealed to customers in challenging times. We are pleased that traffic continued to be up during the quarter, which bodes well for today as well as for the future. ", "I want to emphasize again that TJX is not only a company for tough times for but strong economic environments as well. In down economies, we tend to capture new customers, which is evident in our increased traffic and is an opportunity for us to build our customer base for the future. When times improve, our history has shown that our new customers stay with us because they love our values. At the same time, our pricing umbrella also rises when consumer demand is stronger, providing us an easier environment in which to operate. ", "I would like to address the commonly asked question regarding availability of merchandise and the impact on us when the department stores run with tighter inventories. Let me be clear -- TJX has over 500 buyers, buying in more than 60 countries, working with a universe of over 10,000 vendors and growing every day. ", "For example, one of our divisions opened several hundred new vendors in a period of three months. The impact of department stores tightening inventory levels gives us just as much opportunity and helps maintain a wider pricing gap between us and the department store and can increase average ticket. ", "In addition, we have built very strong vendor relationships, both domestically and internationally, allowing us to grow to a $20 billion company. I have complete faith that our model will allow us to continue to grow to $30 billion, $40 billion, and beyond. ", "We have seen in the past cycles that when we develop new vendor relationships in tough times, they have positive experiences with us and want to continue to do business with TJX in the future. As with new customers, when we add new vendors we are building relationships for the long-term. I\u2019ll say it again -- availability has never been an issue for us. Today\u2019s marketplace presents fantastic opportunities upon which we are capitalizing for the short and for the long-term. Further, while we are delivering consistent top and bottom line growth, we have a tremendous growth story to tell. Our strong operations allows us to reinvest for the future, even in a challenging consumer environment, which will serve us well when times improve. ", "As I mentioned on our first quarter conference call, our growth opportunities are plentiful and we are seeing exciting things. ", "Now to recap the consolidated numbers, net sales for the second quarter increased to $4.6 billion, 7% above last year. Consolidated comp store sales increased 4% over last year\u2019s 5% increase, which was above our plans. Foreign currency exchange benefited comp sales by approximately 0.5 percentage point, which was about what we had expected. ", "Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.45 this quarter, including the $0.02 impairment charge related to Bob\u2019s Stores detailed in today\u2019s press release. Last year\u2019s results include a $0.25 per share after-tax charge related to the computer intrusion. Excluding these charges, our adjusted earnings per share is $0.47, a 24% increase over the very strong adjusted $0.38 per share last year. ", "Overall, pretax profit margins was 6.9%. Excluding the charges I just mentioned, adjusted pretax profit margins increased by a strong 50 basis points above last year\u2019s 90 basis points improvement and above our plan. ", "Gross profit margin was up 40 basis points from last year to 24.4%, driven by strong merchandise margins despite the impact of higher fuel costs ", "SG&A expense was 17.5%, which included a negative impact of 30 basis points from the impairment charge. Excluding this charge, SG&A was 20 basis points favorable to last year and also favorable to plan. ", "In terms of inventories, at the end of the second quarter consolidated inventories on a per store basis were down 2%. We being the third quarter with very liquid inventory which positions us extremely well to take advantage of the enormous opportunities that the marketplace continues to present. ", "To recap the first half, which was above our expectations, EPS for the first six months was $0.88, which is 19% above last year\u2019s adjusted EPS excluding the intrusion charge for last year. The net impact on EPS of the $0.02 per share tax benefit in this year\u2019s first quarter and the $0.02 impairment charge in the second quarter was neutral. ", "Comp sales increased 4% for the first half over a 4% increase last year. We saw strong pretax profit gains in the first half over similar increases last year excluding the intrusions charge, which again speaks to our ability to deliver sustained profit growth. ", "Now to our divisional results, let\u2019s begin with our domestic concepts. At the Marmaxx group, our largest division, comp sales were up 3%, over a 3% increase last year and above our plan; segment profit was $298 million, up 18% over the prior year, and segment profit was 10.1%, up 110 basis points over last year, both well above our expectations.. ", "Marmaxx delivered an outstanding quarter on top of exceptional results last year. We\u2019ve been asked a lot about whether Marmaxx will return to peak margin levels, so I would like to point out that Marmaxx's segment profit margin in the second quarter was the strongest second quarter performance in nine years. ", "Through excellent execution, merchandise margins increased 70 basis points despite the increase in fuel costs. The Marmaxx organization also was extremely expensive in managing expenses. ", "Some brief highlights on categories: accessories and shoes were once again terrific. Accessories comped up 10% and footwear was up 8%. Kid\u2019s, men\u2019s and dresses were all above the chain. We are happy with the Cube and we will have a total of 340 of these departments by the end of the year. ", "With the continued success of footwear, we see further opportunities in this category. As you may have heard, we will be testing a new standalone shoe concept this fall, which is call the Shoe Megashop by Marshalls. We are excited about the potential for this concept but we are only in the test stage, as we are with many of our new ideas and initiatives. ", "As to home fashions at Marmaxx, we are feeling better about the improvements we are seeing in the business. As we discussed on prior calls, we have strategically lowered our inventory levels to identify the areas that are working. We are seeing significantly higher inventory turns and profitability is up. Comps are coming back in several categories and overall comps in home fashions were essentially flat to last year, again with leaner inventories. In addition, we have rolled out about 80 new home prototypes at Marmaxx this year and although early, we like the results we are seeing. We remain focused on improving our performance in home and believe we have opportunity for the back half. ", "Now to HomeGoods; comp sales at HomeGoods decreased 1% in the second quarter versus a 5% increase last year. Segment profit was $2.2 million, which was lower than last year and our expectations. We believe that HomeGoods' disappointing second quarter results were mostly a factor of our own execution issues. Having said that, traffic is healthy and up over last year. As we have discussed on our monthly reporting, we had some regional execution issues and also allowed too large a percentage of high ticket items into the mix, particularly given the weak home environment in certain regions. As I hope investors by now know, when we identify problems we work diligently to fix them. We took our medicine with extremely aggressive markdowns in the second quarter in order to enter the third quarter in a better position. ", "From a cost perspective, as we discussed on first quarter call, HomeGoods gets hits harder by the negative impact of fuel increases than our other divisions, due to the higher costs of shipping home product. We have initiatives in place to mitigate this cost pressure and we have begun to see some benefit but we are continuing to work on it. ", "As to new things going on at HomeGoods this fall, we will be testing a larger store layout with the first store opening planned in West Port, Connecticut in September. The new layout, which is about 37,000 square feet, will allow us to expand certain highly productive categories that our existing square footage cannot accommodate. We are also seeing good results in a few new categories. We will be expanding these new initiatives while cutting back on some categories that are not performing as well. ", "Moving to A.J. Wright, which continued to make very solid progress in the second quarter, comp sales increased by a strong 6%, which was above our plan. On the bottom line, A.J. cut its segment loss in half, which was significantly better than last year and in line with our plan. We are very pleased with A.J. Wright's second quarter performance and are feeling more and more positive about this business. We believe that we have a better handle [on our] customer than ever before and that we have the right marketing campaign. We continue to like the progress we are seeing in A.J. Wright stores\u2019 contribution and are getting closer to levels that would give us the confidence to accelerate the rollout of new stores. ", "We continue to be conservative; however, as this business is in a very good place, we are now planning on opening an additional market or two next year. Long-term, we continue to view A.J. Wright as a vehicle with tremendous growth potential and believe the U.S. could ultimately support 500 to 1,000 stores. ", "Finally on our domestic divisions, at Bob\u2019s Stores although comp sales were disappoint, Bob\u2019s Stores managed expenses well in the second quarter. In addition, they continue to buy better and improve their mark-on. As we have said on prior calls, we are evaluating this business. ", "Now to our international division -- let\u2019s start with the Canadian businesses, which had  a fantastic second quarter. For the second quarter, comp sales in Canada increased 12% in U.S. dollars. In local currency, which we believe better reflects our operating performance, comps increased by a remarkable 6% over a challenging 7% compare last year. Segment profit increased 27% to $60 million and segment profit margin increased 100 basis points to 11.2%, which significantly exceeded last year and our expectations. ", "Winners\u2019 exceptional quarter is all about execution. The Winners organization is doing an outstanding job of remaining flexible, buying right, and flowing great products at great values to our stores. ", "HomeSense in Canada continued to do terrifically well. On the top and the bottom line, HomeSense contributed huge increases over enormous huge increases last year. ", "We have mentioned our plans to test a new off-price concept in that country and I am excited to tell you more about its launch. Again, as with any new idea or concept we develop, we will test and be very methodical in our approach. Our new business is called StyleSense and will offer predominantly family footwear and accessories. These categories continue to perform extremely well for us at Winners and across our chains and we see this as having potential to expand our presence in Canada. We have two store openings planned this fall with one next spring, and the box will be about 14,000 square feet in size. ", "Now let\u2019s move to our European businesses, beginning with T.K. Maxx in the U.K. and Ireland, second quarter comps increased 4% in U.S. dollars and increased 5% in local currency, which again we believe better reflects our operating performance. ", "Segment profit at T.K. Maxx in the U.K. and Ireland excluding our investment in new European businesses, increased to $21 million in the second quarter, which was above our plans. Segment profit margin excluding our new European businesses increased 60 basis points to 3.9%, well above our plan. ", "Including the investments in T.K. Maxx Germany and HomeSense in the U.K., our total segment profit in Europe in the second quarter decreased to $14 million from $16 million last year, and segment profit margin was 2.5%, again above our plan. ", "In the U.K. and Ireland, T.K. Maxx delivered another outstanding quarter in the face of a highly promotional retail environment. By sharply executing the fundamentals, this division is driving strong results and we believe is gaining market share in this tough environment. ", "Our T.K. Maxx stores in Germany are performing beyond our expectations on the top and bottom line. We continue to are seeing inventory turns equivalent to the U.K., which is really impressive. With strong merchandise margins, the bottom line results of our German operations were favorable to our plan for the second quarter. While still early days, we feel very well-positioned in Germany. Our vendor base is very strong and the large majority of product in our German stores is sourced directly in Germany. ", "In terms of store growth, we plan to end 2008 with 10 stores and are looking at the possibility of accelerating our store growth plan slightly next year. ", "HomeSense, which we brought across the pond from Canada to the U.K. this spring, is off to a good start. Our plan is to end the year with six HomeSense stores in the U.K. ", "Now I want to spend a moment on our vision to grow TJX as a global off-price value retailer. I talked in detail on our last call about our plentiful opportunities to grow our company both domestically and internationally. We have a tremendous advantage in that our core businesses are performing extremely well and funding our growth vehicles, such as A.J. Wright and T.K. Maxx Germany, along with some of our newer test concepts. ", "Ultimately, we believe we can grow to more than 4300 stores with our current portfolio in the countries where we currently operate. This does not include some of the tests we talked about today. We see enormous growth potential in the future and have solid strategies in place to support our goals. ", "Key to our strategy is building a global organization that will position our company for future success. To that end, we have made a number of important senior management changes that I would like to share with you. Ernie Hermann has been promoted to Senior Executive Vice President and Group President with the responsibility for Marmaxx, Winners, corporate human resources, and brand development. Ernie continues to report directly to me in his new role. ", "Michael McMillan, previously Chairman of Winners, has been promoted to Chairman of the Marmaxx Group, reporting to Ernie. ", "Bob [Tipalo], previously COO of HomeGoods, has been promoted to President of Winners, also reporting to Ernie Hermann. ", "In addition, in Europe we have taken significant steps to strengthen the organization. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we have formed a new shared service structure that we call TJX Europe. We are highly committed to our recruitment efforts and are hiring some of the best talent available. Recently, we added a CFO of TJX Europe and a managing director of T.K. Maxx Germany. ", "Building our global organization is a top priority for us. With these moves, we are continuing to groom executives who have corporate and global experience so that they can be tapped to run any business anytime, domestically or internationally. ", "Further, we recently enhanced our world-class executive training program, which is one of the few training programs of its kind remaining in the retail industry. ", "Now I\u2019d like to discuss our financial strength in terms of our share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we repurchased $225 million of TJX stock, retiring 7 million shares. Through the second quarter this year, we spent a total of $450 million in share repurchases and bought back 14 million shares. We continue to expect to repurchase at least $900 million of TJX stock in fiscal 2008. ", "Moving to guidance for the third quarter and the full year, in the third quarter we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.62. This compares to $0.54 in diluted earnings per share, or an increase of 9% to 15% over the prior year. This outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%. While we believe these are prudent goals for the third quarter, I can tell you that as in the second quarter, we are motivated to surpass them. Trip will provide more detail on this guidance in a moment. ", "For the fiscal 2009, we are raising our previous guidance. We now expect fully diluted EPS of $2.26 to $2.31, including the benefit of the 53rd week. This range compares to a reported EPS of $1.66 in the prior year, which included a $0.25 per share charge related to the previously announced computer intrusion. Excluding the 53rd week impact and the prior year\u2019s intrusion charge, our guidance is in the range of $2.17 to $2.22, a 14% to 16% increase over the adjusted $1.91 earned last year. These estimates are based on an estimated comp store sales increase of approximately 3% for the full year. ", "Our full year guidance assumes fourth quarter EPS of $0.79 to $0.81, including the benefit of the 53rd week, and $0.70 to $0.72 without that benefit. ", "Summing up, I\u2019ll recap the major points. First, our expected EPS this year represents the third consecutive year of significant earnings growth excluding the intrusions charge last year. Our 14% to 16% estimated range for EPS growth this year is on top of a 17% increase last year, which was on top of a 26% increase the prior year -- again excluding the intrusions charge. Certainly our goal will be to beat the back half numbers.", "Second, while we are driving these strong results, we are building for the future. By not taking our eye off our cash engines, Marmaxx and Winners, which by the way we see growth in, we are fueling our other major growth vehicles. We are in a great position with our core businesses doing extremely well and our growth vehicles are beginning to work. In addition, we are continuously testing initiatives and we will never stop. ", "Third, we have tremendous opportunities to grow our concepts globally. In this call alone, we\u2019ve talked about the possibility of a new market at A.J. Wright, testing a standalone footwear concept at Marshalls, the launch of StyleSense in Canada, and our early success in Germany and with HomeSense in the U.K. We have solid strategies in place to achieve our goals for growth and are creating a global organization that combines the best of the TJX experience with fresh perspectives.  ", "Fourth, expense management remains a key focus area, which helps fund our investments in new businesses as well as other marketing initiatives. ", "Fifth, our extremely solid financials give us great confidence in our ability to invest in the future growth while returning value to our shareholders. ", "And finally, our no-walls approach to communications continues to pay dividends as we share ideas, initiatives, talent, and best practices across all of our divisions. ", "As we begin the second half of 2008, our chief goal remains driving profitable sales. I can\u2019t say it enough; it\u2019s about execution, execution, execution every day. We are upbeat about the back half. We see exciting product in the pipeline, and believe our marketing will resonate with existing and new customers.", "I look forward to updating you on our progress in the third quarter and now I\u2019m going to turn it over to Trip. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Thank you, Carol and good morning, everyone. Carol has really hit the major points of the strong quarter. On a sales basis, I want to emphasize that transactions were up across all of our off price divisions, which indicates that we are gaining market share. ", "On the bottom line, expenses were very well managed overall. That said, our work in this regard is never done and one of our major objectives continues to be cost management. ", "Before I cover the third quarter guidance, just to avoid any confusion I want to recap our first half results and how that impacts our full-year guidance. The net impact of the $0.02 tax benefit in the first quarter and the $0.02 impairment charge in the second quarter is neutral to EPS. Therefore, the net impact of these items to our full year diluted EPS range is neutral. So for modeling purposes, people can include both or exclude both because either way, the net impact to EPS is neutral. ", "Now to guidance -- for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.59 to $0.62, which represents a 9% to 15% increase over $0.54 per share in the prior year. We are assuming a third quarter top line of approximately $5.1 billion with a comp sales increase of 2% to 3% on a consolidated basis with a neutral impact from foreign exchange rates, and a 2% to 3% comp sales increase at the Marmaxx Group. ", "As to monthly comps, on a consolidated basis we expect comp sales increases in the range of 1% to 2% in August, 2% to 3% in September, and 1% to 2% in October. For Marmaxx, we are planning on comp sales to be flat to up 1% in August and up 2% to 3% in both September and October. ", "We are planning third quarter gross margin in the range of 25.2% to 25.4%, flat to up 20 basis points from last year, and SG&A as a percent of sales to be flat to 10 basis points favorable to last year at 16.7% to 16.6%.", "Pretax profit margins are planned in the 8.4% to 8.6% range, essentially flat to prior year. As a reminder, we begin to anniversary investments in our new European businesses in the third quarter.", "For modeling purposes, we are planning a tax rate of approximately 38.6% and weighted average outstanding shares of $441 million. ", "To keep the call on schedule, we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Thank you and we\u2019ll take questions now. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Todd Slater.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Carol, I know you said you see exciting product in the pipeline. I think you made that point pretty clear. I think the bear case really says the quality of the product, not the quantity but the quality is apt to deteriorate -- in other words, say goodbye to a lot of the low-hanging fruit and contemporary luxury and bridge and so on and so forth. So I\u2019m wondering, if you look at your mix for holiday and the for spring, and maybe spring is way too far out there but -- because you are buying a lot more off price, but what do you see -- do you see -- you know, talk a little bit about the mix in terms of quality of the better product that is really exciting the customer right now. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, Todd, we are relentless in our quest for always raising the bar, so I can\u2019t talk to fourth quarter because obviously we are very, very liquid but I can tell you that what we do have in the pipeline is very new. And again, as I said before, our buyers are out all over the world and I do not see the quality of our merchandise deteriorating in any way. As a matter of fact, I see the group as a whole testing a lot of new things and upgrading and trying new countries. ", "So I certainly don\u2019t see a deterioration; if anything, I see progress, and that\u2019s what we talk about every day.  ", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick.", "Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan", "I guess our question really is just focusing on the merchandise margin at the Marmaxx division. Just trying to understand -- I mean, how much of that was just your lean inventory and lower markdowns versus the markups on the better buying? And just also about the second half, should we expect that you will continue to have these nine-year high operating margins at Marmaxx?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I\u2019m going to comment just in general and then I am going to hand it over to Ernie. You know, Marmaxx just continues again to execute very well. They were very, very liquid, very seasonally appropriate. They are really managing all aspects of it so we are going to continue obviously to work hard at improving the margins, and I will hand it over to Ernie. ", "Ernie Herrman", "Brian, just what Carol said, we talked about it on the last conference call, you know, we maintain that liquidity position really for most of the back half and I think we are getting it on both sides -- markdowns and on buying goods better, so it\u2019s really a combination. We maintain that liquidity, so going into third quarter, I mean, it\u2019s just the way we feel is wise to operate in this environment and really in any environment. So I think we\u2019ll get it on both sides of the equation. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "One other comment, Brian, is we continue -- I think I\u2019ve talked about it in the past quite a bit, that some of our investment is in the supply chain. And again, that will allow us over time to continuously do a better job of allocating to the particular store and demographics better and better as we go forward, which again obviously helps in terms of optimizing markdowns. ", "Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "I think you mentioned, Trip, in your prepared remarks that transactions were up across all of your off-price businesses. I just wanted to follow-up on that see if you were seeing an increase in ticket as well, or if tickets were roughly flattish. And my main question is for Carol -- Carol, it sounds like you are seeing encouraging things coming out of A.J. Wright and I was just wondering if you could share with us what are the metrics you are looking at for that division as you consider whether or not to go forward with more store openings and expansions there, and roughly timing if you think you would look to accelerate those openings. Thanks. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I\u2019ll answer the A.J. Wright and then I\u2019m going to hand it over to Trip. As far as A.J. Wright, we\u2019re just seeing constant improvement in the four-wall contribution. This year right through the second half, I think we are up over 200 basis points, which is really a vast improvement. ", "It doesn\u2019t mean, Kimberly, that we are going to just suddenly add on 50 stores. We are going to look at a couple of new markets for next year. We are going to probably accelerate slightly but as we always are, we are careful, conservative, and we want to see continuous results. But we are very, very pleased with what we are seeing. We just think we have a terrific team there that is really understanding the business and what needs to be done at this point. ", "So I think again we\u2019re here half a year ago with a lot more education and a lot more knowledge.", "Trip, do you want to talk to the transactions?", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Kimberly, so first of all to confirm, every off-price business had positive transactions, which for us is a proxy for traffic, and then the second thing is our average ticket was relatively flat for the quarter. ", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Great. Thank you and good luck here. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dana Cohen.", "Dana Cohen - Banc of America Securities", "I was wondering if you could break out by company as well as Marmaxx the merchandising margin versus fuel piece. And then my major question really is on HomeGoods, if you could just break out the composition of the earnings decline by pieces. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Dana, we don\u2019t usually -- we can do -- we can certainly go offline. We don\u2019t usually break down by specific company, and I will talk to HomeGoods a little bit in terms of the fuel because it did hit them hard, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Trip. ", "I think with HomeGoods, I think when I talked about execution, part of the execution was in the mix. But I think part of the execution was not understanding the ramification of big furniture and the impact on fuel, so it took its toll on the HomeGoods bottom line this quarter. ", "They have gotten their arms around it and are getting their arms around it and I think it is an opportunity for the back half, but it did hit them extremely hard. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Dana, I\u2019ll just give you some top line merchandise margin improvements numbers -- for TJX in total, it was 80 basis points and that was after absorbing the impact of increased fuel costs on merchandise margin, which was about 20 basis points. And then at Marmaxx, the merchandise margin improvement was about 70 basis points. ", "Dana Cohen - Banc of America Securities", "And in terms of -- it was 70 basis points after fuel?", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Yes, and at HomeGoods in general, I\u2019m not going to break the number out there but in general, the fuel impacts there are at a much higher level simply because of the bulkiness of the freight that they handle and the larger number of trips that have to be made to deliver similar merchandise, so it hits harder there. And then of course the merchandise margin there was hit by markdowns, et cetera, as we -- ", "Dana Cohen - Banc of America Securities", "Is there any way to just order of magnitude of the $7 million decline, you know, what percent was due to fuel, what percent was due to the markdowns? I mean, the business had a pretty big decline in profitability. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "A large percent was fuel, Dana. ", "Dana Cohen - Banc of America Securities", "Most of that was fuel?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "A big chunk of it. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "A big chunk was. We can detail that out for you after this call. ", "Dana Cohen - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, perfect. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Black.", "Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers", "Carol, on Europe, do you think there\u2019s hard evidence that the businesses perform in downturns like they do over here domestically on a relative sense?", "And then a question for Trip as a follow-up -- is it possible next year, given all the investments, that we still see this level of stock buy-back, or do we think -- or should we assume rather that that is -- that the buy-back goes to lower levels in the $600 million range? Thanks. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Let me answer the buy-back question -- first of all, I would say the three-year plan that we put out there holds us at the $900 million a year stock buy-back level and frankly, we have no plans to change that. So I would just tell you the plan is $900 million for next year, at a minimum, and we remain committed to that. ", "As you know, we generate a lot of cash and we have a very aggressive -- you know, positively aggressive capital spending program and we will still have -- and a good dividend program as well, I might add. And after all of that, we still have more than enough cash to support a very healthy stock buy-back program. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In terms of Europe, first of all T.K. has shown obviously improvement in segment profit year over year and they just have continued that trend. I think that you may -- I am sure you are aware that the U.K., the retail environment has gotten pretty tough. I think it was as much as 6% decrease, if I recall, last month in the retail sales segment. So I think -- again, I think in good times and bad times, that model is an absolutely terrific model. I think the other thing that is happening is that they are just becoming more and more known in Europe, and as we grow the businesses, as we go into Germany, just T.K. Maxx as a business is becoming again, from a marketing perspective, very, very high awareness, so I think that\u2019s a piece of it and I think that will continue. ", "But I think it probably reacts pretty similar to the United States in terms of the economics. ", "Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers", "Great, thanks. Good luck. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "Just a quick follow-up question -- you talked about the business internally. Could you just talk about your view on the competitive outlook? Obviously it\u2019s a tough economy, a tough economic outlook for fall. You guys are bullish, you are doing very well but clearly your competitors aren\u2019t. Historically in this scenario, your competitors tend to falter before you do and put pricing pressure on you guys. Do you see anything different this year, particularly with the consolidation of department stores that improved your outlook in this competitive way?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Again, Richard, we\u2019re always about the difference between where our competitors are, that span. And so whether they have leaner inventories and their price point is at a certain place, we\u2019re always working towards giving that great value versus them. ", "I\u2019m going to come back to saying if we execute well, then we do well. So I can sit there and make comments about the outside world but I really have to say that it\u2019s about what we do in our business and execute every day and give the consumer a great value and that\u2019s what we are sticking to. ", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "Very good. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Adrienne Shapira.", "Adrienne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Just in terms of the comp plan, it looks as if you are lapping an easier Q3 in terms of comparison, yet you are planning a more modest 2 to 3, and it sounds as if the quarter is a little bit more back-end loaded, so is that a function of perhaps the checks that we saw this quarter had some positive impact in saving a little bit in the near-term? What is driving that?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, we basically planned -- well, we\u2019ve been planning the quarters pretty much around the 3 mark, so obviously we like to plan our comps conservatively and we beat them and that leverage is to the bottom line and that\u2019s our goal every quarter. But in terms of August, we are going into August with less clearance than we had last year. We also believe that we have put a lot of our marketing dollars into September because we think that the back-to-school time period will probably shift a little bit later, so that\u2019s why we have set this up strategically in the way that we have. ", "Adrienne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. That makes sense, and then just a follow-up on HomeGoods, I think you discussed the promotions. I wasn\u2019t clear who would be heading this division now. It sounds like there was a promotion out of the division, so if you could share that -- is that a spot there that has to be filled?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "No, we have filled that internally. Actually, we had somebody that was backed up quite a while ago and we\u2019ve been working with that person for a long period of time. ", "Ernie Herrman", "But it was the COO job. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "The COO job, right. ", "Adrienne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then just in terms of -- you shed some light in terms of initiatives that you are focusing on to see some positive impact there. Any sense in terms of timing? You\u2019ve obviously been pretty impatient in terms of poor execution. Just any sense in terms of when we can see some lift out of HomeGoods?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I would say closer to the back-end of Q3 and I think Q4 is looking pretty good but it is not going to happen tomorrow. We have to shift some of the categories, some of the larger furniture into accent furniture, so we have a little bit of work to do. But I think we\u2019ll start to see progress towards the end of Q3. ", "Adrienne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. ", "Nirmal K. Tripathy", "Dana, just to go back and partially answer your question on HomeGoods, we had a 210 basis point decline in margin in the second quarter at HomeGoods, so just to let you know about 150 of that was due to markdowns and freight and fuel impact. That just goes back to the point about cleaning up the inventory in the second quarter. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez.", "Tracy Cogan - Credit Suisse", "It\u2019s actually Tracy Cogan filling in for Paul. I just wanted to follow-up on a previous question about A.J. and I was hoping you guys could talk more specifically about some of the initiatives in specific categories that you have put into place, particularly in homes, and how you have seen the performance improve. ", "And also, if you could tell us a little bit more what you are doing on the marketing side, that would help. Thanks so much. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In terms of A.J.\u2019s, we have some -- the core drivers that we look at are really accessories, shoes, juniors, young men\u2019s, kid\u2019s and basics. We had home, which was an area that we felt we really needed to fix, which we believe we have. So those are the core drivers of A.J. Wright. ", "We are very, very focused on execution and value and in addition to that, we talked about the expansion but I think this is a very good environment for real estate opportunities for A.J.\u2019s. ", "In terms of the marketing, last year we were not focused I think on the right elements that drove the business. I think this year we are and I won\u2019t specifically tell you our marketing plans because of competitive reasons, but I think we understand how to get to this customer now and I think we have the right media to do that. ", "Tracy Cogan - Credit Suisse", "Can you also talk for a second about what categories you are targeting next in terms of areas to improve?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In A.J.\u2019s?", "Tracy Cogan - Credit Suisse", "In A.J., yes. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It\u2019s a building process. The areas that I just mentioned are key to this business and are we comping over comp. To give you an example, accessories is a 19% increase over a 5% increase last year. Footwear we had a 23% increase last year and we are very, very strong this year against those numbers. So it\u2019s continuing to focus on those areas and drive them even harder. ", "Tracy Cogan - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dana Telsey.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Carol, I\u2019ve been hearing the word global a lot in your prepared remarks. I just want to understand what do you see as the sales and margin opportunity as you expand globally, what are the infrastructure costs or timing, how important do you think it becomes? Thank you. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well obviously, we certainly build in the U.K. Germany, I think the U.K., our model is about 8% is our goal. We think Germany can probably range close to that, between 7% and 8%. Real estate tends to be a little less costly in Germany than it is in the U.K. But Dana, as with everything, we build our infrastructure, we are conservative. We will look at Germany, we will have 10 stores by the end of this year. Next year we may, if we trigger it a little bit harder, we are probably talking about maybe another three to five stores. ", "So we\u2019ll continue to build it, be careful, and support it but we like the global infrastructure that we are building over there which will be able to really leverage -- you know, if Germany ends up we think being 200 to 300 stores, there may be more opportunity in the future. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re building it. We don\u2019t be diving into five or six more countries immediately. We think we\u2019ve got quite a bit going on there now that we can build upon. ", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Montagna.", "Mark Montagna - C.L. King & Associates", "Just a question about marketing -- in your press release, you mentioned you are trying to acquire more customers. Can you talk about how you are doing that? Have you adjusted your marketing overall for the Marmaxx division? Just how you are addressing that issue. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We will not get specific in terms of our strategy there. I can tell you that we tested many new ideas and we are -- you will look forward to seeing what is on TV in the near future because we think it really hits the heart and soul of not only our customers but new customers and this is after we\u2019ve done quite a bit of testing. So you will see it in the back half and we are pretty excited about it. ", "Mark Montagna - C.L. King & Associates", "Okay, and then how about an update on the status of your non-merchandise procurement initiative?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, obviously you saw that we were able to mitigate fuel. We are just beginning, I spoke last time, we have somebody on board that has procurement directly reporting to them, so we are really just beginning that project, so we see a pretty big opportunity there. You saw some benefits in in-store labor from the Marmaxx numbers and we are working on damages -- I mean, there are many, many initiatives that we have been improving on and best practices in the DCs. That certainly helps some of our divisions in the DCs and it continues. ", "So it\u2019s going to be a neverending project but it is certainly going to help us fuel new businesses, new ideas, supply chain, so we are reinvesting some of those dollars and some of it will go to the bottom line but this is an ongoing process. ", "Mark Montagna - C.L. King & Associates", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Marni Shapiro.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "All my questions have been asked. Congratulations on a great quarter and congratulations to Ernie, because it sounds like he\u2019s a big [inaudible] now, and everything else I will follow-up with Sherry offline. Good luck to you guys for back to school. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question is from David Glick.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "My questions have mostly been asked -- just a quick one on Canada; can you give us a sense, you know, the environment there has been very strong. Can you give us a sense what your team is saying there on the ground and are there market share shifts out of department stores? You guys are obviously up against tough comparisons going forward, as you have been up against them this year, but some color on Canada would be helpful. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think with the Canadian guys, we have to kind of keep their excitement in line because again, I think we have built HomeSense, which now customers, there is such a high awareness. We think that Canada is just -- has tremendous opportunities in that there\u2019s a lot of retailers up there that are just having a very tough time. But I will come back to, and I hate to just keep saying it again and again, but Canada really has executed very well and I think they are building upon the knowledge that they have. They have tested a lot of new categories, so we believe there is still some opportunity and it will continue in Canada but it\u2019s truly about execution. ", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "Okay, great. Thanks. And any color you can give us on the mix of your new U.S. footwear concept, how you see the mix in footwear in those stores?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think you\u2019ll have to shop it and you\u2019ll see. ", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "I will do that. Thanks. Good luck. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thank you, and we look forward to our Q3 call. Thanks, everyone. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. You may all disconnect.

Welcome to the TJX Company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, President and CEO for the TJX Companies.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Good morning. Before we begin, Sherry is going to make a few comments.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company\u2019s results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company\u2019s plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 26, 2008.

Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third-party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript. Please note that we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange in our consolidated results and our international divisions in today\u2019s press release and the Investor Information section of our website, www.tjx.com. ", "The comparable store sales numbers that we talk about today our on a constant currency basis, which is how we will be reporting these numbers going forward. We have also provided the last five years of comparable store sales on a constant currency basis on our website. Finally, to be consistent, all the comparable store sales results we are expressing today exclude the impact of the 53rd week, however, all of our other financial measures include the effect of the additional week.", "With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s press release posted on our website, www.tjx.com in the Investor Information section. ", "Thank you and I\u2019ll turn it back to Carol. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Jeff Naylor who in addition to as well as Chief Administrative Officer has been billed as CFO position, and Ernie Herrman.", "I have been looking forward to this call. We are going to change up our approach a bit. I\u2019m going to have Jeff take you our full year and fourth quarter results first, and then I will share our outlook for 2009 and why we believe that TJX is positioned not only well, but better than most, to weather these tough times.", "I am also going to tell you why we believe TJX will emerge from this recession in a stronger, competitive position for the long term.", "So here\u2019s Jeff to recap the numbers for this past year and fourth quarter.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "What I am going to do is begin with the consolidated results on continuing operations basis for the full year. Net sales for the 53-week fiscal year increased to $19.0 billion. That\u2019s 4% above last year\u2019s $18.3 billion. Our consolidated comp store sales were up 1% for the full year, which was below our plan and was up against last year\u2019s 2% increase.", "On a reported basis full year diluted EPS was $2.08 compared with $1.68 last year. We have included a chart in today\u2019s press release that details the effect of the computer intrusions and tax-related adjustments on EPS, so you will see that in the release. Excluding these items, adjusted full year diluted EPS was $2.01 compared with $1.93 last year.", "I should note that this year\u2019s results also include a $0.09 per share benefit from the 53rd week in our fiscal 2009 calendar and a net $0.05 per share negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates and these are also laid out in the release.", "Overall, pre-tax profit margins for the year on a reported basis were 7.6%, that\u2019s up 70  basis points from last year. When we exclude the intrusion-related reserve items from both years the adjusted consolidated pre-tax profit margin for the year was 7.5% and that\u2019s down 40 basis points from last year, and let me take you through the cause of change.", "To begin, gross profit margin was 30 basis points below last year. Merchandise margins were up over last year but they were more than offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage on the lower cost. And Carol will discuss in a moment how we are going to address this going forward.", "The 53rd week benefited gross profit margin by approximately 20 basis points and just FYI for modeling purposes, the majority of the 53rd week benefit is in the gross profit line. ", "SG&A expense was up 10 basis points versus last year, primarily due to the deleveraging impact of the 1% comp but partially offset by our ongoing cost reduction efforts.", "And then in terms of inventories, at the end of the fourth quarter consolidated inventories on a per store basis were down 5%. We exited the year with less winter clearance merchandise and entered the new year with far more liquidity and fewer dollars committed forward than at this time last year on a per-store basis. This includes the warehouses, stores, and merchandise on order.", "So we are extremely well positioned with our inventories, which we believe will help us combat this challenging retail environment.", "So that\u2019s the year. Let me now recap fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter net sales were $5.4 billion, which was flat with last year. Our consolidated comp store sales decreased 2% versus a 2% increase last year. On a reported basis diluted EPS was $0.58 versus $0.67 last year. Excluding computer intrusion-related adjustments in both years, the adjusted earnings per share was $0.55 versus $0.65 last year and above our latest expectations. So we were about $0.04 above the consensus in the high-end of our guidance. $0.02 were due to the stronger than expected operating margins, $0.01 was attributable to a favorable tax rate, and $0.01 was due to currency translation having less of a negative impact that we had originally anticipated.", "The 53rd week positively impacted EPS in the quarter by about $0.09 while the overall net negative impact of foreign exchange was $0.10 per share versus the $0.02 benefit that we received from foreign exchange last year. and if we exclude these factors EPS was down $0.11 from the prior year on a comparable basis. and again, we have laid that out in the press release as well.", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margin on a reported basis was 7.4%, again, excluding the impact of the inventory-related hedges and the intrusion-related reserve reductions from both years. The adjusted pre-tax profit margin was 7.6% versus 8.4% last year, down 80 basis points.", "And again, to walk you through that 80 basis points, the gross profit margin declined 180 basis points on a reported basis. it is important to note that 100 of this was due to the negative impact of the inventory-related hedge adjustments. So excluding these adjustments, the gross profit margin was down 80 basis points, primarily due to buying and occupancy cost deleverage, which more than offset the benefit of the 53rd week, which parenthetically we estimate to be 70 basis points.", "Merchandise margins were flat, excluding the impact of foreign exchange against last year\u2019s very strong performance as we brought our inventories down throughout the quarter to protect margins.", "SG&A costs were 10 basis points favorable versus last year and SG&A dollar spending was favorable to plan.", "Net interest expense was up 10 basis points versus prior year, and I should note that the higher interest expense versus last year was basically offset by the benefit of a lower tax rate year-over-year.", "Now let me turn the call back to Carol for our outlook on 2009 and the long-term and at the end of the call I will recap our first quarter guidance.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "As I said earlier, I want to share with you the actions we have taken that I believe position this company well to weather this recession. I also want to outline how we have solidly positioned TJX for when times improve and to pursue our long-term strategy, which has not changed.", "Our plans for 2009 assume a deep recession for most of the year and we have taken a very conservative approach. The three main planks of our approach are planning comp sales very conservatively, running with historically lean inventories, and taking out at last $150.0 million from our cost structure. As to how we are handling guidance, with all of the volatility in the economic environment, we will be giving guidance for the first quarter. For the full year we will provide guidance around a number of elements of our P&L and balance sheet with some assumptions related to the model.", "Broadly speaking, what I can tell you is that we are setting our inventory and expense plans around the negative low single-digit comp in line with our fourth quarter trend. In terms of sensitivities, however, while we are not assuming a flat comp, you should know that our FY2010 model would deliver essentially flat EPS on a flat comp and that\u2019s with $0.14 of currency-related pressure.", "Without the impact of currency, the model would deliver essentially flat EPS at a negative $0.02 comp which underscores the expense of operating margin improvement embedded in the model. And Jeff will elaborate on all of this later on the call.", "Now let me share with you the details of our approach. First, as I just mentioned, we are planning comps very conservatively. We believe that this is not only to protect our bottom line but also gives us opportunity and positions the company to be even stronger long term.  We have many actions underway to drive sales and to the extent that we exceed our conservative comp expectations, we will create a flow-through to the bottom line.", "Let me highlight just a few of our opportunities to drive sales in the is environment. With much leaner inventories we are buying even better and closer to need. This creates even more excitement in our stores and the intensity fresher than ever. Delivering great fashions and brands at extreme value is foremost. We see ourselves as a shopping destination for both moderate and high-end brands at low-end prices.", "Our traffic count is up, which clearly tells us that we are well positioned for today and the long term. We are aggressively shifting our purchase dollars to the right categories and initiatives in order to drive sales. As always, we continue to expand the initiatives at work and to test new ones, and we have many underway.", "Lastly, on sales drivers, we will be bolder in our marketing and more aggressive in communicating our value message to the customers. While we will be reducing our marketing spend in 2009 we will be increasing our TV presence by four to five weeks and hitting 35% of our markets that have never seen our brand on TV before. I am very excited about our marketing campaign for 2009.", "The second major strategy that we will pursue in 2009 is to run with very lean inventories to drive faster turn and even stronger merchandise margins. With intent we entered the year with more inventory liquidity and greater open to buy than I have ever seen or ever remember. For 2009 we are planning inventory levels down to low to mid-single digits throughout the year on a per-store basis on top of decreases we had at the end of this past year. With conservative inventory management and strong buying opportunity, we believe merchandise margins will be up across all divisions with the exception of Winners, due to the higher cost of the U.S. dollar purchases, which we will discuss later in more detail. On a consolidated basis, we believe merchandise margins will be up for the year.", "Third, to protect our bottom line, we have taken a comprehensive series of actions to reduce costs. With these actions we believe SG&A dollars will be essentially flat for the year on a constant currency basis and down on a reported basis. These actions span all areas of the company and most were announced to our organization earlier this week.", "As I mentioned, in total these actions are worth approximately $150.0 million of savings to the bottom line in 2009. Some of the major actions we are taking encompass the following:", "We are driving further savings in non-merchandise procurement, which we started this initiative a few years ago; we are implementing processes to more efficiently manage payroll in our stores and distribution centers; we are reducing our marketing spend, as I mentioned, but increasing penetration; we have frozen headcount since September 2008 from our eliminating open positions; further, we are eliminating merit pay increases across the majority of the organization; we are also restructuring certain areas to improve productivity and efficiency; and will be offering a voluntary retirement program.", "I should note that these reflect our actions at this time. We have identified potential opportunities in other areas, including freight, and more in non-merchandise procurement. We are maintaining our flexibility and keeping our options open to take additional actions should the environment worsen.", "In today\u2019s economic environment our organization is more focused than ever on executing even better and even smarter, understanding that this is what will drive our success in the short and the long term. I am confident that strong execution today will help us be an even bigger player in what will be a smaller retail landscape.", "Our long-term vision of a company as a global off-price value retailer has not changed. While the execution of our vision has shifted to accommodate the current retail environment, I am confident that with the right strategies in place we will come out of the recession with an even greater competitive edge.", "Today we are gaining market share in a challenging environment with the strength of our value proposition. Value is where you want to be in this economy. In 2008 our comp sales were at the high end of the retail industry and our customer traffic remains healthy. We believe that our momentum will continue. Our history tells us that when we capture new customers they stay with us when times improve. This is key because even a slight increase in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending and capturing a piece of that in our average baskets would be very meaningful for our business.", "The consolidation we are seeing in the retail sector also offers major opportunities for us to gain market share. according to recent data bankruptcies and store closures to date across apparel and home fashion retailers will result in approximately 1,200 closed stores and a $10.0 billion market share opportunity. This is just what has been announced and sadly, there will likely be more to come.", "As everyone knows, consumer demand has decreased significantly but the fact that the retail landscape is also shrinking creates an opportunity for TJX.", "I talked about future real estate opportunities in the third quarter conference call and we are now beginning to see some of these opportunities come to fruition. The deals we are seeing are truly advantageous. Further, when I talked about real estate deals, not only about opening new stores but also opportunities to renegotiate more favorable leases and relocate stores to better locations. We have committed to fewer locations for 2009, allowing us to be very opportunistic.", "Our younger and new concepts are performing well despite the current economic climate. In the U.S. A. J. Wright made significant improvement and held up very well in 2008 and is off to a very good start in 2009. Four-walls profitability was up significantly last year, which gives us the confidence to add 13 A. J. Wright stores in 2009, including one new market. We will continue to grow this business conservatively and expand the chain to the size that delivers solid returns for our shareholders.", "Our Marshalls Shoe Mega Shop, which builds on our success in shoes and accessories, had two solid openings this fall, one in Yonkers, New York, and the other in California. We will be adding one or two of these stores in 2009.", "We also tested StyleSense, a similar shoe and accessory concept in Canada in 2008 and it, too, was very successful. We plan to open just one StyleSense in 2009. ", "Further, we believe that being an international company gives us advantages in the short and the long term. Our younger European concepts are all working well and performing beyond our expectations and we believe we have major opportunities in Europe. With very strong performance to date, we believe our German business will be profitable towards the end of calendar 2010 and are very encouraged by the HomeSense business in the U.K.", "Now let me spend a moment on our financial strength which has become even more critical in today\u2019s economy and gives us great confidence in the short- and the long-term success of our company. In this very uncertain economic environment, our approach is to manage our strong balance sheet and cash position to preserve our flexibility. We have an A credit rating, one of the strongest in retail and ample liquidity, including the significant excess cash that we expect to generate from our operations in 2009.", "With this flexibility we will be well positioned to respond to the challenges of this environment and to take advantage of opportunities it may present. Cash is a big part of the TJX story. This past year the excess cash we generated on a per share basis at current stock prices was the equivalent of a 7% cash-on-cash yield. In 2009 we estimate this yield at 10% as we manage our cash even more tightly. Jeff will cover the details of our plans in a moment.", "So in closing, I believe we have the right business model to endure this environment and win in the long term and we don\u2019t have to make drastic changes to our model to do so. We can manage through these difficult times by making adjustments. In 2009 we will be defensive and cautious and flexible. We will plan for conservative comps, keep inventories extremely tight, and take a sizeable piece out of our cost structure.", "We will also manage our substantial cash flow and financial liquidity to optimize our flexibility. In the short term we believe we will be gaining market share, building our vendor base, and maintaining a leadership position in the consumer marketplace and retail landscape. Offering both moderate and high-end brands at low-end prices is a compelling value proposition. It is important to remember that even a small uptick in consumer confidence can have a meaningful benefit on our business. ", "When the dust from this recession settles, we believe we\u2019ll be stronger competitively. We have grown our customer and vendor base, the retail landscape is consolidating so consumers will have fewer places to shop. Real estate, which has already become less expensive, will offer us opportunities in the future. ", "Our new and smaller concept, including A. J. Wright, Marshalls Shoe Mega Shop, StyleSense in Canada, HomeSense in the U.K. and T.K. Maxx in Germany are all doing well and should provide platforms for future growth.", "I hope I have helped to explain how we are taking on the difficult environment head-on and why we are confident TJX will be well positioned now and certainly for the future.", "Now I will turn the call back to Jeff and he will go through our 2009 plans and details and then we will open it up for questions.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Before moving to guidance I want to take a moment on the impact of foreign exchange, as we\u2019ve received quite a number of questions from investors regarding this over the past month. So let me start with that.", "I guess first of all we have included some charts on our website that lay out the impact of currency on TJX, on Winners, and on T. K. Maxx results and we hope you find these helpful and we are going to continue to provide them in the future.", "Clearly, foreign currency translation has impacted our EPS this past year, particularly in the fourth quarter where it had a negative $0.05 impact due to the precipitous declines in both the Canadian dollar and the British pound. In contrast, over the four preceding years, foreign currency translation benefitted EPS by an average of about $0.02 per year and the impact on any one quarter was greater than $0.02. So what we are seeing is extraordinary and it\u2019s impacting us as well as other multi-national retailers.", "In addition to translation, I want to call one other thing out. I need to point out that the sudden and unprecedented decline in the Canadian dollar will economically impact Winners\u2019 gross margins, particularly in this coming year, so let me explain.", "Over 50% of our Canadian businesses merchandises purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. When currency rates move gradually, retail prices adjust gradually and the impact on gross margins is not terribly significant. However, when rates move suddenly, as they have done, we are unable to immediately adjust our retail prices and we have to do so gradually and in line with the competition. ", "This compresses Winners\u2019 gross margins in the short term because in essence the cost of merchandise has increased because the U.S. dollar has appreciated. We began to see some of that impact approximately 100 basis points in the fourth quarter segment margins of Winners. So when you look at Winners\u2019 margins for the fourth quarter there\u2019s about 100 basis point of impact from this item.", "In fact, as I mentioned earlier, our consolidated fourth quarter merchandise margin would have been flat were it not for this impact.", "So that\u2019s currency. Let me delve into more detail about our outlook for the full year. as Carol noted earlier, we will provide full year guidance around a number of elements of our P&L and balance sheet, along with some assumptions about the overall profit model, but I\u2019m not providing sales in EPS ranges.", "Let me run through some key elements of our plan for fiscal 2010. First, we have built our inventory plans around a low single-digit comp decrease, which is in line with our Q4 trend and we have done this to protect the gross margin. With this approach and the terrific buying opportunities we have, we believe merchandise margins will be up for the year.", "Second, we have taken actions to reduce costs by $150.0 million. These will protect our bottom line. They will also offset expense increases in other areas such as pension and health insurance that you\u2019ve been hearing other companies talk about. This implies flat SG&A in dollar terms versus fiscal 2009 on a constant currency basis.", "Third, while we\u2019re not planning flat comps, our model for fiscal 2010 would result in flat earnings per share versus the prior year on a 52-week basis, if the comps were flat. It\u2019s important to note that this model includes $0.14 per share of negative currency impacts for the year, $0.05 from foreign currency translation and $0.09 from the lower gross margin at Winners, which I just discussed.", "Excluding currency impacts, our model would result in essentially flat EPS on a minus 2% comp, so we hope those data points give you some ability or some insights as you\u2019re building your models.", "Fourth and very importantly, we expect the first half of the year to be much more difficult than the second half as we\u2019re up against tougher comps to our sales comparisons and will continue to have negative foreign currency translation until we anniversary last year\u2019s declines, which won\u2019t be until late in the third quarter.", "Additionally, many of the cost-reduction actions will not begin to take effect until the second quarter.", "Finally, in this environment we are managing our liquidity conservatively to preserve flexibility. We have reduced our capex budget to $450.0 million in 2009 from $583.0 million in the prior year. this plan reflects the reduction in the pace of store openings as we keep our powder dry for what we think will be terrific real estate opportunities.", "We are going to take a more conservative approach to our stock buy-back program. Currently we anticipate spending up to $250.0 million, however we could potentially adjust this up or down and adjust the timing, depending on the economic environment.", "At current prices this level of buy-back represents a slightly less than 3% reduction in our share count, and that\u2019s just slightly below what we\u2019ve done historically.", "As mentioned earlier, we\u2019re also reducing our inventories, which will also provide some incremental cash.", "So if I wrap all this together, on the liquidity front, including all these actions, we would expect to generate positive cash flow in the $500.0 million to $600.0 million range this year, on top of the $450.0 million balance we had at the beginning of the year, which gives us significant flexibility.", "However, to be clear, we will, as we have always been, be conservative of how we manage TJX\u2019s balance sheet and finances.", "Now let me turn to first quarter guidance. As I just noted, this is not indicative of the full year, given the more challenging first half. For the first quarter we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.38 versus $0.44 per share last year, on a reported basis. this outlook includes a $0.02 per share negative impact from foreign currency translation and inventory-related hedges.", "Last  year\u2019s results included a $0.02 per share benefit of non-recurring tax benefits as well as a $0.01 negative impact from inventory-related hedges. Excluding these impacts, on a comparable basis, EPS would be in the range of $0.34 to $0.40 versus an adjusted $0.43 last year. ", "That said, we understand and would endorse that most analysts submit consensus estimates on a reported basis, unadjusted for these items.", "Some of the details on Q1. We are assuming a first quarter top line of $4.2 billion, in that range, with a 2% to 4% comp sales decrease, both on a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. For the month of February, we are planning for a consolidated comp store sales decrease of 1% to 2%. We are anticipating a 2% to 4% decrease in March and a 4% to 6% decrease in April.", "April\u2019s comps reflect one less selling day in the month due to the shift of Easter from March last year to April this year.", "For Marmaxx we are planning a 1% to 2% comp decrease in February, a 1% to 3% comp decrease in March and a 4% to 6% comp decrease in April.", "For the quarter, pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 5.4% to 6.2% range, down 70 to 150 basis points from the prior year. this decline is entirely due to expense deleverage on the negative costs as merchandise margins are expected to be up for the quarter.", "We are anticipating first quarter gross profit margin in the range of 23.5% to 24.0% and SG&A as a percent of sales to be about 17.7% to 18.0%. Again, the majority of the benefit of the cost reductions will not begin until the second quarter and we are anticipating cost deleverage on the 2% to 4% comp decrease.", "For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 38.2% and net interest expense in the $4.0 million to $5.0 million range.", "So that\u2019s it for the quarter. I will wrap up my comments with our store growth plans for fiscal 2010. Beginning with our domestic concepts. At Marmaxx we plan to increase its store base by a net of about 17 stores for a total of 1,697 stores by the end of fiscal 2010. Very importantly, as Carol mentioned earlier, we are keeping our real estate powder dry and believe we will have the opportunity to do more Marmaxx stores that we have currently planned.", "At HomeGoods, we plan to add a net of four stores for a total of 322 HomeGoods stores by the end of the year. at A. J. Wright, as Carol mentioned, in fiscal 2010 we anticipate netting 13 additional stores for a total of 148 by year end. In Canada we plan to add a net 13 stores to end the year with a total of 290 stores in that country.", "And then finally, moving to Europe, in the U.K. we plan to add five T.K. Maxx stores as well as three HomeSense stores for a combined total of 241 stores by the end of the year. We also expect to open an additional ten stores in Germany for a total of 19 in that country by the end of the year.", "So that\u2019s it. We\u2019re going to open it for questions now. To keep the call on schedule we ask that you please limit your questions to one per person.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeff Black - Barclays Capital.", "Jeff Black - Barclays Capital", "On the expense initiative can you help us out with how to think about occupancy deleverage in the back half of the year. are you still going to delever on occupancy so we see maybe the 2 comp?", "And could you give us a quick update on Home, what we see there? Is there any progress? It looks like the last quarter was very tough in the home business.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I\u2019m going to take it first. I\u2019ll talk to you a little bit about Homes. We definitely had a tough Homes business in the fourth quarter and I think we have made a lot of changes in the strategy going forward and we are already seeing some very positive signs.", "I will talk to you generally about HomeGoods. We have really changed up our strategy there. Obviously across all divisions everybody is looking at cost reduction. But more importantly, we think we\u2019ve brought tremendous value into our home business, especially in HomeGoods and HomeSense. Much better value than we had in the past. Much leaner, we have a completely different strategy in terms of freshness, a new marketing campaign and I can you that we are really seeing a change and I\u2019m very excited about going into February in terms of the home businesses. ", "We are also seeing where, you know the way it is in HomeGoods, and Linens and Things has closed, we are seeing some very substantial comp increases in those stores. So again, we think the landscape is going to change and I think I\u2019m feeling a lot better about our home business going into this year.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "As to your question on the buying and occupancy deleverage, clearly we would anticipate buying and occupancy deleverage in the first quarter on a minus 2 to a minus 4 comp. and that\u2019s partially offset by increased merchandise margins. But we are seeing buying and occupancy deleverage. It\u2019s really hard, there are a number cost elements in buying and occupancy expense which are fixed on a short-term basis, so it\u2019s awfully difficult to get leverage when you have a negative comp.", "In terms of the back half, it all depends on the comp. I would estimate we would need about somewhere a 2% to 3% comp to leverage buying and occupancy. We will leverage SG&A at a much, much lower comp, given some of the expense cuts that we have made.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "In terms of the expenses, I just wanted to get a little more color there in terms of timing. I know that you said that they start primarily in the second quarter. Jeff, how can we think about weighting them as we proceed through the year?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "We don\u2019t mean to say you\u2019re not getting any benefit in the first quarter. There are a number of things that we\u2019ve done that are going to benefit the first quarter but we won\u2019t see everything kick in until the second. I think the lion\u2019s share of what we\u2019re doing will be done by early in the second quarter.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "To go through some of those, we have DC efficiencies, which we will see a little bit of, the in-store labor piece of it, we\u2019re beginning to see a small positive there but that will really start in second quarter and follow up through. Hiring freeze, April is usually the time where we do our increases. We talked about some voluntary early retirement and in terms of positions, we really basically froze our positions since last September, so that will continue throughout the year.", "There is some strategic restructuring going on that will probably be in the next two to three months. We have a little bit going on in our benefit plans and that really has to do with communication and just doing a better job at some of the things that we already have. Tightening travel expenses, we\u2019ll start to see that. And then non-merchandise procurements, which is a big chunk and which was a big chunk last year, again we\u2019ll probably start to see a little of that but most of that second, third, and fourth quarter. So if that gives you a little more of a breakdown.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "It certainly seems like A. J. Wright has reached a new level of stability. Can you talk a little about that division and any additional color on their ability to gain share in this environment or what you\u2019re seeing product-wise there?", "And also you mentioned shifting dollars to the right categories. What will we see more of or less of in this environment and how does the advertising work with that?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", " ", "In terms of A. J. Wright, first of all, we\u2019re off to a very good start. We\u2019re building on a stronger year. we definitely have a better understanding of this customer and how to market to this customer. Our four-wall contribution has certainly improved dramatically. We think we have upside in margin and running, again, with much, much leaner inventory. And focusing on what this customers wants which is basics, kids, junior, dresses, and young mens, which are really the key categories that we focus on. And shoes. In the A. J. Wright businesses.", "So we are opening a new market this year in Atlanta, which we are pretty excited about. The goods are so plentiful in this market that this is, again, when I say it is impossible to keep these guys home and absolutely there is buying mania out there and we have to control them. So the goods are very, very plentiful in this marketplace.", "But we\u2019re just feeling really good about A. J. Wright and the future of it.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Real solid year last year, too, if you look at A. J. Wright and obviously a 4 comp. making money, above break-even, and I think we have strong team there and really beginning to click.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "As far as shifting categories, without giving away all our trade secrets, there are places that are just working very well. The younger customers, which I\u2019m probably the most excited about, because again, that bodes so well for our future. We have new things going on in accessories and shoes that are just making those areas even stronger going forward and we see some tremendous opportunities. ", "And there is a lot of fashion starting to happen so it\u2019s getting pretty exciting out there. And more importantly, what I like, is that we entered the spring season just so clean. Our stores are reading color and excitement and the breadth of assortment, we are very well assorted versus being deep. So it\u2019s getting pretty exciting. I\u2019m in there every single day checking it out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "Question regarding the sensitivity around some of the comp leverage point you talked about, or if comps were to be at that flat range, which you\u2019re not projecting, but as far as the movement around that and what the sensitivity would be to operating margins, etc., if you could provide any color on that.", "And then if there is anything you can say regarding the content of the advertising, how, other than increased emphasis on value and offering, any other details you might be able to share.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I\u2019ll take the marketing and then Jeff will give you some of the sensitivities around the model.", "We are going to be coming out with a very unusual different marketing campaign, so I\u2019m not at liberty to tell you but it\u2019s very unique. It\u2019s about educating the customer and it reads very well to our model and the value of our model. So I\u2019m going to keep it a surprise. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t give it away yet. But we will be on network TV for the first time. We will be able to hit 35% of the stores that we haven\u2019t been able to hit in the past. And in addition to that, the stores will also be\u2014they will have increased direct mail", "So this is quite breakthrough for us and so we look forward to sharing it shortly.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "In terms of the sensitivities I\u2019ll give you two benchmarks. One is every point of comp is worth about $0.08 to the bottom line. And you can actually see that in the way we provided the model today, where we said flat EPS at a flat comp with $0.14 of currency pressure and if you pull the currency pressure out, $0.14, you are flat on a minus 2 comp. so you can see that in there.", "The other point, or the other benchmark, is every point of comp is worth about 20 basis points in bottom line pre-tax margin.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "Would that be more on the gross margin and the leverage or deleverage of fixed occupancy or would you also tend to see some flex up and down in the SG&A dollars?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "No, as the comp moves up and down you will see flex in both SG&A and buying and occupancy costs. Our merchandise margin doesn\u2019t react and swing as strongly to comp changes either way because of the flexibility in the model and how short our purchase cycles are.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffery Stein - Soleil-Stein Research.", "Jeffery Stein - Soleil-Stein Research", "Carol, on your purchasing strategy, historically the company has always said we buy closer to need and it just seems that that has been a continued focus and I\u2019m wondering this year is it any different or is it just more of the same in incremental? So what I\u2019m suggesting is, what percent of your merchandise for spring have you committed in the upfront market this year versus historically?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "You know you couldn\u2019t pry that number out of me if you tried, but I will tell you that our purchasing closer to need is greater and planned greater this year than it was last year, with leaner inventories. So along with that we have been working on our distribution network the last several years to be able to get very, very close to delivery. So we\u2019re literally in Marmaxx hitting the DCs and in some cases within 24 hours the goods are hitting the floor.", "So our plan is the goods are coming in and going straight on the line and going out to the stores. It makes a big difference in the time frame. So that\u2019s what we have really been, what I see as a bigger positive in 2009. We started to see this 2008 but we\u2019ve gotten better and better on our network. So that\u2019s what is also changing the model a bit.", "Jeffery Stein - Soleil-Stein Research", "And could you tell us roughly how many of your HomeGoods stores overlapped with Linens and Things?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I don\u2019t know the number. I can get back to you on that.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "We\u2019ll make sure Sherry has that information.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Digging into that marketing spend, seems like an interesting intensification of the TV penetration. Can you share with us what you\u2019ve seen already with the TV marketing in existing markets and what sort of comp lift you\u2019ve benefitted from that?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, our traffic has been up the whole year and I think you\u2019ve probably noticed that we have taken a more of an educational positioning in terms of off price to our consumer. Markets where we certainly have had TV have been more positive and we have been testing many things for the last couple of years in terms of what really is increasing our traffic and I think this past year, two years ago we started testing and this last year we started expanding the strategy and this year is probably the big year that we\u2019re really going network and making much larger penetration.", "So that\u2019s our strategy. What I can\u2019t share with you is how we\u2019re going to do it. We\u2019ll see that shortly.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "On the merchandise margin, obviously given the aggressive discounting we have seen across the landscape this holiday season, it was really impressive to see that flat merchandise margin. Just wondering going forward, I understand the place your core competencies in terms of lean inventory and buying closer to need but when you think about continuing to see flat merchandise margins, how sharp do you think IMUs have to be as we are in a clearly very intensified promotional environment?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, I think we gave great value in the fourth quarter, certainly in the  holiday period, which is probably the most promotional environment any of us can remember. I am going to be honest with you, I would be disappointed if our merchandise aren\u2019t stronger than what we\u2019re planning them. I think our opportunity is very strong in this market and Ernie has certainly been out there and as Marmaxx and Winners.", "Ernie Herrman", "I would just validate what Carol said. And we\u2019ve talked about this before. The availability is rather plentiful out there I would say and it\u2019s at all levels in the market so moderate, high-end, etc. and so amidst all of that we\u2019re having to, as usual, kind of pace ourselves. And because we\u2019re liquid, however, we\u2019re able to take advantage of these opportunities and I think buy better than pretty much we ever have before.", "So I don\u2019t see that dynamic changing at least in the near future.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Also, we keep track of if the department stores have a promotion and then a point of sale on top of that and a point of sale on top of that, and we\u2019re still giving great value. And that\u2019s the key.", "Ernie Herrman", "We\u2019re always monitoring. We comp shop all the time and we make sure our model says that we have to be out the door in a gap between our retail and what the out-the-door retails are at the other retailers. So we\u2019re ensuring all the time that we\u2019re in that place.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "I\u2019m curious about your negotiations. Have you been able to negotiate any different terms away from just the prices? I know vendors can negotiate certain terms and concessions to the buyers of their inventory and I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve been able to play with that end of the market as well.", "And walking a couple of shows recently, there are brands that I\u2019m seeing that are valid brands that could clearly not exist in six months or a year from now. Smaller, private brands but they\u2019re valid. Is there any interest on your part in buying a brand name on the cheap to do something with it?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, we\u2019re always looking. Part of our strategy and a small piece of it and we do some product development, so we have bought many brands in the past and we will continue to do so and that\u2019s just part of the over 2,000 vendors that we work with. In terms of terms, we work a million different ways. If a vendor needs cash, we can give them cash. We\u2019re working with these people, not against them. And it depends on the situation and we\u2019re flexible and we work with whatever opportunity or whatever situation presents itself.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "We do that, terms are part of the negotiation but the point I want to make is when you look at the term at Marmaxx, it really hasn\u2019t changed significantly though, in this environment. I think one of the things that I would want to call out is when you look at our balance sheet, the relationship of payables to inventory has come down, meaning we have less leverage in our payables. That\u2019s more a function of how we manage through the fourth quarter. We brought inventories down and when you bring inventories down typically you\u2019re paying off  your old payables  but you\u2019re not building new payables as quickly so you lose leverage until you get your inventories down and then you rebuild that leverage. So I don\u2019t want anybody on the call thinking that we maybe deleveraging our payables. We are not and we would expect this temporary deleverage you\u2019re seeing, the deleveraging you\u2019re seeing at the end of the year, to reverse in the first quarter. Which by the way, is worth about $150.0 million to us.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "So in a general consistent basis a net 30 is still the term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Normally you guys give a division by division, sort of highlight or recap. I was wondering if you could share with us some high-level comments on each of your divisions, either sales, gross margin, SG&A. anything that you felt was a needle-mover in the quarter. ", "And then secondarily, on Winners, can you just remind us what the exact impact on the operating margin at Winners was from the reversal of that foreign currency hedge?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Asking about the reversal of the foreign currency hedge, for the full year it didn\u2019t have a significant impact at all. For the quarter, for the company, it was the difference between a 10 point, so for the quarter we reported a 4.7% margin for Winners. Last year it was 14.9% so it was down 10.2%. 7.6% of that was due to the reversal in the hedge. Remember, we booked a gain at the end of the third quarter and then reversed that gain which resulted in a hit in the fourth quarter. So when you apples-to-apples, Winners segment margins were down 260 basis points for the quarter. The majority of that is merchandise margin and a big piece of that was that issue I mentioned earlier about the cost of goods going up because of the amount of goods they purchased in U.S. dollars is a high percentage of their mix. And the U.S. dollar obviously appreciated against the Canadian dollar. So down 260 basis points ex the mark-to-market was about a 7.5% to 7.6% impact from that mark-to-market.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In terms of the divisions I\u2019m going to give you an overview and also pass it to Ernie to talk about Marmaxx and Winners a bit.", "But generally, if you look at Marmaxx for the year, I think their profit margin was down about 40 basis points and if you look at it on the flat comp, I think it\u2019s very much flat to LY. We think that this year there is obviously the cost opportunities, there\u2019s definitely opportunity on the margin side, and I don\u2019t want to be overly positive because I know we\u2019re in a very difficult environment but I believe between the initiative and the focus, there is still opportunity there.", "In terms of HomeGoods, I think part of this was our fault, in our execution and I can see us changing very rapidly in HomeGoods right now and I\u2019m very excited about how they\u2019re off to such a positive start in the month of February. So again, I think sometimes we do it to ourselves and sometimes it\u2019s the environment. And I think in this case it\u2019s a combination of both. I think it was a tough housing market, but I think HomeGoods is going to be the place to shop and I do believe that there will be less home retailers out there in the future so this is going to be hopefully a very short bump in the road for them leading to a very positive future.", "A. J. Wright, I talked a little about our focus and we\u2019ve got a great team in place right now. We have a head of stores that is absolutely sensational, that was over in the U.K. that I think is going to do a terrific job. I think our stores are going to be run a lot better. I think we understand that customer. They\u2019re in the profit zone and I think they\u2019re really understanding how to flow the goods and the value and I\u2019m pretty excited about this concept going forward.", "As far as the U.K. goes, that is, again, to me, one of the most exciting places right now. Because not only do we have incredible real estate deals going on and opportunities, but Germany has come on very strong. You know, they had a 4 comp on top of the 6 comp at CKs, their segment margin was up 40 basis points, including Germany and HomeSense. And we are seeing unprecedented deals over in the U.K. and I think they\u2019re just getting stronger and stronger. So I just think there is a lot more to come there.", "Winners, we are going to battle the margin. Their segment profit was 11% against last year\u2019s 11.5%.  And we will get through that. And I think Ernie is seeing some positive things that can help mitigate that.", "Ernie Herrman", "At Marmaxx, I would say two of the big focuses right now are one on brands, because with what\u2019s going on out there, we have an opportunity I think to do more business with some brands that we\u2019ve done less with that are desirable. And two, to really take advantage of the market yes, but to buy on a weekly basis and flow on a weekly basis, throughout the whole store. I think we\u2019re really trying to focus the organization on those two things, which should yield more excitement down the road here for the season.", "And going back to something Carol mentioned in the earlier comments, the most exciting opportunity, I think to me, is new customers. So I think if we have customers walking in the door now that perhaps did not shop us before, when they see some of these brands at the values we potentially will have, I think that will be a key strategy for us, even longer term. To gain market share there.", "Secondly, at Winners, yes, we have a currency issue. One positive thing we\u2019re sharing in the midst of that is first of all every retailer will get hit with the currency issue. Some of them buy out further but what we are hearing is that they will be adjusting their retails going into like second, third quarter, which should allow us, surgically in places to adjust our retails accordingly. so I\u2019m thinking that should be a positive strategy for us going forward.", "Clearly with the economy up there softening, we will have to be careful with that, however, again, it\u2019s creating additional buying opportunities up in Canada as well, that we will take advantage of and buy goods better. And there again, hopefully win market share in Canada beyond what we have already.", "So I think high-level, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about both those situations.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "You asked about mark-to-market, were you actually asking about the\u2014because we have this impact of foreign exchange beginning to impact our margins next year. were you asking about that or mark-to-market?", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "I was asking about the 760 basis point hit in fourth quarter to the Winners.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan.", "Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan", "On the real estate side, did you give us the capex you have assumed in your free cash flow generation and then maybe talk about how many of your stores are up for renewals over the next two years, and then maybe the number of stores that you might have co-tenancy agreements on and if we see some impact from the Linens and Circuits going away in those centers.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "I don\u2019t have that co-tenancy information but in terms of the number of leases, the majority of stores, when we open a new store, they\u2019re almost always on a ten-year term. And with as many five-year options as we can get. So if you look at Marmaxx, at just the sheer number of stores in Marmaxx, most of those stores are going to be coming every five years for a renewal. Other than the stores we\u2019ve opened in the last five years. So you would probably have 70% to 80% of the Marmaxx base coming up every five years right now. So that will give you a flavor for that. And that\u2019s obviously where we have the majority of our stores.", "In terms of capital, in that $500.0 million to $600.0 million cash generation, that\u2019s the amount we believe our cash balance will increase. So that is after $450.0 million in capital spending, which as I mentioned, was down from the $583.0 million we spent last year. Now, in the $450.0 million capex, we have a fund in there to allow us to invest opportunistically. So there is a pretty sizeable piece of that that is being held back and controlled by the corporate office and that we have earmarked for opportunities as they come up during the year. and we believe we will see some real estate opportunities.", "So we didn\u2019t want to deploy our entire capital budget to the divisions, we wanted to hold some topside based on what we see coming up.", "The last point I would make on the $500.0 million to $600.0 million, that\u2019s after an assumed $250.0 million buyback and after about $200.0 million in dividend. While it does require Board approval, it would be our intent this year to increase the dividend.", "So if you look at that $500.0 million to $600.0 million with the $250.0 million buyback and with $200.0 million from the dividend, it would tell you that, pre any distribution to shareholders, we would generate $950.0 million to $1.05 billion in cash. We think that\u2019s a good thing, we think that gives us a lot of flexibility.", "The one other point I would make regarding the balance sheet is we have $400.0 million of debt coming due at the end of the year. we believe we will be able to refinance it but in this environment we have to be conservative and so we are going to be prepared that in the event the markets are not our friends that we can retire that debt should the markets force us to do so. Which, by the way, is not what we want to do, but one has to be ready.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "One other comment on the real estate. I think one of the biggest opportunities for us is places such as New York City and the New York area, highly dense areas, or High Street in the U.K., are places that it was more difficult for us to enter. We believe this may be our time in those areas which will really bode well for the future and that\u2019s what we\u2019re pretty excited about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Just a question on the A. J. Wright decision in the Atlanta market. What are the operating margins that you\u2019re willing now to live with before you pull the trigger on adding more stores or a wider roll out? And how close are you to achieving that level or rate?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We\u2019re not going to suddenly add on 100 stores. That\u2019s really not the way we do it. Right now we\u2019re approaching our four-wall. I think we\u2019re over 12 now.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "The target is mid-teens, so at a mid-teen store contribution margin, fully leveraging our distributions centers and our G&A, would give us about a 7% bottom line and an ROIC in that sort of 15% to 20% range. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting.", "Obviously you can\u2019t drive the pre-tax margin up until you open. You do need to open stores. We\u2019re going to go slowly and cautiously. But there are two things we find encouraging. One is that the four-wall contribution. We are probably within 100 basis points of where we need to be. Two years ago we were 300 basis points to 350 basis points away. So A. J. Wright has been really making significant progress in their store contribution margin over the last several years.", "The other thing is our new stores that we\u2019ve opened have performed well so that gives us, you know, having a four-wall contribution close to what we need for the model and also having pretty strong new store performance, and we think that new store performance only improves in this environment, given the quality of deals that we\u2019re going to see. But as Carol mentioned, we don\u2019t throw hail Marys at TJX so we will go slowly and cautiously.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "13 stores into this year and next year we\u2019ll take a look at that number but you won\u2019t be suddenly seeing us jump to 25 or 50 stores.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "And you mentioned a pickup in February. Are you seeing it across the board or just in a couple of the divisions.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "We said down 1 to down 2. [extraneous humor] No, in our guidance we\u2019ve guided to a minus 1 to minus 2 in February. That\u2019s clearly an improvement in the trend and by business we\u2019ll report to you shortly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "I\u2019m excited about the marketing initiatives and some of the bolder plans, especially network TV but trying to reconcile this with what sounds like a decline in actually dollars spent I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019re giving up to get the additional visibility and how we should think about the entire marketing package, what loss this year versus gains.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, we were flat this year to last year and next year we will be slightly down. The key here is really our strategy and what you\u2019ll see and I really don\u2019t want to give that away but once you see it you will understand it creates tremendous leverage and that\u2019s what allowed us to go network and to really hit the areas that we were never able to hit before.", "So you\u2019re asking me to give away our price secret right now, and it will come out shortly.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "I appreciate that and let us know where to look and when. But I was also wondering what is not happening this year that happened last year?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Honestly, not very much. We had probably a little bit of ROP, not a lot. This is really a completely different strategy that is leveraging just much greater penetration with much less cost.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Stacy Pack \u2013 [unspecified firm]", "Stacy Pack \u2013 [unspecified firm]", "On the comp for Marmaxx, can you break down traffic versus ticket? Can you say what the comp differential has been in the markets where you\u2019ve had TV? What is the comp required to leverage SG&A in the back half and then finally, just on the Mega Shoe, how close is the California store to an existing store and what cannibalization are you seeing?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, our traffic is slightly up and our ticket is slightly down. In terms of the Mega Shoe, it happens to be right next to a Marshalls so we have not completely measured the cannibalization but obviously between the two we\u2019re pretty happy with the sales, with the overall sales and we\u2019ll continue to measure that. We purposely put one of the boxes right next to a Marshalls and in our other location we don\u2019t have it next to a Marshalls. And that\u2019s why we will always go slowly and measure the cannibalization.", "I will not give you the information in terms of TV, how it hits our market and the percent of increase we see because that\u2019s really something that we don\u2019t share.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "As to the leveraging question, did you mean for the company or for Marmaxx?", "Stacy Pack \u2013 [unspecified firm]", "For the back half, you said you gave us some information on occupancy you didn\u2019t give us G&A.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "I think right now look for the first quarter we\u2019re calling SG&A deleverage on a minus 2 to minus 4 comp. Of about 60 basis points to 90 basis points. So clearly we would see an improvement in that trend with the execution of some of the cost reduction initiatives. I don\u2019t have specifically back half information because we\u2019re not giving guidance on the back half. If I would tell you I would expect that we will be significantly lowering that leverage point. We mentioned for the year that on a constant currency basis, so excluding the favorable impact of currency, that we would expect SG&A to be flat. On a dollar basis, year-over-year. And that\u2019s down slightly, including the impact of currency.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Edgeway \u2013 [unspecified firm].", "Paul Edgeway \u2013 [unspecified firm]", "Can you break down that capex, new store versus IT, DC, maybe share with us how much you are keeping at corporate for opportunities. And then just hearing you  talk about these opportunities, in this environment have you reconsidered the right number of stores for any of your concepts? And I guess in particular I\u2019m wondering on what the right number of Marmaxx locations is?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We have always given Marmaxx a range. Our comfortability is still 1,800 and we range about 1,800 to higher than that, to 2,200. Again, with less stores out there in the future, we don\u2019t know what that number is. So I would think that there would be only upside to that versus downside. And then the same thing in Europe. We are seeing Germany work, we felt that Germany was at least 350 stores and we are feeling very, very confident about that. So we really don\u2019t see much downside. And as A. J. Wright is working, we have ranged that between 500 and 1,000 stores and we\u2019re just going to keep moving in that direction because each day we\u2019re feeling more confident about that business. So if anything we don\u2019t see downside to the number of stores.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "I think in terms of how much we\u2019ve earmarked and held at corporate. I would rather be mum on that other than tell you it\u2019s a significant amount of capex. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to go public on.", "In terms of the mix, if we look historically, we spend about 50% of our capital budget on store renovations and improvements, that\u2019s where we have all of our initiatives, our remodels, etc. New stores represent about 25% and our office and distribution centers represent about 25%. I think those percentages are going to hold up relatively well this year. We\u2019ve reduced the number of new stores but we\u2019ve also been tighter on store renovations and improvement and the office and the distribution centers. So I think the mix will be a little bit different than that, I think we are going to end up with a little more in store renovation, a little less in new store, but it\u2019s generally along those lines.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "On the average ticket being down slightly, is that a function of fewer items per transaction or is it lower price point items?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We\u2019re slight down in average price point. And intentionally so because we\u2019re really, really pushing the value equation. And it\u2019s working well.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "You told you store growth plans and your expense plans for 2009, how about just some of the merchandise initiatives that have been underway for some time now? Are you planning on adding any more runway stores and how about the Cube and the expanded footwear department at Marshalls? What are you doing with those initiatives?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We\u2019re pretty happy with the results but I\u2019ll have Ernie walk through that with you.", "Ernie Herrman", "Just to give you an idea, we are looking at another handful of runway stores, potentially being added. We have gone to a large degree of the Marshalls Shoe Megas, approaching like 90% so maybe we\u2019ll add another 20 there. Single Cube lines, we\u2019ll add like another 100 or so.", "We would be adjusting these game plans or these numbers if we were running into results that weren\u2019t saying to still do it. So yes, they are working as planned.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "I think with scarce capital we are really pushing our capital dollars to work those opportunities, those investments, that give us the highest return.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think the other thing, too, is to mention, because the Cube has been so successful, we have been pushing that mix and Maxx\u2019s business is also very positive in terms of the junior business. So this is really terrific in terms of the future.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "Have you seen any impact on your business from the liquidation sales at Mervyn\u2019s on the West Coast or Goody\u2019s in the Southeast? Or has that been fairly noneventful?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We haven\u2019t measure it but we\u2019re seeing some positive. We\u2019re certainly not seeing the deterioration like we were seeing in December. But we haven\u2019t really measured specifically those stores.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company.", "David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company", "Question back on gross margin. Can you talk a little bit about the sequential improvement that it looks like you\u2019re guiding to in the first quarter from the fourth quarter? Could you go through some of those components, how you think they\u2019re going to be improving, or still be the same or worse.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "I have to look at my numbers. The sequential improvement. So the merchandise market was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, if I back out the Winners currency issue that we talked about. And then we have an increase in the first quarter. What\u2019s happened is that we\u2019ve brought our inventories down significantly in the fourth quarter. We have much more liquidity open to buy. We\u2019re sitting on more purchase dollars that are uncommitted and there are terrific buys in the marketplace and when that happens your mark on goes up.", "The other thing that happens with very lean inventories is it tends to have an improvement in your mark downs. So yes, there is a sequential improvement from Q4 into Q1 and those would be the factors. And it\u2019s not surprising to us given the way that we\u2019re managing our inventories in this environment.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "And the Winners issue, should that be fairly similar in the first quarter?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "It will be more in the first quarter. We would estimate about 200 basis points of impact on Winners merchandise margins because of this currency issue of sourcing goods in more expensive U.S. dollars.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "And how much should that be for the full company?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Winners is about 10% of the full company, so about 20 basis points.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "And the other components.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "They were up after that. I want to point out that the merchandise margins we\u2019ve been, the up merchandise margin is after absorbing that hit from Winners.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Glick - Buckingham Research.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "Just a clarification on your outlook for fiscal 2010 on your base case, which is the minus 2 comp. So what you\u2019re saying is using the $2.01 you would take out the 53rd week, $0.09, FX $0.14, and your base case would approximate to roughly $1.78. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Yes, on a reported basis that would be right. So on a reported basis we are saying flat, including $0.14 of currency pressure. So flat to us, we have $1.92 on a 52 week basis, excluding the intrusion in the mark-to-market adjustment. So $1.92 would be the base case and we are saying we\u2019re basically, that on a flat comp we would be flat to that, including $0.14 of currency pay.", "So the $1.92 would be the pro forma, the $1.78 would be the reported, and that would be at a flat comp. and then obviously at a minus 2 comp you would pull $0.14 out of both ends.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "You mentioned the price competitiveness as a key issue. There is a lot of pricing upheaval in the department store industry. When you look at the fourth quarter, your business was a little bit tougher in November than December. I know some of it was due to some marketing shifts. But were there any lessons learned there? Just from my walks through the stores and just hearing anecdotally from competitors, there seemed to be that you got more aggressive on pricing as the quarter progressed. And I\u2019m just wondering if the November underperformance relative to December had anything to do with that or did you feel like you were price competitive all along the way?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, I would say the economy definitely hit pretty quickly in October and November so I would say to you that we did have some catch up in understanding what the true value needed to be. And I think we started catching up in December. So yes, if I said to you do I think today looking back, could we have done a better job in November? The answer is yes.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "Obviously going forward you are taking those lessons from December and applying the same.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Randal Konik - Jefferies & Co.", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Co.", "On this marketing spend, you say you\u2019re going to hit 35% more stores. Can you walk us through the regions where you haven\u2019t had some regional advertising in the past and we can kind of monitor the impact of that?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I can\u2019t even answer that. I don\u2019t have it specifically in front of me. Some of it\u2019s the smaller markets and it\u2019s different between Maxx and Marshalls. Maxx tends to be in smaller markets so the impact is going to be in a $5.0 million to $6.0 million store and then Marshalls will probably hit some of the bigger markets so it will hit areas in Florida and California that maybe today it doesn\u2019t hit.", "And it\u2019s certainly where we weren\u2019t highly penetrated before.", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Co.", "And move on to the expense savings of $150.0 million. You talked about the reduced marketing spend. It sounds like it would be modest and you gave us like four or five buckets. Can you give a little more clarity on which is the higher weighting bucket towards that $150.0 million, where is the least weighted bucket in terms of the expense savings?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "The biggest bucket is really non-merchandise procurement and then we have the big chunks are in leveraging best practices and DCs and probably in-store labor is a big chunk of that also. And then we have some other areas where we think that are not including in this number is we have an initiative on freight that we think hopefully will end up big number going forward.", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Co.", "Not included in the $150.0 million?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Right, not included in the $150.0 million. So those are probably the three biggest chunks.", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Co.", "Just on that freight, can you give a little more clarity? What would that be?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I don\u2019t know what the numbers are yet.", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Co.", "Not the number but what are you trying to do with the freight? Change your shipper or what are you trying to do?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "A combination of things. It\u2019s really leveraging the corporation more efficiently. We have a lot of places that I think we can leverage a lot better than we are today and that\u2019s what we\u2019re digging into.", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Co.", "Just on the HomeGoods we\u2019ve been through a little bit of fits and starts, you sounded a little more construction on it in terms of February trends. What specific changes can you point to in the last three months or so that really make you feel better about where the direction is going?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think if you walk into the stores today, we\u2019ve really changed it up and we\u2019ve looked at a much stronger value equation. I think there are places where we weren\u2019t offering enough value to the customer and I think we are today. I think we are marketing in-store a lot better than we have. I think we\u2019re moving the stores around and making them much more exciting. Before you would walk in and you would specifically see a department and it never moved through the entire year. so there are a lot of changes. And then within categories where we\u2019re putting our dollars we are seeing some new categories that are working and some old categories that we\u2019re doing just a lot better job with. So it\u2019s a lot of different dynamics that are going on.", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Co.", "Are there any particular categories you\u2019re taking dollar away from?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We\u2019re always flexing on categories but I really don\u2019t usually give that kind of detail.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to The TJX Companies first quarter fiscal 2010 financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions)", "I would like to turn the conference call over to Carol Meyrowitz, President and CEO for The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Good morning. Before we begin, Sherry Lang has a few comments.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. ", "The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the companies' plans to vary materially.

", "Please note that we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our International division in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website, www.TJX.com.", "As a reminder, the comparable store sales numbers that we talk about today are on a constant currency basis.", "With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today's press release and posted on our website, www.TJX.com, in the Investor Information section. ", "Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Jeff Naylor and Ernie Herrman. We're going to start this call by having Jeff take you through our first quarter results, then I will share with you my thoughts on our first quarter performance, our outlook for the second quarter and our long-term view. ", "Big picture, I am very pleased with our performance in these difficult times and the additional opportunities we're seeing as a result of the downturn from which we believe we will benefit in the long term. However, times are still uncertain and you're going to hear that we are remaining extremely deliberate in our approach and cautious about our near-term outlook. ", "We'll get into more details about the second quarter, but in addition to the continuing challenging environment, our comparisons to last year do not become easier until later in the year. We believe the right thing to do is to plan and run the business with conservative assumptions as we did this past quarter, and strive to beat our plan.", "First, here's Jeff to recap the numbers for the first quarter. ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everybody.", "I'll be recapping the first quarter results on a continuing operation basis, so in the first quarter net sales were $4.35 billion. That was up 1% over last year. Our consolidated comp store sales were up 2% and that was on top of a 2% increase last year and it was also significantly above our plan.", "Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.49. That's up 11% over the $0.44 we reported last year. I should point out, however, that last year's results included a $0.02 per share benefit from FIN 48 tax adjustments, so excluding this benefit from last year's EPS our numbers were up 17% over the adjusted $0.42 last year.", "The 17% adjusted EPS growth was achieved despite several items that impact the comparability of results and adversely impacted first quarter this year. ", "First of all, foreign currency translation negatively impacted this year's results by $0.02 per share, which was about $0.01 more than we had planned.", "Second, marking our inventory related hedges to market at the end of the quarter reduced EPS this year by $0.02 per share compared to a $0.01 per share reduction to EPS last year. ", "And finally, results this year were adversely impacted by about $0.01 per share due to one-time costs related to our expense reduction initiatives.", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margin on a reported basis was 7.8%. That up 90 basis points over last year due to strong merchandise margins and solid expense control, but partially offset by the restructuring costs and the marked-to-market hedge adjustment. And I'll provide some further detail on how this breaks out later in the call. ", "Pre-tax profit margins increased significantly at all divisions with the exception of Winners, whose merchandise margins were adversely impacted by sourcing over half its merchandise in more expensive U.S. dollars. You'll recall that we discussed this on our February call and I'll also provide more detail on Winners later today.", "The gross profit margin was up 90% basis points during the quarter. Merchandise margins were up 110\u00a0basis points over prior year, which was better than we expected, but was partially offset by the marked-to-market adjustment I just mentioned. ", "SG&A costs were flat versus last year as a percentage of sales and SG&A dollar spending was slightly favorable to plan despite the above-plan sales and that was due to our cost reduction efforts. ", "In terms of inventories at the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis were down 4%. We're entering the second quarter with fewer dollars committed forward than at this time last year on a per store basis, and this includes the warehouses, the stores and the merchandise we have on order.", "So now let me turn the call back to Carol and I'll recap our second quarter guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Jeff.", "It's great to be able to report such a strong first quarter, especially in such extraordinary tough times. The overarching message that I'd like you to take away from today's call is that our strategies for a conservative approach in 2009 are working well. By planning conservative comps, keeping inventories lean and reducing costs, all with an extreme focus on execution, we delivered above-plan results in a very difficult retail environment. We will continue to stick to our knitting and proceed with the same strategies that just delivered strong results in the first quarter. ", "On our year end call we outlined the three major strategies of our conservative approach to the business for weathering this difficult environment. Today I'm going to tell you how those major strategies led to our strong first quarter results. ", "First, planning comp sales conservatively truly worked well. We planned our business around an assumption of a 2% to 4% consolidated comp sales decrease and by significantly exceeding this plan drove excellent flowthrough to the bottom line, achieving an adjusted EPS growth of 17% despite adverse currency impacts and one-time restructuring costs. ", "Second, by running the business with very lean inventories in order to turn faster and increase merchandise margin we topped our expectations by increasing merchandise margins by 110\u00a0basis points. ", "Third, we are continuing with our aggressive cost-cutting initiatives of $150 million for the year. At the end of the first quarter we are on track with our plan and we are also seeing expense savings flowing through to the bottom line.", "With great values and merchandise initiatives, customer traffic in the first quarter was up more than it was in the first quarter at virtually all of brands as we continue to gain market share. Clearly, our value proposition is attracting and resonating with our customers. I've said it before and I'll say it again - we believe that value is key, whether the economy is weak or strong, and our job is to deliver value beyond compare every day to our customers.", "I'd like to highlight some of the first quarter results. ", "Marmaxx had the most profitable quarter - not its most profitable first quarter, but its most profitable quarter in its history - with segment profit up 19% driven by very strong merchandise margins and terrific expense control. ", "HomeGoods profit grew 75% and they delivered a strong segment margin of 4%, up significantly over the prior year. ", "With a 12% comp sales increase at A.J. Wright, they delivered $4 million in profit, more than it had cumulatively made in its entire history. ", "Winners significantly beat its plan. Excluding the marked-to-market adjustment, Winners offset much of the negative currency impact on its merchandise margin with better buying and delivering even more expense savings than we had expected. ", "T.K. Maxx generated a strong 6% comp overall and in the U.K. and Ireland more than doubled its profit, dramatically improving the profitability of the overall European business. ", "Including our investment in Germany and HomeSense, TJX Europe delivered over a 190 basis point increase in its segment profit over last year. ", "I also want to reiterate that while we have a short-term strategy in place to manage through these difficult times, we believe that our future growth opportunities are tremendous. The seeds we've planted are working, and I'm convinced that those seeds will only grow stronger in the future.", "I remain firm in my belief that with solid strategies and execution we will emerge from this recession as an even stronger company. We will not get ahead of ourselves, however, and as always will be very methodical in our approach. ", "Now let me share with you some additional details of how our strategies are working in this environment. ", "First, as I just mentioned, planning comps at lower levels enables us to drive more flowthrough to the bottom line as we exceed our plan. Let me highlight just a few of the ways we're driving sales. ", "We're delivering extreme value to our stores every day, which is clearly being noticed by our customers. We are managing the business with much leaner inventories and buying very close to need. Fresh fashion at compelling prices are flowing to our stores faster than ever, and this is also helping to drive traffic. Through strong and weak times we see ourselves as a shopping destination for both moderate and high-end brands at low-end prices. ", "Our strategy to shift our purchase dollars to the right categories and initiatives in order to drive sales is also working. We continue to be pleased with THE CUBE, our junior department at Marshall's, and we are opening many new vendors in this category, which is benefiting both T.J.\u00a0Maxx and Marshall's. The performance of juniors at Marmaxx in the first quarter was phenomenonal as we bring in young customers for the future. Another category callout is dresses, which continues to post outstanding comps throughout our divisions. Footwear also continued to outperform. We've also [inaudible] more dollars into children, which typically does better in economic downturns, and that has definitely been paying off. We are testing several new ideas which we believe will also help drive sales to the back of the year. ", "Lastly on sales drivers, I told you on our last call how excited I am about our new marketing campaign and by now I assume most of you have seen what I'm talking about. For the first time ever we are advertising T.J. Maxx and Marshall's together in the same TV spot. Our Intervention campaign positions both brands as the better way to shop for great fashions, great brands, and incredible value. This new network campaign is hitting markets that have never seen our brand on TV before and we believe will attract even more new customers. ", "Clearly, we are also getting more bang for our advertising buck with this dual branding. We have tested our dual-branding strategy with very positive results but, as always, we will continue to solicit customer feedback, fine tune, and make our campaign even stronger. We've done a lot of work over the last several years to differentiate the shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshall's which has given the consumer plenty of reasons to shop both brands. This is a great time to attract new customers and gain share as the retail landscape is changing so dramatically.", "Second, in addition to driving traffic, our running business with very lean inventories led to faster turns and stronger merchandise margins. We began the first quarter with more inventory liquidity and greater open to buy than I can remember, which for our buyers means even sweatier palms as they chase goods and buy even closer to need. With better buying and faster inventory turns, merchandise margins were significant up across all divisions in the first quarter with the exception of Winners which, while down year-on-year, was significantly above plan, and we'll discuss this later in more detail. ", "Third, we're on track with our cost reduction plans we're already seeing the bottom line benefits. We continue to be confident in our ability to reduce expenses by $150 million in 2009. ", "Moving on, I want to emphasize that while we're taking a cautious approach during this recession, our vision to grow TJX as a global off-price value retailer is unwavering. I truly believe that with the right strategies in place we will come out of the recession with an even competitive edge. We are taking advantage of opportunities that this environment presents and as I mentioned are continuing to plant seeds for the future. ", "First, the consolidation in the retail sector offers great opportunities for our businesses. We continue to gain market share and are growing our customer base for the future through our great values. With customer traffic up and average basket down, even a slight increase in consumer spending should be very meaningful to our business. As we have discussed, we have found in past recessions that once customers discover us, they tend to stick with us when times improve because they love our values. ", "We've seen updated analyst estimates of bankruptcies and store closures to date across apparel and home fashion retailers will result in approximately 1,300 closed stores and nearly $11 billion market share opportunity in the U.S. While consumer demand has decreased meaningfully, fewer players in the retail landscape bodes well for TJX as we play in both higher end and lower demographics.  ", "We believe that this is also true for HomeGoods, which just delivered its strongest first quarter performance ever. HomeGoods has regained its footing with a better mix and flow, sharper value, and improved in store merchandise. In addition to better execution at HomeGoods, we believe that much of the consolidation in retail will happen in the home arena, which should provide HomeGoods a strong conservative position. ", "In terms of sourcing, the tough environment continues to open more and more vendor doors to us, growing our already vast vendor universe. We are still being asked if there will be enough product for us to buy when the department stores bring their inventories in line as we get to the holiday season, so once again I will say it as plainly as I can - availability is never a concern for us. Even when the marketplace becomes more disciplined, there is always more product available to us than we would want or could ever buy. To understand the magnitude of what we are talking about, in the first quarter alone we opened more than 600 new vendor doors and that was just at Marmaxx and HomeGoods alone. ", "We've tried many ways to explain this, but it's very important to understand that we have 500\u00a0buyers all over the world. We take a global tactical approach, sourcing from well over 10,000 vendors in 60 countries, moving and placing buyers in the most advantageous location as the dynamics of the markets change.", "It's also crucial to understand that once a vendor door is opened it typically stays open over time as we establish long-term mutually beneficial relationships with our vendors.  ", "As we indicated on our year end call, one of the biggest opportunities for the future from this downturn is the real estate market. We continue to see very advantageous deals for opening new stores, renegotiating leases and relocating stores to better locations. ", "At the beginning of the year we said that we had 65 net store openings planned and we were keeping our capital powder dry for great deals as they came to us. To update you on where we are with store openings, we now expect to open between 80 and 85 stores this year net of closings, 15 to 20 more than we had initially planned. The additional stores are primarily in Europe as well as Marmaxx and allow us to take advantage of terrific real estate opportunities.  ", "Now moving to our growth vehicles, which continued to perform well despite the weak retail climate. The strong performance of our newer and younger concepts is very promising for the long-term growth potential of our company.  ", "In the U.S., A.J. Wright delivered outstanding performance in the first quarter. A.J. Wright is executing extremely well as the concept continues to gain traction. Store contribution levels continue to move up, which gives us confidence in this division's ability to achieve its long-term segment profit targets. Our store openings in Atlanta, our new A.J. market, were strong. We are very encouraged by A.J. Wright and continue to believe that the U.S. could ultimately support 500\u00a0or more A.J. Wright stores. ", "Our test of our Shoe Megashop by Marshall's in the U.S. and Style Sense in Canada, our stand-alone shoe and accessory concept, continues to generate excellent customer response. We had a strong opening for an additional Shoe Megashop by Marshall's during the quarter. If these concepts continue to be successful, we will have a real long-term growth opportunity here in the U.S. as well as in Canada.", "In Europe our younger concepts continues to significantly outperform our expectations in a difficult retail environment, just as they did throughout 2008. ", "In Germany, our T.K. Maxx stores are achieving sales productivity levels that are comparable to the average of our existing stores in the U.K., and virtually all German stores are exceeding our expectations. We are also seeing strong year-on-year results in stores that have been open for more than a year. With these strong results, as I just mentioned, we are increasing our store growth for the year. We now expect to net 15\u00a0stores in Germany, five more than the original plan. We believe our business in Germany will achieve profitability towards the end of calendar 2010.", "We also plan on opening three stores in Poland in the back half of this year. After a tremendous amount of research, we believe that a merchandise mix that combines what we have in Germany and the U.K. would resonate extremely well for the customers in Poland. We are taking a regional approach to expansion in Europe, as the stores that we are opening in Poland are very close to several of our stores in Germany. ", "We believe the demand for great value as well as the advantageous real estate deals in Poland provide a really solid platform upon which to grow further in Europe. We will start slowly, as we always do, and continue to evaluate as we go forward.", "We're also very pleased with our new HomeSense business in the U.K. With the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector in the U.K., we are seeing excellent real estate opportunities which are allowing us to open HomeSense stores in very good locations on extremely good terms. ", "Both T.K. Maxx in Germany and HomeSense in the U.K. have improved their bottom line and exceeded our expectations. Long-term we see T.K. Maxx growing to 250 to 300 stores in Germany and HomeSense growing to 100 to 150 stores in the U.K. ", "I believe that we have significant growth potential in our U.S. concepts and international expansion. There is no question in my mind that TJX is benefiting from being an international company and will continue to do so in the long term. We are very pleased with what we are seeing in our European businesses, but I reiterate that we will continue to proceed very carefully and methodically with growth. ", "Now let me move to our financial strength, which continues to be critically important in today's world. We will continue to manage our strong balance sheet and cash position to preserve our flexibility. ", "Cash continues to be a big part of our story. We entered the first quarter with a balance of $1 billion. This included $375 million we borrowed to refinance our convertible notes, which we plan to use to buyback the shares that were issued to the convertible note holders earlier in May. ", "Returning excess cash to shareholders remains a priority that we are balancing with preserving cash liquidity in these economic times. In terms of share repurchases, we bought back approximately $43 million of TJX stock during the first quarter. We're retiring 1.6\u00a0million shares. It continues to be our plan to buyback approximately $250 million of TJX stock in 2009 in addition to the $375 million to buyback the shares that converted or approximately $625\u00a0million in total. ", "As we've said before, we may adjust this amount up or down depending on the environment. In addition, we increased the per share dividend by 9%, which is the 13th consecutive year of a dividend increase. ", "I want to take a moment to mention that our strong financials continue to [break in audio] well against our peers. In the recent Fortune 500 rankings, TJX ranked 131, one place higher than last year. In terms of financial ratios among all Fortune 500 companies, we ranted No. 34 in return on assets, No. 28 in return on equity, and 94 for 10-year EPS compounded annual growth rate.", "Moving to our outlook for the second quarter, although off to a good start in May, we believe it's prudent to remain cautious as the economic environment continues to be challenging and uncertain. We also want to remind you of the tough comparisons we have to last year's second quarter. First, it is our strongest quarter of the last year in terms of sales and earnings growth, and we are up against three consecutive years of strong second quarter comps. We also have difficult year-on-year hurdles in terms of the impact of foreign exchange, which will ease up late in the third quarter. ", "We will continue to plan conservatively while at the same time we will certainly take actions to drive sales and profitability beyond our plan level. We are planning EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.49 compared with $0.48 per share last year. We are planning comp sales to be flat to down 2% on a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx group. Jeff will provide more details in a moment. ", "So in closing let me say again that I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance. I believe that our prudent approach to 2009 is working and helping us do what we said we would do, which is to protect the bottom line. We will continue to plan comps conservatively, run with extremely tight inventories and significantly reduce costs. ", "We will also continue to take action to drive sales beyond our conservative expectations, which to the extent we are successful will drive more profitability as we did in the first quarter. It remains our financial strategy to manage our substantial cash flow and liquidity and to maintain our flexibility. ", "We will balance our financial strength with the opportunities that we have in today's environment. We will pursue opportunities with paramount focus on return on investment but take full advantage of today's environment for the future - in other words, seize the day. Even more exciting, our growth vehicles are working in this spate of challenging times and I believe that growing this company in the U.S. and internationally has great advantages. We believe that TJX, a nearly $20 billion company today, when carefully and intelligently executed, has tremendous growth opportunities for the future. ", "I'm confident that the strategies that we have in place are the right ones and that with keen focus on solid execution we are in excellent position to be even stronger competitively when times improve. I truly believe that our great value equation plays well today, in the future, and in many countries across the globe.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jeff to go through further details on the first quarter and our plans for the second quarter, and then we'll be happy to open it up for questions.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Thanks, Carol. ", "Before moving guidance I wanted to take a moment to run through some first quarter items. First let me give you some detail on the impact of currency overall and at the end how it impacted our Winners business. ", "Overall, currency translation and marked-to-market adjustments had a $0.04 per share negative impact on EPS in the first quarter this year and that would compare to last year's $0.01 per share negative impact, so the takeaway here is that Q1's 17% EPS growth was achieved despite some pretty significant currency headwinds which we won't anniversary until very late, actually, in the third quarter.", "The marked-to-market adjustment on our inventory related hedges also impacted our pre-tax margin in the first quarter, so while we reported a 90 basis points improvement, it would have been 110\u00a0basis points excluding the marked-to-market.", "Secondly, foreign currency translation and the marked-to-market adjustments significantly impacted the reported Canadian numbers. If you look at the segment tables attached to the press release you'll see that we reported a decline of $21 million in Winners segment profit. This would have been only a $3 million decline if we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and the marked-to-market adjustment, so when we look at it in local currency we're close to having flat profit year-on-year in our Canadian business.", "Similarly, we reported a 370 basis point decline in Winners segment profit margin, but this would have been down 130 basis points if we exclude these currency items. And the profit decline in our Canadian business is much than we had planned as the team at Winners is doing an excellent job of mitigating the cost of goods sold impact of the weak Canadian dollar by buying better and generating above plan expense reductions.", "I should note that we've provided a schedule detailing the impact of currency on TJX's consolidated results as well as the results of Winners and T.K. Maxx. That's out on our website and we'd encourage you to look at it because I think it's helpful to understanding and interpreting the results.", "The second item I wanted to cover is pre-tax margins and the components of the year-on-year change. Pre-tax margins for the first quarter were 7.8%, up 90 basis points over the prior year. This breaks down as follows: Merchandise margins were up 110 basis points, partially offset by the 20 basis point negative impact on the marked-to-market adjustment. SG&A expense was flat, but it's levered by 10 basis points on the 2% comp excluding the restructuring costs, so we actually got leverage on G&A if you back out the one-time restructuring costs that w had in the quarter. ", "Finally, I wanted to briefly discuss the refinancing of the convertible bonds. In early April we completed a $375 million debt offering and exercised our option to redeem the convertible notes. Since then, the debt - which had an accretive value of approximately $365 million - was converted into 15.1 million shares of TJX stock. Now this doesn't impact the EPS as these shares have always been included in our calculation, and we're now in the process of repurchasing these shares in the open market and will now use the $375 million of proceeds from the debt offering to do so. ", "At current stock prices we would expect to buyback approximately 13.5 million of the 15.1\u00a0million shares that were issued, and the deal should be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 accretive to EPS on an annualized basis, which was not included in our original plans for the year. The benefit of the reduced share count more than offsets the approximately $19 million of incremental interest expense on the new debt.", "So now let me turn to second quarter guidance. For the second quarter we expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.49 versus $0.48 per share last year. You'll see from our comp store sales guidance that we expect the economic and retail environment to continue to be difficult. ", "So, the assumptions - we're assuming a second quarter top line of $4.4 to $4.5 billion, with comp sales planned flat to down 2% on both a consolidated basis and also at the Marmaxx group. It's important to note that while the first quarter was up against an average comp increase of 1% over the past three years, the second quarter is up against an average 3% comp increase for the same period, so the comparisons get meaningfully more difficult in the second quarter. ", "For the month of May we're planning an increase of 3% to 4% on a consolidated basis and also at Marmaxx. We're anticipating a 3% to 5% decrease in June and a 1% to 3% decrease in July, both for TJX and for Marmaxx. It's important to note that we believe June will be our most difficult month as we were up against a very strong 5% consolidated comp last year and an average consolidated comp of 4% over the past three years.", "Pre-tax margins in the second quarter are planned in the 6.9% to 7.7% range. That's down 50 to up 30 basis points over the prior year. We are anticipating second quarter gross profit margin in the area of 24.3% to 24.8% compared to 24.3% last year, and SG&A as a percent of sales to be about 17% to 17.2% compared to 16.8% last year. We expect SG&A to delever in the second quarter due to the flat to negative 2% comp store sales we're planning as well as the impact of the lower average ticket on cost ratios. It's important to note that we've taken actions to deliver the $150 million of cost savings and are on track to meet these expectations. ", "Finally, for modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense in the $7 to $9 million range. ", "So we'll now turn the call back to [Elon] for questions and we'd ask you to keep the call on schedule we'd like you to limit your questions to one per person. So thank you and we'll now open it up.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan.", "Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan", "I guess maybe to Jeff or Carol, just Marmaxx was significantly better than we thought. Maybe if you could just break out how the 140 basis point margin improvement sort of broke out between merchandise margins or leverage and expense savings? ", "And then maybe, just Carol, maybe update us on your intermediate sort of opportunities for segment margins in the younger divisions?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, margins were very strong. It was really split between markdowns and markups. And Jeff, do you want to go through some of the costs?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Yes, I mean, the bottom line is we had a comp up 1%. Ordinarily you'd expect on a 1% comp increase to see deleverage and in fact we saw the merchandise margin was up significantly. It represents most of that 140 basis point increase, Brian. We also got a little bit of leverage from expenses, which speaks to the cost reductions efforts that we have in place. But I think if you look overall the 140 basis points, the lion's share of that is merchandise margin, as Carol mentioned.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "And Brian, in terms of the other divisions, really across the board everyone had significant increase in merchandise margin and in pre-tax with the exception of Winners due to the currency issue. But if you look at the U.K. in terms of in addition to the investment they were up 190\u00a0basis points. HomeGoods has had a spectacular quarter and they were up pre-tax 153. And A.J.'s, which had a very, very strong comp, tremendous again, pre-tax, over 300% increase. ", "So we're really across the board. I'm very, very pleased with the execution of all the divisions. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeff Black - Barclays Capital.", "Jeff Black - Barclays Capital", "On the regional trends, can you tell us what you're seeing in California these past couple of quarters and in Florida specifically and just what's happening there; if you could, in Texas as well. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Texas has been pretty good for awhile, so we've seen a pretty positive trend there. And Florida is definitely starting to come back. So, you know, the trend last year was softening in Florida and we're starting to see some increases there. And California is very slowly increasing, so the whole Southwest region is getting a little bit stronger. But we are definitely seeing some improvement and that is over a weaker comp.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse.", "Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "One question on the spread at Marmaxx; it looks like it's a little bit larger than it has been in prior quarters. Is there anything you could speak to there that might help explain that? I'm talking the spread between comps and total sales increase. ", "And then second, Jeff, I don't know if there's a way that you can give us a sense of the real estate deals that are getting presented to you today. Anyway that you can frame that for us maybe in terms of what you're seeing on a cost per foot versus what you've signed in previous years?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "In terms of the spread I'm going to have to look into that because when we look at Marmaxx's comp it was up 1% and if I look at the square footage growth - I'm quickly finding that here - if I look at the square footage growth for Marmaxx, it's up in that 2% to 3% range. So I don't think there's anything really going on. I mean, the store growth that would be benefiting this year from stores we opened last year was really no different.", "I think, Jeff, we're going to have to take that one offline and just pull the numbers apart a little bit because I'm not seeing the same thing. ", "Jeff Black - Barclays Capital", "", "Sure, yes. It just seems like the productivity number, the new store productivity number, would have to be really high to get to the spread that we're seeing in the first quarter. ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Okay. Well, let us look into it. I don't have anything. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, we'll get back to you on that.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "And in terms of real estate, you can see we've committed to opening more stores. We've got more in Europe than we have in the U.S. because frankly we've seen rates come down more quickly in Europe than they've come down in the U.S., so that's where we're putting the incremental capital at this point.", "And I would tell you over the last couple of monthly real estate cycles we're beginning to see those rates come down in the U.S., but I'd rather not get into specifics in terms of dollars per foot.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes. Paul, the real key here is the fact that we put our bucket aside and we will take advantage of best market prices.

The $150 million of cost savings, just so we're clear, that you're on track to hit for the year in SG&A, would we expect to see total SG&A reported for the company down by that amount on a year-on-year basis with most of the benefit coming in Q3 and Q4? ", "And my follow up really is with respect - it's a little qualitative, you know, looking back at our notes you talked about when you gave guidance before, I think it was back in April, it was really based on a, quote, \"deep recession continuing,\" and I'm just wondering, I mean, you've talked about it this morning, but would you characterize that kind of guidance to be using the same kind of language?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Well, in terms of - why don't I take SG&A? So in terms of SG&A, no, you can't just take the - you know, assume it would be down by $150 million because baseline costs are up and we're also seeing increases in pension expense, employee medical benefits, etc. So what we said in our guidance, John, was that we would expect expenses to be essentially flat year-on-year, the total SG&A.

Naylor", "Right now I think the way to think about it is - and we're not providing guidance for the full year\u00a0 but we said we thought SG&A would be flat for the year. Remember, that was based on a negative comp. So as we beat sales, we actually spend more in SG&A in the stores because we have incremental people in the stores and so [inaudible] on that with payroll is incremental transactions, so you have the interchange fees, supplies, etc. So there will be some costs that'll go up; SG&A will go up as we generate more sales. That's a good thing.", "In the first quarter we had 10 basis points of leverage on a 2% comp with our cost savings partially in. And as we look at the second quarter and going forward we would expect to continue to see leverage at a 2% comp. But we're not going to see a $150 million drop in our SG&A. A portion of that hits buying and occupancy, which is in gross profit, and obviously we have also cost increases across the whole cost structure, but particularly some significant increases in pension and benefits.", "John Morris - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "", "And then the follow up on the language?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes. The other thing that you've got to consider too is we are running with lower retail, so that does put more units through the system in terms of the cost structure. ", "Yes, deep recession, you know, obviously our first quarter was stronger. We planned a down 2% to down 4% and obviously we beat that with an up 2%, which is a positive trend which I can't say I'm not excited about. We went into this year with a lot of questions. So I don't think we have the answer to the deep recession. We're just going to take one quarter at a time.

Naylor", "Yes, I mean, the guidance, we're looking at it versus our plan for the year, Jeff. We set our plan based on currency rates that were in place when we began the year, which for the Canadian dollar was in the low 80s and the British pound sort of the mid, you know, around $1.50, so those would be the rates that would be used by the guidance.

The marked-to-market, which hit us in the first quarter, we flip - it reverses - so we'll end up with $0.02 of positive EPS from marked-to-market, so those two essentially cancel out. ", "I should also mention, though, in sort of calling those out, interest and tax rate also cost in the second quarter $0.01 apiece. So translation cost us $0.02, marked-to-market benefits us by $0.02, and interest and tax each cost us $0.01 in the second quarter if you think of it this year versus last year.", "Jeffery Stein - Soleil - Stein Research LLC", "", "And the trends at A.J. Wright, Carol?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, Jeff. Well, I talked about it before. We've had pretty positive trends for several quarters now and I think the big takeaways here are that we're really understanding the customer.

Wright performing better - I think it had its first profit in the first quarter - and obviously with the real estate opportunities, maybe unprecedented, at the moment, when do you think you start to ratchet up the growth to get better scale then?", "And then secondly, the U.K. business, which is now more than $2 billion, if you look at the rest of Europe where you're going into Poland, what do you think the revenue opportunity there is for the entire continent outside of the U.K.? Do you think it's as big or bigger than the U.K. based on your analysis? ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, A.J. Wright, we have a very, I'll say, very pleasant situation today in that we have really all of our chains doing well. And in terms of the real estate, Todd, we're balancing, again, the best deal in the best place. So although today A.J. Wright we're feeling great about and we're feeling great about it for the future, we have to balance the real estate opportunity there versus the U.K. versus Marmaxx. So I think we're just taking one deal at a time and making the absolute best deal and obviously that's what we set aside that capital for. ", "So we don't have any plans to suddenly go an additional 50 stores, that's for sure, and I don't think that's the smart way to do it. We've done things like that in the past and we don't want to repeat them. So we will be careful and we'll be prudent, but again, we're trying very hard to make the best deal and sit tight.

And then for the balance of the year, if we have flat comps, they generate flat EPS, it would be $0.57 in the third quarter and $0.46\u00a0ex the 53rd week in the fourth quarter. ", "So if we just look at the balance of the year - Q2, Q3, Q4 - if we run a flat comp we generate the numbers I just gave you and we'd be at $2.01. ", "We've provided updated guidance on Q2, so we're now saying at a flat comp we would generate a slight increase year-on-year - $0.49 versus $0.48 last year - but we're not at this point really prepared to say anything about the back half and probably won't until the second quarter call. So hopefully that's clear. ", "And on a full year basis, every comp point continues to be worth $0.08, so that's the sensitivity that people can plug into their models.", "In terms of CapEx, with the new stores - and I'm glad you asked - we would expect CapEx to be $450 to $475 million; before we'd said $450 million. So we think that'll be up slightly versus the prior guidance that we gave you. ", "And in terms of the cash forecast, with the higher CapEx we'd probably be closer to the lower end of the range. We said our range was to generate $500 to $600 million before any debt retirements and after the buyback and the dividend. So we would now expect to be nearer to the low end of that given the incremental CapEx.", "And then in terms of merchandise margin, it's really a pure merchandise margin. We report gross profit on our P&L which includes buying and occupancy costs; however, when we talk about merchandise margin on these calls and in our public filings that really represents markon less markdowns less freight expense and less shrink, so it's pretty much a pure merchandise margin.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair", "", "And that you're saying was the majority of the earnings upside relative to your original guidance range as opposed to just simply the expense or fixed cost leverage?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Yes. If you look versus - I'd call out two things. One is that the overall gross profit margin was 90\u00a0basis points better. We said 110 of that was merchandise margin; 20 went the other way on marked-to-market, so you can infer from that the buying and occupancy costs were flat as a percentage of sales. ", "", "In terms of how we performed against, you know, we had $0.11 of EPS upside against the top end. We had $0.49 of EPS against $0.38 at the high end. About $0.06 of that came from sales, $0.06 came from margins, and $0.01 came from [inaudible] and then we gave back $0.02 to $0.03 in the FOREX being a little higher than we planned it.", "So that's how you get to the variance from what we reported to where we set the high end of the range.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Marnie Shapiro - The Retail Tracker.", "Marnie Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "This is actually a very small question and it's a longer-term question, but if you're looking into going to Poland, I have to believe you're looking at what's going on online with things like Gilt Groupe and Rue La La and all those other smaller conversations online. And your CUBE is doing very well, which kind of leads me down that path, and I'm curious what your thought is about some of these businesses and if it's possibly down your thinking or Poland's your bigger fish to fry.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, right now we think store growth is obviously the place to be with the advantageous real estate deals. As always, we have a lot of initiatives. We have some tests; we are from ready to talk about them, but we're always looking at everything around us. But right now our big fish to fry is obviously stores. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Stacy Pak - SP Research.", "Stacy Pak - SP Research", "Jeff, on the Winners margin, can you address for us how that pressure may have lessened in Q1 and sort of what's embedded in Q2 guidance thinking about the segment margin? I'm kind of wondering how does Winners margin change here in Q2? And you can address the other margins while you're at it.", "On the cost reductions, can you share with us kind of what the baseline cost reduction was in Q1 and what's embedded for Q2 and how we think about those growing for Q3 and Q4?", "And then lastly on the May comps, your guidance of 3% to 4% implies another acceleration in three-year run rate and the guidance for the quarter suggests another slowdown and so I'm wondering is there something in June and July that we should be thinking about because the stimulus last year I think was already happening in May.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "", "On Winners margin, I think if you go to the sheet we put out on the website you'll see that whereas we had a 4% - 7% profit margin TY versus 8.4% last year in Winners, when you adjust out the foreign currency stuff, Stacy, that's an 8% this year versus a 9.3% last year. So if you block out marked-to-market, Winners would be down 130 basis points. ", "Basically we've got merchandise margin decreases being partially offset by SG&A leverage. And we're not going to get too specific amounts, but you've got merchandise margin deleverage greater than that. It's a 130 basis point decline. ", "And I think the Winners team has done a terrific job of mitigating the pressure that they're seeing on the merchandising margins from having to source goods in more expensive U.S. dollars. ", "Stacy Pak - SP Research", "", "Does that get smaller going forward, Jeff? I mean, isn't that less of an issue as the competitors adjust their retail?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "It's going to depend on two things. There's two ways that the pressure lessens. One is the Canadian dollar goes back up. You know, increases will obviously help merchandise margins because the U.S. dollar becomes less expensive, right, which drives down their cost. The Canadian dollar right now is up maybe a couple of pennies versus where we planned it but not significantly, so I wouldn't call that out as a significant factor. ", "The other factor is that Canadian retailers raise prices, and I think everybody's feeling the pressure but, I don't know. Ernie, we haven't seen that, right?", "Ernie Herrman", "No, we haven't seen that yet but there's a lag on that because they buy the goods six to nine months out. So, Stacy, we could see that more towards the summer and the third quarter. But, again, we're trying to be conservative on that front.", "I do commend the Winners team, however, on really capitalizing on the market opportunities in this environment to mitigate that over, you know, roughly a little over half the goods up there are bought in U.S. dollars, so I think they've done a nice job on buying better.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Yes, profit in the second - do not cut the marked-to-market in the second quarter of that, that $20\u00a0million of profit, you know, and adjust for that in translation, say, there's like $42\u00a0million. We're way above where we'd planned the business and I think that speaks to what Ernie just mentioned about the Winners team.", "The second item you asked about - ", "Stacy Pak - SP Research", "", "Well, first of all, the segment margins, you were going to weave that in and then cost reductions for Q1, Q2, and how to think about them.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Yes. So the cost reductions, I think the way to think about the cost reductions is we had meaningful amounts in Q1. Most of the initiatives will be in place some point in time in Q2, which means we're going to get the majority of the dollars, and we're going to have all the savings in place by the third quarter. ", "Stacy Pak - SP Research", "", "You don't want to quantify for us how much in Q1 and Q2?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "No, I really don't. I really don't. But I think the point here is that we feel very confident about the 150. Everything we had contemplated doing we've done or are very close to having completed, and we're getting the kinds of savings that we thought we would get. ", "In terms of May and comp store sales, we looked at this as we set the guidance on a three-year basis, and I think if you take our guidance in the last two years you would see that the second quarter is up an average - it's an average growth of 2%. The first quarter was up 2%. ", "Now as you correctly point out, the three-year comp for May is up 3%, so clearly that's ahead of the 2%, but I don't think we want to be planning, you know, at the current May run rate as we think about June and July because we're up against some big comps, but more importantly I think there's a lot of uncertainty in this environment. So that's why we [inaudible]. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Still look at the total quarter. I mean, there can always be a shift from one month to the other depending on the weather patterns and everything else, so I think it's just a very good logical plan for Q2. ", "I want to thank everyone and I'm sorry we ran over, and I look forward to reporting Q2 to you shortly.

Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, Sherry has some comments to make.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the companies' plans to vary materially.

Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our International division in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website, www.TJX.com.", "As a reminder, the comparable store sales numbers we talk about today are on a constant currency basis.", "With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today's press release and posted on our website, www.TJX.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "", "Good morning again. Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Jeff Naylor and Ernie Herman. So let\u2019s begin by saying it is great to report such strong results in such a difficult economy. We delivered EPS growth of 27% in the second quarter. I want to point out that this is on top of three consecutive years of very strong performance. Further, our first half EPS has grown at a compound annual rate of 20% over the past four years, which speaks to our ability to drive the sustained profit growth.", "Our strategies for 2009 are clearly working. Despite the environment, we are seeing comp sales not only remain positive but accelerate, which is very unusual for us during a recession. ", "In addition, our customer traffic counts have reached extraordinary heights. Value is winning in this environment and we believe that it\u2019s here to stay. We think that the economic recovery is likely to be slow, that customers will remain under pressure to reduce household debt, and that a value-oriented customer mindset will prevail for a long time. ", "With our value proposition consisting of the combination of fashion, brands, quality, and price, we are in an excellent position to retain new customers that we are attracting today for the future. Further, we are employing the flexibility of our business model to take advantage of the opportunities that this environment is presenting. ", "Big picture, we believe that we are extremely well-positioned for today and for the future. I believe we have tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us, which I will talk about later in the call. ", "Before that, I will turn the call over to Jeff to recap our second quarter and first half financial results. Then I will review the highlights of our second quarter performance, our vision for growth, and our outlook for the full year. Now here\u2019s Jeff to recap the numbers. ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everybody. So to recap second quarter results, our net sales were $4.7 billion, up 4% over last year. Consolidated comp store sales were up 4% -- that was well above our plan and it was on top of three years of very, very strong comparisons. ", "As we noted in the release today, the diluted earnings per share were $0.61. That\u2019s up 27% over the $0.48 we earned last year. This growth was achieved despite a net $0.03 per share negative impact from foreign currency translation and from marking our inventory related currency hedges to market. The mark-to-market adjustment was $0.02 unfavorable to what we had anticipated when we set our guidance in early July. ", "In terms of the quality of earnings growth, pretax income was up 23% despite higher interest expense and despite $18 million of foreign exchange impact. The tax rate was essentially flat to last year, so that did not contribute to year-over-year growth. Our share count was down 3%, a very small piece of our overall 27% EPS growth and in line with our strategy to buy back shares. ", "There were no other significant items impacting comparability, so all in all, we had a very high quality earnings growth in the quarter. ", "In terms of consolidated pretax profit margin, that was 8.7%, up 130 basis points over last year. Comparisons to prior year were adversely impacted 10 basis points by the mark-to-market adjustment and another 10 basis points by higher interest expense. ", "The gross profit margin was up by a very strong 130 basis points over LY, driven primarily by merchandise margins. SG&A expense was 10 basis points lower than last year as a percentage of sales. ", "As to inventories at the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including the warehouses, were down 4%. At Marmaxx, our total inventory commitment, including the warehouses, stores, and merchandise on order, was also down versus last year on a per store basis. ", "We ended the second quarter with very clean inventories and are very happy with our inventory liquidity as we enter the back half. ", "Now to briefly recap results for the first half -- EPS for the six months were $1.09, so $1.09, up 18% over last year\u2019s $0.92 on a reported basis. Last year\u2019s EPS benefited $0.02 per share from FIN-48 tax adjustments. Excluding this benefit, EPS was up 21% over the adjusted $0.90 per share. ", "As outlined in today\u2019s press release, foreign exchange rates adversely impacted EPS for the first half of this year by $0.07, compared to a $0.01 adverse impact in the first half of last year, so the EPS increase would have been significantly higher were it not for these impacts. Cost sales increased 3% in the first half over a 3% increase last year. ", "Now let me turn the call back to Carol and I will return later to recap our guidance at the end of the call. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Jeff. The important points that I would like to make on this call are as follows -- first the strength and consistency of our results should be noted, both in terms of year-over-year and division-to-division performance, as well as across economic cycles. Second, we have great opportunities in the back half of this year, given our strong trends and easier comp comparisons. Third, our growth vehicles, both domestically and abroad, are doing extremely well and hold tremendous potential for our company. ", "Fourth, our customer traffic count reached extraordinary high levels in the second quarter and the rate of increase accelerated from the first quarter. We continue to attract new customers with our value proposition and are building our customer base for the future. And lastly, I say it all the time, we must continue to be totally focused on execution. ", "So let me highlight some of the second quarter results. Beginning in the U.S., Marmaxx\u2019s second profit margin of 11.4% was the best second quarter performance ever in Marmaxx\u2019s history. Segment profit was up 20%, driven by a 4% comp, very strong merchandise margins, and effective expense controls. ", "Home Goods delivered a 9% comp with double-digit increases in customer traffic. This division\u2019s profit margins improved dramatically to 5.9%, it\u2019s best second quarter performance ever and we believe it\u2019s profit margin will hit all-time highs for the full year. I believe that Home Goods still has tremendous untapped opportunities for the future. ", "At A.J., they had another profitable quarter with the strength of 5% comps on top of 6% increases in the past two years. A.J. Wright\u2019s store contribution model is now at a level we have been targeting, which gives us the confidence to continue to roll out new stores. ", "In Canada, while Winners and Homesense segment profit was lower than last year, it was entirely due to the negative impact of currency. Profit was well above our plan as the business did a great job of mitigating the currency impact through better buying and excellent expense control. Our Canadian divisions remained our highest ROIC business. ", "TJX Europe continues to significantly outperform our expectations. After investing in our new European businesses, segment profit grew approximately 80% and segment profitability improved by a very strong 230 basis points over last year. And T.K. Maxx put a 6 comp on top of comps that have ranged from 5% to 10% over the last three preceding years. With strong comp sales growth, as well as leveraging its cost base across a broader European business, we now believe that T.K. Maxx in the U.K. will exceed our previously stated segment profit target of 8% this year. ", "Now I want to move to our vision for growth, which is rooted in how we conduct ourselves as a company. On our year-end call, we reiterated our vision and strategies to grow TJX as a global off-price value retailer. We told you that we were planting the seeds for the future. We are encouraged by early reads and would grow when and where we are convinced it would produce solid returns to our shareholders. All of that still holds true today, except that we have seen even better results than we had expected and are taking advantage of the opportunities that this environment is presenting, which together gives us more confidence than ever that we can double the size of this company over the long-term. ", "Our growth vehicles are all performing well domestically and abroad. In the U.S., we now feel that A.J. Wright has a solid foundation. As I mentioned, it\u2019s store contribution margins have gotten to where we needed to see them to give us the confidence to grow this business. In addition, the new market of Atlanta is outperforming our expectation. While we will not grow too quickly, we could step out of it next year. ", "As we pointed out before, we have a very strong management team in place for the future. ", "Also in the U.S., our test of our Mega Shoe Shop by Marshalls, although still early, are performing very well and we believe may hold a good deal of growth potential in the future. ", "In Europe, our T.K. Maxx stores in Germany continue to deliver powerful performance, exceeding our plans and we are on track to open our first stores in Holland this fall. Putting all of this together with the results we are seeing and the real estate deals we are getting is very excited. While we are definitely seizing the day, I want to say it again -- we will only grow when and where we see [occurrence] that justifies growth. ", "Now let\u2019s talk about how we are capitalizing on the opportunities in this environment. First we continue to attract new customers and are building our customer base for the future. Customer traffic continues to be up significantly and our average basket remains down, which means that even a slight increase in consumer spending in our basket would be very meaningful to our business. This would probably be a good place to say that we are thrilled with the results of our dual branding strategy of T.J. Maxx and Marshall\u2019s, and are very pleased with the new campaign at Home Goods. ", "Additionally, we are very focused on making the shopping experience for our new customers a great one and have staffed our stores appropriately. ", "In addition to building our customer base, we are taking advantage of this environment to build our vendor base. I can assure you that we are highly confident in the future of our supply chain. In terms of sourcing, we have significantly expanded the breadth of our vendor base. Any one vendor is even less meaningful to us today than a few years ago. We continue to build our buying group and now have more coverage of the worldwide marketplace than ever before, with over 600 people in our merchant organization. ", "Now to the real estate environment, which is presenting opportunities in the near term as well as for our long-term growth. Some very attractive locations are opening up to us the first time. We now expect to net approximately 90 new stores this year, up slightly from what we said on the last call, due to some opportunistic deals. Keep in mind that while we are capitalizing upon opportunities, we are still opening fewer stores than last year, so we are being very careful. And next year we anticipate opening more stores than this year, with our growth opportunity and the advantages of the global real estate environment. ", "I want to reiterate that the strategies for growth that we shared with you a year ago are all working today. What has changed this year is that our results are better than we expected and the environment is offering us excellent opportunities. We are more committed than ever to our vision for growth. I can assure you that we will remain prudent and methodical in our approach. It\u2019s part of who we are. However, the advantages we have in the current environment bring even greater clarity to our vision to grow TJX well beyond the $20 billion company we are today. ", "Now let me move to our financial strengths -- returning excess cash to shareholders remains a priority that we are balancing with preserving our financial flexibility in this economy. Our strong operations generate substantial amounts of cash, which allows us to reinvest in our businesses and be conservative with CapEx, while we are simultaneously returning value to our shareholders through our share buy-back and dividend programs. ", "In terms of share repurchases, we bought back approximately $194 million of TJX stock during the second quarter, retiring 6.4 million shares. It continues to be our plan to buy back a total of approximately $625 million of TJX stock in 2009. This consists of $250 million we originally planned and the additional approximately $375 million to buy back the shares that converted in the first quarter. However, we may adjust this up or down depending on the economic conditions. ", "Let me now move to our outlook for the full year -- we are now planning EPS to be in the range of $2.26 to $2.38, compared with $2.08 per share last year on a recorded basis. Last year\u2019s results included a $0.09 per share benefit from the 53rd week, as well as certain other items impacting comparability, which are detailed in a table in today\u2019s press release. ", "Excluding these items, our full-year EPS outlook of $2.26 to $2.38 represents an 18% to 24% increase over last year\u2019s adjusted $1.92. ", "I should also point out that this guidance includes an estimate of $0.03 per share negative impact from foreign currency for the full year. ", "Our outlook assumes a comparable store sales increase of 2% to 4% in both the third and the fourth quarter. Although we are up against easier compares in the back half, we believe it makes sense to continue to plan our business conservatively. This strategy has allowed us to generate significant leverage on incremental sales in the first half, so it is working and we will continue with this approach to the business. ", "However, I am pleased with our current momentum entering the back-to-school period. Jeff will provide more detail in a moment. ", "So in closing, let me say that we believe we have more opportunities in front of us than ever before. We are seizing the day to take full advantage of the terrific opportunities this environment presents. Our strategies to remain flexible and conservative are working and we are going to stick with them. We know that we must execute sharply and we will. Our approach has always been and will continue to be that when things are going well, we get more demanding of the entire organization, not less. Complacency is not in our DNA. ", "While we significantly surpassed our expectations for the first half and reached many all-time highs, I want everyone to hear me say that we are far from maximizing our growth opportunities. We hear the discussion out there about whether our growth is sustainable, so I want to be crystal clear on this point, despite all that we have achieved, we strongly believe that there is even greater growth ahead of us. As we enter the back half, we have great opportunities in our existing businesses and several new growth initiatives that we will be testing, as we are constantly planting new seeds for future growth. ", "Further, a very important piece of our growth story that I want to make sure is understood is the scope of our value proposition. We span the customer income demographic from the low-end through the middle and to the high-end. We believe that our customer appeal is broader than any other apparel or home retailer out there. Just think about how much more growth we can achieve on a global level with this broad customer appeal. I have great confidence that we will emerge from the recession in a stronger position and grow beyond the $20 billion business we are today with stable, consistent, and strong growth. ", "Now I will turn the call back to Jeff to go through further details on the second quarter and our guidance, and then we will open it up for questions. ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Thanks. Obviously we now believe we have enough visibility into the balance of the year to provide guidance for the full year. What we will give you today is detailed guidance for the third quarter. We are also providing you with our outlook for comparable store sales growth and EPS for the fourth quarter and the full year but, and I want to emphasize this, we are not providing detailed guidance or models for these periods at this time. So we will give you very detailed guidance for the third quarter. We\u2019ll give you ranges of comp and EPS for the fourth quarter and the full year but no detailed models or guidance for the fourth quarter or full year. ", "Now let me turn to the details on third quarter guidance -- for the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.68 over the $0.58 per share we reported last year. There are several items impacting comparability here. Last year the mark-to-market adjustment for our inventory related hedges benefited EPS by $0.05 per share, while this year it\u2019s estimated to only have a $0.02 per share benefit, which is essentially the reversal of the Q2 quarter end mark-to-market adjustment that we booked in Q2. ", "Additionally, we expect Q3 this year to be unfavorably impacted by $0.01 per share due to the impact of foreign exchange translation. ", "And finally last year\u2019s Q3 earnings per share benefited from an adjustment to our computer intrusion reserve of about $0.01, so when you adjust for these factors, the third quarter guidance represents a 17% to 29% increase over prior year. ", "We are assuming a third quarter top line of $5.0 billion to $5.1 billion, with comp sales planned up 2% to 4% on both a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group. ", "As to monthly comps, both on a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group, we expect comp sales in the range of 2% to 4% in August, 1% to 3% in September, and 2% to 4% in October. ", "Pretax profit margins are planned in the 8.7% to 9.4% range, which on a reported basis are down 10 to up 60 basis points over the prior year. However, these year-over-year comparisons are significantly impacted by mark-to-market adjustments, which negatively impact our year-over-year pretax margin comparisons by 40 basis points. Last year also benefited by 10 basis points from the favorable intrusion reserve adjustment that I mentioned earlier. So adjusting for these items, the pretax margin would actually be up 40 to 110 basis points. ", "I should also note that higher interest expense year over year, in part due to pre-funding year-end debt maturities, adversely impacts pretax margin comparisons by approximately 10 to 20 basis points. ", "Staying with the third quarter, we are anticipating gross profit margin in Q3 to be 25.9% to 26.4%, compared with 25.7% last year. Again, gross profit margin comparisons are adversely impacted by 40 basis points due to the mark-to-market adjustments I just described, so the underlying year-over-year increase is greater than the guidance would indicate.

Good morning and congratulations on a great quarter. Jeff, I was hoping you could help us understand the magnitude of the items impacting the gross margin in the second quarter, the 130 basis point improvement between, for example, merchandise margin, occupancy, et cetera. Thanks. ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "In terms of the gross margin, Kimberly, that was primarily driven by merchandise margin. We had a little bit of buying and occupancy levered, but primarily merchandise margin related. ", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Thanks.", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "The one other point I would make out is mark-to-market adjustments had a 10 basis point adverse impact on the gross profit margin, so that 130 basis points improvement would have been 140 basis points worth after that market-to-market hit. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick.  ", "Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks. Congrats as well. I guess our question is on the Marmaxx segment margins, it looks like you\u2019ve got a lot more leverage in Q1 on a one comp than you did I guess in the second quarter on a four comp, so we\u2019re just trying to understand what the difference between the two quarters from a leverage perspective and how should we think about the leverage point going into the back half?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Brian, first of all we are leveraging SG&A very well. There\u2019s probably 20 to 30 basis points predominantly due to our incentive program, which does go very deep in the organization. As you know, we have thousands of associates, including our store managers. So with this very strong performance, it\u2019s significantly higher than planned. We have a bit in the 401K and probably for the back half, a slight up-tick in marketing. Jeff, do you want to add to that?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "I think just when you look, the difference on Marmaxx is really being driven by SG&A, which as Carol mentioned is impacting the entire quarter so if you look at SG&A, Brian, you see we reported 10 basis points of leverage today. If you actually calculate it, by the way, it\u2019s closer to 20 basis points. There\u2019s some rounding going on. ", "The underlying leverage is actually significantly higher than that 20 basis points. As Carol mentioned, we\u2019ve got an incentive plan, incentive programs that are tied to financial performance that go very deep into our organization. We have store managers and thousands of exempt associates participating and these associates are going to receive pay-outs that are well above plan. I mean, the strength of performance with EPS up 21% year-to-date in a very difficult economy with the majority of retailers struggling, this is leading to higher expenses, higher incentive expenses associated with these broad-based incentive plans. So as Carol mentioned, the expense is meaningful. It\u2019s worth about 20 to 30 basis points in terms of a G&A hit in the second quarter. It\u2019s impacting the majority of our operating divisions because they are all performing terrifically and you know, we are going to see this impact carry over into the back half as well. ", "That said, if you look at Q3, we are calling for SG&A leverage of 10 to 30 basis points, despite this impact. It really tells you we are getting the cost savings that we planned. ", "Probably a bit more than you asked for there, Brian, but it sort of naturally led into a conversation about SG&A. ", "Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan", "Yep, always appreciate it. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Black. ", "Jeff Black - Barclays Capital", "Hey, thanks a lot and nice quarter as well. Carol, you mentioned you broadened the vendor base. Now, just to get at what\u2019s really the main knock on the story, I guess, do we see at this point in time some of the bigger brands less availability and that\u2019s why you are broadening out things? And is that a break from historical practice when we are coming out of recessions and we might have saw the supply chain tighten up? Could you just add some color around that for us? Thanks. ", "Carol B. Tome", "I would say to you the answer to that in terms of the big brands is absolutely not. We put a strategy in place many years ago when we looked at the whole extension of being a global company and purposefully put a lot of dollars into sourcing and expanding to be very, very unique. I think today, we probably have the most exciting stores that I\u2019ve ever seen and the breadth of assortments, which is what we strive for, a little of everything versus being narrow and deep in any one place makes for probably one of the most exciting mixes and I think that\u2019s what is driving the customer back into our store and I think that\u2019s what is driving our traffic. So that will continue. ", "So there\u2019s no change in our philosophy. We are just broadening, which I think is very exciting. ", "Jeff Black - Barclays Capital", "Great. Good luck. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Slater.   ", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Thanks very much and congrats. I am always shocked by the market\u2019s reaction to probably some of the strongest fundamentals in retail, but anyway -- you come up -- but I\u2019m interested in your guidance. I mean, you come up against much easier back half comps, and I think you talked a little bit about this and I\u2019m wondering why your guidance using the midpoint of your comp guidance assumes a pretty decent deceleration in the two-year average comp. So you did a 4% comp in the third quarter on 3% last year, it\u2019s like a 3.5% two-year average. And then if you look at sort of your third and fourth quarter, even at the fourth quarter you are calling for if you take the midpoint of that two to four, you are calling for a deceleration to like 0.4% on a two-year basis. I am just wondering what are the things that are contributing to that type of conservative guidance?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think the way we looked at it is we really took the first half and basically said fairly equal in the second half. Yes, planning conservatively and I think part of it is we obviously with the volatility of the economic environment, we never know. Having said that, my intention is obviously to beat it and we are conservative in our plans and I think wisely so at this point. ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "I mean, I think it\u2019s benefited us year-to-date. I think you called that out in your comments. It\u2019s really benefited us year-to-date in that we set our inventory and our cost plans around comps that are reasonable but conservative and that\u2019s the way we are going to continue to plan the business. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "And we certainly will leverage our business a lot better by planning it that way. ", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "And do you expect in the fourth quarter the consumer to be, or the trends to get any worse than they were in the first half or do you expect them to be the same or a little better?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I really can\u2019t answer that. I can only tell you that we will go after a bigger piece of the pie. ", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Fair enough. Best of luck. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from John Morris.", "John Morris - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations as well. Carol, can you talk a little bit about the success and the learnings of your advertising strategy, what\u2019s been different there both in terms of spend or shifting dollars, international TV? What kind of results are you getting and what are your plans there going forward strategically?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay, well I won't give you all our secrets, that\u2019s for sure. I can tell you that I think it\u2019s out there that we have done this dual advertising in terms of Marmaxx, which we think we are just at the beginning of this venture and we are pretty excited about what we are seeing. ", "It\u2019s really allowed us to hit probably between 30% and 40% of the market that have never have seen us really on TV, let alone on a consistent basis. So our plans are to be fairly aggressive in the back half and to continue this and we have a few new goodies and surprises for the future, and we are testing some other possibilities that will be very intriguing corporately going forward. ", "So that\u2019s really all the comments I can make. I can tell you our spend will be less but our penetration will be greater. ", "John Morris - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Is the strategy a little bit different in the sense that you had been advertising more on the basis of price and now it\u2019s more brand? Can you comment on that -- more of a brand strategy? ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We have both. We really have a layer cake. Because when you incorporate TV, direct mail, and every other vehicle that we have, we still layer in value as a big chunk of it and branding as the other piece. ", "John Morris - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good luck for the back half. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. If we forget about anything that happened last year for a second, I\u2019m just wondering why fourth quarter wouldn\u2019t be a larger EPS quarter than 3Q. I\u2019m just trying to understand the guidance a little bit. And then to layer on to that easier sales comparisons and more help from FX, I\u2019m just trying to figure out how you come up with that fourth quarter guidance. Maybe part of that is if you could share your currency assumptions, Jeff?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Well, yeah, I mean, I think when we forecast currency, Paul, we forecast it at the current rate. And right now, we would anticipate about $0.02 pick-up, and we have that baked into the numbers. ", "You know, if you back out currency, if you back out mark-to-market, the 53rd week, you know, some of the one-time items that we have had and that we detailed in the press release, you would see the midpoint of EPS range is up 10%. I think if you look at it without the translation benefit because frankly there\u2019s no guarantee what currency rates are going to do, it would be up 14%. That\u2019s a on a 2 to 4 comp and I think the biggest factor impacting fourth quarter is given that we are trying to project out, a decent amount of time in an economy that\u2019s relatively uncertain, we took the tact here of being relatively prudent in the way that we set the guidance. So to build on the question Todd asked earlier, year-to-date we have a 3 comp on top of a 3 last year. You know, our guidance for the fourth quarter is 2 to 4 on top of a minus 2, so clearly there is a deceleration baked in there. If that doesn\u2019t happen, you know, then there\u2019s upside. But we just felt it made sense to plan our cost structure and our inventory prudently around that level of comp growth. ", "In terms of the pretax margin, if you do the reverse math, we\u2019re about flat to up 70 basis points. The mark-to-market in a 53rd week impacts in the fourth quarter basically cancel each other out, so on a 2 to 4, flat to 70 basis points, we have that bonus impact that we talked about earlier which dampens those year-over-year pretax margin increases. ", "But I think we are clearly being prudent, given the length of time between now and the fourth quarter and I think what remains a reasonable amount of economic uncertainty. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Paul, I\u2019ll say that having said that, I certainly hope we beat those numbers. ", "Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "Me too. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffery Stein.", "Jeffery Stein - Soleil-Stein Research", "You guys have clearly seen a nice turn in your home business and I\u2019m wondering, Carol, if you could possibly talk a little bit about some of the categories where you are seeing most upside. ", "And in turn -- some of the categories where you are still seeing weakness, and also if you can just talk about you did allude to the fact that your basket was solid -- was it up in the second quarter?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay. First of all in terms of the basket, our basket is slightly down. Our traffic is way up -- very, very strong and our average ticket is down mid-single-digits. So that\u2019s what is really driving it, is truly the traffic. ", "In terms of the home businesses, Jeff, it is really strong across the board. What I am very happy about and gives me a tremendous positive feeling going forward is that not only are the fashion pieces working but the basic pieces are working, so when our sheets and towel business and our soft home and our basics are strong, that\u2019s a tremendous sign. ", "So I think our values are extraordinary, I think the execution is absolutely terrific and we are testing a lot of new ideas and new categories, so I just think it\u2019s going to get more exciting.

Our next question is from Adrianne Shapira.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Thank you. Hi, Carol. Congratulations. Just following up on the traffic, it sounds like clearly that has been a phenomenal success. Maybe -- give us a sense of the sequential improvement you are seeing, and then if you can give us any sort of breakdown, new customers, existing customers coming more frequently -- where do you think the traffic lift is coming from? Thanks. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "All right. Well, in terms of the lift, I think it\u2019s coming from both and we don\u2019t have the specific numbers yet but our early information definitely tells us it\u2019s coming from both. Q1, and again we won't quote specific numbers but I can tell you that there has definitely been an acceleration that seems to be continuing. And it is across the board.

Just wanted to see if you might give us an update on some of the in-store merchandising initiatives and where you stand with the rollout and -- of let\u2019s say the runway at Maxx or the cube at Marshall\u2019s, those kinds of things and if those had any material impact in the quarter and what the outlook is going forward. Thanks. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay. Ernie, do you want to talk to the runway in cube?", "Ernie Herrman", "Patrick, and I think this came up at a call earlier, on the runway we\u2019ve added another few stores because our results there continue to be strong. We like what we see. I think it does speak a little bit to the whole conversation of getting new customers in the door, a different customer that speaks to what Carol said earlier about a broader range of customers, so again we are pretty content with the runway and have added a few stores recently, actually in this quarter here that we are just finishing. ", "The Junior Cube, you know, initiative continues to expand. We are at a little over 400 stores at this point and again, the results, we are very happy with. So -- and what we are trying to do there is obviously capitalize on a different customer than we have in the past, the younger customer, again going back to the comment about trading broader demographics wise. I think we are trading to not only a different demographic but a different age group, so that I think is planting a strong seed for the future and those are two good initiatives, actually, [inaudible]. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "What\u2019s interesting, Patrick, is that typically your mean age sort of starts to age and ours isn\u2019t. We\u2019ve actually gone slightly down a few years, which means that when we talk about the increase in traffic, it absolutely means that we are capturing both a younger customer and keeping our customers, so that\u2019s a pretty exciting statistic. ", "Patrick McKeaver - MKM Partners", "So does that shape some of the broad comments that you made earlier about please with back to school, early back to school, that kind of thing? Is it just being better positioned from a merchandising standpoint with Juniors and some other categories?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, absolutely. ", "Patrick McKeaver - MKM Partners", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair", "Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question about A.J. Wright, the profit margin trend obviously up considerably year to year but relative to the first quarter, down a little bit. Was that primarily markdowns earlier in the quarter or was there some, you know, what should we kind of be expecting going forward there? Thank you. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Patrick, we definitely did do a clean-out in A.J.\u2019s. We got hit with the cooler weather. We took some -- we made a decision to take some early markdowns and clean out all summer, very early, so we did take a bigger hit in July than we had in plan. Having said that, we entered August strong, in great shape and I feel very, very good about it going forward. This is a very short moment in time. ", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks very much, guys. A quick question about your thoughts regarding the debt coming due and what the ideal balance sheet will look like and presumably with more capital, your intention to perhaps accelerate share repurchases? ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Well, clearly we have $1.4 billion on our balance sheet. We also have almost $150 million in cash that we can\u2019t classify as such because it\u2019s invested in marketable securities that are a little bit over 90 days, so we are sitting here with about $1.5 billion. ", "Our intent right now is to retire the debt, so of that $1.5 billion, $400 million of it is for debt retirement. We have actually paid down the Canadian debt, which is approximately $200 million. The rate of interest that we were paying on that was very comparable to the rate of interest we were earning on the money, so it just made sense to pay it down. ", "And then we have the bonds to repay in December, so that $1.5 billion, really $400 million of that is earmarked for debt repayment, so that would leave us with $1.1 billion. Clearly, Richard, it\u2019s not our goal to run with that level of cash. If you look historically, we have typically run $400 million or $500 million of cash on our balance sheet. ", "However, I would say in this environment, you know, we are going to want to maintain some excess liquidity as it\u2019s probably not a bad thing and continue to be conservative. And you know, so our plans are currently to execute the buy-back plan as we\u2019ve laid it out, the $625 million, although there is a chance that at certain stock prices, that we might go in a little bit heavier on the buy-back and we reserve the right to do that and we clearly have the financial flexibility to do that. But ultimately that cash will be distributed to shareholders. That\u2019s been our practice, our longstanding practice now for the last -- well, for as far back as I can go, so we\u2019ll continue -- so we are going to continue that practice but I think for the short-term, don\u2019t be surprised to see us run a little bit heavier levels of cash, given the environment. ", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "And the opportunity to leverage up further? ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "We\u2019re pretty happy with the level of debt we have now. We have -- essentially this year all of our transactions have replaced existing debt, so we really haven\u2019t impacted our leverage ratio. I think over time as EBITDA grows, you have the ability to take on more leverage, and we\u2019ll consider that but as of right now, there are no plans to do so.

Our next question is from Dana Telsey.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group ", "Good morning, everyone and congratulations. Can you review a little bit the operating margins in the second quarter by division and what your outlook is for the third quarter by division? And Carol, you mentioned a lot of times new category opportunities -- when do you think we hear about some things like that? Thank you. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We\u2019ll go through the model. Dana, I think I\u2019m not going to answer your second question. ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "That\u2019s a big question, Dana. Do you want me to go ahead and take it? Okay, yeah, fine. So in the case of Marmaxx, Marmaxx\u2019s profit margin was up 130 basis points on a 4 comp in the second quarter. Right now we have it up 100 to up 140 basis points on a 2 to 4 comp in the third quarter. ", "In the case of -- I\u2019ll do the American, the U.S. divisions, and then do international. In the case of Home Goods, in the first -- or in the second quarter, excuse me, we saw a 230 basis point -- excuse me, 530 basis point improvement on a 9 comp. Our guidance for the third quarter is a 220 to 330 basis point increase on a 4 to 6 comp, so again those line up. ", "With A.J. Wright, we saw a 130 basis point improvement on a 5 comp. As we look at the third quarter, we actually on a 3 to 5 comp would project it up 160 to 250, so it\u2019s higher than we saw in the second quarter, primarily because of the markdown issue that Carol mentioned that dampened the overall profit growth at A.J. Wright slightly. ", "In terms of our international businesses unfortunately you get a lot of noise in here because of mark-to-market. In the case of Winners, Winners was down 150 basis points in the second quarter but only down 30 if you back out the impact of the mark-to-market, which was -- it\u2019s very important. I mean, they did a fabulous job of mitigating the impact of foreign currency on their cost of goods and a great job of managing expenses, so for them to be only down 30 basis points in the second quarter excluding the mark-to-market is a big deal. ", "We look for a similar level of decline in the third quarter. We right now have them down 20 to down 40, again excluding mark-to-market. ", "And in the case of T.K. Maxx, T.K. Maxx profit margin for -- or TJX Europe, we have -- they were up 230 basis points in the second quarter. There was really no impact from mark-to-market on it and that was on a 5 -- excuse me, on a 6 comp and then in the third quarter, we have them up 20 to up 120, again excluding mark-to-market on a 3% to 5% comp, so that\u2019s how it breaks out by business, Dana.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Stacy Pak.", "Stacy Pak - SP Research", "Hi, guys, congrats again. So I guess the question just on the whole cost reduction effort -- are you still sort of thinking 150 is the right number for \u201909? Can you talk a little bit about what inning you are in, what cost reductions we might be able to see for 2010 and sort of the potential improvement to gross margin and SG&A from those efforts, you know, multi-year kind of level? And maybe in that, throw in your thoughts on operating margin goals by division now, especially given some of the changes we saw this quarter?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "So Stacy, was that one question? All right. I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff in a minute. In terms of the cost reduction, we had a goal of 150. We are definitely going to reach that goal. We are looking obviously at next year on what that number could look like. We are working on that today and we will update you obviously on that call in the beginning of the year and give you a full picture of that. And then in terms of multi-year, Jeff, do you want to just --", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Well, I think the one other thing I would call out on the $150 million is at the beginning of the year, we said SG&A would be essentially flat on a constant currency basis and actually down in an actual dollar basis. And we are on track for that. I think what you have to call out is that our significantly above planned performance, it results in additional SG&A dollars for the first -- you know, with sales significantly over plan, there\u2019s variable costs like store payroll, the credit card interchange costs, et cetera, which have to increase the support sales. Also, we are planning to open 24 more stores than our original plan, so we\u2019ve added 25 stores to the plan, and Carol talked earlier about some of the performance related incentive costs that are higher due to our strong performance. So when we actually normalize for -- and we have a little bit of additional marketing that we are spending behind the strength in the business in the back half of the year, so if you normalize for that, we\u2019re seeing $150 million and we are seeing flat SG&A year over year. It\u2019s just that we -- since we\u2019ve put the plan together, we\u2019ve actually added G&A, so that\u2019s important to call out. ", "The other call out on this year as we look at second and third quarter, and I am not commenting on fourth quarter at this point but second and third quarter, you know, excluding the impact from the incentive comp, we\u2019re seeing very, very significant SG&A leverage and that\u2019s being driven by this. ", "You know, as we look forward, I don\u2019t think we are prepared to put a model for next year at this point. And as I think as we look at our potential margins, you know, the operating margin goals for each business, they are essentially in line with where we have been. We think Home Goods is clearly a lot closer than they were. They had a peak margin two years ago, lost a lot last year. They\u2019ve gained it all back and then some this year. ", "T.K. we think can exceed their profit margin goal. Carol talked about that in the script but beyond that, you know, and Marmaxx is clearly pushing the high end. But I think beyond that, we haven\u2019t revised any of those goals and really wouldn\u2019t comment on that until we get into putting a plan on the street for next year. ", "Stacy Pak - SP Research", "Just on the cost side, do you think that -- I mean, what inning are you in? If you don\u2019t want to comment, I understand you don\u2019t want to give numbers for TAN, that\u2019s fine but can you just give us a sense of sort of what inning you are in and you know, what sort of opportunities you may be looking at for 2010? Anything qualitative? ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Stacy, as far as I am concerned, every single year we are going to go after cost reduction. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in -- we\u2019re going to finish this year, certainly reaching our goal and hopefully surpassing it and then we are going to set the next goal for next year.

Just to piggy-back on the last couple of questions -- Jeff, can you give the EBIT, segment EBIT sort of goals for this year that are embedded within your full year assumption?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "We\u2019re really not -- I\u2019d be happy to that for third quarter but I think as it relates to fourth and full quarter, we -- as we said earlier, we weren\u2019t going to put detailed models on the street at this point. ", "David Mann - Analyst", "Okay, then if I can ask a different question, you\u2019ve talked a lot about inventory availability not being a problem. Can you just comment a little bit on whether you are seeing better pricing now in terms of contributing to merchandise margin and whether you believe that\u2019s sustainable?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I would say we are seeing both, David, but again, I\u2019m going to go back to how we set up our sourcing and supply chain -- every single year we\u2019ve increased our buying of off-price, you know, and we will continue that goal. So we just -- we see this continuing, the availability via best brands or any country. I don\u2019t see that changing. ", "David Mann - Analyst", "Great. Thank you. Great job.

Just a follow-up on home goods -- how much of your improvement, which was pretty spectacular for the quarter, was due to operational improvements and inventory management, which we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time, and how much was just better traffic and merchandising? ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It\u2019s really all three. Our inventory levels are significantly down, which allows us to really flow in a lot of fresh, fantastic merchandise and I think our execution is really where it should be this year and I do think we skipped a few beats last year and I think we are at a place today where the guys understand it, they know that going forward, they know what they need to do and I think that some of it is up. ", "", "David Glick - Analyst ", "Great. Thanks a lot for the color and good luck in the second half. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I\u2019m very happy with the performance. ", "David Glick - Analyst ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Marnie Shapiro.", "Marnie Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Hey, guys, congratulations. Great quarter. I have two tiny questions -- you talked briefly about your basket being down and average ticket being down. I was curious if you could give us color, if that was mix of product versus mark-downs, and did Home Goods -- I\u2019m sorry, A.J. have an impact on that for the overall? And were there any segments that you saw rebound nicely and improve nicely in the second quarter that you are able to now flex up going into the back half? ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "In terms of our basket being down, we said mid-single-digits. A.J.\u2019s really has no effect on that, Marnie -- it\u2019s really across the board and the qualitative piece is the qualitative piece. I just think we\u2019ll continue to give great value to the consumer and that\u2019s what our goal is. ", "In terms of seeing a segment going forward, again we have big initiatives for the back half. I really don\u2019t want to talk to those and I think you will see them when you go into our stores in the back half, so I would suggest shop in our stores. ", "Marnie Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Not a problem. Talk to you guys soon. Good luck. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Champine. ", "Laura Champine - Analyst ", "Good morning. Just trying to reconcile your comment that Home Goods is likely to have its best margin in its history -- can you talk about what makes that business stand out from other homes related retailers, other than the obvious? Because that\u2019s a great result. And then also, I think that implies a real reversal in margin trends at Marmaxx in Q4 -- is that right? And if so, what should keep Marmaxx from having much better margins in Q4 on a year-on-year basis?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I\u2019ll take the Home Goods question and the margin question, Jeff already did talk a bit about Marmaxx and exactly what is creating that, so if you want to reiterate that, you can. ", "In terms of Home Goods, again I\u2019m just going to come back to it\u2019s about execution and I think these guys are executing and I think the model is a terrific model. It worked and it worked when you execute well and that\u2019s what they are doing. So I think again, I\u2019ll reiterate that I think they understand. I think we made some missteps a year ago and I think we are back on track and we are ready to accelerate. ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "I think the only color I would give you around the fourth quarter is -- I\u2019m not going to comment on Marmaxx specifically but again, if you look at our Q4 overall pretax margin, we\u2019re saying flat to up 70 basis points. We\u2019re clearly running stronger than that year-to-date and have stronger guidance in the third quarter and it really just comes down to a level of caution about the fourth quarter, just given how far we are out from holiday and the level of visibility we have. ", "So I would tell you, you know, as we said earlier, that the assumptions we are making in our Q4 guidance lean towards the conservative side but again, we think that\u2019s prudent in terms of how we position ourselves from a cost and an inventory perspective. ", "Laura Champine - Analyst ", "Thanks. Maybe I\u2019m missing the share count -- can you comment on year-end share count? ", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "We\u2019re just going to execute the buy-back program that we have and we\u2019ve got about $400 million to go we\u2019re going to spend throughout the back half. I think you can make an assumption on share price and get to the share count. ", "Laura Champine - Analyst ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Michelle Clark. ", "Michelle Clark - Analyst ", "Good morning and congratulations. You had mentioned additional store openings next year relative to what we are going to see this year -- could you just detail us on where the biggest growth is coming from and maybe domestically, geographic penetration, where we should expect to see those store openings? Thank you.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Michelle, you really are going to see it across the board and we are taking an opportunistic approach, and the reason why we ended up with 26 more stores in the original plan this year was because of the opportunities. So just like everything else, we have cash, we have tremendous flexibility. So we will take advantage of every terrific real estate opportunity for next year and that\u2019s the way we are looking at it, so it\u2019s really not by any particular region. It\u2019s really by return on invested capital. ", "Michelle Clark - Analyst ", "Okay, great. Good luck. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question today is from Randy Konick. ", "Randy Konick - Analyst", "Great. Thank you. Just regarding the merchandise margin, can you just give us a little bit of color of the IMU versus the markdown? And then on IMU, I guess you made a comment that you have a plentiful inventory to buy out there -- has the costing side of it changed at all over the last few quarters on a sequential basis?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think it\u2019s pretty much split, right? Half and half?", "Jeffrey G. Naylor", "Yeah, it\u2019s pretty balanced between merchandise margin -- the merchandise margin growth is pretty balanced between mark-up and markdown. And we are also getting some benefit from freight and fuel -- freight as a result of some -- you know, part of our cost reduction program, so we\u2019re seeing some of that flow through the -- but it\u2019s primarily going to be markdowns and [inaudible] pretty balanced between the two, Randy. ", "Randy Konick - Analyst", "Do you foresee any big changes in the IMU trend now that you are broadening out the inventory buys?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think we\u2019ve been seeing it year over year. And I think we\u2019ll again, you know, our sourcing, just in terms of the total coverage, this gives us an opportunity. So I think going forward, again I don\u2019t know what basis points it is but you know, we are going to continue with our strategy and our sourcing and we continue to add to the merchandising group because we think it\u2019s very advantageous. ", "Randy Konick - Analyst", "Lastly, you just think the IMU should continue to move higher as we move into lapping these comparisons in the next 12 months, is that fair?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I hope so. ", "Randy Konick - Analyst", "All right. Thank you. ", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I want to thank everyone and we certainly look forward to our next call. Thank you.

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, November 17, 2009.", "I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, President and CEO of The TJX Companies, Incorporated.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, Sherry has few comments today.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings, including without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 31, 2009.", "Further these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies. Any recording, retransmission, reproduction or other use of the same for profit or otherwise without prior consent of TJX is prohibited and a violation of United States copyright and other laws.", "Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript. Please note that the financial results and the expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis.", "Also we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website www.tjx.com. As a reminder, the comparable store sales numbers that we talk about today are on a constant currency basis.", "With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today's press release and posted on our website, www.tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Sherry. Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Jeff Naylor and Ernie Herrman.", "So let me start by saying it is great to see our significant momentum continue. Again in the third quarter, we delivered record results with earnings per share increasing by 40% on a reported basis.", "We continue to see comp sales and customer transactions not only increase, but accelerate. Although, we have also fared well during recessions, this is the first time we are seeing acceleration during a recession. This presents a huge opportunity for us to capture a significant increased consumer spending when the economy improves.", "With our extreme value proposition and a demographic reach that we believe is wider than just about any other apparel or home retailer out there; we believe we are in excellent position to retain the new customers we are attracting today.", "For us, value has always been and continues to be the place to be. We believe our values and merchandising mix are only getting better. This unusual environment is presenting major opportunities for our company and with our flexible business model and substantial financial resources, we are seizing the day. Across the board, all of our businesses including our growth vehicles are performing well, which bodes extremely well for our future.", "The important message I want to share with you on this call is our confidence in our ability to sustain our strong, consistent profitable growth. We focused on the reasons for our confidence at our investor event on October 20th, and I want to reiterate those key things with you today.", "Our goal is to be one of the best retailers in the world. I'll outline for you what gives us confidence in our ability to grow TJX to be $30 billion and a $40 billion retailer long-term.", "Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to recap our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Then I'll review the highlights of our third quarter, cover the key points and then discuss our financial strength. We'll also speak to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year, and for now I'll turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeff Naylor", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Let me recap third quarter results. Net sales were $5.2 billion; that's up 10% over last year. Our consolidated comps were up 7%, and that was significantly above our original plan.", "The diluted earnings per share was $0.81. As Carol mentioned, that's up 40% over the $0.58 we reported last year. Now I should point out that last year benefited by a penny from a non-operating item and by $0.05 from foreign currency, while this year benefited by $0.02 from foreign currency. So if you look at the underlying adjusted growth rate, it was much stronger than we reported given the currency headwinds that we faced in the third quarter. These items are all detailed in today's press release.", "Our consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 10.8%; that's up 200 basis points over last year on a reported basis.", "Now comparisons to prior year were adversely impacted by two items. First, last year benefited 10 basis points from a non-operating item that we detailed in today's press release. Second, the third quarter of both years, were impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, last year much more positively than this year. That reduced the year-over-year improvement in pre-tax margin by 40 basis points.", "So the underlying pre-tax margin growth on an adjusted basis is actually 50 basis points more than we are reporting when you adjust for currency and you adjust for the non-operating item.", "The gross profit margin was up 180 basis points and well above our plan, primarily due to strong merchandise margins, partially offset by the 40 basis point impact from foreign currency that I just discussed.", "SG&A expense improved by 50 basis points as a percent of sales, despite a 40 basis point increase in expenses related to performance-based compensation. As a reminder, as we discussed on our last conference call, we have a broad based incentive program that goes very deep into the organization and includes thousands of associates, including our store managers.", "In terms of other items impacting the P&L, a lower tax rate versus last year added about a penny to EPS, while higher net interest expense reduced EPS by about a penny.", "As to inventories, at the end of the third quarter consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the warehouses, were down 5%. If you exclude the impact of foreign currency, we were actually down 7% on a per-store basis.", "At Marmaxx, our total inventory commitment, including the warehouses, stores, and merchandise on order, was down versus last year on a per-store basis.", "We ended the third quarter with very clean inventories and are very, very comfortable with our inventory liquidity as we begin the fourth quarter.", "Let me briefly discuss our results for the first nine months now. EPS for the first nine months was $1.91; that's up 27% over last year's $1.50 that we reported. Last year's EPS benefited by $0.03 per share from non-operating items that are detailed in today's press release. If you exclude these items, EPS was up 30% over the adjusted $1.47 per share.", "Also as outlined in today's press release, foreign currency adversely impacted EPS for the first nine months of this year by $0.04, whereas last year it actually had a $0.04 positive impact in the first nine months. So the EPS increase year-to-date would have been significantly higher if it weren't for these impacts. Our comp sales increased by a strong 5% in the first nine months.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Carol and I will recap our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Jeff. The major things I want to highlight on this call are as follows: First, as I said, we are taking full advantage of the opportunities the current environment is presenting us. Second, we have an extremely flexible model that delivers consistent results in both strong and weak environments. Third, we are confident that our top-line and bottom-line growth is sustainable going forward. Lastly, our strategies for managing the business and our growth vehicles are clearly working.", "First, I'll share with you some Q3 highlights, which are pretty interesting. Beginning in the US, Marmaxx segment profit was up 52% over last year and has achieved a segment profit of 12.5%, the highest segment profit margin in its history.", "As you know, given Marmaxx's consistently strong out-performance ahead of our investor event, we raised our long-term outlook for Marmaxx's segment profit margin above its prior target. We now estimate that Marmaxx's segment profit margin will fall in the 10.5% to 11.5% range for the next three years.", "HomeGoods continues a remarkable year, with customer traffic up well into the double digits and record segment profits that more than doubled from last year. We are also expecting record-breaking increases for the full year. This organization is executing great fashion and brands at exceptional value. Our values are truly outstanding compared to other retailers and our customers are getting it.", "A.J. Wright delivered another profitable quarter and a 110 basis points improvement in its bottom-line profit margin. Store contribution is at the level we required to support a high-return business model, and we are now very comfortable continuing to roll out this chain.", "The new market of Atlanta is performing well above expectation and our new stores are beating our plan, which bodes well for opening stores in new markets for the future.", "Now to our international businesses, beginning with TJX Canada, with our Winners and HomeSense businesses; despite the adverse impact of foreign currency, which we have discussed all year, TJX Canada had an increase in reported segment profit in the third quarter.", "Further, excluding foreign currency, segment profit was up 16%. As Sherry mentioned upfront, this is all laid out in the tables on our website. The bottom line is that TJX Canada continues to execute very well, buying better and controlling expenses and mitigating the impact of currency on its results.", "At TJX Europe, we continue to be very pleased with our business. Like Canada, TJX Europe was also adversely impacted by foreign currency. Excluding that impact, segment profit was up 32% and segment profit margin improved a 120 basis points. Again, this is laid out on our website.", "As we leverage costs across a broad European base, we now expect T.K. Maxx in the U.K. to exceed the 8% profit margin we had previously modeled as its potential.", "Our German operation should be profitable in Q4 and next year; not bad for a business that is just two years old.", "We entered Poland, the ninth largest country in the EU, with our first four stores in the third quarter. We love the cost structure in Poland and believe this will be another substantial growth vehicle in Europe.", "Now let's review what makes us so convinced that TJX is not only positioned for today, but extremely well positioned for its future growth.", "First, we believe many of the opportunities this environment is presenting us are not only helping us today, but will continue to help us in the future. We are growing our customer and vendor basis and taking advantage of the real estate landscape as well as supply chain and cost reduction opportunities.", "With customer traffic counts reaching extraordinary highs, even a slight uptick in our average ticket will be very meaningful for our business. We are very focused on keeping our new customers, and we will be substantially investing in a variety of ways to not only keep them but to gain even more customers.", "One of our key strategies for retaining the new customers we are attracting today is our aggressive reinvestment in stores to create a better shopping experience. How many retailers today are in the position of being able to truly invest back into their business?", "We also love our new marketing campaign and more importantly, our customers love them. We are reaching more customers than ever before and educating consumers about our off-price concept. Our vendor base is not only growing by huge numbers, but we are becoming even more meaningful to the vendor community.", "I think it's important for anyone following the TJX story to understand that any one vendor represents only a small percentage of our merchandise mix, and as we add vendors, it becomes even less important.", "In the global real estate landscape, we are taking full advantage of opportunities and signing deals that we would have never imagined.", "Lastly on this thing, we are capitalizing on opportunities in the supply chain to make us even better and faster, and we believe our cost reduction opportunities continue to be very real.", "The second key thing is that we have a business model that was built to have tremendous flexibility and grow with the times, no matter what the environment. Our history has shown us that in good and bad economic times, TJX has always thrived.", "In our 33-year history as a company, we have only had one year with a negative comp. Our comps are remarkably consistent and much less volatile than those of traditional retailers.", "It's also important to note that our model was built to never be dependent on any one or even any few vendors. If one vendor doesn't have product for us at a particular time, many more do, and we have the flexibility to make adjustments. We are certainly not waiting around for things to happen in the marketplace. Managing the vendor universe and handling changes in the marketplace is what we know and is what we do every single day. We work with a universe of over 10,000 vendors and are constantly opening new stores.", "In this year alone, we have added over 2,000 vendors. We have over 500 buyers covering the marketplace all the time and building mutually beneficial vendor relationships. We operate many buying offices around the world and stores in 60 countries. In our stores, we have extreme flexibility and no walls. We can easily expand and contract departments depending on opportunities and evolve with customer tastes.", "Third, we have great confidence in our ability to sustain our strong top and bottom-line growth. This was a major theme of our Investor Day and I'd like to reiterate some of the key points here also. On the top line, we have enormous growth opportunities with our value proposition, demographic reach, and the growth potential we have in our existing concept as well as our new seed for the future.", "We believe that even when the recession ends, the importance of value to consumer will remain, which plays to our strengths. Our history through three prior recessions, show us that we tend to keep new customers [we gave] in the recession when the economy improves. We believe we will see this again when we emerge from this recession, perhaps even to a greater extent than in the past, given the importance of value to the consumer.", "The TJX Companies is truly about exceptional value, exceptional fashion and exceptional brands catering to all income levels and all demographics. Our brands give us the ability and flexibility to shift and to maximize a wide range of customer income level and demographic groups. We are global and diverse, which gives us enormous opportunities for the future.", "We continue to have significant store growth potential within our current portfolio. We believe we can add approximately 1,500 stores to our existing concept alone. This is before expanding into new countries where there's enormous, potential, before rolling out any standalone shoe concept, and before expanding any of our new [seeds].", "Beyond our existing concept, of course, we are always developing new [seeds] for the future, which is just part of our DNA. We continue to develop our current [seeds] like the Shoe Megashop by Marshalls, STYLESENSE in Canada, and HomeSense in the U.K.", "We are excited about Poland, a new country. While still very early, we are hoping to grow 100 stores in that country.", "We know that a big question out there is whether we can sustain our strong pre-tax margins and profit margin. I want to reiterate that we are very confident that we can. We believe that factors driving profitability will continue.", "We continue to have opportunities to run the business with even leaner inventory. This has worked well for us this year, as it puts our buyers in chase mode and drive faster inventory turns and higher merchandise margin. In each of the 10 years, Marmaxx's merchandise margins have been flat or up every year; and we are not done.", "We remain focused on cost reduction. We have seen the benefit over the past several years and believe significant opportunities remain.", "Our younger businesses both in Europe as well as HomeGoods and A.J. Wright in the U.S. are growing their store bases, which will drive the overall segment profit as these businesses expand their store bases and further leverage their cost structure. Further, as Marmaxx and TJX Canada continue to add stores to their fleet, we also gain more leverage on costs and drive profitability.", "Fourth, our strategies for running the business and our growth vehicles are certainly working. The conservative strategies that we laid out at the beginning of the year for managing the business are clearly delivering strong results. Planning conservatively and setting our inventory and expense plans around conservative comps is serving us well this year. We'll continue to follow this approach, because it's working and as always we will strive to beat those conservative plans.", "In the last several years, we have developed our growth vehicles and planted many seeds for growth and nearly all of them are performing well. Take A.J. Wright; this division has made significant progress, and its store contributions are now at the level that gives us confidence in growing the chain. We believe that A.J. Wright can ultimately grow to 500 plus stores.", "Internationally, over 20% of our sales and profits today are outside the U.S. and growing. Our TJX Europe infrastructure is providing great leverage. In Germany, we now operate 23 stores. The German retail market presents great opportunities for us. Without middle-tier or off-price retailers, with Germany's population of 83 million, we believe that we can grow to 300 stores in that country. I am confident that these growth vehicles and our many seeds will lead to tremendous growth in the future.", "Lastly, it is our goal to be one of the best retailers globally. Today, we think and act as a global company, giving great value to all our customers every day. We have strengthened our management team and are hiring talent globally. We are communicating better than ever before, leveraging and collaborating on all fronts with no walls.", "The seeds are planted for growth, both top and bottom line. Big picture, we have great confidence in our ability to ultimately grow this company to twice its size. Now let's spend a moment on our financial strength. Our strong operations generate substantial amounts of cash. This allows us to reinvest in our businesses and be conservative with CapEx to preserve our flexibility in this economy, while returning value to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.", "In terms of share repurchases, we bought back approximately $304 million of TJX stock during the third quarter. We retired 8.2 million shares. It continues to be our plan to buy back a total of approximately $625 million of TJX stock in 2009. This consists of the $250 million we originally planned and the additional approximately $375 million to buy back shares that converted in the first quarter. However, we may adjust this up and down depending on the economic conditions and other factors.", "So in closing, I hope that what I have outlined for you today makes you as convinced as we are in the future growth and success of TJX. We're taking full advantage of the opportunities in today's environment and believe that we'll emerge from this recession in an even stronger position.", "We believe that value wins in this and any environment that we are positioned. We are positioned as the premier off-price value retailer. Value is deeply rooted in our TJX culture and it is an internationally understood concept. We have one of the most flexible business models in the world, which enables us to drive consistent results and grow in both strong and weak environments. In the near future, we feel good about our momentum and opportunities for the fourth quarter.", "With plentiful buying opportunities in the marketplace, we will continuously flow exciting assortments to meet the gift-giving needs of our customers. Since the question of availability continues to persist, let me be clear on this point. Availability is never an issue. Whether the marketplace is running with leaner inventories or excess inventories, it's good for TJX.", "When department stores are running with leaner inventories, the environment is less promotional, which raises our pricing umbrella and widens the value gap between us and traditional retailers. Excess inventories in the marketplace means a lower cost of goods. Either way, we win. We certainly have plenty of open to buy going into the fourth quarter.", "There are strong reasons for our confidence in our ability to sustain our top and bottom-line growth, many of which I shared with you. We have shown you that our strategies for managing the business and growth vehicles are working; and we continue with our proven approach of our intelligent risk-taking.", "With our strong momentum exiting October, our very strong start to November, and confidence going into the fourth quarter, we are raising our guidance for both the fourth quarter and full year.", "I'm excited about the future and look forward to updating you on our results at the end of the year, as well as our plans for 2010.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jeff to go through guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.", "Jeff Naylor", "Before I get into the guidance I wanted to reiterate one point on third quarter performance. As Carol mentioned, it's very important to note that the results for both TJX Canada and TJX Europe were significantly impacted by currency during the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the profit performance of these businesses was significantly stronger than on the reported basis.", "So, on our website, we have laid out reconciliation between reported results and results excluding currency translation and mark-to-market impacts at those foreign businesses. I would really encourage investors to refer to this information so you get a good picture of the underlying growth in both Canada and Europe.", "Now to details on our guidance for the fourth quarter. As Carol mentioned, with the strong momentum we're seeing in our business we are raising our outlook for the full year and for the fourth quarter. We are now planning EPS for the full fiscal 2010 year to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.61 compared with $2.08 per share last year on a reported basis. This range is based on expected comp store sales of approximately 5% for the full year.", "As a reminder, last year's results included a $0.09 per share benefit from the 53rd week as well as certain other items that impact comparability, which we've detailed in a table in today's press release. If you exclude these items, our full year EPS outlook represents a 33% to 36% increase over last year's adjusted $1.92.", "I should also point out that this guidance includes an estimated $0.02 per share negative impact from foreign currency for the current fiscal year, compared with a 1 penny benefit in the prior year. So the underlying growth rate if you were to exclude foreign exchange is actually a little stronger than the numbers would suggest.", "Turning to the fourth quarter, our outlook assumes fourth quarter EPS of $0.65 to $0.71 compared with $0.58 last year. There are several items impacting comparability.", "Again, last year's results were positively impacted by a $0.09 per share benefit from the extra week in our fiscal calendar as well as a $0.03 per share adjustment to our computer intrusion reserve. Adjusting for these factors, our fourth quarter guidance represents a 41% to 64% increase over prior year's adjusted $0.46 per share of EPS.", "With that said, currency has a significant impact on year-over-year EPS growth. Our estimated range for this year's fourth quarter reflects an expected benefit from foreign currency of $0.02 per share. This compares to a negative impact of $0.04 per share last year. So with currency now turning to a tailwind, the underlying growth is actually a little less strong than the numbers would suggest since we now are benefiting from currency.", "One last factor impacting fourth quarter EPS growth was the incentive comp expense. This year with our very broad-based programs and above-plan performance, this expense is up significantly. This is exacerbated by last year, where we had very low incentive comp expense as business softened in the fourth quarter. This incremental expense adversely impacts fourth quarter EPS growth by about 11 percentage points, which was twice the impact it had on our third quarter EPS growth.", "Let me now get into some of the details around the guidance. We are assuming a fourth quarter top line of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion with comp sales planned up 5% to 7% on a consolidated basis and up 5% to 7% at the Marmaxx Group.", "As to monthly comps on both the consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group, we expect comp sales increases in the ranges of 7% to 9% in November. So, November is off, as Carol mentioned, to a strong start; 3% to 5% in December; and 3% to 5% in January.", "It is very important to remember that, unlike most other retailers, TJX did not have a comp store sales decline in December last year when comps were essentially flat despite the very difficult environment.", "In terms of pre-tax profit margins we've planned those in the 7.9% to 8.5% range. That's up 50 to 110 basis points over the 7.4% we reported last year.", "Now, the pre-tax margin last year benefited 60 basis points from the 53rd week and it benefited 40 basis points from an adjustment to the intrusion reserve, but was negatively impacted by 40 basis points by foreign currency.", "So combined, these items are expected to negatively impact growth in the fourth quarter pre-tax margin by 60 basis points in aggregate. So if we exclude these non-recurring items, the underlying pre-tax profit margin is up 110 to 170 basis points over last year on a comparable basis.", "We are anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margin to be 24% to 24.3% compared with 22.7% last year. Last year's gross profit margin was positively impacted by 60 basis points by the 53rd week and negatively impacted by 40 basis points due to foreign currency.", "So combined, these items positively impacted last year's gross profit by 20 basis points, which adversely impacts the comparisons to prior year. So despite this adverse impact, we still anticipate our fourth quarter gross profit margins to be up significantly over last year.", "We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 15.7% to 15.8% compared to 15.6% last year. This year's SG&A rate is adversely impacted by higher performance-related incentive compensation expense, as I mentioned earlier, which is estimated to have a 60 basis point impact on the year-over-year comparisons. So, excluding this item, we continue to see a significant amount of expense leverage.", "Finally, for modeling purposes we are anticipating a tax rate of 38.3% in the fourth quarter, which is higher than last year, and net interest expense in the $10 million to $11 million range. Combined, these two items reduced EPS growth by two pennies. Finally, we anticipated a weighted average share count of approximately $425 million.", "So with that, we are going to open it for questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person. To keep the call on schedule, we are going to continue to enforce a one question limit, and we appreciate your cooperation with that.", "Thanks, and I'll now turn it back to Candy and open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Thank you. One moment for you first question. Jeffery Black of Barclays Capital, your line is open.", "Jeffrey Black - Barclays Capital", "Carol, I guess you mentioned in your meeting that the opportunity to take inventory leaner. Can you guys share with us where the low-hanging fruit is on that, is it outside Marmaxx? How do we think about inventory per square foot, if that's the way you want us think about it, and/or inventory turn next year? In other words, how far can we improve turn and profit?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well again, we don't share that number, but you can see that this year we were down in total 5% on a store-by-store basis against a year ago down 6%, Jeff. I think we see this year another opportunity to hopefully be in that range, and it's definitely across the board. So we are buying much closer to need. We have invested a great deal in our supply chain, and we intend next year to make us even speedier. So I don't know where the end number is, but our goal is to every year try to chop it and to turn faster.", "Operator", "", "Next question, Adrianne Shapira of Goldman Sachs, your line is open.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "All year, we've been seeing, obviously, we've grown accustomed to your under-promise, over-deliver. I'm just wondering, Jeff, if you kind of look at the components of the guidance, where will you see perhaps the source of upside going further? Whether it's sales, margins, you talked about obviously that incentive compensation on expenses, but where would you see the levers continuing to be perhaps better?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, s you know, we are planning the margins slightly lower than Q3, but closer to the total year. Again, we had a flat December, so we kind of hope there is opportunity there, but I think we always plan conservatively. Again, we're happy with what we are seeing at the beginning of November, and we like to plan our sales conservatively and hopefully beat them and keep our inventories nice and lean. So, I think we are in a pretty good place in terms of planning. Adrianne, as always, we hope very much to beat those numbers.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Carol, if I could just follow-up the point about the margin planning lower. Any read across in terms of how aggressive the competitive landscape is heading into the holiday season or again just conservatism?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Not at all. I mean it was so promotional last year. We are not expecting it to be quite as promotional, but either way, it doesn't affect us, because we are tremendously open-to-buy going into Q4.", "Operator", "", "Next, Kimberly Greenberger of Citigroup, your line is open.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Carol, I am wondering if you could help us understand the relative impact of increased customer traffic and increased transactions in terms of comp contribution. Are you still seeing ticket down? Then I just had one clarification for Jeff. I'm not sure I caught what you said about the 11 percentage point increase in incentive comp, could you just clarify that?", "Jeff Naylor", "Well, I'll start with the clarification. What we were saying is that, we have a higher bonus expense this year in the fourth quarter, because last year, if you think about it, it was a tough fourth quarter for us like it was for everybody, so there was very little bonus expense that we accrued in the fourth quarter, whereas this year, we're significantly outperforming. So that higher level of bonus expense this year is costing us about 11 points of EPS growth. So in other words, if the bonus expense were the same this year as it were last year, we would be looking at 11% more EPS growth, if you will, Kimberley. So it's just the impact that it's having on the EPS growth rate.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Kimberly, our customer traffic every quarter is increasing tremendously. We have certainly not seen numbers like this in the past. Our average ticket is slightly down; it's low single-digits down, pretty much consistent quarter-over-quarter.", "We are increasing our advertising spend versus plan for Q4 because we think we have an opportunity again to keep driving new customers into our stores, and as I have said in the past, one of our goals is to certainly put some capital back into our stores to keep the customers for the future. So our goal is to keep our customer, and our ticket may get back to flat next year. We'll see, but our goal is to just give great, great value. So we're just pretty excited about the constant increase quarter-over-quarter.", "Jeff Naylor", "One other thing I'd add to that, Kimberly, is obviously, with a lower ticket you have to ship more units to do similar levels of business. So we are shipping more units., but we've actually been offsetting that cost with some of the productivity that we've been seeing both in our DCs and our stores. So you haven't heard us talk about that as a de-levering factor to either buying and occupancy or SG&A expense, because we largely offset it with productivity year-to-date.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Carol, the improvement has gone from a plus-two comp in Q1 to a plus-four in Q2 to a plus-seven here in Q3, which is very impressive acceleration. Is it primarily your traffic that's getting better and better or are you also seeing a little less pressure on your ticket as we've gone through the year?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, it's pure traffic. It's pure increase in customer traffic.", "Operator", "", "Next question Jeffery Stein of Soleil Securities, your line is open.", "Jeffery Stein- Soleil Securities", "Jeff, I am wondering if you could talk about merchandise margin versus B&O leverage that you saw during the third quarter. Then, Carol, I am wondering if you might talk a little bit about or amplify a little bit on your strategy for holding on to the customer. You referred to improving customer experience, and I'm kind of wondering exactly what that means.", "Jeff Naylor", "The merchandise margin, as we mentioned, in the third quarter was up 180 basis points. We had a 40 basis hit from mark-to-market, Jeff; so it was actually up 220 basis points if you look at the underlying trends. Most of that was merchandise margin. Buying and occupancy, we got a little bit of leverage from, but we don't really talk about this , we have some incentive comp expense flows through buying and occupancy.", "The other thing that happens with our accounting is that, in our inventories we capitalize some buying and occupancy costs into inventory, so that when we are bringing our inventory down you actually end up with some expense that you have to flush through your P&L.", "So if you adjust for the bonus impact that's flowing through, as well as these capitalized costs that come down as you reduce your inventory, but we actually had a significant amount of B&O leverage in the quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "In terms of the in-store, we've done a lot of customer research and a lot of customer surveys on what is it that they want to see in our stores. I'm not going to tell you too much of the specifics, but we have reacted to that, and believe it or not, every store is almost treated differently. We will have a store where we will get some feedback and we will work on a specific project, and in other stores we will do something that maybe a little bit different.", "This all comes from really listening to our customer and reacting to that. So we're pretty excited. Some of it is just in store labor, some of it's recovery, some of it's physical work, but I think we're seeing very good results from this. We will continue to do it and probably be fairly aggressive next year, as we will end the year with quite a bit of cash.", "Operator", "", "Paul Lejuez of Credit Suisse, your line is open.", "Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "Carol, can you talk about for which of your concepts you feel you have the greatest visibility going into 4Q from a traffic, ticket, and just overall product availability perspective, maybe in which do you have the least visibility? Then I'm wondering how that answer might change if I asked you the same question about next year?.", "Then Jeff, just a point of clarification, the $0.02 help from FX in 4Q, is that strictly translation or does that include the FX hedging?", "Jeff Naylor", "Why don't I take that question first just as a clarification. It is all from translation, Paul. So that $0.02 is all translation benefit this year as we have higher FX rates in both Canada and the UK than we did last year at this time. So there is no mark-to-market in there; it is all translation.", "Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "You don't expect anything on the gross margin line from mark-to-market?", "Jeff Naylor", "We never really expect it. It all depends upon what the currency rates are on the very last day of the quarter, because that's when we look at marking those hedges to market. So if there is significant volatility between the time we hedge our inventory positions and wherever the rates are on the last day of the quarter, there could be, but candidly, it's not something you can really plan, because it solely depends on what the rates are on the last day.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Paul, in terms of visibility, we really have the same visibility across the board in all of our chains. You know, we leverage our communications throughout. So if there is an initiative that is going on in one division, it will be going on in another division if it's appropriate. They also leverage each other. So if there is a European vendor, let's say there is a high-end vendor, then that is shared with the corporation and we go in as a team to leverage that also.", "So I can't quite answer you, because there really is no difference in the visibility. We know all the initiatives. We know what we're going after. The open-to-buy is the open-to-buy by division; and it's pretty much consistent across the board. Everybody is pretty lean.", "Operator", "", "Next Laura Champine of Cowen and Company, your line is open.", "Laura Champine- Cowen and Company", "Carol, just as we continue to address some concerns on product availability, can you talk about, coming out of past recessions, do you lose vendors that you signed on? We know you had 100s of new ones this year. How good is your track record of keeping those vendors moving into a recovery?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Honestly, Ernie can help you too, but I don't remember ever losing a vendor. I mean having ran Marmaxx for five years, I can't remember ever losing a vendor.", "Ernie Herrman", "Laura, I'll jump in here. I would echo what Carol just said. The dynamics going on here, I think, is we've opened dramatically more new vendors of recent. So I think, again, you can never predict exactly where the markets are going to flood or lean up a little, but overall, the availability across all the departments should just continue to be there.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company", "So just as a follow-up, when demand recovers does that mean that as suppliers invest in more capacity your availability actually improves?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We had to shut the guys down last year. We had to shut the guys down this year. We did it last week. It is just always available goods and there is always available quality goods. One thing I have to make clear in this environment is that, if people do business with TJX, where we pay on time, where we're very, very solid company, I think there is a change in the mentality. I think vendors will want to do more business with us in the future versus keeping anything consistent. I think there is more of an opportunity for them to do more business with us.", "Ernie Herrman", "Laura, I'll jump in, back, prior to this whole change in the economy a little over a year ago, we have always had to manage the buyers and not buy too much. So the availability, again, just echoing what Carol said, just seems to be there regardless of the economic environment.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Our brilliance is in managing these 500 maniacs that are out there.", "Operator", "", "Next question Todd Slater of Lazard Capital Markets, your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "It's actually [Jennifer] for Todd. Let me add my congratulations. Going back to guidance, your comp guidance assumes about a 5% deceleration on a two-year basis between the third quarter and the second quarter. Are you seeing that much of a deceleration or should we attribute that to your conservatism?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Jeff will speak to this, but right now I think we are planning conservatively and that is what we're comfortable with.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, November is off to a strong start. Carol clearly said that on her prepared remarks. I think if you look on a three-year basis, you will see a little less deceleration than you do on a two. So we look at it both ways, but I think November is off to a strong start.", "We are up against a flat comp in December. There is always uncertainty around the December numbers, so we are being a little cautious, but we think it's prudent to be cautious. We set our cost structures and our inventories around these comps, so I think it just makes sense given there is a lot of business in front of us to be prudent at this point in time.", "Unidentified Analyst", "One quick clarification. Where do you think Marmaxx margins will end up this year, around the high end? Your long-term range is now 10.5% to 11.5%.", "Jeff Naylor", "The guidance implies 11.1% to 11.2%.", "Jennifer Cook - Lazard Capital Markets", "So in second quarter and third quarter you had record EBIT margins, but you would expect that fourth quarter you might see a little bit of a deceleration?", "Jeff Naylor", "In Marmaxx in the fourth quarter we're planning the bottom line segment margin up 150 to 180 basis points on a 52-week basis. You have to, when looking at last year, adjust 60 basis points out of it, Jennifer, because we had the benefit of the 53rd week. So if you adjust for that, we've got them up 150 to 180 on a five to seven comp, and in the third quarter they were up 340 basis points on a nine comp. So there may be a little bit of opportunity there", "I think again, as Carol mentioned, when you look at the guidance, you look at the total fourth quarter for the company against third quarter and you look at the trend, we're clearly calling bottom line profit growth below the trend, and most of that is in merchandise margins. Again, we've got the whole fourth quarter to go here.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "A tremendous amount of open-to-buy, so we'll think.", "Operator", "", "Next question Richard Jaffe of Stifel Nicolaus, your line is open.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks very much, guys, and my congratulations as well. Just a follow-on question regarding marketing, both in terms of dollars and in terms of initiatives, the way you'll be spending the money, TV, print, social networking, outgoing e-mails, that sort of thing?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "TV is going to be pretty heavy, Richard. Heavier than a year ago, and we are going to be hitting a lot more markets than a year ago. Then social networking is a big chunk of it also. We have not decreased our direct mail, but I think we're more pointed with it. So we're feeling very good about our TV. We are very excited about our (inaudible); you are going to see something what I think is even more clever than our intervention. So we're pretty excited about it.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "The dollars year-over-year?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Dollars are slightly up over plan and slightly down versus a year ago. A year ago we were quite a bit up from the prior year. Again, we are leveraging that a lot more.

Anything you can add on initial markup or trends within product categories as opposed to a mix effect, anything on markdowns there?", "Then, just coming back once again to the outlook, particularly for December, my records show you've got a couple years, actually, in December of basically flat comps at least in the Marmaxx division. I am just wondering if that month in particular could have some upside relative to the guidance that you've laid out?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Daniel, we really don't talk about margins by product category, so I'm really not comfortable going there. As we said, we are comfortable with our plans in terms of our comps, and we are believing that we're somewhat conservative. We understand that. We'll see what happens. I think Ernie is feeling pretty good in terms of Marmaxx and going into the fourth quarter. So I think we're doing what we do.", "Jeff Naylor", "The one thing we can say about merchandise margins increase is, it's pretty balanced between mark-on and mark-down. We're obviously buying closer to need, and take advantage of great deals and that helps in the mark-on, and then lower inventory levels, that helps you control your mark-down. So we are seeing pretty balanced between the two as we look at the year-over-year increase year-to-date and in the third quarter.", "Operator", "", "Next Stacy Pak of SP Research, your line is open.", "Stacy Pak - SP Research", "Congratulations and a very good quarter, guys. A question for you, though, Carol you talked a lot about keeping this customer that you gained in the recession. I've heard everything you said about how you're going to keep the customer, but is there something you are seeing now that's telling you the customer will stay going forward beyond what you said?", "I'm wondering, Jeff, if you sort of quantified, I mean, there was so much going for you guys in '09 in terms of Mervyn's and Linens and bankruptcies and this incredible drop that we all saw last year, leading to incredible excess inventory in the market. Is the 12.5% operating margin that Marmaxx posted this year, the difference between that and the 10.5% to 11.5% that you're talking about as the longer-term target, is that kind of the impact that you think all those things like Mervyn's had on the business, more the one-time things?", "Jeff Naylor", "No, Stacy, it's more of a third quarter there. The third quarter typically is our strongest quarter...", "Stacy Pak - SP Research", "You had a 100 to 200 basis point impact from those other things or how do you sort of quantify that? Then I have a follow-up on A.J.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, I think the quantification there is, most of those happen in the first half of the year, so if they had a short-term benefit you would have expected a pop and then a deceleration. We're actually seeing an acceleration in our comp, whether you look at it on a one-year or on a stacked basis.", "We are also seeing an acceleration in transactions, so we appear to be continuing to pick up business even after the initial impact of those businesses going away. So I guess that's the way I'd respond to that question. I don't know if Carol could add to that.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "There are just a couple of things. First of all, Linens 'n Things is not affecting HomeGoods at all, so where there is a Linens 'n Things, our stores that are not near Linens 'n Things are doing just as well, in some cases better. That's pretty much the case with Marmaxx too. You are asking about the customer increasing, it's increasing every single quarter. So that means that we're maintaining the new customer and we're still adding new customers. So it's a continuous acceleration, which tells you that it's likely going to continue and you're going to certainly keep that customer. So we feel pretty confident about that.", "The other thing in terms of Marmaxx last year is, third quarter we did take some markdowns. We got hit pretty quickly like everybody else did in November. So we where loaded a year ago. We moved very quickly to get out of it, and then we ended up in January with much leaner inventory. So part of that number from a year ago was certainly a weaker quarter in terms of margins. So that will also show the acceleration on the Q3 versus Q3 a year ago.", "Stacy Pak - SP Research", "So on an annualized basis then you don't really think the recession and the bankruptcies and the excess inventories we saw really had any meaningful, positive impact on your business in '09?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, I really don't.", "Stacy Pak - SP Research", "Then the follow-up, Jeff, I just don't totally understand A.J, because if I'm looking at this correctly, their operating expense was up about 110 basis points on a plus-11 comp; whereas they Q3 it was up about 120 basis points on a plus-five comp. I thought you were looking for about that kind of increase on a much lower comp, like a four. So I'm just wondering if you could address that?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, we had some one-time issues and a couple of things that hit us in A.J.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, I think the flow through was less than you would expect. So you correctly identified, Stacy, the segment profit margin was up 110 basis points. That was less than we would have expected, candidly. We had higher incentive comp. We also remodeled nine stores, and so we had some write-offs associated with those remodels. Then we also had merchandise margins up at A.J; they were not as up as much as other divisions due to some markdowns we took transitioning from summer to fall that we talked about on one of the sales calls.", "So those were the main factors. I'd say, look, year-to-date, we've got $7 million of profit against a $2 million loss last year; we've got almost 200 basis points of bottom line profit improvement. Our store contribution margin is right where we need it to roll new stores. We are seeing terrific performance out of the new stores we've opened this year. So we're seeing feeling very confident about the business and I think you are just looking at a little bit of a hiccup on the flow through in Q3.", "Operator", "", "Next David Glick of Buckingham Research Group, your line is open.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "Congratulations on the quarter. Two quick questions for Jeff, just what is the count for the store openings in Q4? Then, any color on the rollout over 2010? Obviously, in your investor day you updated us on the new square footage growth outlook, but if you can give us a sense for the pace of new stores?.", "Carol, you've talked about the flexibility of the model and the ability to go after new categories. I'm wondering if you can give us some examples of some new categories that are working, in what areas, whether it's apparel, accessories, or home you are having the most success, and how meaningful these new categories are to your overall business?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, I'll answer that one with a non-answer. For competitive reasons; I don't want to go there, but I will tell you, it's both apparel and non-apparel where our initiatives are. So there are some interesting things. Again, I suggest hopping into our stores over the holiday season, and I think you'll see some newness and pretty exciting things.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "Then, Jeff, on the new stores?", "Jeff Naylor", "In terms of the new stores, most of the stores we're opening this year are open. We've got a handful that are opening in the fourth quarter, but of the 93 net new stores, net, net of closings, that we anticipate this year. Just backing up, we anticipate opening 105 stores this year; closing 12; so we've got 93 net. The lion's share, I think all but a handful, are in the third quarter. We generally, David, try to do our openings, get it done before the end of the third quarter and given the fourth quarter it is just tougher to open stores in that time frame.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "Then the pace for next year?", "Jeff Naylor", "We are not public on that yet. I think we said we would anticipate increasing the square footage growth from 3% to 4% historically to 4% to 5%.

Could it reach the double-digit operating margin of Marmaxx or could Europe get even halfway towards where Canada is, does it become a 12% or 13% operating margin business? Do you have economies of scale that allow you to get there?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Dana, I will answer, then, and then Jeff can. My answer would be I hope so and we're going to work our way towards it.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, I think I'll give you two answers, one for HomeGoods and one for Europe. HomeGoods is having just a phenomenal year. So we looked at it, prior to this year the pretax margin for that business was 5.1%. With a weak comp last year, particularly in the back half, it went down to 2.7%. This year the guidance implies 6.5% to 6.8%. So they have had just a phenomenal year in terms of recovering their profitability. Their returns on invested capital are now approaching mid-teens, so we are very, very happy with that business.", "I don't know yet whether it can be go beyond 8%. I think we're increasingly confident that it can get to 8%, because we are getting close. The question is can we get beyond? They are driving improvements in merchandise margins with lower levels of inventory this year and getting more cost leverage, frankly, than we thought that they were going to be able to achieve. They plugged a lot of cost leverage into the model and are beating it. So maybe, I guess; that's a good solid maybe there.", "On Europe, we used to think T.K-UK was an 8% business. Our current guidance calls for 8.4% to 8.6%, so we're clearly approaching higher levels of profitability there. As we expand across Europe, we should get leverage. A, we can take those UK fixed costs and spread them across the broader store base. Secondly, as we open in Europe we are seeing in those markets that rents are lower than the UK and there is less CapEx that we are putting into stores that are all at least as productive as the UK. So all those signs tell us that there is a pretty high-margin, high-ROIC opportunity in Europe, but again, that remains to be seen. We have got to prove it. Initial signs are all very encouraging.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "The other thing, Dana, about Europe is, we have an opportunity to take the backend of the business. UK is probably the most expensive country to operate in. As we learn more about this, we may have some more opportunities for cost reduction, much greater than we maybe think today.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "When do you announce the new concept, Carol?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Not for a little bit.", "Operator", "", "Next Marni Shapiro of Retail Tracker, your line is open.", "Marni Shapiro - Retail Tracker", "Congratulations and good luck with the fourth quarter, in case I forget.

So what you're seeing is, you are seeing some impact from the bonus flowing through that line as well as through each of our divisions.", "In terms of the third quarter, what we have said is that, underlying SG&A is up 50 basis points. Within that there is a 40 basis point hit from higher incentive compensation expense. Again, we have incentive comp programs that go very deep and broad in our company. So that the underlying SG&A leverage then would be 90 basis points if you excluded the underlying bonus expense.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I want to thank everyone, and we look very much forward to reporting on the holiday season.

Please go ahead, madam.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you, Eran. And good morning everyone. Before I begin, Sherry has few words.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially.

Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis.", "Also we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website www.tjx.com. As a reminder, the comparable store sales numbers that we talk about today are on a constant currency basis.", "With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today's press release and posted on our website www.tjx.com in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Sherry. And joining me on the call today with Sherry are Jeff Naylor and Ernie Herrman.", "2009 was the great year, but it was a great year on top of many great years. I believe that we have many more ahead of us, which is why I am going to spend a lot of time on this call talking about \u2013 or not talking about \u201909\u2019s results. I will focus instead on why we believe so strongly that our consistent profitable growth to sustain as well. I will discuss why we are convinced that our new customers will continue to shop less even when times improve, and we will continue to gain market share. Then I will drove into why we believe our strong margin is sustainable. Lastly I\u2019ll discuss in many ways in which we are growing this company profitably for the future. Before I continue I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff to recap full year and fourth quarter results.", "Jeff Naylor", "Okay, thanks Carol. Good morning everybody. I will begin by recapping the full year fiscal 2010 results. To begin, net sales reached $20.3 billion, that\u2019s a 7% increase over the last on a reported basis and adds up 8% on a 52-week comparable basis, which excludes the one point benefit we got from the extra week in last year\u2019s fiscal calendar.", "Consolidated comp store sales were up 6% on top of last year's 1% increase, which was a much tougher comparison than those of our retail peer group. As we\u2019ve noted many times before, comps were driven and continue to be driven by increased customer transactions as the value of the average basket was down in the mid-single digit range.", "For the year diluted earnings per share were $2.84, up 37% over last year's $2.08 per share. The prior year benefited from an extra week in our fiscal calendar as well as certain other items, which impact comparability and will be detailed in today's press release. If we exclude these items on a 52-week comparable basis, EPS increased 48% over last year\u2019s adjusted $1.92 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates were not a significant factor, negatively impacted EPS by a penny this year compared with a one penny benefit last year.", "So clearly we have a business model that delivers consistent EPS growth. We\u2019ve delivered 14 consecutive years of EPS growth on a continuing operations basis, and we\u2019ve achieved compound annual EPS growth of 18% over the last five years, 13% over the last 10 years and 23% over the last 15 years. Clearly, our financial performance of growth has been consistent. We have a model that is much more stable and less volatile than the vast majority of retailers with very high returns on invested capital.", "Continuing with last year's results, the consolidated pretax profit margin was 9.6%, that's up 200 basis points from prior year on a reported basis. Comparisons to prior year were adversely impacted by approximately 40 basis points due to last year's 53rd week as well as certain items impacting comparability that again are detailed in our release this morning. Foreign currency exchange rates did not meaningfully impacted pretax margin comparison. And the gross profit margin was 210 basis points above last year, primarily due to very strong merchandize margins combined with some buying and occupancy expense leverage.", "SG&A expense improved 10 basis points as a percentage of sales despite a 50 basis point increase in expenses related to performance based incentive compensation as we exceeded our plan so significantly. As we\u2019ve discussed on prior calls, we have a broad based incentive comp that goes very deep into the organization and includes thousands of associates including our store managers. Excluding this item SG&A expenses improved 60 basis points compared to prior year.", "As to the inventories, at the end of the fourth quarter consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the warehouse were down 10%, and excluding the impact of foreign currency they were down 12% per store. We began the year with very clean inventories, extremely well positioned to take advantage of the enormous buying opportunities in the marketplace.", "At Marmaxx, our total inventory commitment, including the warehouses, stores and merchandise on order was essentially flat versus last year on a per-store basis. We would expect Marmaxx inventory commitments to be flat to slightly up over the first half of fiscal 2011given the strong pace of our business this year compared to last.", "Let me now turn to the fourth quarter results. Net sales for the 13-week fourth quarter were $5.9 billion, a 10% increase over last year on a reported basis, and up 18% on a 13-week comparable basis, which excludes the 8 point of the extra week in last year\u2019s fiscal calendar.", "Our consolidated comp store sales were up very strong 12% for the quarter. Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter were $0.94, that\u2019s up 62% over last year\u2019s reported $0.58 per share. Again, prior year\u2019s results included items impacting comparability which are detailed in today\u2019s press release. Excluding these items diluted EPS increased 104% over the adjusted $0.46 per share last year.", "Our consolidated pretax margin was 10.7%, up 330 basis points over prior year for the quarter. Comparisons to prior year were adversely impacted by the prior-year reduction to the computer intrusions reserve which benefited last years\u2019 pretax margins of 540 [ph] basis points. So they\u2019re actually up a little bit more than we have this year with that impact.", "Our gross profit margin improved 410 basis points over last year due to extremely strong merchandised margins combined with buying and occupancy expense leverage. The benefit of the 53-week to last year\u2019s gross profit margins were essentially offset by the negative impact of mark-to-market adjustments on inventory hedges during the same period last year.", "SG&A expense for the quarter was up 30 basis points as a percentage of sales with the positive impact of cost reduction initiatives and expense leverage more than offset by higher performance based incentive compensation in contribution to the TJX Foundation which combined had an adverse 110 basis point impact. So excluding that impact, SG&A actually leveraged by 80 basis points.", "Now let me turn the call back to Carol and I will recap our first quarter full-year guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Jack. So let me get straight to the major scene I want to highlight on this call, which are first, why we believe our strong comps and customer traffics are sustainable; second, why we are confident that our margins are sustainable; and third, how we plan to increase square footage growth while simultaneously delivering strong financial returns. We are very confident that our outstanding 2009 performance was not a one-year phenomena and we believe that we can ultimately grow this company to be double the size that it\u2019s today.", "I will begin with what gives us confidence and the sustainability of strong comps and traffic. First, we entered 2010 with significant momentum which bodes very well for our future. If we look at our two- and three-year aggregate comps, the trend in our business continues to accelerate in the fourth quarter.", "Second, we believe that there has been a paradigm shift among customers to value. We expect that the economic recovery will be needed and our history shows that after recession new customers stick with us and comps increase. Regardless of whether the economy is weak or strong, value isn't going out of style. Also, if some of our newly acquired customers go back to shopping at their favorite high-end department store more often than in the past, it does not mean they\u2019ll stop shopping us. Our value proposition meets the needs of the consumer in an unconventional way. Our \u201cno walls\u201d business model enables us to shift rapidly as customers pace change.", "We can entirely eliminate one category and open a new category within weeks or months. We are sourcing products around the globe; we have opened over 2,000 new vendors in 2009 bringing the number in our vendor universe to over 12,000. We are actually more of a sourcing machine than practically any other retailer, and I am not sure that this is understood as well as it should be. I believe the quality of our merchandize mix is more exciting than ever and getting even better. My expectations for 2010 is to vow our customers even more.", "The third reason we believe our strong comp and profit are sustainable with our broad customer demographic reach, which we believe is wider than just about any other retailer. With our various concepts and international scope, we have heeled to high, middle and low-end demographics. Our numbers tell us that new customers are driving our transaction, and that we are pulling new customers from a widening range of income level.", "There is a whole new group of customers out there who have discovered us and could not be happier with the value that we are bringing to them. Even more exciting is that our research shows us that new customers intend to continue shopping with us. Our research further shows that 75% of US shoppers have not shopped our stores in the past year. That means there are tens of millions of untapped shoppers in just the US alone we can attract to our stores with great value.", "Fourth, we are making significant investments in marketing to drive traffic and then our shopping experience keep our customers coming back. We expanded our advertising reach in 2009 and we\u2019ll go even further this year. We will be continuing with our educational messaging, increasing our advertising spend and our penetration will be even greater than last year.", "While our marketing message is driving new customers to our stores, we understand that a great shopping experience is what keeps them coming back. In '09, we began an extensive store remodel program, and by fall 2010 Marmaxx will have 700 stores in the new prototype. As this represents 40% of Marmaxx stores and we are seamless [ph] in remodel stores, we believe this creates an opportunity for us in the back half. We expect to continue our aggressive remodel program over the next three year. When we considered the combination of our momentum, the paradigm shift of consumers to value, our unusually wide demographic reach, the strength of our marketing and our upgrading the shopping experience, what all of this means for the future of our business, we believe that our strong momentum will continue.", "Now I'll move from top line drivers and margin sustainability, which we know is a big topic of discussion out there. Let me start by saying that we expect pretax margins to increase slightly in 2010 on top of a very strong year we just delivered. Jeff will get into the details in a moment but let me share with you why we are confident that we will achieve our margin goals.", "First, our gross margin increases in 2009 were largely driven by lower inventory levels, and we plan to run even higher this year. Our inventories are turning faster than ever before and our plan is to turn that even faster in 2010. Leaner inventories and faster turns both are biased by even closest can be driving mark-on and reducing mark downs. Merchandised margins increased significantly in 2009 and we are planning the outcome of slightly in 2010 \u2013 in 2010 on top of 2009 strong performance. Further, we continue to improve our supply chain to work faster and better, getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right time. The bottom-line here is that improved merchandised margins are sustainable as long as we manage our inventories well and lean.", "Second, we obtained the benefit of our cost containment initiatives in the last few years and believe that significant opportunities still remain. For 2010, we are planning expense reductions of $50 million to $75 million and I believe we have a good chance of exceeding that range. Our big rocks continue to be non-merchandised procurement in store and DC labor efficiencies and supply chain.", "Third, we continue to have significant leverage opportunities. Our younger businesses are still moving towards a targeted profit margin potential and we gain leverage as they grow their store basis. We also gained leverage at our establish businesses Marmaxx and TJX Canada continue to grow their store fleet. Our European expansion enables us to spread cost across a wider store base and leverage our Pan European structure. Further, our newer European businesses are showing very attractive financial return potential. Our stores in Germany continue to outperform and we expect our German business to be profitable this year. We are also pleased with Poland\u2019s initial sales.", "Now let\u2019s turn to how we plan to grow square footage and simultaneously drive strong financial returns. We netted 91 stores in 2009 and the vast majority are exceeding plans. With the success of our growth vehicles, we now believe we can grow square footage at a rate faster moving from 3% in 2009 to 5% in 2010 or a net 130 stores. Further, in 2011 our plans call for accelerating square footage growth to approximately 6%.", "Let me share with you the reason for our confident and accelerating the pace of our growth. TJX has plenty of room to grow. With over 2700 stores today, we believe we have the potential to ultimately grow to over 4200 stores with just our current portfolio in our current markets alone. That\u2019s before our further expansion in Europe or a rollout of our standalone shoe concept or any other new concept.", "We have a successful track record of delivering growth with financial return. Returns on invested capital \u2013 our invested capital has increased as we have grown our business and now stand at 20% after tax.", "Now let\u2019s talk about how we're looking at growth. We continue to believe that we are far from finish in adding stores to Marmaxx. We see the potential to add several hundred more stores at this division and grow it to the over 2,000 stores long-term. Because we see this potential, and because of the huge leverage we get from Marmaxx, our priority is to aggressively add stores to Marmaxx while supporting growth for HomeGoods and A.J. Wright.", "HomeGoods had an outstanding year in 2009 delivering segment\u2019s profit margins that support our growth plan. A.J. Wright also had a great year achieving store contribution level that give us the confidence to rollout this chain further. We will take a steady approach with these businesses in 2010 and may accelerate store growth in 2011.", "Further we are pleased with our standalone Marshalls Shoe Megashop concept, just one of our growth thing [ph]. TJX Europe is exceeding expectations and the landscape is wide open for A.J. Wright. In addition to Germany performing well customers response to HomeSense in the UK is phenomenal and Poland is off to a solid start.", "With the early success of these businesses, we will be growing at a faster pace in Europe this year and likely we\u2019ll do more next year. We also want to tell you about our plan to launch a new off chain concept in spring of 2011. We are not ready to let you know the name or the details yet, but it has the potential to be a 90 to a 100 store chain. Stay tuned as we will be sharing more with you as soon as we get on to this exciting venture.", "The final point I want to share with you on growth is that we are investing in our infrastructure and hiring the best talent globally to support our plans for square footage growth acceleration. Now I\u2019ll spend a moment on our financial strength.", "For 2010, we are taking a balanced approach to managing our cash. First, we\u2019re aggressively investing in our growth and we are increasing our CapEx to $750 million range. Jeff will provide details on this in a moment. Even with this increase, we plan to buyback close to $1 billion of TJX stock, and expect that our Board of Directors will increase our dividend by 25%. With all of this we still forecast ending 2010 with cash well over $1 billion. In terms of our financial plans for fiscal 2011, we will continue to plan conservatively and strive to surpass our goals as we have done successfully over time. Jeff will go through guidance in detail in a moment.", "So in closing, I hope that I have \u2013 in closing I hope that what I shared with you today make you as confident as we are in the continued profitable growth of TJX. We are very confident that our top line and bottom line performance is sustainable. We started 2010 with great momentum, which we believe bodes relative extremely well for our businesses. We are not your average retailer, we operate an extraordinary business model on a very large scale that delivers consistent performance in strong and weak economic environment and enables us to create merchandise categories quickly and ease the stake current with the customer demand. We believe we\u2019re extremely well positioned to capitalize on the value oriented mindset of consumers, which believe is here to stay.", "We have very broad customer appeal, and it is only widening in its environment. All of our growth vehicles are performing well, and we have plentiful opportunities in front of us on our confidence and our ability to deliver growth with financial return. I am excited about our growth prospectus for 2010 and believe we have many more great years to come.", "Our no loss business model allows us to drive cost, we are increasing the rate of square footage growth and we plan to run with even leaner, faster turning inventories which allows us to increase margin. While aggressively reinvesting in our business, we are also distributing significant returns to our shareholders. We are careful and methodical in our approach to our business and have the confidence that TJX will be a $30 billion and then $40 billon company.", "Now, I would like to turn the call back to Jeff to go through our guidance and then we will open it up for questions.", "Jeff Naylor", "Thanks, Carol. Let me first provide you with our view of the three-year model. We continue to model on annual EPS growth rate for the next three years in a 12% range, which as Carol mentioned, we have exceeded over time. This model is based on a comp store sales increase in the 2% range, square footage growth in the 5% to 6% range, margin expansion contributing approximately 1 percentage point of EPS growth and 3 to 4 points of EPS growth coming from the stock buyback. This difference from prior models, as Carol noted earlier, as we are planning acceleration in the square footage growth.", "Let me downturn the guidance for fiscal 2011 and cover both the full year and the first quarter. My full year comments are going to be at high level, and we are providing guidance for TJX on a consolidated basis only at this time. On the other hand, the first quarter guidance will be more detailed and we will have a full model with division detail available for you.", "For fiscal 2011, we expect diluted EPS from continuing operations for the full year to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.20 which represents an 8% to 13% increase over $2.84 which we earned in fiscal 2010. Some of the detail. This guidance assumes consolidated top-line sales of about 21.5 billion to 21.7 billion and a consolidated comp store sales increase in the 1% to 2% on both a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group.", "For the year, we expect pre-tax profit margins to be 9.5% to 9.8%. This represents a 10 basis points decrease to a 20 basis point increase over fiscal 2010, our strong margin performance. We are confident we can deliver this level of profitability at a very low single-digit comp increase giving continued inventory management and cost reductions opportunities.", "Some of the elements, we expect gross profit margin to be flat to slightly up, and SG&A to be flat to slightly down as a percentage of sales versus fiscal 2010, again, on a 1% to 2% comp. Foreign exchange rates, assuming current levels, provide about a penny of the planed EPS growth over fiscal 2010.", "For modeling purposes, we are planning net interest expense in the $40 million range and tax rate of 38.4%, which is up 60 basis points over prior year and a weighted average share count of 409 million. Capital is planned in the $750 million range, and we are planning to buy back in the range of 900 million to 1 billion. While we are not providing guidance here on our first quarter, we would expect comps to be stronger in the first half and then flat to slightly down in the back half as we anniversary last year\u2019s strong numbers.", "Now, let me turn to first quarter guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.65 which is a 22% to 33% increase over last year\u2019s very strong $0.49 per share. We are assuming a first quarter top line in the $4.8 billion range with comps in the 3% to 5% range on both a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group.", "As the monthly costs for the first quarter, for February we are planning comp sales increases of 8% to 9% on a consolidated basis, and 9% to 10% at the Marmaxx Group, and I should note that these increases are coming despite the unfavorable wintry weather that we saw during the month. On both the consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group, we are planning on comp increases of 2% to 4% in March, and flat 2% in April, which are reflective of the shift in Easter earlier in the calendar this year.", "Pretax profit margins are planned in the 8.5% to 9% range in Q1, up 70 to 120 basis points over prior year. In terms of some of the elements, we\u2019re anticipating first quarter gross margin in the range of 25.8% to 26.2%, which is 100 to 140 basis points above last year\u2019s strong performance.", "We\u2019re expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 17% to 17.1%, now that\u2019s up 10 to 20 basis points over prior year. This increase is largely driven by higher store payrolls, because we are up against some very deep cuts last year, probably too deep, and also are impacted by the impact of our European new businesses and certain other factors, which combined slightly offset our planned cost reductions.", "Again as I mentioned earlier we are planning SG&A flat to slightly down for the full year on the 1% to 2% comp, and comp our ability to leverage. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense to be in the $10 million to $11 million range. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 414 million for the quarter.", "I will wrap it up with our store growth plans for next year, for fiscal 2011. As Carol mentioned on a consolidated basis we planned to net 130 stores for a total of 2873 stores by yearend and increase square footage by approximately 5%, so let me talk to these statistics.", "In the US starting with Marmaxx, we planned to increase the store base by a net of about 43 stores for a total of 1746 stores by yearend. At HomeGoods we\u2019ve planned to net nine stores for a total of 332 HomeGoods stores by the end of the year. At A.J. Wright, we anticipate netting eight stores for a total of 158 stores by yearend. At TJX Canada, we planned to net four Winners stores and two HomeSense stores to end the year with a total of 296 stores in Canada. Now in Europe, we expect to add a net of 44 new stores in fiscal 2011. In the UK, we expect to add 10 T.K. Maxx stores as well as six HomeSense stores for a combined total of 265 by the end of the year. We will continue to take advantage of the phenomenal real estate opportunities we\u2019re seeing in the UK.", "We also expect to open 25 stores in Germany for a total of 49 stores in that country by the end of the year. In Poland, we expect to open three stores in fiscal 2011 for a total of seven stores in that country by the end of the year. And finally, like last year we are maintaining a funded our capital plan to take advantage of the best real estate opportunities, the bulk of which will likely be at Marmaxx and in the UK. These additional stores are included in the 130 stores we\u2019ve planned to add in fiscal '011, but not in the divisional plan I've just recount.", "We ask you please \u2013 we\u2019ll open the questions now, we ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. To keep the call on schedule, we are going to enforce the one question limit, and we appreciate your cooperation.", "So thanks, and with that I'll turn it back to Eran and we\u2019d like to take questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hi, Kimberly, how are you?", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citi", "I am great, Carol. Congratulations on a terrific quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citi", "Carol, I think you gave a lot of compelling reasons as to why the operating margin is sustainable here, I am just looking back historically, and there have been slight volatility over time in that operating margin and I am wondering if there has been a fundamental change in the way we run business that leads you to believe that maybe some of that volatility has been removed? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, we\u2019ve been earnestly striving over the year in terms of the supply chain to lean up our inventories and to make us faster fresher, that\u2019s been a goal that we have been working on for several years. So, I think that this year was a big step for us in running our inventories a lot leaner and turning almost a week faster. I believe that we have reached a level that we can go a little bit further, but I think there is a shift in the way we run our business.", "Jeff Naylor", "We have in the past and really historically when you look back beyond three to four years back, when with ploughing [ph] back into business we have typically had planned our businesses at higher level of comps. And what happens is that if we have a miss, it was harder to pull back both inventory in cost dollars which is related to some of that volatility.", "And I think now given that we plan our comps much lower than we did in the past, we set the inventory plans as Carol mentioned, much leaner now as a result of that as well as actions we\u2019ve taken to improve the way we manage inventory. And we are also more focused on cost reduction over the last three, four years than we were in the past. All those things really help take the volatility out. The one other thing I want to add is that when you look at the volatility our gross profit \u2013 our volatility is so much lower than any other retailer out there. I am sure, you\u2019ll have, given the way we can chase; it\u2019s an opportunity to adjust inventory levels.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citi", "That\u2019s the way everybody thinks?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well the only time we have gotten ourselves in trouble is honestly when we have driven up our inventory too high.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi, thanks very much. A question on inventory turn, we have seen that there is nice acceleration in turn \u2013 one ring where you ended by division with in-store turns, and where do you think you can go from here, it\u2019s already remarkably \u2013 or remarkable historically? Thanks very much.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Richard, we don\u2019t \u2013 we really don\u2019t talk as to the individual division turns. I can however tell you that, again, we do believe that there is room for us to turn even faster than we did in \u201809 and that\u2019s what we are striving for.", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And if I can just ask a second, the Internet business by some offsite retailers, I am sure you have seen Movealot [ph] or Galeton [ph] just wondering how do you see that relates to your business?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, we did start an Internet business in Europe and we are actually very pleased with the results. We are well aware what\u2019s going on out there in terms of the Internet, and as we \u2013 we still \u2013 that will be a future possibility for us and, again, we want to be methodical thoughtful, and when we do get to enter in that arena in the States we would like to do it right. We were in the Internet business in the past; we closed it but we have been researching it and I think it\u2019s a future potential for us.", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Look forward to hearing more on that. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Black.", "Jeff Black \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hey, thanks. Turning to the store build-out, it looks like there is more of an emphasis on the core Marmaxx over the next couple of years. I am just wondering what\u2019s driving that. Is it lower rents, or are you finding better opportunities? And, also on the A.J. Wright business, related to that, it looks like we are building fewer stores than I would have thought. You say the business is where you want to be, is there just more work that needs to be done before we definitively roll that out in a bigger fashion then, can it still be the growth vehicle, you have been contemplating in the past several years? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Jeff, it's all about prioritizing. It\u2019s just, when you have an open to buy, we see \u2013 we take the moment and time to seize the day. Marmaxx what we are seeing is with the Marshalls next to Maxx, both are performing extremely well, we differentiated the businesses over the years, and we are really at a point in time when we are putting the two together, they both do extremely well. So we are seeing more room there. We are also seeing our Mega shoe concepts doing well.", "So, it's really a matter of prioritizing, so we are exceeding A.J.s, we are exceeding HomeGoods, but at the same time we really want to accelerate Marmaxx and Europe because the return on investment is so strong there. So we absolutely believe that A.J. Wright right has the potential to be 500 plus stores, but again it\u2019s taking that capital and being intelligent how we invest it.", "Jeff Black \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Great, thanks. Good luck.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the Michelle Clark.", "Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes, good morning and congratulations on a very strong quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Carol, in the past you said that as you see less attractive buyers [ph], inventory turns start to pick up in the wholesale channel that you can increase AUR. We would love to hear your thoughts on the potential to take up AUR by segment, your outlook for 2010?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. Well, we planned it conservatively, so we have plans, our average retail is slightly down, however, that's only going to be on the plus side as it trends up, and we are going to see how it goes through the year. It is leveling off at this point, and we are seeing a little bit of \u2013 less of a decline from a year ago. So, again, it\u2019s about keeping that distance between us and the department store. So to us it will just be upside, if it\u2019s flat or slightly up this year.", "Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And what do you think is the potential, how much do you think you can increase without negatively impacting traffic in the stores?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I go after pure value, so I never look at it as what it should be or how to plan it. We go after it as we want to give the best value to the customer.", "Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "All right, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair", "Good morning. Excellent results. Just had a, I guess, a question about one or two of the divisions in the fourth quarter, the segment profits at A.J. Wright specifically. And then I guess, looking specifically related to your comments on the vendor base having grown so substantially in 2009, what \u2013 are you at this point pretty satisfied with kind of the current size of the base and the mix of vendors or do you see a potential even further opportunities given the continued fallouts from the recession? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "All right. Well, I'll foster the vendor base and then Jeff will talk to A.J segment comp in the fourth quarter. You know we are going to keep increasing our vendor base, I mean we have worked very, very hard in the last several years, and as I\u2019ve talked before we have over a 100 people in Germany. We have offices now in India, we have offices in France, we have offices in Denmark.", "So it\u2019s the excitement of our mix and its future its constant change and newness and being ahead of our fashion curve. So we will continue to increase our vendor base, and obviously there will be standard that we drop because they may not be appropriate for our business, but this is never going to stop, I mean, this is part of what until we are and that\u2019s part of our supply chain machine. So, we will increase that. Jeff, you want to go through?", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, I am going to anticipate your question here, Daniel. I am going to \u2013 A.J. Wright last year reported a second profit margin of 2.7% in the quarter and this year it\u2019s 2.5%. So I assume you are curious as to why it would be down 20 basis points when we true-up inc comp on the business. And it\u2019s really simple, the function of the 53rd week and the bonus. Last year we benefited 70 basis points from the 53rd week. We obviously didn\u2019t have that 53rd week this year. And also the bonus impacted A.J. Wright by about 70 basis points. So it\u2019s almost \u2013 the other A.J. actually excluding those factors increased its pretax segment profitability by a 120 basis points, which is really in line with what we would have expected it to be.", "In terms of \u2013 I am going to \u2013 you didn\u2019t ask this question, but we actually had a very similar situation with Europe, where Europe was down a 100 basis points on a reported basis but when you back up the 53rd week and the bonus you actually got quite a bit of leverage there to. So, I will anticipate that might be a question of you will be interested and that\u2019s the answer.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair", "I appreciate that. It was really to that \u2013 I guess, the question of did those divisions in light of those two, sort of, non-comparable factors, were they in line with your margin expectations?", "Jeff Naylor", "Very much, though, actually above the margin expectation. We are seeing strong merchandised margins across those businesses just as we did in other businesses and we are continuing the leverage cost when you slid out the bonus.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks guys. Can you maybe share with us your traffic first ticket assumptions that underpinned that 1% to 2% comp guidance, and Jeff, can you maybe give us a breakdown on CapEx just how to split up that 750 between new stores and remodels and other projects might have going on?", "Jeff Naylor", "Sure.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "First of all, we don\u2019t give specifics on traffic, but I can assure you it\u2019s continuing and it\u2019s very, very aggressive and we are seeing that continue in the months of February. So we have pretty strong momentum there. Jeff, you want to address that?", "Jeff Naylor", "I think as you think about it, we the retail spots are slightly down, transactions would be often \u2013 that would be implied in the one to two, so. In terms of capital, maybe I just talked to the increases, Paul that\u2019s okay. We would anticipate that between new stores, remodels and in-store initiatives that, that would represent about two-thirds of the growth in the CapEx budget year-over-year. The balance of it is adding distribution capacity to support our European growth as well as some systems investment to support European growth and to replace some end of life hardware. I mean, probably would have said in the United States.", "We are doing nothing in the systems or by the way that would put our business at risks to sell a major software replacement or anything about sort of note. The one other thing included in the increases is that we do have an opportunity fund or a contingency that is available to Carol to add some more new stores or other investments as we see. So it\u2019s kind of hitting that we are maintaining in corporate that\u2019s about 30 plus.", "Paul Lejuez \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Jeff, how much is the cost to open a store in the US versus Europe?", "Jeff Naylor", "Cost to open a store in the US versus Europe \u2013 you are going to take \u2013 I would let \u2013", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. I was going to say, Paul, we are going to in terms of CapEx we're going to continue pretty close to that pace going forward.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, I mean, the cost to open a new store in the US, it\u2019s obviously more expensive in Europe, just kind of flipping through some numbers, make sure I give you a good number. I think with the inventory, this is almost twice as much in Europe. But that said, our European stores are significantly more productive than our U.S. stores because of the density that we typically find around the store, which allows us to generate similar contribution markets as we would make in Marmaxx.", "Paul Lejuez \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks guys. Good luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Stein.", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research", "Jeff, couple of questions here real quickly. One, incentive comps, and I'm wondering is part of the increase that we are seeing in the first quarter due to the fact that you\u2019re going to try and smooth out the incentive comp accrual in the new fiscal year? And then also, if you can kind of break out for us the leverage in buying and occupancy versus merchandise margin improvement that you saw for the fourth quarter and year? Thank you.", "Jeff Naylor", "Okay. So, in terms of the impact of the bonus on the \u2013 First, you wanted that on the first quarter, right, Jeff?", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research", "Yes, first quarter, and then for the year as well. I presume that it was so large in the back half of the year because you just had under accrued during the first two quarters, maybe that\u2019s not correct but I'm assuming that\u2019s part of it.", "Jeff Naylor", "Part of it was a pick up, so there is not a \u2013 as we look at the SG&A rate for first quarter of fiscal '11, incentive comp doesn\u2019t have a \u2013 isn\u2019t a big factor because we were essentially on our plan or slightly ahead of the plan last year in the first quarter, so we didn't have a tick-up in incentive comp last year that were going up again this year. As we look at the full year we do have, we kind of break down the SG&A. We have got \u2013 we are on the pickup for the full year from bonus, Jeff, because obviously we have a higher bonus expense in fiscal \u201910 that we are going to have in fiscal \u201911 because of the \u2013 we are planning fiscal \u201910 \u2013 fiscal \u201911, as we plan for fiscal \u201911.", "So we are planning fiscal \u201911 as a plan, whereas in fiscal \u201910 we significantly exceeded the plans. So there is pickup in the bonus that is largely being offset by some expense increases in some other areas. We get a little bit of deleveraging, in fact as we \u2013 but the rapid expansion in the European business, the average retail we are planning down, as Carol mentioned that we need to ship more units to do the same business so that has some impact on SG&A. There is some increases in medical costs and so on. So those largely offset the pickup we get from the bonus next year.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And investment.", "Jeff Naylor", "Right.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah.", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research", "Okay, and buying an occupancy and merchandised margin?", "Jeff Naylor", "Yeah, we really don\u2019t break that up. I guess what I would tell you is that we saw significant buying in occupancy leverage for the year and for the quarter but the lion share of the improvement in the gross profit margins will be incurred by merchandised margin.", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Adrianne Shapira.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. A question, you had mentioned, Carol, and obviously a big focus is to hold onto the new customers and drive that stickiness, and so I am wondering the remodel, it sounds as if you are seeing a conflict, any sort of help in terms of quantification because when we think about the guidance for the year as a one to two, you are obviously starting off very strong, with strong momentum in the three to five for Q1, I am just wondering since 40% of the Marmaxx would be in the remodeled format, why then should we expect the comps to decelerate to that one to two for the year?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Obviously, we really don\u2019t give out specific remodel cost, but and I think that as always we put a conservative model out there what we feel that we want to obviously build our cost to, and then anything above that, obviously will flow aggressively to the bottom line. So, we are planning prudently. We are doing very similar to what we did last year with our hope and our intent to beat those numbers. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of this things going on, but we have no idea, again, with the economy what\u2019s going to happen. So, I think we are being again planning prudently and being careful.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "It\u2019s kind of protect the business in the back half given what numbers we are looking at?", "Jeff Naylor", "But that\u2019s \u2013 I mean we were going to \u2013 should beat the numbers, we are not \u2013 if we don\u2019t get excited about our comp flat is slightly down, Adrianne.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We are, however, planning the back half on the conservative side. So we are looking at comp flat slightly down in the back half.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Right. Okay, understood. Thank you. And then just a follow-up, if I could, in terms of the accelerated square footage that you highlighted, I am just wondering what you say to, you know, we\u2019ve seen an environment where things like imitation, sort of, highest form of flattery, a lot of people are looking enviously to the offsite sector whether it\u2019s Nordstrom accelerating the rack or Bloomingdales announcing sort of an outlet division. So, help us understand as you too see opportunity to accelerate square footage, help us understand and speak to the Mayfairers [ph] where you are not \u2013 there is an issue as it relates to perhaps securing real estate, securing inventory as more and more people kind of try and follow your leads? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, in terms of our competitors we are always looking at our competitors, but we are in a very different business and very key [ph] in terms of our sourcing, our supply chain and our flexibility. So we \u2013 I get asked obviously the question of, is that going to be good out there and I can answer this a 100 times a thousand times, a million times we are not concerned about it. Again, I just keep coming back to the sourcing, the way we source, our foothold all over the world. So, that is not a major concern for us. What we always look at our competitors. We always want to make sure our value is right against our competitor\u2019s and that\u2019s what we focus on. So, I think we feel very confident going forward, and I think it takes people a long time to get through with TJX as we have built this business over tens of years.", "Jeff Naylor", "And to lot of scale. And on the real estate side, Adrianne, we just work continuing to see terrific deals. So, as long as we see strong deals and strong returns, you know Carol mentioned, most of the deals we did last year were exceeding our numbers. So we\u2019ll keep investing aggressively as long as we continue to see that.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We don\u2019t sign a deal unless it has the right return on investment.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great, best of luck. Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Slater.", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Thanks very much. Good morning everybody.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hi, Todd.", "Jeff Naylor", "Hi, Todd.", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "You guys made a really compelling case as to why comp growth is sustainable, and of course the history supports your case because you\u2019ve grown comps 4% on average during recessions and 3% on average during all other periods since your IPO. But \u2013 and I understand your conservative guidance of 1% to 2%, but what I would like to get a better feeling about is what you see or what you are planning on the average tickets, since it was down pretty decently, last year the comparisons are easy, I would expect some stabilization in the ticket and obviously in the better environment that might even trend up because I am just curious what you are seeing, and if you could just address that trend, the average ticket trend in \u2019010 versus last year? And then how does it change with the potential for 90 to a 100 doors moved the needle to any great degree?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, you will see when we announce it. We believe it has the potential to be a fairly profitable business. So again more to come on that, and as far as the average ticket goes, we have planned it slightly down so that anything that come close to flat or above will hopefully be gravy and drive comp and certainly drive to the bottom line. But what we want to do is to make sure we absolutely have the best value out there and that\u2019s what we\u2019re always striving for.", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Stacy Pak.", "Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research", "Hi guys. A couple of questions, Carol, I was hoping you could kind of talk to us about what you see as the areas of opportunity in terms of merchandising focus? And also if you guys could expand on the supply chain initiatives getting the right products to the right place at the right time, when should we see all that impact, what are you doing in terms of profiling the stores, what level, that sort of thing? And then just a clarification on the SG&A, you said 50 to 75, is that the reduction in SG&A dollars or is there some offset so it's not down that much? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, Stacy, only get one question, which one do you want?", "Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research", "I want you to address the merchandize and supply chain stuff?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "All right. We see many, many areas of (inaudible) and we obviously \u2013 I always say take a walk in our stores because this is not something that we share exactly what we are planning by division. Many, many different initiatives are in each division and of the same. And then we obviously leverage on \u201cno walls\u201d, so we\u2019ve got plenty, plenty of new opportunities for next year, and we are very excited about it.", "And this year we test a lot of new categories, we are testing different categories for next year, but we think in some of our divisions where we had some weaknesses in the apparel areas, I think we are seeing some strength and I like where we\u2019re going with that. The supply chain has been ongoing. Every single year we get more pointed, and that's been part of our investment over the years. And I think we have a long way to go but we definitely made some inroads last year, and I think this year we\u2019ll be even better in terms of targeting our stores.", "So that\u2019s an initiative that\u2019s going to go on to the next several years. Again we don\u2019t go in and say, let's just change our entire systems and do anything dramatic. So, we have been building on our days and getting much more focus and more pointed on it. So that will just be ongoing, but we did see some pretty good results in 2009.", "Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research", "Can you give us any sense in terms of how you are thinking about the stores, Carol? Are you saying this is a fashion store, this is a \u2013 how you\u2019re profiling the stores and how are you getting the right product there, can you give us any more detail there?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Very deep, we take a very deep cut in terms of the level of store, the type of merchandise, how contemporary it is, the type of customer that is shopping in that store. We have a very, very deep understanding. The different weather patterns, early deals with Marmaxx in terms of North, South, Marshalls, Max in Canada, he deals with all different weather patterns. So, we are pretty detailed and we are getting a lot more detailed. Do you any comments to make Ernie?", "Ernie Herrman", "No, I think just backing up what Carol said, we have, our planning organization really does a great job on this and I think we have become more sophisticated in the last few years not just growing in by climate but by demographics, by location. So, I think we are really in a different place than we were a few years ago, and I can see that continuing to improve over the next couple of years.", "Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research", "Great. Okay. Thanks and good luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Tubin.", "Howard Tubin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot. Carol, can you tell us, can you share with us, over the last year, has there been any significant change in the percentage of your buys that were maybe all price relative to the percentage that comes from upfront buying?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, we\u2019ve moved the percentage slightly higher on the off price side of the business.", "Jeff Naylor", "Still a continuation of a trend we\u2019ve been \u2013 seeing over for five years. Right?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And we will probably see that trend continue this year to get a little bit higher.", "Howard Tubin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. That\u2019s great, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Champine.", "Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Carol, if you ramp group footage growth just overall, is there any change to the size of the different boxes by concept?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Laura, yeah, again, as we get better and better understanding with consumer, we look at the specific locations and the box is an relationship obviously to the demographics, the number of people that are in the certain radius. So, we flex dramatically. If there is a site in New York City and it\u2019s a smaller box, but very, very high traffic pattern, we can do a smaller store and drive it. You will see the same thing in London. We have some stores that range as small as 12,000 square feet, to stores that range to 50,000 square feet. So, again, that\u2019s the flexibility of our business and we can take full advantage of all of the real estate that\u2019s out there.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, if you look at the average, the average at all outs, we can do larger boxes, smaller boxes, and Carol mentioned how we are flexible. But we also \u2013 when you look at just the average square footage, it\u2019s pretty consistent. It actually has been pretty consistent, so that, I think in the past we might have opened \u2013 we had as much diversity in the kinds of deals that we did. Now we can have more diversity, but the average size of the box is pretty comparable to what has been for.", "Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Marni Shapiro.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Hi, guys, congratulations. Jeff, I think Carol\u2019s kiddy needs to go like three times. I could spend her kiddy on a good evening [ph]. I was very curious about two things, first marketing, you could talk about what your \u2013 we know what you are doing here in the US, if you could talk a little about what you are doing in Europe and as you expand in Germany and Poland, just to support these brands? And then, just a follow-up kind of clean up thing, could you just touch on loss prevention and shrinkage and remind us when you do a fiscal inventories company?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. In terms of marketing in Europe, it\u2019s very, very different than in the United States, the United States we tend to drive TV a lot harder. Each country is very different. What Paul does in the UK is very different than what he does in Germany and in Poland. So, we are not going to let out our trade secrets, but they\u2019re very, very different strategies. And Ernie is also looking Canada and really leveraging some of the things that we\u2019re doing in United States with Canada, as we\u2019re also leveraging some of the things that we are doing with Marmaxx, with HomeGoods. So, we really look at each brand very differently and how we market each brand.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "But you are marketing all of these brands in these countries.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Okay.", "Jeff Naylor", "In terms of block prevention, we take a full physical inventory at the end of the year for each of our chains, every store in the chain. And in terms of (inaudible) we really don\u2019t comment on that, that\u2019s part of the gross margin results, and if it were a significant factor, it\u2019s something we'd talk about but it really hasn\u2019t been significant to the results for many years.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Excellent. Congratulations, guys.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Weiner.", "David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning, and thanks for taking my call. So, I had a question on long-term margin potential. I think in October during your Analyst Day, you had kind of broken that down by brand. Has there been any meaningful change to your kind of long-term pretax margin goals by brand and how that rolls up to the total company? Thanks.", "Jeff Naylor", "So, in total as I mentioned in the three year model, David, we\u2019ve got about a point of our EPS growth over the next three years coming from margin expansions, that would equate to about 10 to 20 basis points over that time period. And that's almost entirely coming from leveraging our \u2013 increasing our margins at \u2013 of our businesses other than Marmaxx and Winners, which we plan flat. So the business, Marmaxx and Winners will be plan flat, other than Marmaxx and Winners we've assumed some leverage as we rollout new stores.", "As we think about the potential margins, the only thing we would say is at Marmaxx is the time we\u2019re seeing 10.5 to 11.5, Marmaxx came in at 12. I think as Carol mentioned earlier we think we can maintain that, we\u2019ll see how well we can do, so that\u2019ll be interesting to see.", "I think with T.K. Maxx in the UK, historically we\u2019ve said eight to nine, we are approaching nine as we exit the year and we still have leverage opportunities with Europe. So clearly T.K. in the UK can go higher and we would now anticipate that more in the 9% to 10% range. And we are going to see how high we take that. What\u2019s interesting is that that our distribution network is Pan-European, we have many shared services that we are leveraging. And so as we grow Europe we are getting leverage in Europe, we are also getting more leverage in the UK.", "And lastly with HomeGoods, I think before we've said we thought it was about 8% business, we are now thinking it\u2019s more like 8% to 9%, because again HomeGoods is approaching that 8% margin this past year and we still have, we could still double the fleet in terms of the number of stores. So there should be more leverage available there as we grow that. So those would the changes that I will highlight.", "David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks, that makes a lot of sense.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Glick.", "David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research", "And I'd say good afternoon and add my congratulations. In terms of your TV advertising in 2009, I believe that you went from regional to national buyers, and as a result reached a lot more markets in TV advertising than you had before. I'm just wondering if you \u2013 I presume at this point you\u2019ve analyzed the success for that and the returns and just wondered how much of your success in 2009 was at least partially attributable to the approach you took at your TV advertising and the reach of it.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, we were very, very happy with our advertising strategy last year. And this year we are shifting more media back into the network TV. We are actually going to taking our individual brands, Marshals and Maxx and going network, which is going to be a pretty big increase in penetration. We\u2019ve loaded up the back half and we are going to continue more aggressively also on our dual strategy. So, we are really very, very happy with our marketing strategy and I think we are going to be a lot more aggressive this year coming up.", "Jeff Naylor", "We are obviously seeing an attractive return there, but we really don\u2019t want to publicly break out \u2013", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Right \u2013", "David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research", "All right. Jeff, and just quick a follow-up, could you give us a rule of thumb on the flow-through if you are able to get incremental sales over plan, what kind of incremental flow-through as a percentage of sales that you generally carry to the bottom line?", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, I would quantify that around like in the low 30s, so for every dollar of sales above plan I think 30% to 33% kind of in that range, and other way to think about it is point of comp above plan specifically gives us about 20 basis point of incremental margin on the bottom-line for a full year.", "David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Good luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question is from Dana Telsey.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Good afternoon, everyone and congratulations.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Dana.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Can you talk a little bit about the differentiated areas in the store and how they are progressing whether it\u2019s Runway, whether it\u2019s Cube, are you seeing that in international stores too in terms how you are setting it up, and is that helping the international sales or possibility? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Right. Dana, we are very, very happy with the Cube, and in terms of \u2013 and we\u2019re happy with the one way. But in terms of taking that internationally, yes, we have no walls and where our \u2013 an initiative works in a division, the other divisions appropriately does make sense for their business to take the initiative event. So, Europe is actually had several different things going on and we will learn from that. So, the idea is then with no walls that we are constantly sharing the information so that every single brand can maximize their business and do it right through their business. It\u2019s in part of our really getting together almost every single Monday, all of our presidents and our seniors and the sharing of information. So that will continue.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, I want to thank everyone, and I really look forward to reporting the first quarter so we will see you soon.", "Operator", "Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, President, and CEO for The TJX Companies, Inc. ", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Before we begin, Sherry has a few comments.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. Forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings, including without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 30, 2010.", "Further these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies. Any recording, retransmission, reproduction or other use of the same for profit or otherwise without prior consent of TJX is prohibited and a violation of the United States copyright and other laws.", "Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript. Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis.", "Also we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website www.tjx.com. As a reminder, the comparable store sales numbers that we talk about today are on a constant currency basis.", "With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today's press release and posted on our website in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks Sherry, and good morning again, and joining me on the call today are with Sherry is Jeff Naylor and Ernie Herrman. So let me start by saying that its great to see our strong momentum continue.", "We delivered another quarter of above planned results with earnings per share up 63% over last year. You should note that we achieved these strong results on top of comparisons that were quite a bit more challenging than most other retailers faced.", "Our customer traffic continued to increase significantly which we believe indicates that consumers will remain focused on value regardless of the economic environment. Our strategy to retain new customers and continue growing our customer base are clearly working. ", "I\u2019m going to keep my comments brief today and reiterate the reasons for our confidence in our sustainable profitable growth then update you on our strong first quarter results. I will also discuss our outlook for the second quarter and opportunities in 2010. We will continue to run the business conservatively, keeping inventories lean and reducing costs. ", "At the same time we are extremely focused on keeping our new customers that we\u2019ve been gaining and have many initiatives under way across the company to drive results beyond our plans. We continue to have tremendous opportunities for global growth. ", "Before I continue let me turn the call over to Jeff to recap the numbers for the first quarter. ", "Jeff Naylor", "Thanks Carol, good morning everybody. Just to recap the first quarter results, our net sales reached $5 billion, that\u2019s a 15% increase over last year. Our consolidated comparable store sales were up 9% on top of last year\u2019s 2% increase. ", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.80, that\u2019s up 63% over last year\u2019s $0.49 per share and I should mention that foreign currency exchange rate had a slightly positive effect on the year over year growth. ", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 10.7%, that\u2019s up 290 basis points over prior year and that was driven by continued strong merchandise margins, expense leverage on the 9% comp, and solid expense controls. ", "Foreign currency exchange rates did not meaningfully impact our pre-tax margin comparisons. The gross profit margin was 250 basis points above last year and that reflects strong merchandise margins and significant leverage on buying and occupancy expenses.", "SG&A expense improved 50 basis points to 16.4% as a percent of sales which is well favorable to our plans. This was achieved despite the deleveraging impact from investments in our European businesses, as well as a lower average retail both of which we discussed on our year-end conference call. ", "SG&A expense on a dollar basis was in line with our plans despite approximately $170 million in incremental sales above our plan, as we saw very high flow through to the bottom line due in part to the expense controls I mentioned earlier. ", "As to inventories, at the end of the first quarter consolidated inventories on a per store basis including the warehouses were down 12% and that\u2019s despite the impact of foreign currency which actually increased inventory levels by 2%. So we were down 12 despite foreign currency pushing up the inventory levels by 2%. ", "At Marmaxx our total inventory commitment including the warehouses, stores, and merchandise on order was slightly up versus last year on a per store basis, and as we\u2019ve discussed on our prior calls we expect Marmaxx\u2019s inventory commitments to be flat to up slightly throughout the first half of this year given the much stronger pace of our business compared to last year. ", "Its important to note that we continue to run the business with very lean inventories and the slight increase in inventory commitments at Marmaxx remains far below the rate of sales and our owned inventories in the stores and DC\u2019s are down considerably over prior year levels. ", "So that\u2019s the recap of the first quarter, let me turn it back to Carol and I\u2019ll come back at the end to cover second quarter guidance. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "Thanks Jeff, moving straight to the key points, first we remain very confident in our top line growth and continue to have significant opportunities to drive comp sales. Second, we have great confidence in our ability to sustain strong profit margins. ", "And third, we are growing TJX as a global off price value company and have vast opportunities to grow this business over the long-term. I\u2019ll start with the reasons for our confidence in the top line growth, first our strong momentum continued in the first quarter with customer traffic increasing significantly. ", "Its important to note that on a two and three year aggregate basis our comps trend accelerated in the first quarter. Our compelling values continue to attract new customers. In our 33-year history new customers that discovered us when times were tough have continued to shop us when times improve because they love our value.", "Today we believe that value is more important than ever in customers\u2019 minds across all demographics . Second we continue to grow our customer base for future. Our customer research tells us that new customers are driving our customer traffic increases and more importantly that the vast majority of these new customers intend to shop us again. ", "Our research further shows us that we are pulling customers from a widening customer demographic reach. We believe that one of the many elements that differentiates us from other apparel retailers is our very broad consumer appeal. ", "With our various concepts and international scope we reach all income levels, from moderate to middle to upper, as well as many age ranges. Third we believe our investments in marketing and the shopping experience for our customers are helping us attract and retain new ones. ", "I believe our marketing campaigns are more powerful than ever and are effectively educating consumers about our great fashion and value. We are seizing opportunities to leverage our marketing spend which means that you will be seeing more of our marketing than ever before and we have skewed this heavily towards the back half of the year when we\u2019re up against tougher comparisons. ", "By the fall we will have 700 of our Marmaxx stores remodeled, a program that began last year. As we are seeing sales lifts in our upgraded stores we believe this too will help us in the back half. Fourth, we are beginning to see a moderation in our average ticket. That said, we always need to be right on value and maintain the price gap between us and traditional retailers. ", "So while we have said that as the economy improves even a slight increase in consumer spending would be meaningful to our business we will remain sharply focused on being priced to offer the best values to our customers. ", "Now let\u2019s move to our confidence in bottom line growth, first our strategy of running with lean inventories continues to work well. Merchandise margins were up again in the first quarter over last year\u2019s very strong performance. ", "I should note that in the last 10 years merchandise margins at Marmaxx have been flat or up on an annual basis. Looking ahead we believe we have meaningful opportunities to run even leaner. We are improving our supply chain to run faster and better and become more pointed in flowing merchandise to stores.", "Second, we are on track with our cost reduction initiatives for 2010 which we continue to expect will total $50 to $75 million this year and as always we\u2019ll certainly strive to beat that plan. Third, as we discussed in our year-end call we have significant opportunities to leverage [structure] costs as we grow the store base of both our younger and more established chains. ", "Now I\u2019d like to reiterate our confidence in our long-term goals for global growth, with over 2700 stores today we are confident that over the long-term we have the potential to grow to over 4200 stores. This represents our potential with just our current concepts in just our existing markets alone. ", "It does not include rolling out tests of new concepts such as our standalone shoe stores in the US or Canada or expanding into new markets in Europe or eventually new continents. Our growth vehicles are performing well, which underscores our confidence in our plans for accelerated store growth. ", "To recap our plans we expect to accelerate store growth from 3% in 2009 to 5% in 2010 and then 6% in 2011. We are prioritizing investments and taking advantage of the best real estate opportunities. And further we\u2019re investing in infrastructure and pursuing top talent on a global level to support our growth. ", "We continue to view TJX Europe as a major vehicle for our future growth. In the first quarter we believe that unfavorable weather as well as our own execution contributed to a sales miss in the UK and Ireland and segment profit overall was just slightly down. ", "The first quarter has always been a very small quarter for our European business and despite the slight miss in Q1 we\u2019re confident in our plans for the full year. Germany, Poland, and HomeSense all performed well in line and above our expectation and we have strong confidence in TJX Europe. ", "My final point on growth is that beyond adding new stores we have many new ideas that we are testing in all of our businesses that could ultimately grow into new concepts or initiatives. We hope to discuss the details of our new chain on our next quarterly conference call. ", "We continue to test ecommerce in the UK which could develop into an important growth vehicle. Developing and testing new seeds for growth is part of our DNA and we have many opportunities to expand in directions that play on our success and what we know best. ", "Now to our financial strength, our strong operations generate substantial amounts of cash which we deploy with a careful balance between reinvesting in our businesses and preserving our financial flexibility and simultaneously distributing excess cash to shareholders. ", "In terms of share repurchases, we bought back approximately $234 million of TJX stock during the first quarter retiring 5.5 million shares. We continue to expect to repurchase between $900 million and $1 billion of TJX stock in fiscal 2011.", "Our Board of Directors approved the 25% increase on our per share dividend in April which marks our fourteenth consecutive dividend increase. I want to briefly mention that our strong financials stack up very well against our peers. ", "Fortune 500 recently ranked TJX number 119 in its survey to the largest company in 2009, up from 131 last year. Additionally among all Fortune 500 companies, we ranked number 11 in return on assets, number 25 in return on equity, and number 77 for 10-year EPS compound annual growth rate. ", "I will also mention that we were very pleased on behalf of our associates to be named the top performing company in Massachusetts by The Boston Globe, ranking just published today. Moving to our outlook for the second quarter, we will continue to plan our business conservatively and at the same time try our best and do whatever we can to drive results beyond our planned levels, a strategy that has worked successfully over time. ", "For the second quarter we are planning EPS to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.72, a 10% to 18% increase over last year\u2019s $0.61 per share. For the full year we now expect EPS to be in the range of $3.21 to $3.32, a 13% to 17% increase over $2.84 per share last year. ", "This guidance is based on our planning the business around a flat to slightly negative comp in the back half of the year. Jeff will provide more details in just a moment. So in closing I will say again, that we are pleased to see our strong momentum continue, and 2010 is off to a great start.", "We are very confident that our strong top and bottom line performance is sustainable. We know our comparisons get tougher as this year progresses, but believe we are well positioned to address this. We operate an extremely flexible business model which enables us to capitalize on the value mindset of our consumers. ", "With our no wall store layouts, we are able to move inventory purchase dollars between categories and react quickly as consumer tastes change. We are growing our customer base for the future and appeal to a broad and diverse customer demographic. Additionally we are investing in marketing, skewing our spending to the second half of the year and enhancing our stores to attract and retain more customers.", "We have many new ideas and like the availability and quality of goods we are seeing in the marketplace. We view ourselves as a sourcing machine and lever our global buying presence to source from 60 countries. On the bottom line we believe opportunities remain to run the business with even leaner inventories and we continue to focus on reducing and levering costs to drive profitability. ", "We have accelerated the pace of our growth and are pursuing the many opportunities that this environment is presenting. We are capitalizing on great real estate deals particularly in Europe that we believe will benefit our business long-term. ", "Further we are building our infrastructure and organization to support this growth. We have exciting prospects for the short-term and are confident in our long-term global growth potential. Ultimately as I previously stated I believe that we will grow TJX to be double the size it is today. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jeff to go through guidance and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. ", "Jeff Naylor", "Thanks Carol, so let me provide some details on our second quarter guidance, as Carol mentioned for the second quarter we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.72 and that\u2019s a 10% to 18% increase over the $0.61 per share last year. ", "We\u2019re assuming a second quarter top line of approximately $5.1 billion with a comp sales increase of 2% to 4% on a consolidated basis, and 2% to 4% at the Marmaxx group. As to monthly comps we\u2019re planning for comp sales increases of 1% to 2% in May, 2% to 4% in June, and 2% to 4% in July. ", "These comp increases are the same for TJX on a consolidated basis and for the Marmaxx group. Pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 8.9% to 9.4% range which represents a 20 to 70 basis point increase on top of last year\u2019s 130 basis point increase.", "We\u2019re anticipating second quarter gross profit margin in the range of 25.9% to 26.2% which represents a 30 to 60 basis point increase over last year. I should note this improvement is on top of significant increases last year and is driven by improved merchandising margins as we continue to capitalize on the opportunities Carol mentioned earlier. ", "We anticipate SG&A as a percent of sales to be about 16.7% to 16.8% which is flat to 10 basis points above last year. The slight decrease in leverage is due to investments in our European business, a lower average retail, and the expense of opening new stores and the expense of remodels that we\u2019re doing, most of which also impacted Q1 and all of which were anticipated in our original plans.", "For modeling purposes, we\u2019re anticipating a tax rate of 38.6% which is higher than last year and negatively impacts EPS growth by two pennies. We\u2019re also planning net interest expense in the $10 to $11 million range, corporate expenses in the $39 to $41 million range, and weighted average shares of approximately 413 million. ", "Now let me turn to the full year, for the full year we\u2019re now expecting earnings per share to be in the $3.21 to $3.32 per share range, an increase of 13% to 17% over the $2.84 per share in the prior year. Here are the key changes versus the model we gave you at the beginning of the year, first we now estimate consolidated comp store sales growth of 2% to 3%, which is up slightly versus our prior guidance of plus 1% to plus 2%. ", "We now expect pre-tax profit margins to be 9.9% to 10.2%, that\u2019s up 30 to 60 basis points over last year and is 40 basis points above our original guidance. This revised outlook assumes gross profit margins up 20 to 30 basis points over prior year and SG&A rates improving 10 to 20 basis points and again, both of these assumptions are favorable to the original guidance that we gave. ", "While we\u2019re not providing quarterly guidance beyond the second quarter the model assumes flat to slightly negative comps in the back half of this year as we anniversary strong numbers. As Carol mentioned earlier, we have many opportunities to do better but believe this is the prudent way to plan our business. ", "We\u2019ll now open it for questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person and to keep the call on schedule we\u2019re going to continue to enforce our one question limit. After you ask your one question if you\u2019d like to, you can get back in the queue and ask another one. ", "We appreciate your cooperation and thanks, and we\u2019ll open it up now. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Black \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Jeff Black \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Congrats on a really nice looking quarter, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing with the lower AUR comment and in the average basket overall, is that improving, what\u2019s happening with, is it lower because of the mix shift, because of units and on the gross margin that really looks conservative, is there something in the timing of receipts, mix, anything you\u2019re seeing in April that leads you to be a little bit more cautious here. ", "Jeff Naylor", "I think on the average unit retail, we were down low to mid single-digits in the quarter and we\u2019re seeing that moderate somewhat, but we continue to plan it down slightly and obviously with a lower average unit retail you have to move more units to do the same level of sales which puts pressure on DC and store costs. ", "We built some of that into the guidance. In terms of the gross profit, we\u2019ve got 30 to 60 basis points of improvement on top of last year\u2019s 130, if you actually look at the gross profit margin over the last three years, so in the first quarter if you look over the last three years, we\u2019ve had 240 basis points improvement in the gross profit margin. ", "If you look at what we\u2019re guiding to in the second quarter, it would be about 210 to 240 basis points over that same three period. So its not out of line with the historical trend, that said as Carol mentioned we always try to set our guidance at reasonable levels and obviously have plans in place to beat it. ", "And I think the low inventory levels that we have coming into the quarter certainly set us up in terms of turning faster and having lower markdowns. But that\u2019s the way we set the guidance. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "One more comment to that, in terms of the average retail we are seeing it moving in a positive direction but I want to be very careful here because our job is to always give the best value we can. So we don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to look like going towards the back half. It could be up and could be down. ", "So we\u2019re more focused on value than anything. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Congrats, your full year guidance assumes flat to down comps for the second half as you\u2019ve mentioned and I\u2019m curious as to your assumptions on the AUR, on traffic and also how should we look at Forex effects on sales and earnings for the rest of the year. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "In terms of traffic what we have done is we\u2019ve pushed our marketing plans pretty aggressively in the back half. We also have probably, we have 110 out of the 400 stores that we\u2019re remodeling done so its very back half driven, along with many merchandise initiatives that we have in place. ", "So we are being pretty aggressive in the back half and because of the comps, we had such strong comps last year we\u2019re being very prudent in terms of planning it. But I have a lot of confidence in the back half and I think we\u2019re doing all the right things. ", "Jeff Naylor", "In terms of Forex, I\u2019ll deal first with sales, sales were up 15% in the first quarter, Forex was worth about three points of that. In the second quarter Forex is worth about one point of our revenue growth will come from Forex in the second quarter at current rates. ", "And in the last six months its really a non issue [inaudible] of our sales growth. In terms of EPS in the first quarter Forex benefited EPS by a penny compared to a two-cent hit last year. For the second quarter we\u2019re anticipating a one-cent benefit this year against the one cent hit last year and in the second half we\u2019re anticipating it to be relatively neutral from an EPS standpoint versus a one-cent benefit last year. ", "So you can see really from an EPS standpoint its pretty neutral on the year, pretty much a non issue and has a slight impact on sales although that moderates as we go through the year. Now that again, that assumes that the exchange rates stay where they are today which is typically how we would forecast our business. ", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "And just as a follow-up what\u2019s the marketing investment change in the second half year over year that Carol mentioned. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "We don\u2019t give you the exact number but we\u2019re slightly up, in dollars we\u2019re up. But more importantly in terms of penetration we\u2019re being very aggressive. You are going to see our [grips] way up in the back half. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan ", "Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan ", "Congrats as well, I guess investors seem to be concerned about the ongoing question about the availability of inventory, the mix between the off price and the make-ups, you talk about inventory turns and supply chain, I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe give us some more confidence or color of why you think gross margins can continue to head higher and then the second question is on T.K. Maxx, can you maybe just give us an idea of how much margin pressure in Q1 came from your new store investments in the other countries versus the sales and the execution mix. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "First of all our new store investment in the UK is half the stores and we\u2019re up to over 50 stores. Half of the stores will be in the first half and you\u2019ve got to remember that even in the first quarter about 80% to 88% of our sales are done in the back half in the UK. So they are effected more dramatically by the new stores and the remodels in the first quarter, in the first half. ", "In terms of the availability of goods, we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing. We have shut down the team many times through the quarter so there\u2019s certainly not a lack of availability and I believe that in terms of our inventory levels we have many divisions that are leaner than other divisions so that we think we have some still improvements to be made there. ", "But more importantly we have invested and continue to invest in our supply chain and that is allowing us to buy closer to need and it will allow us to continuously do a better job of transitioning the seasons and shipping the right goods to the right stores. So its not just about bringing the inventory down, its really about the mix and how the mix hits the stores by region and by zone. ", "So we still think we have quite a bit of potential. ", "Jeff Naylor", "Just to add to your comments on Europe Carol mentioned the same quarter from a sales standpoint, from a profit standpoint we make about 5% of our profits in Europe in the first quarter whereas total TJX is about 20% to 25%. So it\u2019s a thin quarter. In terms of the impact of the new businesses, in terms of the UK and Ireland our profit dollars and our segment margins were essentially flat year over year.", "We had a miss on sales, our gross margins were essentially flat because of the flexibility in our business model, we\u2019re able to adjust. If you then look at Poland, Germany, and HomeSense, slightly higher levels of loss/investment versus last year, that was all anticipated though, and is in line with our plan. ", "Germany remains very, very much on track to earn a profit this year and Poland and HomeSense we think will be near break even. So we remain confident in those businesses and they\u2019re really on track with what we\u2019re seeing so far. ", "", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "Also in terms of weather in the first quarter the home businesses and the non-apparel businesses were absolutely [inaudible] and the same thing in Europe, so we clearly believe that we do have a bit of a weather issue and that did hurt the pace there.

Are there any of the concepts that you\u2019ve seen ticket turn positive. ", "", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "In terms of the traffic we\u2019re really up in all divisions. The traffic has been accelerating, its actually accelerated since the back half.", "Jeff Naylor", "About 75% to 80% of the gross margin, 250 basis point improvement in the first quarter, 75%, 80% of that was merchandise margin. The balance was buying and occupancy. ", "", "Paul Lejuez \u2013 Credit Suisse", "But on the ticket are there any of the concepts where ticket is running positive right now over the past quarter or so. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "Not really, we\u2019re really slightly down across the board. But it is come back since the back half but its definitely moving in a more positive direction since the back half. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citi", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citi", "I was just trying to understand the differential between the decline in inventory per store relative to your comments that Marmaxx is flat, I think you mentioned that there were some divisions where you\u2019re down significantly are there any other factors in there that are influencing that, is it that Marmaxx is committing inventory further ahead of time relative to when they were doing it last year or what are the dynamics that are influencing that spread between what the reported inventory per store balance is versus what your comments are about Marmaxx\u2019s commitments.", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "Well Marmaxx remember Marmaxx is still against very high sales in the back half so the commitments are really pretty lean when you look at it against last year. So I think we couldn\u2019t be in better shape and the turns are faster than they\u2019ve ever been before so I\u2019m very, very comfortable with our commitments. ", "We came into May, we made a very conscious decision to keep May very, very lean and we did that as we saw last May was a very hot May. Last June was a very cold June. We\u2019re starting to see the opposite and what\u2019s beautiful about our business is you can obviously shut it off pretty quickly so we made a very conscious decision and we decided to strategize to keep May very lean and then go much stronger and ship fresh goods in June, shorts and bathing suits and much more summer product a little bit later this year.", "And those are the things that we\u2019re learning. We got hurt a little bit in the UK because we came in too summer and then we kind of came back with a little bit of the wrong transition and now we\u2019re getting ourselves back in line and we\u2019re in great shape. So that\u2019s the beauty of the flexibility. So we\u2019re very, very comfortable. I\u2019m very happy we\u2019re as lean as we are in May and I think we\u2019ve made the absolute proper commitments going forward.", "So, I think our flow is going to be terrific. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman \u2013 Wells Fargo ", "Evren Kopelman \u2013 Wells Fargo ", "Can you give us an update on the remodels at Marmaxx, maybe how much of the comp improvement if any in the first quarter is driven by remodels and are you seeing a similar lift in comps and how we should think about that in the second half. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "We really don\u2019t, we don\u2019t talk about the percentages. We\u2019re very pleased, we\u2019re also very pleased with the customers\u2019 reaction so we will continue with this program. We also have tested the remodels across all our divisions done in slightly different ways and we\u2019re seeing the same type of lift. But I apologize, we really don\u2019t give you that number. ", "Jeff Naylor", "We don\u2019t want to break that too fine but suffice it to say that we get strong returns and pay backs on the investments we\u2019re making and importantly most of the remodels are going to be done by the end of the second quarter so that does help us as we get into the back half in terms of lapping up against the numbers that we are lapping up against. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "Its part of our whole back half strategy. ", "Evren Kopelman \u2013 Wells Fargo ", "If I could follow-up on the home category as well, clearly there\u2019s been a lot of strength, can you give us a little bit color of in home, what\u2019s working, is it soft goods, is it hard goods, and kind of the drivers of that and how long do you think we can expect to see double-digit cost in that category. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "Honestly our home business is very strong across the board. Its really both soft home, gift giving, hard home, it is, we really don\u2019t have too many categories that are soft. I think that home in general out there is stronger. I think there\u2019s a weather factor here. But I think more importantly for TJX, I am absolutely thrilled with the mix and I think our values are better than ever. ", "And I think they\u2019re going to continue that. We are sourcing in some amazing new countries and there is such a stream amount of newness that I believe our trends will continue. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "In your prepared remarks, the benefit of new customers, just wondering if you can give us some additional color in terms of new customers as a percent of total this year versus last, where the customers are coming from and then what the benefit to the comps. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "Again our customer, our increase in customer trend in new customers is continuing. So we really saw a huge lift last year, we\u2019re continuing to see that lift going forward and as we said before we\u2019re doing everything possible to keep all of these new customers and continue it into the back half. So we again we don't divide up our transactions and our number of customers but I can tell you that its absolutely accelerating. ", "Jeff Naylor", "Our comp, as Carol mentioned the customer count has actually accelerated into the first quarter so when we look at transaction growth its accelerating and a big chunk of that is coming from new customers and they\u2019re coming from all over the place. As Carol mentioned in her prepared remarks we\u2019re really broadening the demographic reach and we\u2019re also seeing some of those customers very high both intent to repurchase as well as when we look at credit card data, we actually see those new customers are in fact coming back in, in large large numbers to, for a second visit and sometimes more visits. ", "So we\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the level of trial we\u2019re getting from new customers and the level of repeat business we\u2019re getting from those customers as well. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "On the Memorial Day shift, could you quantify that, we appreciate sort of the monthly comp but give us a sense of what the shift out of May is having an impact into June and then just specifically on categories, obviously we\u2019re hearing the home strength but give us a little bit more color on what else you\u2019re seeing, sort of apparel, accessories, where you\u2019re chasing harder, where the strengths are, where you\u2019re seeing some encouraging trends from the consumer. ", "Jeff Naylor", "On the shift, its not as significant for us as it is for other retailers because we don\u2019t have large promotional events. So, it ends up being relatively minor. I think we would classify it as less than a point. The other thing that benefits June is that we\u2019ve got a little bit of a shift in the Fourth of July where with the holiday moving out of June into July that will probably help the June comps because there aren\u2019t a lot of people that, traffic tends to be down on the day that people have off as they do\u2014so it\u2019s a little bit of a benefit to June but its no where near as material as you\u2019d expect it to be from other retailers who promote heavily around the holiday. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "Our main plan is not based on the Memorial Day, its really based on where we see the business. In terms of categories, we continue to, our accessories business, our shoe business continues to be very strong. Our junior business with the cube is absolutely exceptional and our men\u2019s business is coming around which last year our men\u2019s business we weren\u2019t as happy with. So we\u2019re starting to see some terrific progress there, which bodes well for Father\u2019s Day.", "So we\u2019re pretty excited about that. That\u2019s basically this year versus last year, what\u2019s happening, along with a couple of new categories which I won\u2019t mention. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research", "Wondering, the provision for incentive comp and how that effected SG&A in the first quarter compared to last year, was there a material basis point shift year on year. ", "Jeff Naylor", "No not really because it wasn\u2019t until really into the later part of the second and the third and the fourth when we started booking heavier incentive comp impacts. It really didn\u2019t have any basis point impact at all on G&A this year versus last year. Because that impact would have come later in the year. ", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research", "And as far as your leverage point buying and occupancy expenses, where is it currently and where should it be headed as we move deeper into the year and we begin to see an acceleration in new store openings. I would presume that you\u2019ll require somewhat higher leverage point later on. ", "Jeff Naylor", "We kind of look at it for, we tend to look at the leverage point for total expenses rather than splitting it. The buying and occupancy SG&A split is something we do for the external reporting. Internally we look at our business merchandise margins and expenses, our expenses the leverage point typically its sort of in the low 3\u2019s, 3, 3.25 in that range. What we\u2019ve done over the past is that we have enough cost reduction though that we\u2019ve been able to reduce the leverage point down to 2.5% or slightly below and we\u2019ve done that again this year as you can see from the full year guidance, we\u2019re getting leverage at 2 and 3 comps more than you\u2019d ordinarily, a little bit more than you\u2019d expect given 3, 3.5% inflation rate. ", "In terms of B&O as we go through the year we do have an impact in the back half from, we combine these because we\u2019ve got new store openings that in the back half of the year we think have about a 10 to a 20 basis point hit that we\u2019re taking and that\u2019s primarily from the costs that we incur prior to opening the stores. ", "But that\u2019s got about a 10 to 20 basis point impact in the back half of the year. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company", "If I go through your gross margin guidance for the year, it clearly indicates a slow down, does that, I understand the occupancy deleverage, but will you also see merch margins decline as you lap those really tough comparisons with your progress in the back half of last year. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "We\u2019re definitely planning the back half more conservatively. ", "Jeff Naylor", "On the merchandise margin in the back half its essentially flat is where we plan the merchandise margin to LY and that\u2019s what\u2019s implied in the guidance. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Could you talk about the European business, the non-domestic businesses and how their four wall contribution is different US to Canada, Canada to the UK and then UK to Germany and if you would comment also on Poland as well. ", "Jeff Naylor", "We\u2019re not public on the numbers per say but the four wall profitability in our core UK business is pretty comparable to Marmaxx. HomeGoods and A.J. Wright are slightly below where Marmaxx is but still at levels that give us very strong returns on invested capital and as we mentioned before A.J. Wright\u2019s four wall contribution is increased significantly over the last four years and is actually above the level we need to have a model and have the confidence to roll that business out. ", "When we look at Germany its early days right because we\u2019ve got four or five stores in Germany that are two years old and we\u2019ve got four stores in Germany that are one year old. And we\u2019ve got another 15 stores that are just beginning their second year. What\u2019s interesting is we\u2019re seeing contribution margins not that far below T.K. Maxx, T.K. Maxx is UK stores.", "And we\u2019ve commented on that, that\u2019s one of the things that really makes us excited about Germany, that we\u2019ve seen sales in an average store in Germany comparable to the UK. The stores are a little bit smaller so they tend to be a little bit more productive. We\u2019re seeing turns in gross margins very comparable to the UK. ", "And so the four wall economics in Germany have really surprised us on the upside which is why we\u2019ve gone and we\u2019re going as aggressively as we\u2019re going. What that matures to its hard to say because we\u2019re dealing with four wall contributions now that are points below the UK but there\u2019s still a lot of maturity ahead of us in those stores that could in fact bring that store contribution margin up to the UK levels and maybe even beyond. ", "Poland is just too early to say, our stores in Poland have been open for six months now. We like what we\u2019re seeing but I think its too early to comment on four wall contribution margins until they lap their first year. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "And I also might add that HomeGoods four wall contribution has increased significantly so first quarter things are, its been tremendous. So we believe that there may be some additional growth in terms of store count in HomeGoods in the future. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice ", "David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice ", "Another question on the merchandise margin, in terms of the initial market that you\u2019re seeing how do you see that trending going forward, in terms of the pricing of the goods that are available. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "There\u2019s a lot of talk about cotton prices increasing, wool prices increasing, any increase obviously to us is beneficial and that if your average ticket goes up, its beneficial to us in terms of costs through our DC\u2019s, comps, all of that. And I keep coming back to our job is to gap between where everybody else is and where we are. ", "So whether the cost for apparel is finally not deflationary but inflationary it will certainly benefit TJX. If you\u2019re asking about the quality of the goods in the marketplace I think we\u2019re feeling very good about it. ", "Ernie Herrman", "I think we said it before, I think the availability we\u2019re obviously excess inventory driven, the availability is across all categories. The challenge still is to hold back the buyers mainly in this company so it goes in waves sometimes but the wave recently has been just like it has every other quarter which is we\u2019re having to hold ourselves back based on the amount of goods out there. ", "So that is always a good sign in terms of mark-up which I think you\u2019re asking about, initial mark-up, I think that bodes well for the future. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "We are hearing production increasing a bit, so it will be interesting to see what happens in the back half. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I just had a follow-up on the foreign business, not so much on the contribution but let\u2019s say the pre-tax margin plan, I think in past calls you\u2019ve given kind of a long-term 9% to 10% range, are you still comfortable with that number or do you see upside to it. ", "Jeff Naylor", "We\u2019re comfortable with that general range. With the UK we\u2019ve, we originally thought that was an 8% to 9% business, that\u2019s a business that was almost at 9 last year with still store growth ahead of it and as we grow UK we can leverage the cost in the UK against the growth in Germany, Poland, and other countries that we may enter. ", "So, and with the strong contribution margins we\u2019re seeing out of Germany yes I think we continue to feel comfortable with that range.", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "And with our investment we\u2019re still for the year feeling that the European businesses will certainly again have a positive on pre-tax. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair", "Just quick question on the near-term comp outlook May to June and then following up on the back half specifically May to June with the weather being unfavorable year to year in May so far I think a lot of companies have talked about that, and then June flipping, do you think that that June forecast could maybe be meaningfully conservative being just a point or so higher especially if you layer in the July 4th shift too, and then looking at the back half obviously recognizing that the rate of growth last year was phenomenal, was there anything that you felt that was like one-time in nature that would cause you to have, recognizing this is your internal plan for budgeting but that would cause you to have like flat to slightly negative comp expectations internally, or for budgeting or because, other than just very very strong results and market share gains last year, anything else that causes you to be incrementally more conservative. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "First of all for June I guess I\u2019ll just answer it by saying I hope so. And then as far as the back half goes there is nothing going on on a one-time basis at all. I think its very, very prudent to plan the back half conservatively and our whole goal initially for the year, we are going off of a very aggressive year not to plan the back half conservatively I don\u2019t think would be a smart thing to do. ", "So as always we strive to beat our plans. I think we have a lot of initiatives going. I obviously personally would not be happy if we didn\u2019t beat those plans. But I really think it\u2019s the right thing to do and it\u2019s the right way to plan the business. ", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair", "Okay so it comes down to just the outsize level of growth last year as opposed to anything kind of on a current year basis. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "Absolutely, from day one I really wanted to get the back half planned flat to down and I think we\u2019re in a great place. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Tubin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Howard Tubin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Can you tell us, I think you said in the past that over the last couple of years the percentage of your upfront buys verse off price buys has been shifting towards off price buys, is that true and is that still the case here in the spring season. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "We\u2019re pretty flat in terms of percentages and we\u2019re in a pretty good place. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Congratulations. Can you talk a little bit more any more color on the operating margins by division as you had such good progress this quarter, do you see going forward in the forecast is it gross margin, is it SG&A, and is it different by division where you get the leverage points and just lastly the marketing spend, what are you seeing there and magnitude of change as we look to the second half of the year.", "Jeff Naylor", "I think as we look on a full year basis, so we aren\u2019t providing a lot of specific guidance but I think in terms of color this year versus last year on a full year basis we continue to, we believe that the segment margins will be up at Marmaxx. We believe they\u2019ll be up at Canada, Canada if you recall we had a currency hit last year so we would expect that to be up. We\u2019re expecting Europe to be flat to slightly up full year and that\u2019s with the investments we\u2019re making in the three new businesses. ", "HomeGoods is clearly up and A.J. clearly up and as I mentioned for the total company for the full year the pre-tax margin up 30 to 60 basis points and that\u2019s really coming from a mix between the gross profit margin and some SG&A leverage for the full year. That\u2019s kind of a quick snapshot of how the full year guidance looks. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "And marketing spend is slightly up but the impressions are very aggressively up for the back half. So you\u2019ll be seeing a lot of us. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Congratulations, great quarter. I know there\u2019s obviously plenty of inventory here in the United States but with the stronger dollar is there an opportunity to buy overseas and does it make sense at all to buy overseas more aggressively and ship some of those goods back here and are there pockets across the fleet and across the categories that make more sense to do this, so maybe its not apparel but maybe its home or handbags or something like that, if you could talk a little bit about that. ", "", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "First of all we have a huge office in Italy, we have people on the ground in India. We have people in China. We have people in the UK. We have over 100 people in Germany and everybody does buy together so we leverage the corporation so we are absolutely, which is part of what we talk about when we say we\u2019re really a supply chain company. ", "We take advantage of all of it. If we have to pay in euros, and pounds, or dollars, we do it, whatever is advantageous. So we absolutely are taking full advantage of that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research", "Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research", "Question on Europe just wondering if you would comment what you\u2019re seeing there currently with sort of all the mess over there, have you seen a change in momentum in your business there. I guess just circling back to what you said about TK for Q1, can you repeat how you know it was weather in addition to your own execution and I\u2019m just obviously kind of zeroing in on the economy there. Can you explain, did you say its top line and bottom line neutral FX in the back half and then lastly just on May, if you\u2019re not expecting any real shift from Memorial Day then is the decline you\u2019re forecasting in May on the two year is that really all the weather you\u2019re seeing now or are you also being conservative there. ", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "First of all last May was our highest comp in the quarter that we\u2019re up against so between that and the shift I think that\u2019s the way we should be planning it and we are. In terms of the UK you can always ask the question is it weather or is it execution, the UK obviously the economy was pretty bad a year ago. They got hit as dramatically as the US did so I really, as I hate to use that as an excuse, there\u2019s very clearly categories that are working that read to weather. We know what the mix was. We know how we transitioned and it was completely the opposite weather pattern of a year ago.", "And we also know the things that we do in terms of execution and what we can fix. Having said that they did have a drop in sales in the UK to plan but their margins were pretty much the same so they did a pretty good job of that and that\u2019s by keeping lean inventories. ", "So my answer to that is that I think that some of it is our own doing and some of it is the weather. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever \u2013 MKM Partners ", "Patrick McKeever \u2013 MKM Partners ", "You mentioned that 75 to I think you said 80% of the gross margin improvement in the quarter was merchandise margins, wondering how that just that differential has changed over the past few quarters. If you look back to the back half of last year for example how much of the gross margin expansion that you saw was due to merchandise margin improvement. ", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, I actually don\u2019t have those numbers here in front of me, I apologize. Last year given the strength of the comp in the back half I would have expected that we would have had more buying and occupancy leverage than we\u2019re showing. Right now we had a 10 comp in the back half which would have, particularly the 12 comp in the fourth quarter we would in all likelihood would have seen more buying and occupancy leverage then we\u2019re seeing right now. ", "But I apologize, I just don\u2019t, you stumped me with the one question I don\u2019t have the numbers in my book. So we\u2019ll have to respond to that offline. ", "Patrick McKeever \u2013 MKM Partners ", "And then you talked last year a fair bit about opening up new vendors at a nice clip and I\u2019m just wondering if that same thing is true today. I know you\u2019re always opening up new vendors but do you feel like that momentum that you saw with opening up new vendors last year has continued into 2010.", "Carol Meyrowitz ", "Yes it has and as a matter of fact we are hitting a lot of new countries so we are seeing that and again I just think its making the mix very, very eclectic and interesting. So that continues to happen. We\u2019re very pleased. I want to thank everyone and we look forward to giving you the Q2 results and thank you again.

We believe it's important to point out that this was achieved on top of successive EPS increases over the prior year, 27% last year, which was on top of 26% the year before and 27% the year before that.", "Also noteworthy is that we drove these year-over-year results in both strong and weak retail climate, which points to our consistency and ability to grow the top and bottom lines in various economic environments. This continues to reinforce the power of the TJX model.", "I will keep my comments brief today, beginning with a recap of our second quarter performance. Then I will share our outlook for the back half of the year and why we are confident in the sustainability of our top and bottom line growth. Finally, I will reiterate our long-term goals for our global growth.", "Before I continue, let me turn the call over to Jeff to recap the numbers for the second quarter.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, thanks Carol. Good morning, everyone. So let me recap second quarter results. Our net sales reached $5.1 billion, that's a 7% increase over last year. The second quarter consolidated comp stores sales increased 3% and I should point out that's on top of 3% to 4% increases in each of the past four years.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.74 compared with last year's $0.61 per share. EPS benefited from a reduction in the provision related to the previously announced computer intrusions, which positively impacted EPS by $0.01 per share during the quarter. And if were to exclude that benefit, diluted EPS was $0.73, which is a 20% increase over last year. Year-over-year EPS growth for the quarter was positively impacted by foreign currency rates by approximately $0.01, but a higher tax rate adversely impacted EPS by $0.02, so that's a little bit on quality of earnings.", "Consolidated pretax profit margin was 9.8%. That's up 110 basis points over prior year and that includes a 20-basis point positive impact from the intrusion provision benefits that I mentioned earlier. On an adjusted basis, excluding that benefit, pretax margins were 9.6%. That's up 90 basis points over the prior year. These were also \u2013 I should mention that pretax margin was also above the high end of our original guidance and that was primarily due to merchandise margin favorability.", "Turning to the gross profit margin, that increased 100 basis points above last year during the quarter, reflecting strong merchandise margins, as well as some buying and occupancy leverage.", "SG&A expense increased 10 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. And you will recall on our Q1 conference call that we told you we expected SG&A to slightly de-lever and that was due to the cost of opening more new stores, we have 33 new stores this year versus last year; the impact of our younger European businesses on cost ratios; and increased spending in our stores organization to enhance customer experience and support our growing customer base. And essentially, that's what we saw. If we were to exclude these factors, SG&A leveraged 10 basis points, which is about what we would expect on a 3% comp.", "As to inventories, at the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis including the warehouses were down 13% on top of a 4% decrease last year. Clearly, the lower inventories and faster turns are driving lower markdowns, resulting in higher merchandise margins. At Marmaxx, our total inventory commitment, including the warehouses, stores, and merchandise on order, was down versus last year on a per-store basis.", "Finally, let me talk briefly to the financial strength. As many of you know, our stores generate substantial amounts of cash, which we deploy with a careful balance between reinvesting in our businesses and distributing excess cash to shareholders through the buyback and the dividend.", "In terms of share repurchases, we bought back $356 million of TJX stock during the second quarter, retiring 8.2 million shares. We continue to expect to repurchase between $900 million and $1 billion of TJX stock for Fiscal 2011.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Carol and I will return at the end to recap our guidance for the full year and the third quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Jeff. I would like to get straight to my major points. First, as I just discussed, our strong second quarter results, year-over-year growth demonstrate the consistency of TJX. Second, we have excellent opportunities in the back half of the year and we will utilize our extreme flexibility to capitalize on them. And third, we have tremendous long-term global growth potential.", "First, some comments on our second quarter. In particular, I want to address the results of", "T.K. Maxx in the U.K. and Ireland, which were weaker than we expected and we know have been a question on peoples' minds. I want to be clear that the miss at T.K. Maxx was our own doing, even though the low customer confidence in the U.K. has not helped.", "As we have previously mentioned, the issue began early in spring when we did not transition into warm weather products as well as we could have and the unfavorable weather patterns exasperated our own issues. We then did not execute well in a few categories. I attribute this issue to minor growing pains [ph].", "Our merchant organization in Europe is growing and learning, and typically when newer buyers are added, there are some missteps and some overcorrection. It's important to understand that this is nothing we haven\u2019t seen before and addressed before at our other businesses. In fact, we used the first half of the year to add talent in Europe which included moving the COO of TJX Canada to lead the U.K. and Ireland business, as well as several planners from the U.S. to Europe.", "In addition, we have our TJX University in Brussels up and running in order to train our associates in Europe. But also we are pointing out that historically the back half drives about 85% of TJX Europe's annual profits and our comparisons to last year of this division does become easier.", "I also believe that our merchandise mix will be more compelling. TJX Europe is fundamentally a very strong business. We are very encouraged that our growth vehicles, T.K. Maxx Germany and Poland and HomeSense in the U.K. continue to outperform our expectations and we expect these businesses in the aggregate to generate meaningful profit in the back half of the year.", "While we planning TJX Europe back half comps to be only flat or up slightly, we expect to deliver approximately 15% to 20% segment profit growth. We still very much believe in Europe.", "Now, to some other callouts in the second quarter. Marmaxx, HomeGoods, and TJX Canada all delivered exceptional sales and profit growth. A.J. Wright strategically ran its business with very lean inventories in the second quarter versus much higher levels of clearance last year. And although we did not get out of summer very early \u2013 sorry, although we did get out of summer very early which caused us to miss some sales, our segment profit for the second quarter improved over last year and has doubled year-to-date. Importantly, we are very clean going into the fall season.", "Lastly on the quarter, customer traffic was up significantly over large increases last year as our great values and great brands continue to attract customers and increasingly numbers from a broad demographic spectrum. Importantly, our customer research indicates that most of these new customers are continuing to shop our stores. In addition, we will be spending a large portion of our marketing dollars in the second half of the year when we face challenging comparisons, which represents a substantial increase over last year's spend.", "Let's move to our outlook for the second quarter \u2013 for the second half of the year. As we outlined at the beginning of the year, comparisons to last year become more challenging in the back half when we are up against a 10% consolidated comp store sales increase. These comparisons are also much more challenging than those at most retailers.", "We expect comps to be flat to slightly down in the back half, while we still expect EPS to be flat to up 6%. At the same time, we have many initiatives underway and as always, we will strive to beat these numbers.", "Let me recap some key differences in our businesses versus a year ago, which should help us in the back half. First, I am very happy with the quality and quantity of our inventory. Although our inventories are very lean and planned down versus last year, the quality of our inventory and our brand penetration is substantially better than last year in nearly every category of our business. In addition, I am very excited about the fashion trends that we believe will make the back half really exciting. As always, we will stand for tremendous value.", "Second, in terms of marketing, we will have significantly higher penetration in the back half and even stronger campaigns than last year. We are increasing our television impressions on a global scale being on TV in Europe for the first time in several years. And we will significantly increase our media spend in the U.S. market versus a year ago.", "Third, we have many customer-facing initiatives underway to retain and attract new customers. Over the last year and a half, we have been remodeling and opening Marmaxx stores in the new prototype and will have about 700 stores completed in the new prototype ahead of the important holiday selling season. This is great as we are seeing sales lift in the remodeled stores.", "Fourth, on a macro level, we are hearing about late merchandise deliveries to other retailers, which typically benefits us. We will stay very liquid in order to capitalize on all of these potential opportunities. This is great as we are seeing our average ticket begin to flatten out which could be meaningful to our business. As always, we will remain laser-focused on maintaining our price gap with traditional retailers so that our values are as sharp as they can be.", "And finally, we believe we have opportunities to further improve our markdown levels versus the first half. We enter the back half with inventories significantly lower than last year, turning even faster, giving us the ability to reduce the markdowns and drive merchandise margins. I want to reiterate that we are planning our in-store inventories leaner than last year. So you can see that we have many exciting things happening across all of our businesses and we will be positioned to take advantage of the great opportunities in the marketplace.", "Now, I would like to recap the elements of our exciting long-term global growth plan. As we recently announced, we plan to bring Marshalls to Canada in the spring of 2011. Our Canadian business unit achieved our highest financial return.", "Further, the success of operating T.J. Maxx and Marshalls in the U.S. demonstrates the concept can be effectively differentiated and work very well in the same market. And we have already had success in rolling out HomeSense in Canada. We know the Canadians level of price and many certainly know the Marshalls brand. We believe that Canada could probably ultimately support 90 to 100 Marshalls stores.", "We remain confident that we can ultimately grow from our nearly 2,800 stores to date to over 4,300 stores long term. This now includes Marshalls in Canada, but importantly, does not include the addition of new countries or markets or the launch or rollouts of new concepts.", "As we stated, we are prioritizing investments this year in Marmaxx and TJX Europe. HomeGoods and A.J. Wright continue to have excellent long-term potential and we may accelerate growth at these divisions next year. Note that HomeGoods will deliver a segment profit of over 9% this year.", "Before closing, I want to cover a couple of other points. First is our flexibility. We believe we can react faster than just about any retailer of our size to changing customer tastes and macro trends.", "For instance, you may be surprised to learn today, on a consolidated basis, approximately half of TJX's business is non-apparel in categories like footwear, accessories, home, and many others, which is a significant shift from five years ago. This is no accident. This is what we do and why we can achieve such consistent success. We think very strategically, we anticipate market trends, and go after opportunities with very short lead times. Our no-walls business model enables us to rapidly adjust our merchandise mix, our categories, and our store floor. This aspect about our company is very often underappreciated, especially for a company of our size.", "Further, we are working on many new initiatives to make us even faster and we still have ways to be more flexible for the future and expand margins. One of our big rock initiatives is improving our supply chain and further elevating our planning and allocation abilities. As good as we are in this area, we are very focused on becoming even sharper and more precise in shipping the right goods to the right stores at the right time to drive inventory turns and merchandise margin. I still believe we have plenty of room to improve over the next few years.", "So in closing, our strong second quarter and consistent sales and earnings growth over time demonstrates the power of our business model to deliver multiple year-over-year increases on top and bottom lines in both strong and weak economies. While we expect comps in the back half to be flat to slightly down, we always strive to exceed our expectations and we plan to capitalize on our many opportunities.", "The differences in our businesses versus a year ago give me great confidence in our ability to drive results. I am convinced that our increased brand penetration, heightened marketing, customer-facing initiatives will continue to attract and maintain new customers from a wide demographic reach.", "Additionally, we see macro factors that should play to our strength. We continue to run the business with extremely lean inventories which could drive merchandise margins. Longer term, we have tremendous opportunities to grow our brands at home and internationally. I believe that the retailers that will win both in the short and long term are those that can truly offer the consumer the best value with the right product and the best fashion and brands. This is what we at TJX pride ourselves in doing and we will continue to work even harder at pleasing our current and new customers.", "Now, I would like to turn it back to Jeff to go through guidance and then we will open it up for questions.", "Jeff Naylor", "Great. Thank you, Carol. So now to our guidance. As we noted in our press release today, we raised the guidance for the full year. The new guidance calls for EPS to be in the range of $3.28 to $3.38 \u2013 $3.28 to $3.38 and that's up from our previous guidance, which was $3.24 to $3.33. This raise in guidance is driven by a couple of factors. One is the improved pretax margins that we are expecting. The second is a greater benefit from the buyback than we originally planned in the back half.", "Additionally, the revised guidance includes the second quarter reduction in the provision related to the computer intrusions, which will have an estimated $0.01 per share impact. So if we exclude that item, the new estimated range of EPS is $3.27 to $3.37 and that's an increase of 15% to 19% over last year.", "This range of EPS for the full year is based on comp store sales in the 2% to 3% range and reported pretax margins of 10.2% to 10.4% including the intrusion provision benefit. So if we exclude the intrusion provision benefit, the adjusted full year pretax margins are planned at 10% to 10.2%. That's up 40 to 60 basis points over prior year.", "In terms of the components, we now expect gross profit margins to be up 40 to 50 basis points over prior year, primarily due to strong merchandise margins, as well as some buying and occupancy expense leverage and SG&A ratios that are flat to slightly favorable.", "Let me now discuss the back half guidance. As Carol mentioned and we have discussed on prior calls, our comparisons to last year become more challenging in the back half. So accordingly, we are planning comps in the back half to be flat to down 1%. However, we do expect earnings per share for the back half to be $1.75 to $1.85 and that's flat to up 6% over last year's $1.75. It's important to note that foreign exchange rates are assumed to negatively impact year-over-year EPS growth in the back half by about $0.30. So the growth rate is actually a bit better on a constant currency basis.", "Now, I will shift to the third quarter. For Q3, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.91. That's a 6% to 12% increase over the $0.81 per share that we earned last year. Again, it's worth noting that this assumes foreign exchange adversely impacts year-over-year growth by $0.02.", "Some of the components. We are assuming a third quarter top line of approximately $5.5 billion with the comp sales increase of zero to 2% both on a consolidated basis and at The Marmaxx Group.", "As to monthly comps, on both a consolidated basis and at The Marmaxx Group, we are planning comp sales to be up 1% to 3% in August, down 1% to up 1% in September, and flat to down 2% in October when we have the most difficult comparisons.", "Pretax profit margins are planned in the 10.4% to 10.8% range, which are flat to down 40 basis points compared with the 10.8% last year. This guidance includes an anticipated 20-basis point negative impact from mark-to-market currency adjustments on the company's inventory related hedges.", "We are anticipating third quarter gross profit margin in the range of 27.1% to 27.4% and that's down 10 to 40 basis points compared to last year. Gross profit comparisons are adversely impacted by 20 basis points due to the hedges I just mentioned. Merchandise margins are assumed to be slightly up and buying and occupancy expense is assumed to slightly de-lever on the flat to 2% comp increase.", "In terms of SG&A, we are anticipating that, as a percentage of sales, it will be about 16.4% to 16.5%, which is a flat to 10-basis point improvement versus last year. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 38.3%, which is essentially in line with last year. We are also planning net interest expense in the $10 million to $11 million range, corporate expenses in the $44 million to $46 million range, and weighted average shares of approximately $404 million for the quarter.", "We will now open it up for questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to keep the call on schedule. We are going to continue to enforce our one question limit and we appreciate your cooperation with that.", "So thank you and we will open it up for questions now. Go on.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). One moment please for the first question. And the first question today is from Stacy Pak.", "Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hi, Stacy.", "Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research, Inc.", "Hi, guys. How are you?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Good.", "Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research, Inc.", "Carol, a question just on the industry in July. I mean, it seemed like as the industry got more competitive you guys didn't compete quite as well and I am hearing about weakness in some other off-price businesses. And I am just kind of wondering what happens going forward here?", "We have got rising inventories in the industry. I know you can benefit from that, but you also want to maintain a differential versus the industry. What can you do? Are you going to cut prices more? What are you seeing? And if you could weave in also some commentary on apparel, where you are seeing strength and maybe where you are seeing some weakness that would be great. Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "How many questions was that?", "Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research, Inc.", "One big one.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. First of all, Stacy, I think in terms of July, I am actually very pleased. I think we strategically kept very lean, we didn't keep summer too long. In most of our divisions, we may have lost a little bit of sales, but I think that our profit was pretty strong. We drove our home business and we certainly did keep our apparel business pretty lean, and that was the strategy.", "So in terms of going forward and what's going on in apparel, we think that we are starting off feeling pretty good. We got a lot of areas that are working, we have a strong dress business, a strong career business, we are certainly seeing a lot of fashion going on. So we are feeling pretty positive about that.", "Our concern about our values versus everyone else, I think we are in pretty shape and I think our inventories are in fabulous shape and we will take advantage. We competitive shop every day, it's part of our life and what we do, and I think we are feeling pretty good about our values. And Ernie, you want to comment on that?", "Ernie Herrman", "Stacy, I would just I guess focus in on the \u2013 what's going on. I think with the inventories, you were talking about are on the board. We are just looking at that as potentially an opportunity later to ensure the values, because generally we buy in relationship to the inventories that are out there. So I think that will be another opportunity probably about a couple of months away.", "Stacy Pak \u2013 SP Research, Inc.", "Okay. Well, good luck, you guys.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Evren Kopelman.", "Evren Kopelman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Great. Thank you, good morning. You commented on the merchandise mix that over the years it has changed where half is not apparel any more. Can you talk a little bit about how that has impacted your merchandise margins? How do the merchandise margins for accessories or home or footwear compare to apparel?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Now, we don't break it down. But the real point is the flexibility of our business. So if tomorrow all of a sudden there were categories in apparel that were very strong, we would be shifting our mix. And really the concept here is again \u2013 is being open, the flexibility of our floor, changing our floor, changing our mix, and going after what the consumer wants. So again, we take advantage of the margins by buying closer to need and focusing on the customer and turning our inventory quickly.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, the \u2013 if I could just jump in, the margin differential between categories within our business just isn't that great. It's not like department stores where you make up very significant variations between categories. Our categories tend to be not that different from one another, so mix shift usually don't impact margin to the extent they might other retailers.", "Evren Kopelman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Stein.", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research LLC", "Okay. Carol, a little bit of pushback on your comp store sales assumption. You are \u2013 you consistently have been talking about the fact that average ticket is beginning to kind of level out and at the same time you are talking about the significant growth in traffic year-over-year. So when you put it all together, how do you come up with flat to negative comps?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, Jeff, as you know, we certainly will strive to beat that. We always are fairly conservative. It helps us keep our inventories very lean, but I can assure that we will attack this as vigorously as we always do and hopefully, we will beat those numbers. But I think it's very smart and prudent to go out on a more conservative note.", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research LLC", "So it would be more for planning purposes rather than what you hope will eventually produce positive comps?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, we always try to plan a little bit conservative. But having said that, we are certainly up against tougher numbers. I mean, we see some areas such as traffic that we think can increase. We certainly see opportunities, which I sort of outlined in my speech, marketing \u2013 we are doing a lot of things to drive the business. But again, we think it's smart to plan this way.", "Jeff Naylor", "Jeff, if you look at a two-year stacked comp, you would say the back half pretty much aligns up with the front half. On a three-year stack, you might say there is a little bit of opportunity. So we will see.", "I think Carol is right, there is a lot of things we are doing to beat the numbers. But I think when you look at two and three-year stacks, they are crazy numbers in the back half. They may look a little on the conservative side, but we are also up against big numbers, as Carol said, and there is a lot of potential volatility in the economic environment, right? So I think we are just \u2013 I think it's safe to be a little bit cautious and position inventories and costs around numbers that you have a level of confidence in.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And hopefully, we are conservative.", "Jeff Naylor", "We won't know until the end of the \u2013 year whether we were or not.", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research LLC", "Jeff, one question on the mark-to-market hedges. How much did that help Winners during \u2013 or Canada during second quarter and how much do you think it will hurt in Q3?", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, I think if you look at the mark-to-market for Winners in the second quarter, it helped them by \u2013 I just want to give you the basis points here \u2013 by the way, if you look at the web table, that will \u2013 the table that we have out on the web, that will help. But I think we were up 410 basis points roughly on a reported basis. I'm sorry, we were up 440 basis points on a reported basis. We would be up 270 basis points currency adjusted, so it was about a third of the margin improvement.", "I should point out it negatively impacted T.K. though. So T.K. Maxx, where we reported \u2013 TJX Europe where we reported $2 million of profit, it would have been $9 million profit if it weren\u2019t for currency. So it helps the comparisons in Canada, but it hurts them in Europe, but again about a third of the profit declines we saw year-over-year in Europe came from currency in the second quarter.", "As we go forward, in the back half of the year, last year we had \u2013 generally speaking, we had mark-to-market gains in the back half. So we are not going to repeat those gains. So it ends up being a little bit of a headwind in the back half, Jeff. But that's just built into our number. I think we said currency was going to cost us roughly $0.03 in the back half.", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research LLC", "Got it.", "Jeff Naylor", "And most of that's mark-to-market gains we had last year that won't repeat this year.", "Jeff Stein \u2013 Soleil-Stein Research LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "Good morning. With regard to the average ticket, I guess, where are you seeing the greatest change? It sounds like it hasn't been a major difference, but moving toward flat, it \u2013 is it more units per transaction, is it number of items per basket, if you will, or is it price or mix playing into it? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, it's basically our transactions. Our basket was slightly down, our transactions have been slightly up. But obviously, the ticket is reaching a little bit more of a flattening out. So it remains to be seen in terms of transaction and average basket in the back half.", "But our ticket flattening out, which is usually positive for us, in addition obviously on the cost structure, it's positive, because it \u2013 again, it will certainly help our DC costs and our OPH. So it's only positive for us, we think, going forward. It remains to be seen, I don't know if the basket will continue to be slightly down. We still think we have room to transaction.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "Okay. I guess my question was just even within the average ticket change, to the degree that it's getting toward flat, what's driving that?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It's really across the board. And again, it's not a change so much in mix, but it's across the board. Now, remember, last year we were dramatically down.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "Right. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Adrianne Shapira.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hi, Adrianne.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi, good morning. Just a question on the marketing. Perhaps you could share with us, it sound like increased penetration, increased impressions. Perhaps some quantification in terms of the ramp and spend there. And then, Jeff, if you could reconcile, it sounds like on the SG&A you are planning for flat to some leverage in the third quarter so help us think about when this stepped-up marketing spend will hit the back half. Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, the marketing spend, it's about 20 basis points, Adrianne. But again, qualitatively, we think it's much stronger. Not only are you going to have a lot more impressions, but the quality of what it is, is a lot stronger than last year. In addition, what I am really excited about is the last time we were on TV in Europe was in 2006. So that's going to be very positive for us.", "Jeff Naylor", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. And then \u2013", "Jeff Naylor", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So in terms of some of the puts and takes that you described in the third quarter that will continue into the fourth?", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes. Adrianne, if you look at Q3, I think there is a couple of factors that are going on here. First of all, the \u2013 we get a benefit, because you'll recall we had incremental bonus expense last year, so that becomes a benefit to the SG&A, and we also have cost savings. And then those are partially offset by deleverage that you would expect on a zero to 2% comp, as well as some investments that we are making in our bench and in our stores organization really to try to continue to improve the customer experience to retain all the new customers that brought into the stores.", "So you put all that together, we are flat to up 10. On advertising, most of the impact is in the fourth quarter, as Carol mentioned. We have a slight uptick in the third quarter, most of the increase is in the \u2013 into the fourth quarter. But that's a third quarter reconciliation you are looking for.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Jeff Naylor", "And it's a similar story by the way if you look at the full back half. The only difference being is that you have that advertising deleverage.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So in terms of some of the puts and takes as you described in the third quarter, that will continue into the fourth?", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes. If you look at the \u2013 as you look at the fourth quarter, the same puts and takes. You actually get a little bit bigger bonus \u2013 benefit from the bonus. We also had a contribution to the TJX Foundation last year that we made. So you get a bigger benefit there and you have costs savings and those are offset by the natural deleverage and on a minus 1 to minus 2, as well as a higher level of advertising spend.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Slater.", "Jennifer \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Hi. It's actually Jennifer [ph] for Todd. Congratulations on another good quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Jennifer.", "Jennifer \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "A quick question on the U.K. I guess, could you talk a little bit more specifically about the issues there? I mean, I get that you didn't transition well into warm weather categories in the spring, but I assume that that would clear up in a couple of months. So then what happens? And when should we expect that to turn? Did you say that comps would be flat to slightly up in the second half and did you say margins \u2013 sorry, go ahead.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Now, we are planning the comps fairly conservatively for the back half. And as I said before, you got to remember that more than 85% of their profit is done in the back half. So we feel stronger about the mix. There is some growing pains in the U.K., but we feel very, very strong. We've got to be balanced about this business. I mean, they have had four years of very, very strong track record. And I think this is the period of time that I think we are going to certainly see a positive in the back half. This is a business that is still going to do 6% to 7% segment profit.", "And, again, I think we are being prudent in conservative \u2013 in conservative comps and planning. But again, we are going to do everything to beat those comps. So I think they are just going to get stronger and stronger. A lot of new people in place, we have the University up and running. So they have some growing pains.", "Having said that, if I \u2013 someone said to me, would you have done the number of stores you did, would you have done it the same way. I would say absolutely, because not to take advantage of the real estate deals that we did and we will continue to do would be a mistake for the medium and the long term for TJX.", "So \u2013 again, I want to be very careful to keep this balance. We have got three new concepts that are certainly going to be making money in the back half and that's \u2013 we are talking about a three-year period of time.", "Jennifer \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "All right, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick.", "Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi. Congrats as well. So trying to look beyond the second half of 2010 here, it looks like Marmaxx is going to end the year around a 13% segment margin. You look back at your Analyst Meeting in October, I think you said your targets were around 11%. So just curious, what do you think are the permanent margin gains that you have made over the last few years? Obviously, some of that is from the comp leverage, but you are clearly running an inventory strategy that's different today than it was.", "So just curious, will you update your margin target for Marmaxx now that it's above? And then also looking beyond the back half, is your footage plans for Europe changing given the near-term execution? I think we have 65 new stores for next year. Thanks very much.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Brian, in terms of Marmaxx, we are learning \u2013 all of TJX is learning every year how to run our inventories better and I have set a big initiative in shipping the right goods to the right store. And we do have a big investment in the supply chain. So I don't know what the ultimate is. Again, I think we have been very, very good on \u2013 in the way we handled and improved our business year-over-year. But I still think that we have opportunity.", "So we will look at Marmaxx and we will certainly look at the model and every year \u2013 Marmaxx has run over the last \u2013 many, many years flat to up in margin. And we will continue to do so and hopefully, there is some more opportunity there. But I believe that there are places that we can still get better.", "In terms of Europe, we still want to be aggressive with Europe. We have got most of our heads in place and we have got our infrastructure in place and we will continue to enhance that. But the basis there, we still see tremendous real estate deals. Poland is off to an exceptional start. Germany's average store does what the U.K. does, which is phenomenal. Our four-wall contribution in Germany and Poland are well exceeding plan, as well as HomeSense.", "So we are going to continue on track to be very aggressive for next year and probably be around the range of the 65 stores.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, we will give you all of that, Brian, on the \u2013 when we put our plans in place. We are currently developing them and we will provide those, as we always do on our end-of-year conference call.", "And I guess just one point of clarification. We are not at 13% \u2013 if you do the math, it's about 12.5%, Brian. I think, it \u2013 part of the way we got there was by comps, you leverage your G&A down. Those G&A ratios don't go back up unless you comp below a 2%, 2.5%. And we have gotten a lot of improvement in merchandise margin. A lot of that's come from markdowns and lower inventories and we are going to maintain those lower inventory levels and continue to turn them fast.", "So I think the things we have done are largely sustainable. So we feel pretty comfortable. We will have to figure out what our formal guidance is here. Every time we put a range around Marmaxx, it exceeds it. So more to come there. But I think very comfortable, we can hold the margins \u2013 the pretax margins at the current rate.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think the other thing is that we have added more stores and we do see Marmaxx as having over 2,000 stores, which was not probably the way we were thinking several years ago. In addition, where we are opening real estate, like we had seven stores in New York City, those are big volume stores. We are seeing opportunities to go in places that we may have thought possible, not as easily obtainable in the past. So that is also an advantage going forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Weiner.", "David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes, hi. Good morning. Just to follow-up on the European question in terms of \u2013 just a two-parter. In terms of the beneficial rents that you are seeing, is that mostly in the UK or is that in Germany? I think you have talked about that as in Germany as well on department store rationalizations and things like that. Just the second part of it would be, I think as a secondary reason for the weakness in the U.K. T.K. Maxx, you have called out that the U.K. consumer may be showing some weakness. Have you seen that weakness in the German or any other European countries as well? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. No, we really haven\u2019t seen it in Germany and the real estate opportunities are truly all three countries, in the U.K., Germany, and Poland. And that's why we want to continue to take advantage of it. Germany and Poland are very, very healthy. But again, I think Europe, we can do a better job. So a piece of it is certainly we own and I think we can do a better job with it. We don't really like to look at the economy and use that as an excuse for our business. It really hasn't been in the past and shouldn't be in the future.", "David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Marni Shapiro.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great first half of the year and good luck in the back half.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Marni.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "You are welcome. Could you talk a little bit \u2013 I am very interested in this non \u2013 in the non-apparel. Are you seeing this trend across just the United States in Marmaxx or is this true for A.J. as well, is it true in Europe? And are there any non-apparel areas that have surprised you to the positive that are worth digging deeper into?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "The trends are pretty similar across the different divisions and in terms of non-apparel areas, you know I won't talk about that. You will have to yank out my teeth.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Thought I would ask. (Multiple Speakers)", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Quite a few interesting tests going on and as you know, we are a great laboratory of 2,800 stores. So we will continue to maximize our categories today and certainly new ones that we are testing.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "And a quick follow-up in Canada for Marshalls. Are you using the same team for Marshalls U.S. to buy into Canada or are you leveraging off of Winners? How is that working as far as the team from Marshalls Canada?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Ernie?", "Ernie Herrman", "Marni, we will be leveraging off of the Canadian TJX associates out there. So there would be really executing. But at the same time, like we do with everything, we always talk about no walls. Our merchants partner up here with the Marmaxx team, the vendors. I mean, there is a lot of collaboration. But it is driven by the Winners team up there.", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker", "Great. So it doesn't have to \u2013 it doesn't necessitate an entire new team? That's fabulous. Great, guys. Congratulations.", "Ernie Herrman", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Champine.", "Rob Simone \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Hi, guys. This is Rob Simone in for Laura. She is out of the office. You guys gave guidance for Q3 in terms of your merch margin and your B&O leverage. Do you \u2013 can you comment further on what you are looking in those areas \u2013 looking for in those areas in the back half of the year? Thanks.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, sure. So if you look at the back half of the year, we would expect our gross profit margin to be down about 40 to 70 basis points. Most of that is going to be B&O deleverage on the flat to minus 1% comp. We are planning slight merchandise margin decline, although as Carol said we are obviously going to try to beat that. We think that's a prudent way to plan it given the significant increases that we had last year. And there is about a 10-basis point hit from the mark-to-market hedges.", "So you put that all together, you get a down 40 basis points to a down 70 basis points. But again, most of that's going to be B&O leverage on the \u2013 buying and occupancy leverage on the flat to minus 1% comp.", "Rob Simone \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dana Telsey.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Good morning, everyone.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hi, Dana.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Hi. As you take a look at the real estate opportunity, you have mentioned it before, Carol, is it as good as it has been? And are the returns on the stores different from what they were in the past? Second, just on the merchandise margin opportunities, is it by category or by concept that you are seeing any differences? And when do we hear about any of those new concepts I think that had been previously mentioned? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. Well, Dana, all of your question, we don't usually give answers to. So let me start there. The real estate returns are really exceptional and very, very strong across the board from both the U.S. and the U.K. and Germany and Poland. So we are still seeing that, a little less so in Canada. I have to say of all our areas, that's probably the place where we are not seeing as big an advantage. How long it will last? We really don't know. We are trying to take advantage. We say seize the day, so we will certainly do that.", "In terms of merchandise margins by category, we really don't talk about that and we really don't know. We are wide open, we are off-price, we have a whole back half; we think there is going to be some tremendous opportunities and we will see what categories they are in as we get a little bit closer.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question is from Sandra Barker [ph].", "Sandra Barker", "Yes. Could you talk a little bit about the evolution of your thoughts about why Marshalls make sense in Canada and why you need a different concept there?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Sure. First of all, we don't do anything without a tremendous amount of research. So we have spent a very long period of time talking to the consumer, doing our research to understand if we can support Marshalls in Canada, and we feel very, very good about doing it. We also will differentiate it dramatically as we do T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. So \u2013 again, we think we have opportunities there.", "Lastly, it is our most profitable division and we think in terms of the TJX portfolio, it will only be very positive and accretive.", "Jeff Naylor", "I guess, to state the obvious, it's worked well in the U.S. having two concepts and we find our customer cross-shops and we don't think it's going to be any different in Canada, particularly with \u2013 as Carol mentioned, we are going to go in with a very high level of differentiation. So we are really comfortable the market opportunity is there and looking forward to opening our first six stores this year.", "Sandra Barker", "Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I want to thank everyone and we look forward to the third quarter and we will speak to you then.

Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you, Elan and good morning, everyone. And before we get started, Sherry has a few comments.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially.

Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis.", "Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website, www.tjx.com. As a reminder, the comparable store sales numbers that we talk about today are on a constant currency basis.", "With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today's press release and posted on our website, www.tjx.com in the Investor Information section. ", "Thank you and now I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Sherry and good morning, again and joining me on the call today with Sherry are Jeff Naylor and Ernie Herrman.", "Let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with our 14% EPS growth in third quarter on top of 40% EPS growth last year. We drove this growth on a 1% comp increase over 7% increase last year demonstrating the power of our business model to deliver sustainable margins even at a lower level of comp. Our customer traffic was up over huge increases last year and we achieved these results despite average tickets still being slightly down. We continue to run the business with lower levels of inventory, which is driving faster inventory turns and stronger merchandise margin. We are very confident that this is sustainable. Further, we delivered these strong results despite unfavorable warm weather in September and October. We entered the fourth quarter with very lean inventories and even more open to buys for the quarter than we had at this time last year. This set us up extremely well to buy into the exciting opportunities we are currently seeing from great brands and fashions in the marketplace. I'll keep my comments brief today starting with the recap of our third quarter performance. ", "First, I want to spend a moment on why we believe in the sustainability of our margin and how our supply chain improvements play into that. Next, although we are not going to get specific until our year-end call in February when we have finalized our plans, I will share with you some of our thinking about growth for next year. We continue to look for 5 to 6% square footage growth but currently plan to get there a little differently. I'll wrap up with our outlook and opportunities for the holidays and the fourth quarter. ", "Before I continue let me turn the call over to Jeff to recap the numbers for the third quarter. ", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, thanks Carol. Good morning, everybody. Let me recap the third quarter results. Net sales reached $5.5 billion, that's a 5% increase over last year. Third quarter consolidated comp stores sales were up 1% on top of last year's strong 7% increase and as Carol mentioned the increase was driven by growth in the number of transactions with the average ticket slightly down.", "Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.92. That compares with last year's $0.81 per share and again, that's a 14% increase on top of last year's 40% EPS growth. Foreign currency rates negatively impacted our year-over-year EPS comparisons by two pennies. However, EPS comparisons were favorably impacted by a lower tax rate and reduced interest expense which, together essentially offset the foreign exchange impact so all those items in aggregate were neutral to the overall consolidated performance.", "Our consolidated pretax profit margin was 10.8%. That was unchanged from the prior year. However, if you exclude the impact of foreign currency, primarily a mark to market adjustment on the company\u2019s inventory related hedges, our pre-tax profit margin was actually up 30 basis points. And we're very encouraged that we've sustained last year's significant increase in profit margins and that we've seen continued improvement in our merchandise margins over last years large increases. ", "The gross profit margin, as we reported today, it was flat to last year. Higher merchandise margins, as well as buying and occupancy expense leverage were offset by the impact of mark to market adjustments on the company's inventory related hedges which, as I mentioned earlier significantly benefited last years results. I think the key point there is that our merchandise margins continue to be up and these merchandising margins were achieved. The merchandise market gain was achieved on top of a 240 basis point improvement in the third quarter of last year. ", "Turning to SG&A expense for the quarter it was also flat to prior year. If you peel it back the benefit of cost savings initiatives and lower incentive compensation expense were basically offset by deleverage from the 1% comp store sales increase as well as increased preopening costs associated with a larger number of new stores this year versus last year. That said, our overall expense ratios if you include buying and occupancy costs, along with SG&A, decreased during the quarter compared to last year. ", "As to inventories, at the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis including the warehouses were down 6% on top of a 5% decrease last year. Again, we're extremely happy with our inventory levels and our greater open to buy position as we enter the fourth quarter. ", "Now to financial strengths. Our stores generate substantial amounts of cash, which we deploy with a careful balance between reinvesting in our businesses and distributions to shareholders through the buyback and through the dividends. ", "In terms of share repurchases, we bought back $256 million of TJX stock during the third quarter, retiring 6.0 million shares. Year-to-date, we have bought back $845 million of TJX stock. We now expect to repurchase between 1.0 and 1.2 billion of TJX stock in Fiscal 2011, more than we had originally planned.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Carol and I'll recap the guidance for the fourth quarter and full year at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Jeff. Now to some comments on the third quarter, which again clearly demonstrates that our strong margins are sustainable even on a lower level of comp. ", "First, I want to discuss our disappointing results at T.K. Maxx in the U.K. and Ireland and how we are addressing the issues there. As we discussed in our last conference call I believe that the weakness of T.K. Maxx is entirely about execution. Our merchandise mix got a bit too moderate and we lost some of our value equation. We did take aggressive markdowns in the third quarter which is what we do when we misstep. We clear out and move on. We're on a learning curve at T.K. Maxx mostly due to the newness within our buying ranks, as we are adding and teaching our new talent to support the growth of the business. ", "In short we have gotten off track and need to get back to basics. The great quality, great fashion, great brands and great values this division is capable of delivering. ", "I expect that we will continue to experience some of these growing pains in the fourth quarter and we are looking for improvement in the first half of next year. Our U.K. and our Ireland business is fundamentally very strong and over the four preceding years has driven comps in the mid to high single-digits and grown segment profit margins over 8%. I have every confidence that we will get back on track. ", "We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new European businesses. T.K. Maxx in Germany and Poland and HomeSense in the U.K. In the aggregate, these businesses were close to breakeven in the third quarter and we expect to be profitable in the fourth quarter and the back half. I want to emphasize that we remain very confident in our European business and the opportunities that Europe presents to us for enormous growth for the future. ", "Continuing on the third quarter with our U.S. businesses, Marmaxx achieved a very strong 13% segment profit margin, up 50 basis points over last years record results. Marmaxx drove this profit growth on a 1% comp increase versus the strong increase last year, demonstrating our margin sustainability even on a lower comp. Merchandise margins were up 40 basis points in the third quarter, over last years strong 270 basis points increase. Merchandise margins at Marmaxx have increased steadily in the last 10 years, largely due to the structural changes we have made in our business to run at substantially lower inventory. We believe we have even further room to improve in this area, which I'll discuss in a moment. ", "HomeGoods continues to deliver strong top and bottom line increases over record results last year. It's important to note that this division lowered its inventory level more than any other division in 2009, which changed the face of this business in a very positive way. Operating with lower inventory has continued to pay dividends this year. Our mix is more exciting. Our values are sharper and our margins are stronger than ever before. Additionally, this organization is doing a great job with marketing the HomeGoods brand. HomeGoods is reaching record segment profit with profit margins that are well above what we initially anticipated for this business. ", "While A.J. Wright\u2019s third quarter performance was disappointing, we believe it was predominantly due to the negatively impacted weather. With its heavy concentration of stores in the Northeast, A.J. Wright was disproportionately impacted by the warm weather in September and October. To illustrate this, less weather sensitive non-apparel comps were 10 percent points higher than apparel costs. And outerwear, which is a significant category for A.J. Wright, was down 21%. I should also mention that this division was up against an l1% comp increase last year. We took aggressive markdowns in the apparel areas, which left us with a very liquid position as we enter the fourth quarter. ", "Moving to Canada, TJX Canada continued its excellent year with comps up 3% and segment profit margins up 200 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign currency. I should mention that Canada also had unseasonably warm weather during the quarter and their results were driven by exceptionally strong comps. Customer traffic has been very strong in Canada. The continuation of strong trends at Winners and HomeSense bodes very well for our previously announced plans to bring Marshalls to Canada next year. ", "Now let's talk about how important lean inventories are to driving sustainable margins and what we see as further opportunity in our supply chain. The improvements we made to our supply chain last year to run our business with historically low inventories is leading to sustainable strong margins as evidenced by our third quarter performance. As we continue to run leaner we are turning inventories faster and buying closer to need, which is reducing markdown and leading to sequential improvement in our merchandise margins. But while we hear a lot of discussion out there about the favorable buying environment benefiting us last year, we believe that our strong 2009 merchandise margin performance is far more a function of our improved inventory and management. In addition, as lean as we are I still believe we have opportunities to bring inventories even further down and deliver fresh goods even faster to our customer. ", "One of our big rock initiatives is investing in our supply chain to enhance our planning and allocation capability as I discussed on prior calls. While we're already very good in this area, I believe we can become even more precise at getting the right goods to the right store at the right time. We see a lot of opportunity in this area in the next few years, which is an important reason for our confidence in our ability to provide continued top and bottom line growth. ", "I mentioned at the top of the call that I'd share some of our thoughts about growth for the next year. We're still planning on a 5 to 6% square footage growth but we believe will achieve it a bit differently than originally planned. We intend to slightly slow growth in Europe to give this business time to get back on its very solid track and give new talent time to season.", "By year-end we will add a net of 54 stores in Europe this year and we took advantage of amazing real estate opportunities that we are confident will benefit our business long-term. While slightly slowing the pace in Europe we intend to accelerate growth a bit next year at Marmaxx and HomeGoods, which are achieving consistently strong performance. With increased store profitability with Marmaxx, we now see opportunities to open more stores at this division than we originally thought we could. Therefore, we intend to pick up the pace of growth slightly at Marmaxx next year. It's important to note that we have excellent visibility and for the level of capitalization from new stores and are achieving sold ROIs after (inaudible). ", "We're also very excited about our store openings in Manhattan this fall, which I'm sure most of you have seen and been in. They were superb and they demonstrate the potential for more stores in urban locations. With HomeGoods consistent performance and strong profitability we also see opportunities to grow this store chain. Long-term we believe we can roughly double the number of HomeGoods stores. So at HomeGoods we intend to accelerate growth next year as well.", "We remain confident that we can ultimately grow over 2,800 stores today, over 4,300 stores long-term. This growth reflects only our current concept in our current markets now, including Marshalls in Canada. It does not capture the addition of new countries or new concepts. The areas of our business will be our prioritizing investments are performing very well and we're very confident in our long-term growth plans for TJX. ", "Now to our outlook and opportunities for the fourth quarter. Like the third quarter we are up against extremely strong comparisons in the fourth quarter that are much more challenging than those facing most other retailers. We are guiding our comps in the fourth quarter to decrease 1% to 3% and EPS to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.94, which would be flat to down 5% versus last year. There are a number of factors that give us confidence in this fourth quarter performance. As always, we will strive to beat our plan and there are a number of factors. ", "First, we just reported a very good third quarter on top of a 40% EPS growth last year despite unfavorable weather. ", "Second, we entered the fourth quarter with very lean inventory. I like the quantity and the quality of the product we're seeing in the marketplace, which is superior to last year. I believe our brand and fashion penetration is even higher than it was a year ago. ", "Third, our marketing will be even more powerful than last year with higher penetration and heightened campaigns. We are on network TV this month compared to no network TV in November last year. In the fourth quarter, we will be upping our presence on network TV and in addition we are showing triple branded commercials for the first time for T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods. You'll be seeing them very shortly and we're very excited about it. ", "Fourth, we now have about 700 Marmaxx stores in the new prototype. We are seeing sales lift in these stores, which bodes very well for the holiday season. ", "And lastly we have lots of merchandising initiatives for the holidays but of course I cannot share with you for obvious reasons. We have great opportunities to drive sales and margins this holiday season and we will be pursuing all of them.   ", "In closing, our strong third quarter overall results demonstrates our ability to deliver sustained sales and profit growth. We achieved 14% EPS growth over record results last year, which is in line with our long-term annual EPS growth model. Importantly, the factors driving this profit growth are sustainable. We have significantly improved our inventory management capability and are investing in the supply chain to run even faster and even better. Further, we have reduced our cost base and have additional cost reduction opportunity, which we believe will enable us to maintain our cost leverage point at a 2% comp. I feel very good about our business as we enter the fourth quarter. As the weather cools down in November sales momentum picked up.", "Our inventories are lean and clean. I am sure that we are one of the very few retailers out there that is buying in November and December for the holiday and we love it. We believe that value will continue to be uppermost in the consumers mind this holiday season and we will be flowing exciting gift giving selections in many categories throughout the season. ", "Additionally, we plan to deliver more freshness this December than we ever have in the history of the company. We have many initiatives to drive sales and margins in the fourth quarter, including heightened marketing and upgrading our sales. We are planning our business appropriately over challenging comparisons to last year and at the same time I like the trends that we're seeing. ", "TJX has proven year after year in good and bad economies that we do deliver. This year we expect to continue our record of only one negative comp in over 30 years and are sustaining profit margin growth. I'm excited about our opportunities and very confident in the continued successful growth of our company. ", "Now, I'd like to turn it back to Jeff to go over guidance and then we will open it up for questions.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes. Thanks Carol. Before I cover guidance, a quick comment on Canada. As you can see on the reconciliation tables that we provide on our Web site, the segment profit margin in our Canadian business this quarter was reported down 140 basis points. It would have increased 200 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign currency primarily due to the mark to market adjustment that they benefited from last year. In segment profit growth for Canada, which was reported essentially flat to last year in the quarter would have been up 18% on an invested basis. ", "Okay, so with that out of the way let me now turn to the details of our guidance. First thing I want to make a point of is we haven\u2019t adjusted the fourth quarter outlook that was implied in our prior guidance but we have raised the full year guidance to reflect the above performance in the third quarter. We now expect full fiscal 2011 EPS to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.40, excluding the non-operating item, which we detailed in today's press release, the estimated range of EPS is $3.33 to $3.38, an increase of 17 to 19% over last year. ", "In terms of the underlying assumptions the range is based on an expected comp store sales increase of 2% to 3% for the full year. It also assumes reported pre-tax margins of 10.2 to 10.3%. Now if we exclude the non-operating item I just mentioned the adjusted full year pretax margins are planned at 10.1 to 10.2%, up 50 to 60 basis points over prior year and that's primarily due to continued strength in merchandising margins as well as some buying and occupancy expense leverage and SG&A ratios that are flat to slightly favorable to last year. So that's the full year.  ", "Our full year outlook assumes fourth quarter EPS of $0.89 to $0.94, which would be a flat to a 5% decrease versus last year and again is unchanged from our prior outlook. In terms of the underlying assumptions we're assuming a fourth quarter top line of 6.1 to 6.2 billion with comp sales planned to decrease 1% to 3% on a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx group. Again, we're up against very challenging comparisons to last year when consolidated comps increased 12% and Marmaxx's comps increased 13% during the quarter. We're looking for average tickets to be flat to slightly up in the fourth quarter. ", "As to monthly comps, in November we expect comps to increase 2% to 3% on a consolidated basis and 3% to 4% at the Marmaxx group. In both December and January, on both the consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx group, we expect comp sales decreases in the ranges of 3 to 5%. ", "Pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 9.6% to 9.9% range, down 80 to 110 basis points over last years very strong 10.7%. We're anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margin to be 25.4% to 25.8% compared to 26.6% last year. It's important to note that we're up against a 410 basis point improvement last year and are planning this appropriately with the reduction evenly split between buying and occupancy de-leverage on the negative low single-digit comp and our merchandise margins which are slightly lower than last year. ", "We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 15.7% to 15.8%, which is a flat to a 10-basis point improvement versus last year. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 38.8%, net interest expense in the 8 to $9 million range and corporate expenses in the 51 to $54 million range. ", "Finally we anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 399 million. ", "We'll now open it up to questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to keep the call on schedule. We're going to try to continue to enforce our one question limit and we appreciate your cooperation. Thanks. We'll take questions now. I'll turn it back to Elan. ", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our first question today is from Adrianne Shapira.", "", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just on the acceleration of the Marmaxx square footage, maybe Jeff, if you could give us a little bit more quantification on the cannibalization you're seeing, maybe some of the new space productivity, kind of give us the confidence that there is, that makes sense in terms of the acceleration there to get to the 5 to 6% next year. Thanks. ", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, on the cannibalization, we aren't public on the level of cannibalization Adrianne, but what I can tell you is that we estimate cannibalization for every new store, every new store we do a pro forma analysis of that new store. We estimate the sales, we treat the lease as capital and then we estimate the cannibalization of surrounding stores and we put all that together to calculate or turn on ROI, which typically is in the low to mid teens. So within those ROIs we make sure we can afford the level of cannibalization on the surrounding stores. And then we go back and we measure that level of cannibalization and what we've found is that our estimates are actually very, very good. We tend to be very close to the level, to the cannibalization estimates are very close to what we actually incur in that first year where the new stores impacting the existing stores so we feel that between charging cannibalization to the new store pro forma, making sure that we're getting a low to mid teen ROI including that cannibalization and then going back and measuring the cannibalization to make sure our estimates are on track. That gives us the confidence that we are growing our business profitably and preserving our financial returns.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "", "So could you perhaps break that in terms of the 5 to 6% square footage growth? How much will be coming from Marmaxx, HomeGoods acceleration versus the slower rate European growth next year?", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, we're not ready to do it at this time because we are still developing our plans for next year but we will be doing that on our February call later.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Holdings, Inc.", "Hey, thanks guys. Just wondering about your outlook for A.J. Wright? Has anything changed in terms of your long-term view in terms of the number of stores you think that concept can have and is there anything you can share I think us on the growth plans for A.J. for next year or your outlook for the fourth quarter? Thanks. ", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Paul, what\u2019s important with A.J.'s is now I want to see more consistency and so we're going to take it slow and we can afford to take it slow so I think we want to get, we want to see consistency quarter by quarter and then we'll start to accelerate. So we still believe in the same number of stores that we put out there but we will be conservative in terms of number of stores.", "Jeff Naylor", "Okay and if I could just touch on the guidance briefly? For the fourth quarter we are planning A.J. comps flat to plus two. That's on an 8% last year so like every one of our businesses they take some tough comparisons and on that we're planning profits essentially flat year-over-year. You know when you look at the full year for A.J. we think we've got profits planned up roughly 3, 4, $5 million versus LY for the full year continued increased in profit margins. It'll be about a 2% total profit margin compared with break even two years ago so we're continuing to make progress with A.J. although as Carol said, it's been a little bit uneven and we want to see some consistency before we really ramp up the investment.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Holdings, Inc.", "", "So does that mean no store growth at A.J. next year?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We'll probably keep the number probably around 10, in that range.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes, keep consistent with what we did this year. ", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Holdings, Inc.", "Gotcha. Thanks, guys. Good luck.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick.", "Brian Tunick - JPMorgan", "Thanks, congrats. I guess two quick ones. Jeff, just trying to understand 300 basis points swing at Winners? Can you just maybe help us understand it a little more on the off margins segment and sort of give us some color on how you're thinking upon Q4? And then on product cost inflation talk about how you think that impacts your business as we look at next year, it doesn't really feel like on the cost side but can it help you if department stores take up pricing under your umbrella?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Brian, let me answer your second question and then Jeff can go on to the Winners numbers. Everybody's hearing huge increases in cost and prices and everything else and we are moving from a slightly down ticket to a slightly up ticket, which is, we're certainly positive. We look at all of this as a positive because we're all about the consistency between us and everybody else out there. So we take the inflation piece again as a positive move for our business and what we need to do is just make sure that we're competitively priced correctly and we will be. So we see the effect in our business more of a positive than a negative.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes and Brian, where it was a question about the third quarter, that swing?", "Brian Tunick - JPMorgan", "Yes, exactly. What's happening? I didn't see the currency move?", "Jeff Naylor", "No, the issue was it wasn't so much in translation. Its two impacts, two international businesses. One is translating the results from the local currency into U.S. dollars. The other of these mark to market impacts where we hedged, we hedge our inventories so when we place an inventory buy it's based upon evaluation and we hedge it to lock in our margin. At the end of the year, each quarter under the accounting rules we have to mark those hedges to market. So, you may have a gain or a loss in the derivative but you also have an offsetting gain or loss in the margin of the goods. We only recognize one side of that for accounting purposes. ", "So last year in the case of Winners we had $19 million of benefit from mark to market adjustments. That was last year in the third quarter. This year it was essentially diminutive. So basically we had $19 million of benefits last year that we did an anniversary this year. So that impacted both the profit growth and has had a significant impact on the operating margin. So that's how you get from 140 basis points decline this year on a reported basis to a 200 basis point improvement because there was almost a 3.0 points of margin last year that benefited to Winners that came from this mark to market adjustment.", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Evren Kopelman.", "Great. Thank you. Question if you can get into the issues a little bit more in Europe? So, one question there is the terms there is, the turns I believe, the inventory turns are very quick which makes me wonder why maybe you don't anticipate some of the issues to be fixed a little more quickly? And the second question is your inventory strategy has worked so well at Marmaxx, at HomeGoods and maybe have you, not implemented there, maybe talk about the inventory strategy as well for the U.K. business? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Actually Evren I'm very happy with the inventory strategy in Europe and it's really not about our turns. It's truly about the mix and we got off-track and we got very moderate, our average ticket was way down and this is definitely fixable but I'm certainly not going to look at the month of November and say that we can turn this business around on a dime because it does take a little bit more time than that. They know what they've done wrong. I think there's tremendous clarity. I think they have a great strategy in place. We can certainly afford to take the period of time that we need to take to get this organization to where they need to be but I think next year is going to be a good year and I feel good about it but it doesn't turn on a dime.", "Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Stein.", "Jeff Stein - Soleil-Stein Research LLC", "Sure, wondering if you reallocate capital and open more units domestically? Are there enough locations available to meet your plan and can you also talk about the kind of lift you're getting from the remodels and how many you have yet to go?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay, well Jeff we don't really talk about our list so I'm not going to go into that but we're certainly happy with it. In terms of the real estate we feel we are semi ready to lay our next years plans. The acceleration in both Marmaxx and HomeGoods, we have absolute locations and we are in very good shape. We don't accelerate until we know we can. So we're pretty pleased with the real estate and we're in very good position to again, move that up a bit and then just be a little more conservative on Europe. We're in a very good position.", "Jeff Stein - Soleil-Stein Research LLC", "And how many, Carol, how many remodels do you have yet to go in Marmaxx?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well we have 700 to date but those are big remodels. We'll continue next year with the fairly aggressive remodel program. Some of it will be full store, some of it will be just painting and cleaning up but we'll continue to make this chain a top-notch chain.", " ", "Jeff Stein - Soleil-Stein Research LLC", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Champine.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company", "Good morning. It looks to me as if you're comp guidance is better than what I would have expected for November, a little worse than December and January? Can you talk about what's happening? I know your comps get tougher but is there anything else that's pressuring the comp expectation in that December, January timeframe? ", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well Laura, I mean December in Marmaxx were up against the 15 comp so I think it's prudent for us to plan the way we did. In January I think we're up against 13 or is it 14, Jeff?", "", "Jeff Naylor", "Just checking. We're up against 13 I believe.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "", "Yes, now is there an opportunity on a two year basis possibly, but quite frankly we've never gone up against comps like that before so we will do our absolute best to beat them but I think it's smart to plan that way and to keep our inventories nice and lean.", "Jeff Naylor", "Yes. We're up against 14 and a 12 in TJX and a 15 and a 13 in Marmaxx in November and December respectively and I think, if you look on two and three year stack bases you'll see it's a pretty consistent in terms of how we laid it out Laura. And there's nothing else that (inaudible), there's nothing else under; it's really just a factor of what we're going up against in terms of how we accept the plans.

Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks very much, guys. A couple of quick questions. In the past you've spoken about acquisition opportunities, could you comment on that, where you stand on that subject and also the Internet initiative that we've heard about overseas?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well Richard, we don't talk about acquisitions and the Internet overseas is going quite well. We're pleased with it. We're moving slowly. Again we have three countries Internet, we have a lot going on there but we're very pleased with what we're seeing. We're learning a lot about the consumer. We're learning a lot about what categories sell so this to me is fantastic in terms of our learning and our knowledge and maybe some day we'll bring to the States.

Just I guess a question particularly given your strong track record doing better relative to guidance. For the fourth quarter if coming out of the quarter if there's one or two key things that might enable you to end up ahead of your EPS guidance, would it be do you think customer traffic, continued merchandise margins coming in better than your guidance, what do you think would be one or two key things that?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think it's really our inventory positioning right now. We're very lean. We love what we're seeing and as I stated before our percent of freshness in December and January is much higher than last year, which just creates a lot of excitement. Our merchants are still in the market. We're going to be in later than we've ever have before so I can't answer all your questions because who knows what\u2019s going to happen in the next three months, in the next three weeks even before the Christmas season starts but I love the position we're in so those are really the two factors.

Our next question is from Todd Slater.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Hi, it's actually Jennifer for Todd. A couple of quick ones. First, Jeff could you talk about, I think you said you were planning fourth quarter average ticket flat to slightly up so are you already starting to see that? And then secondly could I get a little clarification on guidance? Carol, you talked about that sustainability of margins and I mean we clearly believe that and I think that third quarter results prove that and you're planning inventory down and it is down going into the fourth quarter but yet I think you're planning merchandise margins down so is that just based on being conservative or I guess maybe could you address how should we think about Marmaxx margins in the fourth quarter? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "", "Jennifer, I mean we're planning the margins, again we're up against huge, huge numbers a year ago so I'm just going to come back to I like to plan prudently, carefully, conservatively and we certainly hope to beat those plans. I just think it's a smart way to plan our business. ", "", "Jeff Naylor", "", "Yes, I think on the, in terms of planning the tickets flat to slightly up, obviously we try to plan based on what we're seeing and we have visibility into our on orders of some of the trends and our plans kind of do reflect what we're seeing. So I think we're reasonably confident in that flat to slightly up and it is reflective of trends we're seeing in the business. ", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Good luck.", "Jeff Naylor", "Thanks.", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Glick.", "David Glick", "Yes, good morning. I just wanted a follow-up on the T.K. business. I was just wondering if you could give us some, help us understand how your trend there is performing across different parts of the U.K. and Ireland and then are you succeeding in Germany and Poland despite some of these execution issues or are they also being impacted by the assortments? I'm just curious if that's been, had any impact or do you think you can do better in those new geographies? ", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well actually our business again, we're pretty pleased with Germany and Poland and HomeSense. And in the aggregate all three of them are going to end you making money in the back half, which we\u2019re very, pleased about. Again, having said that I still think there's much opportunity there and as we get the overall mix to a place where we feel terrific that's only going to accelerate Germany and Poland and HomeSense. Europe, it is pretty much across the board and I'm going to come back to, we know what we did wrong, we know what we need to do and I was just over there this past week and the guys know how to fix it. So I think we've just got a little bit off track and I think we were running a bit too quickly to fill (inaudible) and they now know exactly what to do. We have a lot of people who have been there for many years. They\u2019re spending time with the new people and I feel very confident that this team will turn it around.", "David Glick", "Okay. Carol, if I could follow-up on your comment on inflation being a positive? Can you help us understand here which elements for that environment make you feel optimistic? I mean is it the higher, potential higher average tickets? Can you maintain a merchandise margin in that kind of environment or is it just value becomes more of a premium as the pricing umbrella lifts in the department store channel?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Again, we keep coming back to our job is to keep the distance between us and the department stores and obviously as pricing goes up, the consumer is still going to want value. It's not like we're looking at an economy that's getter 10 times better so it bodes well for us because it's, everyone else goes up in price and we go up proportionally in price. I think it's really going to drive the customer to us. Average ticket going up obviously is a benefit to our comp and it's certainly a benefit to our costs. So, that's all we focus on is making sure we have that great value versus everyone else and this entire organization is very aware and very much on board. ", "The other element of our business again, I just keep coming back to flexibility is that we can move categories faster than anyone else can. Move our floors around faster than anyone else can so we take advantage of all those elements. Any disruption or change in the marketplace usually tends to benefit us and every year there's usually something else going on and our job is to take full advantage of that for TJX.", "", "David Glick", "What's driving the improvement in Q4, you know, product availability or quality and quantity? Is it late shipments from China? Is it the inventories have gotten a little bit, not out of whack, but a little bit higher in the department stores? What do you think the drivers are?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It's a piece of it. That's a piece of it. Another large piece of it is that we continue to invest in our supply chain; our number of buyers are all over the world and our relationship with the brand. So all of those elements make us keep, we're always raising the bar in our mix and that's what our job is. ", "David Glick", "Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter.

Carol as you look out to 2011 in terms of inventory, do you think there's still opportunities to reduce inventories or should we expect inventories to maybe flatten out next year?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No we think there's opportunities to reduce inventory. We absolutely do. There are two elements to this. We're speeding up our supply chain at the same time as decreasing our inventory levels and creating more freshness so we're investing where we need to invest. In addition we will get better at shipping the right merchandise to the right store at the right time so. I don't know how many years we have of improving but it's not a one-year pony as they say.", "Jeff Naylor", "And there's still variability between our divisions Howard. Not all divisions are turning at the pace of the fastest division, which tells you there's probably a little bit of opportunity left.", "Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it.

You talked a little bit about the multi brand marketing. I was curious where that leaves A.J., are they included in that or are they their own entity and if you could update us on European marketing?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "A.J.'s is separate and the demographics of Marshalls, Maxx and HomeGoods is really a sweet spot to triple brand together. So we're testing that. You're going to see that very shortly. We're very excited about it. That'll be on network TV. What we're also hoping is that it really brings the consumer closer to being aware of the HomeGoods brand as we improve, as we increase the numbers of stores in HomeGoods, I think this is really going to be beneficial if we hit new markets. So that's the game plan there. As of today, we don\u2019t have A.J.'s as part of that campaign, but hey, you never know.", "Mami Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Well that makes sense. Well good luck for the holiday and any opportunity does it mater at all, what happened to Loehmann's for you guys or do you feel guilty about putting them out of business again?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "There's always real estate opportunities.

Our next question is from Dana Telsey.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Good morning, everyone and congratulations. Can you talk a little bit about, you've had, going into the holiday season in past years you've talked about the increased emphasis on marketing spend? What opportunities do you see in marketing spend in this year and then next year and the other element on expenses you've talked in the past about reduction opportunities in procurement? Is that still the case and is there a change in the comp increase you need to leverage expenses? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, Dana in terms of expenses, we're slightly above where we thought we would be. I think we gave you 50 to 75 million, we're probably half way through some of the initiatives but we're always adding initiatives so we're going to continue on our expense reductions. Our marketing spend, again we'll, we look to get greater and better penetration so we haven't laid out our plans. We're certainly not going to be looking at our marketing budget and saying let's increase it dramatically. We just hope to get smarter and smarter which is what we believe we've done this year. So we'll continue that, we'll continue that path and where we believe we need to up (inaudible), we will but its not a matter of looking at a tremendous increase in spend for next year.", "Jeff Naylor", "And Dana in terms of our three-year model we have on the street right now. We're assuming at 2% comp leverage point and we believe we have enough cost saving initiatives to allow us to do that for the next several years. So as Carol mentioned beyond that we're trying to put some seeds in the ground now that will take us beyond three years out and give us the ability to continue to leverage at a two comp. We really like setting up our model on a low comp, putting in enough cost reduction to allow us to maintain our  profit margin and then, if and when we beat the sales you get tremendous flow throughs and we've seen that each of the last three, four years. So we want to continue to plan that way.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our final question is from John Morris.", "John Morris", "Thanks. My congratulations as well. Drilling down a little bit deeper on the marketing spend, Carol I'm just wondering is there much of a mix or can you give us the mix shift between TV versus Print and other, are you spending a lot more on TV? I'm kind of wondering what's going there and then on A.J. Wright, you know you talked about the weather disappointment, I'm wondering is, it sounds like it was hitting A.J. a little bit more than some of the other businesses, excluding T.K. obviously separate issues? Is not the other business sort of have the same kind of weather component to them, is it that much of a geographic difference but also weather aside for A.J. where are you seeing the progress and where are you seeing the improvement at A.J.? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I'm going to answer a couple of questions and then Ernie's going to chime in.", "John Moore ", "", "Great.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "First of all when we talk about Winners, which probably had weather. They had an opportunity in their home business because they had a fairly weak home business a year ago. So that increase was fairly substantial in Home up at Winners. And as I said in A.J.'s the outerwear business, which is a bigger part of A.J.'s business was down substantially over 20%, which was a big hit and there are some other factors there that Ernie will go into. In terms of our marketing we don't discuss that, that's really not our strategy. So I'd rather not comment on our percent of mix. What I an tell you that we continue to increase on network TV and we continue to increase the penetration. It is increasing in traffic and we do see the needle moving every single year that more customers or more people that have never shopped TJX that is increasing every year so that that is our goal.", "John Moore ", "Yes, that's what I was getting at. ", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Do you want to talk a little bit about A.J.?", "Ernie Herrman", "John, real simply on A.J. one of the things that happened there was obviously based on where we're Northeast Chicago driven on the real estate locations we did not do a good job on transitioning so we had I think, we were a little too deep in some categories, a little too dark and the weights weren't really as appropriate as they should have been and I think Carol actually mentioned some markdowns in apparel so really that's the gist of what I think was a self inflicted execution issue at A.J. We did take our markdowns, we're in a better position now for the fourth quarter and we're going to learn from that. ", "John Moore ", "Yes. That's great. That's great. But Carol, also the progress in improvement, you guys clearly have made a good degree of progress at A.J.

Welcome to the TJX Companies Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] ", "I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer for the TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Holly. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, Sherry has some comments.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning.

Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release in the Investor Information section of our website, www.tjx.com. As a reminder, the comparable store sales numbers that we talk about today are on a constant currency basis. With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today's press release and posted on our website, www.tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "In addition, we have posted in that section reconciliations of guidance with respect to non-GAAP measures to guidance on a GAAP basis. Thank you and I'll turn it back to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Sherry. Joining me on the call is Ernie Herrman, whom as you know was promoted as President of TJX last month. It's terrific to have Ernie take on a bigger role with the company. I couldn't be more pleased with this new management structure, which further strengthens our leadership team to continue to grow TJX successfully. Also joining me with Ernie and Sherry is Jeff Naylor. ", "I'm proud to report that we delivered a 23% increase in adjusted EPS in 2010, particularly because it was on top of an adjusted 48% increase in the previous year. This marks the 15th consecutive year of EPS increases. We drove this profit growth on a 4% annual comp increase over a very strong 6% increase last year. What continues to give this company the ability to post these increases year after year in good, bad and in-between times and even over very tough comparisons is the extraordinarily flexibility of our business model. ", "One of the most impactful ways we used our flexibility in 2010 was to run with leaner inventories than we ever have in the past. This gave us fast returns and growth in merchandise margins over large increases the year before. We believe that there is still room for further improvement in running with even leaner inventory, as well as fine-tuning our shipping of the right goods to the right stores at the right time. We will continue to invest significantly in our infrastructure for both the short and the long term. ", "In addition, our customer traffic was up mid-single digits over huge increases last year, as our great brands and values continue to attract new and existing customers. This tells us that whether we are in recessionary times or recovery, value remains a constant top-of-mind priority with consumers. ", "I will keep my comments brief today. I'll focus on the sustainability of our strong top and bottom line growth, as well as our long-term vision to grow as a global off-price retailer. Before I continue, let me turn the call over to Jeff to recap our full year and fourth quarter results.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Again, I want to emphasize that we will be referring to adjusted results throughout today's presentation. Reconciliations between GAAP reported and adjusted results are provided in today's release, and are also on our website. ", "So now to recap full year fiscal 2011 results. Net sales reached $21.9 billion, which is an 8% increase over last year. Consolidated comp store sales were up 4% on top of last year's very strong 6% increase. The growth, as Carol mentioned, was driven entirely by continued growth in transactions with the average ticket down slightly for the year. ", "Adjusted earnings per share were $3.49, which is a 23% increase over last year's adjusted 48% increase and this underscores the sustainability of our profit growth even over challenging comparisons. Foreign currency rates positively impacted full year EPS by $0.02 this past year, compared with a neutral impact the year before that. ", "Consolidated pretax profit margin on an adjusted basis was a 10.6%, and that represents a 100 basis point increase over the prior year. This increase is primarily due to significant improvement in gross profit margins, which were up 90 basis points on an adjusted basis due to strong merchandise margin growth as well as buying and occupancy costs leverage.  Pretax profit margins also benefited from SG&A expense leverage, which improved 10 basis points on an adjusted basis. ", "As the inventories at the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis including the warehouses were up a 4% versus a 10% decrease last year. As we have discussed in our recent monthly sales calls, per store inventory levels are impacted by higher levels of pack-away this year compared to last, which reflect some great opportunities for branded goods at the end of this year. It's important to note that pack-away still represents a relatively small portion of our overall inventory, less than 10%, and that we planned our per store inventory levels to be down again us of the end of this coming year. And we're also, obviously, very comfortable with our open to buy position, which continues to be in great shape as we enter the spring season. ", "In terms of share repurchases for the year, we bought back $1.2 billion of TJX stock, retiring 27.6 million shares. During the fourth quarter, we bought back $355 billion of TJX stock, retiring 7.9 million shares. ", "Now I'll recap the fourth quarter results. Net sales were $6.3 billion, that's a 7% increase over last year, and our consolidated comps were up 2% over last year's very strong 12% increase. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.5, which is a 12% increase on top of last year's 104% adjusted increase. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on year-over-year comparisons were neutral in the fourth quarter. ", "And then finally, our consolidated pretax profit margin on an adjusted basis was 11.2%, which represents a 50 basis point increase over last year, and on top of last year's 440 basis point adjusted increase. This increase was due -- the 50 basis points this year was due to continued improvement in gross profit margins, which were up 30 basis points on an adjusted basis, with the balance of the improvement coming from SG&A expense leverage. ", "So that's it for the wrap up on the numbers this year. Let me turn the call back to Carol and I'll come back at the end of the call to recap first quarter and full year fiscal '12 guidance.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Jeff. The major themes I would like to highlight today are the sustainability of our strong top and bottom line growth and how we are in an even stronger position today to achieve our long-term plans for global growth. ", "Beginning with sustainability. Clearly, as I've mentioned, our strong fourth quarter and full year 2010 performance demonstrates the power of our off-price model to deliver year-over-year growth on top of challenging comparisons. I'd like to highlight some of the elements that led to our success in 2010 that we believe will continue to benefit us. ", "Let me begin with why I believe TJX will continue to be a retailer of choice for consumers. First, throughout 2010 and as we enter 2011, customer traffic continued to be up, significant increases over the prior year, which we believe indicates that value continues to be uppermost in the consumer's mind. ", "Second, our more powerful marketing is working and driving customer traffic to our stores. Our U.S. network TV push was very successful in the fourth quarter. In 2011, our ads will continue to reach out even more aggressively to consumers who have not yet shopped our stores, there's plenty of them, and emphasizing the great fashion and value that we have to offer. Third, we saw sales lift in our 700 neatly modeled Marmaxx stores in 2010 and we'll continue our aggressive store upgrade program across the company to enhance customer shopping experience and drive sales. In 2011, we expect to do about 350 across all our banners, which is about what we did last year. Fourth, we continue to open vendor doors in 2010 and now source from a universe of over 14,000 vendors. Our vast vendor universe allows us to offer customers better brands, more excitement and continuous freshness. ", "There's a plentiful marketplace out there, and we see many exciting opportunities for 2011. In the same way we are a retailer of choice for consumers as we expand our global sourcing, grow our store base and build mutually beneficial relationships, we're also a retailer of choice for vendors. As long as we continue to offer the combination of great brands, fashion, quality and values that we do and continue to execute, we believe consumers will not only continue to choose our stores, but new customers will turn to shopping the TJX brand. In fact, that's what our customer research is telling us. ", "Now let's move to running with even leaner inventories and our further opportunity to improve our supply chain, a major factor in our confidence in sustaining our top and bottom line strength. In the last two years, we have made significant improvements in our supply chain, which has enabled us to reduce inventory, which we've operated the business to historically low levels. As we run even leaner, we are turning inventories faster, buying closer to need and driving even more excitement to our stores. This has reduced markdowns, leading to sequential improvement in merchandise margin. I believe that we can continue to reduce our inventory levels, and we are investing in our supply chain to run even faster and even better. ", "Over the next few years, we have meaningful opportunities to become more precise in getting the right goods to the right stores at the right time. In addition, we will continue our cost-cutting initiative. In 2010, we exceeded our plan to reduce costs. And in 2011, we are again planning cost reductions in the $50 million to $75 million range, which will help protect our profit margin and offset other cost increases. ", "The second major theme that I want to highlight is our outlook for successful long-term global growth. I believe that our actions in 2010 position us even more strongly to prioritize our most profitable businesses, all of which have major store growth potential. I am certain that our decision to consolidate A.J. Wright, while a very difficult run because it affected so many people, was the right action for TJX as a whole. This move significantly improves our economic prospects in the near and long-term and enables us to focus our managerial and financial resources on fewer, larger businesses with higher returns. ", "To recap the key points, as we convert A.J. Wright stores and lever the efficiencies of our more profitable banners, we expect the benefit to earnings to grow. We expect the move will negatively impact EPS in the first quarter with an increasing benefit over the last three quarters of 2011, and that we will see the full benefit to annual earnings in 2012. In subsequent years, we expect the annual beneficial benefit will be even greater as sales in our converted stores grow. ", "Now, I'll review how we're prioritizing growth. In 2011, our plans call for growing square footage by 4% or netting 115 stores, excluding the A.J. Wright closing. This is slightly less than our original plan for 2011, reflecting our slowing the pace of growth in Europe a bit, which I'll discuss in a moment. At the same time, we are investing in Marmaxx, HomeGoods and TJX Canada, which are all achieving consistently strong performance. ", "Let's talk about Marmaxx, which delivered another outstanding year in 2010. Comps increased 4% over last year's exceptionally strong 7% increase and segment profit was up 18% over record results last year. With Marmaxx outperforming our expectations once again, we will maintain the higher level of new store openings that we established in 2010. Long term, we believe Marmaxx has the potential to grow to 2,300 to 2,400 stores, which is 300 to 400 more stores than we originally envisioned. Over the past two years, we have widened our customer demographic reach significantly and T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have been very successful in markets with similar demographics to A.J. Wright. This gives us confidence in our increased expectation for Marmaxx's long-term store growth prospects. I should note that we have excellent visibility into the level of cannibalization from new Marmaxx stores and are achieving solid ROIs after reflecting that effect. ", "HomeGoods also had a terrific year in 2010, achieving strong sales and profit increases over record results in the prior year. With HomeGoods' consistent performance, we also see opportunities to expand this store chain beyond our previous thinking. We will pick up the pace of growth in 2011 and over time believe that we can nearly double the number of HomeGoods stores to at least 600. It's worth noting that many home businesses with higher average tickets in HomeGoods are close to or over 1,000 stores. ", "TJX Canada had an excellent year in 2010 as well. We are very excited about bringing Marshalls to Canada this spring. We achieved our highest returns in Canada, so we are thrilled to launch another vehicle for growth in that country. We are opening our first stores in the Toronto area in March and long-term, see the potential for Marshalls to be 90 to 100 store chain in Canada. And overall, we expect TJX Canada's long-term store growth potential to be around 425. ", "Now to TJX Europe. We were disappointed with the TJX Europe's results in 2010. But I can assure you that in the short term, we are very focused on getting this position back on track. With 54 store openings in Europe and the complexities of adding a new country in 2010, we lost our focus on execution.  When this happens, inevitably, we give up some of our value proposition and our customers see it. This is exactly what happened at TJX Europe. So in 2011, we are slowing the pace of growth in Europe to give our team time to refocus on the basics of our off-price model: Great brands, great fashion, great quality and great value. ", "We are also strengthening our European organization with some TJX veterans. Further, through our TJX University, we are leveraging the knowledge of seasoned TJXers across the company to teach the new talent in our buying right. Our expectation is that we will begin to see progress in this business towards the end of the first half, with greater improvement in the second half when TJX Europe typically earns the vast majority of its profit. ", "There is no doubt in my mind that we will get this business back on track this year. When we have stumbled at other businesses in the past, we have fixed them and I am confident that we will fix this one too. It's worth noting that TJX Europe has been on a successful 15-year trajectory through the first quarter of last year.  I would like to make it perfectly clear that we are as confident in our long-term growth opportunities in Europe as we ever were. Further, I believe we were right to have taken advantage of the European real estate opportunities that we had in 2010. I am convinced that the stores we opened in Europe last year will benefit our company in the long term. The competitive landscape in Europe is fertile ground for us, and we continue to believe it holds enormous growth potential for TJX.  Long term, we see the potential for TJX Europe to grow to 750 to 875 stores in just our current European markets and many more beyond. ", "Wrapping up our long-term growth, we see TJX growing from 2,700 stores today to over 4,300 stores long term. We are also investing in our infrastructure for both the short and the long term, and believe we have enormous future growth in front of us. ", "In terms of our financial plans for 2010, we'll continue to plan conservatively as we did in 2010. At the same time, I can assure you that this management team is motivated to surpass those goals as we have done successfully many times. Jeff will provide details on our guidance in a moment. ", "Before I sum up, I want to briefly mention how we see the current retail environment playing into our strengths. We all know that there's a lot of confusion out there about forcing and pricing. Historically, disruptions in the marketplace have benefited our business by creating great off-priced opportunities. We entered the first quarter with very liquid inventories, which affords us the flexibility to respond quickly to market trends. If the retail-pricing umbrella rises, we have an opportunity to raise our average ticket while maintaining our value gap and drive merchandise margin. If other retailers do not pass costs on to consumers, we've proven our ability to buy right, remain under the pricing umbrella and sustain merchandise margin. Either way, we will watch the market around us and adjust and believe that for us, the net result of the product pricing issues will be positive for us. ", "Summing up, our strong top and bottom line performance in 2010 demonstrates, once again, the power and flexibility of our off-price model to deliver consistent growth in both weak and strong environments. As we begin a new year, we have great opportunities and I am convinced that our strong sales trends and profits are sustainable. I believe that value is more important than ever in the consumer's mind. We see ourselves as a sourcing machine with a vast vendor universe. This affords us enormous flexibility to capitalize on disruptions in the marketplace and shift categories swiftly as consumers' tastes change. Our marketing is driving new customers to our stores and our upgraded shopping experience keeping them coming back. We are running our stores with even leaner inventors and turning them even faster, which leads to exciting selections and higher merchandise margin. We are offering consumers great brands, fashion, quality and value. It is this combination of elements that I believe position us to continue to be a retailer of choice. ", "As we work to achieve our goals, I'm very pleased with our exceptionally strong management team. In addition to Ernie taking on a larger role, Michael MacMillan and Nan Stutz have also been promoted and are now Group President. They join Jeff, Jerry Rossi and Paul Sweetenham as Senior Executive Vice President. With a management team with many decades of combined retail experience and years of working well together, I'm confident that TJX will grow to be a $30 billion and then a $40 billion company. ", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Jeff to go over guidance and then we'll take questions.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Thanks, Carol. Before I get into the guidance for fiscal 2012, let me iterate our continued confidence in our three-year growth outlook, which calls for compound EPS growth of 10% to 13%. This remains unchanged from our prior outlook. ", "As you can see from today's release, we provided fiscal 2012 guidance on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis, and the adjusted basis excludes the impact of the A.J. Wright closing, the costs we're going to incur to convert and rebrand open 90 A.J. Wright stores to other banners and the impact of a nonoperating item in fiscal 2011 [ph]. ", "So all the details of this adjusted guidance, along with the related reconciliations to GAAP financial information, can be found in the table in the Investors section of our website, www.tjx.com. That's up there right now, and I encourage you to, sometime today, as you march through the guidance to look at these. And I'm going to speak to the adjusted numbers in my remarks today, because we think those best represent the underlying trends in our business. ", "So let me turn to fiscal 2012 full year guidance. For fiscal 2012, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.78 to $3.93, and this represents an 8% to 13% increase over the adjusted $3.49 in EPS in fiscal 2011. Our EPS guidance assumes consolidated top line sales of about $22.6 billion to $22.8 billion and a consolidated comp store sales increase in the 1% to 2% range on both a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group. ", "For the year, we expect adjusted pretax profit margins to be 10.4% to 10.7%. This represents a 20 basis point decrease to a 10 basis point increase over the adjusted fiscal 2011 pretax profit margin of 10.6%, and it's a little better than we'd expect, given the 1% to 2% comp increase. We are planning adjusted gross profit margins to be 27.1% to 27.3%, which is flat to up 20 basis points over the adjusted 27.1% in fiscal 2011. This improvement is primarily due to merchandise margins, which we are planning slightly up as we continue to reduce inventories and drive faster turns. ", "We expect adjusted SG&A to be 16.4% to 16.5% as a percent of sales versus the adjusted 16.3% in fiscal 2011. This represents 10 to 20 basis points of deleverage and that's about what we would expect on a 1% or 2% comp. ", "Foreign exchange rates, assuming current levels, are expected to add approximately $0.02 to full year EPS growth. For modeling purposes, we're planning net interest expense in the $40 million to $42 million, a tax rate of 38.1%, which is consistent with fiscal 2011, and a weighted average share count of 386 million shares. ", "Capital is planned in the $800 million to $825 million range and we are planning to buyback at approximately $1.2 billion. The increase in capital spending is driven primarily by a greater number of remodels, which includes investments to convert former A.J. Wright stores to their new banners. It also includes replacement of the company's existing data center, as well as additional distribution capacity. ", "We anticipate our cash balance at the end of 2012 after this increased capital spending and increased shareholder distributions to be approximately $1.5 billion, which provides significant financial flexibility. ", "Now let me turn to Q1 guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.82, a 6% decrease to a 3% increase over last year's very strong $0.80 per share, which in turn represented a 63% increase over the prior year. ", "In addition to challenging year-over-year comparisons, there are several other factors that impact the first quarter. First, we are planning further deleverage from our European business, as Q1 was the strongest quarter for Europe last year. Second, for the majority of the first quarter, we will not have the benefit of sales from the A.J. Wright conversion stores, and this impacts expense ratios and our bottom line in the first quarter. Finally, we will run with heavier headcount earlier in the year as we absorb talent from A.J. Wright into our businesses. ", "So combined, these factors represent about 50 to 60 basis points of deleverage in the first quarter, but will moderate as the year progresses. In contrast, today's guidance implies adjusted EPS growth for the second through the fourth quarters, so for the balance of the year, up 12% to 15%. And it also implies adjusted pretax margin improvement for the balance of the year of 10 to 30 basis points on a 2% to 3% comp for that period. So we view the Q1 guidance as being heavily impacted by the timing issues that I discussed. ", "Now with some details in Q1 guidance. We're assuming a first quarter top line in the $5.0 billion to $5.1 billion range. This is based on comp sales in the range of down one to up two on both the consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group on top of last year's very strong 9% and 10% increases, respectively. As the monthly comps for February, we are planning comp sales increases of 2% to 3% on a consolidated basis and 3% at the Marmaxx Group on top of last year's increases of 10% and 11%, respectively. So the year is off to a strong start. ", "For the combined March-April period, we are planning on comps in the range of down one to up one on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx over last year's very strong 9% increases at both. This year, the March-April period is impacted by the Easter shift, with this holiday falling in April this year, compared with the March selling period of last year. Consequently in March, we're planning comps to decrease 2% to 4% on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx.  In April, we are planning on comp increases of 2% to 4% on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. ", "For the first quarter, adjusted pretax profit margins are planned in the 9.5% to 10.1% range, and that's down 60 to 120 basis points over the prior year. At the high-end of the range, the decline in adjusted pretax profit margin of 60 basis points is adversely impacted 50 to 60 basis points by the factors I mentioned earlier. So those factors really explain the decline in the pretax profit margin at the high-end of the range. ", "At the low-end of the range, the decline is driven by these factors as well as deleverage from the 1% comp decrease. We're anticipating first quarter adjusted gross margin in the range of 26.8% to 27.2%, down 10 to 15 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to buying and occupancy deleverage, which is about what you'd expect on the up two to down 1% comp sales guidance. ", "We're expecting adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the 16.9% to 17.1% range, up 50 to 70 basis points versus prior year. Again, this is due entirely to the factors mentioned earlier. Although at the low end, there are obviously some deleverage on the negative 1% comp. ", "As a reminder, full year SG&A rates are expected to deleverage only slightly on a one to two comps. So again, this is principally a timing matter. For modeling purposes in the first quarter, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.1% and net interest expense to be in the $10 million to $11 million range. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately $393 million. ", "So I'll wrap up with our store growth plans for fiscal 2012. There's a lot going on here, so let me break down the components. We entered fiscal 2012 with 2,859 stores. We have since closed the remaining 142 A.J. Wright stores and we'll reopen and 90 of these as Marmaxx and HomeGoods stores. 81 of these 90 conversions will be incremental to the store count, with nine of these representing relocations of existing Marmaxx stores. We will also add 115 net new stores during the year. So between conversion stores and new stores, we will add 196 stores on a consolidated basis, ending the year with an estimated at 2,913 stores. This represents 2% square footage growth on a reported basis, but 4% if we adjust for the A.J. Wright closed stores. ", "One final comment. In the past, we provided and discussed the detailed divisional breakdown of our guidance for the current quarter, but have not provided it for the full year. Going forward, we intend to discuss the detailed divisional model for the full year with investors in the street, as we think this provides useful insights into the growth and economics of our individual businesses. That said, we will no longer provide this divisional detail for the current quarter, as we already provide guidance for all the P&L elements and we'd like to keep our conversations more strategic. ", "We will now open it up to questions and ask that you please limit your questions to one per person. To keep the call on schedule, we're going to continue to enforce our one question limit and we appreciate your cooperation. Thanks, and we'll open it up for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Kimberly Greenberger [Morgan Stanley].", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "Carol, I'm wondering if you can take a look at Europe. I know that you're taking a pause in the growth rate there this year. But how do you envision the path back to the appropriate operating margin structure throughout the year this year? And how would you think about reaccelerating the growth? What would you like to see out of the business before you tried to do that?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So Kimberly, we obviously stubbed our toes and I can reiterate it in terms of we grew too fast and complexities. We had 57 stores and opening new countries and a fairly new talent -- a team that needed a lot of learnings in terms of time in their jobs. So I feel at this point, we've slowed the growth. I think we are building our foundation and making it much stronger. We're much more country focused in terms of getting the right fashion to the right country. We've injected strong veterans of high levels and given people smaller jobs so that they can have time in jobs. We're really levering the corporation. So I see this year as I think we're going to -- towards the back half and towards the end of the first half, I think we're going to see some terrific progress. And I think that we're doing the right thing by slowing the store count down. And my gut is, by the end of next year, we're going start to feel pretty good and look at next year to start accelerating it.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Kimberly, just to expand on that a little bit. We think we planned Europe relatively conservatively this year. We're planning a two to three comp for the full year on top of a minus 3% last year. And we think if we achieve that, we'll have a profit margin back up to the 4.5% to 5% range versus 3% last year, but also versus a peak of over 7%, which by the way at that time the U.K. was almost 9%, so we're starting to make some progress. We're planning some progress candidly, not as much as we hoped to achieve this year into the numbers. The store count for this year for Europe is up 27 stores, significantly below where we've run the last couple. And I think to Carol's point, I think we need to see a little bit more before we make a decision on the reacceleration.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "The real key is the team is getting a lot more solid and we have three very high level executives that are now in the business that weren't there a year ago, which is, I think, going to make a very big difference. So again, we don't have to push these buttons too hard. We got time. We'll fix it. And we didn't have too dissimilar an issue with HomeGoods years ago. So I believe we will come back roaring, and we're going to take this year carefully.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stacy Pak.", "Stacy Pak - Prudential", "Question for you, I guess, on the whole marketing side of things, Carol. I was hoping that you could expand on what you're seeing in your customer research findings, particularly with regard to attracting new customers. And if you want to share at all, kind of what you are seeing in existing customers. And also within that, can you comment, Jeff, on the advertising dollars or percent plans in '11? And if there's any big changes by quarter and maybe weave in TV.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So, Stacy, our dollars are not way up, but our impressions are. And we're fairly aggressive in the first quarter in that we will be on Network TV that we weren't on a year ago. And we have a fairly aggressive plan in terms of things that we learned last fourth quarter for our December Gift-Giving business, which will get us a lot more pointed. And I think we have a terrific program again for the back half. So our customer research is very clearly telling us that our customers -- our new customers like shopping us. New customers are planning on coming back. We keep increasing the percent of new customers and reaching out into the universe. It's just that we still have an enormous, enormous percentage out there that we haven't tapped yet. But our messages are getting out there very loud and clear and our educational message is getting out there. So the positive news is when they get into the stores, they want to come back and that's very clear. So I think we have a lot of growth rate in the future. So we're pretty excited about it.", "Operator", "Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "Carol, this is the first time in a long time that we're living through an inflationary environment from a cost perspective. What do you think needs to change about how you run your business, if anything? And then maybe just, specifically, does your mix in upfront versus in-season buys need to change in this new environment?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So I'll start with absolutely not. Our business model does not have to change. We are in a fabulous, liquid position. And as I said, it's usually the gap between us and everyone else. Ernie, you have some insight to this also as we're all dealing with these increases in prices?", "Ernie Herrman", "Well, I would say, and I think Carol alluded to it further in the script, the model of our business has generally worked for us in the past. Any time there is like unknown or confusion in the market, that usually works to our advantage. So our goal is really simply to show relative value, better value relative to the competition. If during that, by the way, the average ticket goes up, well as long as we're still offering better relative value, I think that's only good for us as well. But again, because of our opportunistic business model, I don't think we need to change anything. And I think when the environment changes like that, it usually bodes well for us.", "Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "Moving to a lot of retailers managing inventory units down, does it need to change when you order goods in terms of upfront versus in-season? Waiting for in-season?", "Ernie Herrman", "Well, you know, first half all, and this usually comes out in a different question. Availability is not an issue. If anything, we're having to hold the merchants back from buying too much too soon. I don't see that pattern changing amidst this whole pricing discussion that's going to be in the marketplace. So I would say we'll just stay the course and maintain the relative value. I don't see our upfront, closeout percentages or any of that happening to be toyed with to any significant degree.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, Paul. The increase in our inventories today is really strictly some pack-away deals, which were just great brands. Last year, we were lean on pack-aways. But we're still in the same percentage. So that's really the only difference in the inventory. We're just as open to buy as we were a year ago. We're actually a little bit even more open. So we're in a great position.", "Operator", "Evren Kopelman [Wells Fargo Securities].", "Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Can you talk about the 115 net new store additions? Which divisions will they be in? How many Marmaxx in there? Also along -- within that of the ones you are converting from A.J. Wright, do you plan to merchandise them differently from a core Marmaxx, maybe more comparable to the urban brands that A.J. Wright was carrying, or are they going to look more comparable to your average Marmaxx?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. Well, first of all, I'll have Jeff run through the numbers. But in terms of the conversion, we have an overlay of many stores that live in that demographic. We know -- we're very clear on how to merchandise those stores, so we're pretty comfortable. Our mix will say similar. We do not have the same mix in every store in Marmaxx. And this is all part of what we strive in terms of getting the right goods to the right store at the right time, and focusing on enhancing our supply chain. That all comes around that messaging and the dollars that we're putting into systems is all about improving that. So we have many stores, again, that overlap, so we're pretty clear on what that needs to be. And Jeff, you want to break down the stores?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes, so we have a 115 new stores, that's 1-1-5. In terms of the store openings, we have 51 planned for Marmaxx, and that compares to 50 last year. So we're maintaining a very similar place at Marmaxx as we've been on. HomeGoods, we have 22 stores. And last year, we opened 13 net. So we're accelerating the pace at HomeGoods. We think that's appropriate given the terrific performance out of that division, strong comps, strong profit and just really phenomenal performance. In Canada, we have 15 stores. Last year, we had seven. The primary driver there, obviously, is opening Marshalls -- with Marshalls opening this year that's driving a little higher store count in Canada. Very happy about that, since Canada is our highest return business. So happy to be investing in that country. And then in Europe, we have 27 new stores versus 54 last year. Breaking that down for you, 10 are in the U.K., 10 are in Poland and seven are in Germany. So that's the break down on the new store count. And obviously, we retain flexibility to do more if we choose to do so, and a lot of that Canada, just depends upon real estate opportunities in North America.", "Operator", "Adrianne Shapira [Goldman Sachs Group].", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "My question is how you mentioned the first being really discussed the sustainability of your results. And it seems as if you're confident of that ongoing merchandise margin expansion with inventory turn continuing to improve. So it seems as if, looking at the average turn, doesn't really tell the whole story on the opportunity. Jeff, perhaps you could share with us differences across the divisions to give us the confidence that there's more room to improve and where we can learn from those divisions that are turning faster and what some of those lessons are.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Adrianne, I'm going to turn over to Jeff in a minute. But part of it comes again back to shipping the right goods to the right store at the right time and your freshness percentages. There is a lot of detail in this. And that helps lean up the inventory and drive sales harder. So Jeff will go through by division, but as we get better and better at that, we don't know how low we can go or how quickly as we increase this supply chain to get the stores faster in number of deliveries. So it's going to change over time, and we're going to keep learning more. Jeff?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "I think overall for TJX, our store turns have improved significantly over the last two years. And I think, when you peel it back, Adrianne, what you see is that we've taken the inventories down more aggressively at our smaller divisions because, obviously, in the larger division you want to be very careful. And so, I think if you looked at it, you'll still see fairly meaningful variances between our smaller divisions and our largest division, Marmaxx. So I think when you look at that, that suggests that there's still opportunity. We're going to continue to, obviously, be very, very careful on it because we don't want to sacrifice sales and profit for turn, but we do believe that there's opportunity in them. The other thing that I should point is that none of this is plugged into the model. So if you look at our three-year model, we talked about hitting 10% to 13% growth. We are plugging merchandise margin improvement into that. So that would be upside to the model were we able to achieve that.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Could you talk about what some of those meaningful variances are? Give us a ballpark in terms of what the differences are?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "No, we'd rather not be public on that.", "Ernie Herrman", "Adrianne, I just wanted to jump in for a second and say that I think in Canada, which again, I've become pretty familiar with over the last couple of years, I think there's still opportunity out there. As Jeff alluded to, a couple of the business is Marmaxx in Canada. I think we have opportunity to lean up a little further over the next couple of years and make improvements on the markets -- merchandise margins.", "Operator", "Brian Tunick [JP Morgan Chase].", "Unidentified Analyst", "It's actually Ike calling in for Brian. I wanted to ask a question on the A.J. Wright convergence to Marmaxx. When we think about those stores that are converting to the Marmaxx format, how should we think about the profitability of those locations? I guess, meaning, could they earn similar Marmaxx four-wall profitability despite their real estate?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Absolutely. They should and they will. We put in the right cannibalization factors. We're probably going to start out being conservative. But we have no doubt that they should, because we already have stores in the those demographics that clearly have very strong operating income.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "And when you look at the four-wall contribution of Marmaxx stores that are already in those demographics, it's very similar to the Marmaxx, overall four-wall contributions. So I think for the individual stores, we're looking for similar profit dynamics as we would in base Marmaxx stores.", "Operator", "Todd Slater [Lazard Capital Markets].", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "I guess my question, Carol, is as you move to more pack-aways, if you could give us sort of an order of magnitude. It sounds like maybe you can go from single digits now more to your low double digits or something. And if so, what are the implications on inventory currency and relevancy on markdowns? Because in the past, your decreased impact rates has self improved, but the turnover as well as the product currency and lower markdowns and therefore margins. So as this increases, sort of, how do you see that affecting margins or risk margins going forward?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Todd, the pack-away, honestly, the number is so irrelevant, it's not funny. I mean it's well within our normal. We're not even near double-digits nor will we be. Last year we were just a little bit lean. We're probably somewhere in the middle of where we have been in the past. We're going to be current. We're going to be great value. We're going to be the most current in fashion and brands and that is our business and we will continue to run it that way.", "Ernie Herrman", "Todd, if I could also jump in. At this point in time with the inventories which again holds some of the incremental pack-aways, which is not really in the scheme of things a significant number, we are pleased with our inventory position going to the year though. We have more accounts payable leverage than last year and our EPS as a percentage of inventories are up, which is telling us that our inventories are even fresher than last year to what Carol just said. So that validates that. And also, our absolute inventory turns increased during the fourth quarter. So again, we're still turning very, very fast and we're very lean and flexible.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Daniel Hofkin [William Blair & Company].", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Just, I guess a question regarding inflation and listening to your comments about cost versus the retail-pricing umbrella. Can you discuss just kind of what you're seeing right now in terms of the competitive pricing environment and also kind of the what rate or roughly rate of cost inflation you're seeing out there currently? And are you seeing retailers thus far passing it along or choosing to absorb a little bit in maybe in their margins?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Right now, the retailers are not really passing a significant amount. And I think that's going to start to happen probably towards the end of the back half, middle to end of back half and possibly into the following year. So we'll see. Again, I'm thrilled if our average ticket goes up. It's fantastic for us, but I can guarantee, we'll keep the distance of great value. And that's what we're focused on.", "Operator", "Richard Jaffe [Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.].", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Can you go through the individual divisions in fiscal 2012, how you see them contributing both in terms of sales and operating margins?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Total model?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes, we're happy. So overall in the comp, we're planning one to two. Right now, we'd be looking at a one to two for Marmaxx, one to two for Canada, one to two for HomeGoods and, as I mentioned earlier, two to three for TJX Europe. So pretty consistent planning other than a little bit heavier comps for TJX Europe for the full year. As we look at it by business, we would see Marmaxx at 12.9% to 13.1%, that's down 40 basis points at the low end and down 20 basis points at the high end. So we have it planned down 20 basis point at the high end on a two comp. That's going to be reflective of cannibalization from those -- we've got 74 of those 90 stores are opening as Marmaxx's. The cannibalization impact that has a bit of diluted impact on Marmaxx for the year. That said, overall, the exited A.J. Wright business is worth 30 basis points to the consolidated company. So the economics here all work very well. In the case of Canada, last year was 14%, we're planning it 14% to 14.2%. In the case of HomeGoods, last year was 9.5%, we're planning it 9.1% to 9.4%, again at the high-end we've got a two comp. So it's a little bit of deleverage on a two comp, 10 basis points. Again, nothing unusual. In Europe, we had a 3% margin last year, we are going from 4.6% to 5.0% for the current year and then those are really the major items. I commented on tax rate interest. They are elements that are really in our asset. So I just have to be [indiscernible] the detail that you need. And we're happy, obviously, to follow-up and talk further about it in the follow-up calls.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Dave Weiner [Deutsche Bank].", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just another follow-up question on Europe, if I could. Carol, I think you talked about potentially seeing progress by the end of the first half of the year. I guess, could you give some specifics on what that's based? Is it largely on just easier compares and so that makes running the business easier? Or are there other kind of specific catalysts that you plan to come into action at that time? And then also Jeff, I think you had talked about 17 new stores in between Poland and Germany for the new year. I think that's the number 10 and seven. Didn't hear anything on productivity of those countries. Could you give a little color on how those stores are doing versus the U.K. stores?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, it's completely based on what I'm seeing in terms of the mix and the leveraging the corporation and better focus. So, I think we're starting to see where we'll turn the corner. There are specific categories that are trending in a positive direction and there are specific categories that we're very, very focused on to do a better job in the value and the mix. So it really all comes back to based on execution and that's where I'm sort of laying out the time frame.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Is that a result more from maybe the training of some of the buyers gotten or...", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It's training, it's the brand focus and it's the fashion focus. And there are things that work in the U.K. that don't necessarily work in the Germany that we have learned that we're much more focused on, where to ship, again coming back to the right goods to the right store. So there is a lot of we've learned from this past year. And understanding the pure value equation. In the long-term, I hate to say it, when you skip a beat like this, you usually get a lot stronger.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "As you look at the pacing too, we've, the first quarter, we would rough against the one comp. If you look at the remaining three quarters, we're up against a down four. So clearly, the comparisons do get easier. So if you look at Europe, we planned it up three and up four -- up three to four against the down four. So again, we think that's the realistic plan and, as Carol mentioned, lots of plans and actions in place to achieve that. In terms of Germany and Poland, 17 stores. Poland last year, the performance was in line with our plan in terms of the bottom line. Generally, we're seeing stores that are performing above where we thought they would be. We had some phenomenal openings, particularly in Warsaw, really just some terrific openings. So we remain very, very confident in terms of continuing that plan in Poland and the performance of the underlying store base in line with what our expectations were. Germany, in the back half of the year, the stores fell off their trends, just as they did across all of our European business. So we ended up with a sales miss at Germany and some compression in the margin rate. That said, I would tell you when we look across the portfolio of stores that we have and the relative productivity and relative four-wall contributions versus the U.K., they're just a little bit below the U.K. Likely, were trending earlier. So we remain very, very confident that as we improve the mix and take some of the merchandising actions that Carol talked about, that we'll see strong improvement there, which gives us the confidence to go ahead and continue to invest. Now, obviously, it's seven stores in Germany versus 24, 25 last year. So we're slowing it down there considerably and we think that'll help benefit that business.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "The other factor in Germany is we got hit very hard in the fourth quarter and we did, I'm saying that it's truly -- we own it in execution. But Germany really did get hit by an enormous unusual weather pattern of snow. And we did see some day-to-day tremendous hits by that. So that was a little bit unusual. So I think there is just some base opportunity there also.", "Operator", "Howard Tubin [RBC Capital Markets].", "Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Maybe just a quick question on the remodeling program. Can you give us any color on the lift you see close to remodel, maybe relative to a store that hasn't been remodeled?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We really don't talk to that, Howard. Not a number we give out. Nice try though.", "Operator", "Laura Champine [Cowen and Company].", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC", "The pack-away inventory is usually not enough to move the needle at all, and we're seeing it throughout the closeout industry. What's driving that increase? It's not as if full-price retailers are missing. Why is there suddenly such a great availability of branded product?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "First of all, you've got to understand it's versus last year, we were down 10% last year. And we were chasing a little bit. But we had very little pack-away last year. This year, there just happened to be a bunch of brands that we liked very much and we went after it. And that's really the whole story there. There's no big change here.", "Ernie Herrman", "And part of it is the wholesale market. Some of those vendors were a little more aggressive, maybe based on what was going on out there. So that combination yields more goods.", "Operator", "Jeff Stein [Soleil Securities].", "Jeffery Stein - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.", "Carol, you mentioned at the beginning of the call that you're now dealing with 14,000 or so vendors and that's a fairly large jump if I'm recalling the prior year's number which I...", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think we were being a little conservative in the past, Jeff. I don't even want to tell you what we think the real number is.", "Jeffery Stein - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.", "Obviously, there's been a big jump. And I'm wondering, is most of the increase, one, coming from Europe? And two, if you can just kind of segment it between higher-end vendors and just kind run-of-the-mill kind of moderate vendors.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Well, first of all, it's both. And we are -- again, when I talk about the different stores and the different demographics, we've pushed the high-end and we'll continue to do that. Part of that is some interesting new countries. There's a lot going on in HomeGoods. There's some changes in apparel. There's a lot of new contemporary guys out there. So we're seeing a vast increase in many, many new areas. Poland, Germany, and we have offices now. When we talk about Germany and we talk about Italy and even in China, we have many, many people on the ground. We just opened another new country in terms of having a buying office -- so it's a combination of upgrading countries and then having more feet on the ground also in terms of moderate vendors. So it's really across the board. And you want it across the board so that you have that tremendous reach. So that if we're converting an A.J. Wright store, you have a fantastic mix appropriate to that type of environment and then when you're opening in the middle of New York City or downtown Boston, again, you want a mix that's different. So it's really across the board.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Montagna [Avondale Partners].", "Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC", "The store openings for next year. If you're reducing the amount of inventory in the stores, turning the inventory faster, are you able to open smaller square footage stores?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I mean, we have. We still have our Mega Shoe stores. But it's a advantage to us. Again, it has to do with the real estate and the shape of the real estate, the size of the real estate. So we always look to -- we can do a $7 million to $20 million store, if that's what we would rather do.", "Ernie Herrman", "One of the beauties of our business model is we don't have a defined footprint. So what we can do is we can open -- we can start a 20,000 square foot store, we can start a 40,000 square foot store. So really we are opportunistic in many ways and take what the market will give us.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "So you don't see the average store size decreasing by the different...", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No. As a matter of fact when we can put a HomeGoods with a Maxx or HomeGoods with a Marshalls, it's terrific for us. So, again, we go with the deal, the right deal.", "I want to thank everyone. Thank you, Holly. And we look forward to giving you the results of our first quarter.

I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of the TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And before I begin, Sherry has a few words.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning.

In addition, that section of our website also includes reconciliations of guidance with respect to non-GAAP measures to guidance on a GAAP basis. Thank you. ", "And now, I'll turn it back to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Good morning, again. And joining me is Sherry, who's on the call; and Ernie Herrman; and Jeff Naylor. Let me begin by saying that our overall first quarter performance demonstrates, once again, our ability to deliver consistent results year-over-year in economic upturns and downturns. Despite extraordinary growth in the prior year, we continue to deliver positive comps and earnings per share in line with our plan and on top of a 9% comp increase and a 63% increase in EPS last year. We believe that our first quarter sales would have been even stronger if it were not for the unseasonable weather that hindered apparel sales in many U.S. and Canadian regions.", "When we spoke with you on our last conference call, we said that we expected the first quarter to be the toughest of the year as we faced our most challenging prior year comparison, particularly for our European business, as well as timing issues related to certain expense items. With our most challenging quarterly comparison behind us and May off to a very strong start, we are looking forward to the second quarter and the rest of 2011. Going forward, we have many exciting opportunities, and we remain as convinced as ever that we will continue to drive steady top and bottom line growth regardless of the economic environment. ", "But before I continue, let me turn the call over to Jeff to recap our first quarter results.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Again, I want to emphasize that we will be referring to adjusted results throughout today's presentation. Reconciliations between our GAAP reported numbers and the adjusted results are provided in today's release, and we've also put them up on our website. ", "Now to recap first quarter fiscal 2012 results. First off, net sales reached $5.2 billion. That's a 4% increase over last year. Our consolidated comp store sales increased 2% on top of a very strong 9% increase last year. That was driven by continued growth in customer traffic. And for the quarter, the ticket was essentially flat. ", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.78 compared with last year's $0.80 per share. Now these results include a $0.03 negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates due to a mark-to-market adjustment on our inventory-related hedges, which had not been contemplated in our original guidance. So our underlying results are a bit stronger than it would appear and, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment, towards the high end of our guidance. This item is expected to effectively reverse in subsequent periods, primarily in the second quarter when the inventory that we\u2019ve hedged is sold. ", "Turning to pretax profit margins. Our pretax profit margin on an adjusted basis for the quarter was 9.6%. That's in line with our original guidance and down 110 basis points from the prior year. Now the mark-to-market adjustment represented 30 basis points of this decline, with the remaining 80 basis points primarily due to factors that were anticipated in our plan, and I'll cover in a moment. It's important to note that we expect these factors will moderate as we move through the year. And in the guidance I'll cover later in the call, we continue to plan for full year, that's full year adjusted pretax profit margins, essentially flat on a 1% to 2% comp sales increase. So what we're seeing here in the first quarter largely reflects a pacing or a timing item. ", "The gross profit margin decreased 40 basis points on an adjusted basis versus last year. 30 basis points of that is due to the mark-to-market adjustment. The remaining 10 basis point decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit margins in Europe, as we took significant markdowns to clear out inventories, and that was partially offset by improved buying and occupancy expense leverage. ", "SG&A expense increased 70 basis points, which was in line with our expectations, and reflected the factors impacting Q1 that we discussed on our last conference call. So in terms of the factors themselves, specifically, the increase in SG&A reflects the timing of certain expense items. One, we're absorbing talent and certain costs from the A.J. Wright division and other TJX divisions. Secondly, we have deleverage from our European segment. And finally, for most of the first quarter, we did not have the benefit of sales from the 90 A.J. Wright conversion stores, which negatively impacted our expense ratios. So again, these factors will moderate as we move through the year, and we continue to expect SG&A rates for the full year, that's a full year, to be up minimally on the planned 1% to 2% comp increase, which is about what you'd expected. So again, Q1 SG&A rates, we think, are more about the timing and the pacing of the year.", "Turning to inventories. At the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including the warehouses, were up 12%. That's up 10% on a constant-currency basis, and that compares to a 12% decrease last year. This increase was primarily due to our having taken advantage of much larger available quantities of end-of-season branded packaway product, and that compares to very low quantities that we had of end-of-season packaway last year. It's important to note that inventory levels in our stores are down and turning faster, which bodes well for merchandise margins. Further, we entered the second quarter with a more liquid inventory position, with more open to buy than at this time last year, and we think we're in very, very good shape to buy into current trends and opportunities in the market.", "In terms of shareholder distributions, we retired 7.1 million shares, buying back $361 million of TJX stock during the quarter. We continue to anticipate buying back approximately $1.2 billion worth of TJX stock this year. We also raised the annual dividend to $0.76 per share, a 27% increase, and it's worth noting that this was the 15th consecutive year in which we\u2019ve raised our dividend. ", "So now I'll turn it back to Carol, and I'll come back later to provide details on our guidance for the balance of the year.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Jeff. As we've reiterated many times, our consistent performance over both the short and long term, as well as the strength and sustainability of our business, give us great confidence in the future. I intend to keep my comments brief today, leaving more time for Q&A. I'll start by highlighting the major themes in regard to the sustainability of our strong sales and margin and our exciting opportunities for the second quarter and beyond, beginning with sustainability. ", "The first quarter clearly speaks to the power of our off-price business model to deliver steady performance year-over-year. To recap our divisional results. In the U.S., we are very pleased with Marmaxx and HomeGoods, excellent first quarter performance. Both of these divisions achieved strong comps on top of very challenging prior year comparisons. On the bottom line, adjusted segment profit grew significantly across both businesses, and adjusted segment profit margin continued to improve over prior year level. ", "At Marmaxx, comp sales increased 4% over last year's very strong 10%. Adjusted segment profit was 14.4%, up 10 basis points on top of last year's record performance, and customer traffic continued to be up over significant increases last year, despite the negative impact of unseasonable weather in the Northeast and Midwest. This bodes well for our business when the weather turns warm in these regions. ", "At HomeGoods, comp increased 6% over last year's exceptional 15% increase. Adjusted segment profit was up 80 basis points versus last year, then highest ever first quarter profit performance for this division. HomeGoods' sharp execution is driving these strong results as we are offering customers great off-priced values on a fantastic assortment of goods from around the world. ", "TJX Canada's first quarter results were heavily impacted by weather. We believe that the negative impact of un-spring-like weather on demand for apparel drove the sales mix, while deleverage on the 3% comp decline hurt the bottom line. It's important to note that our home businesses in Canada performed well, which we believe underscored the impact of weather. We are excited about our launch of Marshalls in Canada, where our first 5 stores are now open. Although still very early, customer response has been very strong. ", "Moving to TJX Europe. As I mentioned on our year-end call, we don't expect to see improvement in this business until the end of the second quarter as we're still focusing on getting this business back on track. We've talked about how our rapid pace of growth last year put pressure on our organization and we lost our value proposition with a mix that was too moderate. As we knew we'd have to, we took aggressive markdowns in the first quarter in order to clear out and start a new fresh season. We have begun to see inventories turning a bit faster in the last several weeks than they were a year ago, and that's a good sign. ", "Further, I believe both our brands and values are definitely getting stronger, continue to expect that we will start to see progress by the end of the first half, with greater improvement in the second half when TJX Europe typically earns the majority of its profit. In the short term, we believe that we are making some progress and beginning to head in the right direction. And in the long term, we're confident that Europe continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for the company. ", "As we move into the second quarter, we have many exciting opportunities. First, customer traffic continued to be up in the first quarter over significant increases last year. Looking over the last 2-year period, customer traffic has increased enormously, up in the mid-teens percentage range. This indicates to us that value remains top-of-mind for consumers. ", "Second, while we have made significant gains in our U.S. market share and widened our demographic reach substantially, enormous opportunities still remain. Our research tells us that approximately 75% of U.S. shoppers have not shopped at T.J. Maxx or a Marshalls store in the last year, which translates to tens of millions of untapped shoppers in the U.S. log [ph]. ", "Third, we believe that our more effective marketing is helping to grow our customer base. Our television network campaigns were very successful in the first quarter, and our increases in customer traffic tell us our messages are working. We will be making a bit more of an investment in our marketing this year. ", "Fourth, our store remodels are helping to retain the new customers we are attracting with our marketing. At Marmaxx, we will have almost 2/3 of our stores in the new prototype by the end of the year. We continue to see sales lift when we remodel store comparable to when we began the program. The returns are not diminishing. We are on track to remodel approximately 350 stores across all our businesses this year. ", "Fifth, on a macro level, we see the uncertainty in the marketplace of outsourcing and pricing as an opportunity for our business. Historically, disruption in the marketplace has created great off-price opportunity. We can utilize our flexibility to seize opportunity and react faster to the market trends than just about any other retailer. The key for us is relative value. If other retailers pass on costs to consumers and our pricing umbrella rises, this should allow us to drive merchandise margins while maintaining our value gap. If other retailers absorb rising costs, we typically have the flexibility to adjust our mix, which enables us to remain under the pricing umbrella while sustaining merchandise margins. ", "We are seeing tremendous opportunities for great brands and quality products in the marketplace. We enter the second quarter with very liquid inventory, which puts us in an excellent position to respond quickly to the current fashion and trend. We continue to open more vendor doors around the world as we expand our universe of more than 14,000 vendors. So you can see that we have many reasons to be excited about our opportunities as we begin the second quarter, and we will be utilizing our flexibility in the marketplace to its full advantage. ", "Before closing, I want to cover a couple of other key points that give us confidence in our business. We continue to invest and make improvement in our supply chain to run the business with even leaner, faster turning inventory. This has led to even fresher selections and sequential improvement in merchandise margin. We continue to see additional opportunities to reduce our inventory, as well as fine-tune our shipping of the right goods to the right stores at the right time. This is a major factor in our confidence in sustaining our top and bottom line strength. Further, we remain sharply focused on managing expenses with cost-cutting initiatives underway across the company. To recap our plans, we expect to reduce costs by approximately $50 million to $75 million in 2011, which will help protect our profit margin and offset other cost increases. ", "Although very early, I am pleased with the performance of our stores that have been converted from A.J. Wright. If this continues, it bodes extremely well for the possibilities of additional stores under both the Marmaxx and HomeGoods banners long term. As we learn more and more about these customers, we see several tactical improvements that we -- that can be made to make these stores even stronger. ", "In terms of our outlook for the second quarter. While our comparisons become easier than the first quarter, we will continue to plan conservatively. At the same time, as always, we are motivated to surpass our goal. Jeff will provide details on guidance in a moment. ", "Summing up, we have many reasons giving us confidence for the second quarter and beyond. We delivered strong sales in the first quarter despite exceptional prior year growth. Earnings were in line with expectations, and our comparisons get easier as we move through the year. We had sales momentum exiting the quarter and May is off to a good start. We expect the benefits from converting our former A.J. Wright stores into more profitable TJX banners to ramp up as we move through the year and beyond. We are looking for TJX Europe to begin to make progress towards the end of the first half with greater improvement in the second half. ", "Due to the uncertainty in the marketplace around costs and sourcing, it's an opportunity for our business as disruption in the market typically creates great off-price buying opportunity. We continue to invest in and improve our supply chain to run with even leaner in-store inventories, which drives faster inventory turns and merchandise margins. We have a strong consistent history of generating enormous amounts of cash, resulting in some of the highest financial returns in the retail industry, and we have a long track record of returning cash to our shareholders through our share buyback and dividend program. We have vast growth potential with the portfolio of 4 powerful divisions are -- and we are investing in our infrastructure to support profitable growth in the short and long term. ", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jeff to go through guidance, and then we'll be happy to take all your questions.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Thanks. So before I get to guidance, I want to briefly touch on 2 items related to the quarter. One, first, let me speak to the Canadian performance. As we discussed upfront, our consolidated EPS in Q1 was reduced by $0.03 due to the mark-to-market adjustment. Virtually all of this adjustment was recorded in our Canadian segment. ", "So while segment profit and profit margin in Canada were down, the mark-to-market adjustment was a very big factor. Just to dimensional-ize that for you is that -- while we reported an $18 million decline in segment profit at Canada and a 370 basis point decrease in the segment profit margin, the numbers are actually $9 million down and 170 basis points, if you exclude this item, and that's on a negative 3% comp, which was -- basically be in line with what we would expect. ", "The second item. I want to briefly recap the A.J. Wright consolidation, given that we're essentially down at this point. Through the end of the quarter, all of the 162 A.J. Wright stores have been closed, and 79 of the 90 stores that we're converting to Marmaxx and HomeGoods banners have been reopened. So of those remaining 11 conversions, 9 have already been completed in May, to date, with just 2 more to go. ", "The costs to close A.J. Wright and convert the 90 stores to other banners are significantly below where we thought they would be. First, to close the A.J. Wright business, we estimated the after-tax cost would be in the $150 million to $170 million range or $0.38 to $0.43 per share. And of that, $40 million to $50 million was cash -- was cash. Our current estimate is that the after-tax cost will be in the $120 million range or $0.30 per share, with an after-tax cash cost of approximately $20 million, which is well below that $40 million to $50 million original estimate. In terms of the cost of converting the 90 stores to Marmaxx and HomeGoods banners, which represents the costs that we incurred during the go-dark period, as well as the grand reopening costs for these stores, the impact on EPS is expected to be approximately $0.03. And that's at the low end of our original estimates. ", "And then finally, in terms of the benefit. We remain confident that the converted stores, will, on a run rate basis, generate $25 million to $35 million of after-tax profit, which is in line with our original estimate. Approximately $15 million to $20 million, or $0.04 to $0.05 per share of this, is incremental to what we were earning with A.J. Wright. We expect that approximately $0.03 per share of this benefit will be realized in the remainder of the current fiscal year, with the balance picked up next year. ", "That said, the most important benefit of the A.J. Wright decision remains the improved profitability that we expect from opening stores that were previously designated for A.J. Wright and opening those as Marmaxx stores and the enhanced growth that'll bring the company. So that's just a quick recap of A.J. and the consolidation, where we've come out. ", "Now onto guidance. As you can see from today's release, we provided fiscal 2012 guidance on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis, and the adjusted basis excludes the impact of the A.J. Wright closing and the related store conversions, as well as the impact of a non-operating item in fiscal 2011. Details of our adjusted guidance, along with the related reconciliations to GAAP financial information, can be found in the table in the Investor section of our website, and I'd encourage you to refer to these. I'm going to speak to the adjusted numbers in my remarks today. ", "So for the full year, we now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.81 to $3.93, which represents a 9% to 13% increase over the adjusted $3.49 in fiscal 2011. I should note that the high end of this range is consistent with our original guidance, while we've raised the low end by $0.03 to reflect Q1 performance. ", "Now the full year guidance continues to be based on a 1% to 2% comp store sales increase. We continue to project adjusted pretax profit margins in the 10.4% to 10.7% range, which is down 20 basis points to up 10 basis points over the adjusted fiscal 2011 pretax profit margin of 10.6%. And that's a little better than what we'd expect, given the 1% to 2% comp increase that we have in the model. ", "For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.86, which is an 11% to 18% increase over our adjusted earnings per share of $0.73 last year. So in terms of the underlying assumptions, what are they? We're assuming second quarter sales of approximately $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion, with a comp sales increase of 1% to 3% on both a consolidated basis and up 2% to 4% at The Marmaxx Group. ", "As to monthly comps. For the month of May, we're planning comps to increase 2% to 3% on a consolidated basis and increase 3% to 5% at The Marmaxx Group. And obviously, that's the month of May. May is our most difficult comparison of the quarter. In June, we expect comps to be flat to up 2% on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. In July, we expect comps to increase 1% to 3% for both TJX and Marmaxx. ", "For the quarter, the pretax profit margin is planned in the range of 9.5% to 9.9%, which is down 10 to up 30 basis points versus the adjusted 9.6% last year. We are planning our second quarter gross profit margin in the range of 26.7% to 27.1%. That's up 10 to 15 basis points over the prior year. And we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 17.0% to 17.1%. That's an increase of 20 to 30 basis points over the 16.8% recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. ", "This guidance reflects the moderation of the factors, which impacted Q1 SG&A rates, as cost ratios will benefit from a full quarter of sales from virtually all the A.J. Wright conversion stores. We'll be further along in absorbing A.J. Wright talent and certain other costs into our other businesses, and we will face easing comparisons at our European business. For modeling purposes, we're planning a tax rate of 38.1%, net interest expense in the $9 million to $10 million range and weighted average shares of approximately 389 million. Our full year and second quarter guidance both assume that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels. ", "Finally, a few comments on the back half of fiscal 2012 that's implied by today's guidance. We believe the back half will be relatively stronger as we will benefit from easing year-over-year comparisons, the cycling of negative trends in Europe, the profit impact of the A.J. Wright conversion stores and the moderation of the SG&A factors that were discussed earlier. So we're expecting EPS in the back half of $2.22 to $2.30, up 13% to 17% over the adjusted $1.97 in the prior year, and that excludes last year's fourth quarter charges related to A.J. Wright. I should note that this guidance is based on comp store sales growth in the 1% to 2% range. And for the back half, we believe pretax profit margins will be up 20 to 40 basis points over last year's adjusted 11%. ", "We'll now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Jennifer Davis. [Lazard Capital Markets]", "Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "It must feel great to have comps positive against your strong comps against the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Absolutely.", "Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "So my question is, if you look at your Marmaxx segment margins, you keep exceeding record levels. Did you think if you kind of annualize it, a 13% to 13.5% is the right level? And will the converted A.J. Wright stores impact those margins? Are those lower margin stores or will they be similar to the chain average?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, in terms of the A.J. Wright stores, their profit percent is slightly higher and their dollars are slightly lower. But we are planning Marmaxx pretty conservative as we always do. And the likelihood, I always feel good that we usually beat our number. So I'm hoping to beat those numbers in the second quarter in the back half.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Jennifer, for the full year, we've -- we're calling for the Marmaxx segment profit margin, which was 13.3% last year, to be basically flat on a 2% to 3% comps. So as Carol mentioned, the stores that -- the Marmaxx stores we have in the lower-income demographics, we actually see slightly higher four-wall contributions from those stores. So it doesn't hurt, that cannibalization can be a factor, but when you put it all together, it's basically flat year-over-year. And that's what we have baked into our 3-year model, by the way, when we look out 3 years it\u2019s a flat segment profit margin for Marmaxx on a 1.5% to 2% comp.", "Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "All right, great. I'll limit it to one. I do have more though. So if you have time, I'll circle back.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Just get back in the queue.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Evren Kopelman. [Wells Fargo Securities].", "Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I had a question on the -- your comment on the larger available quantities of the end-of-season branded packaway. Are you buying more, more because of the cost increases that are coming in the second half or more because the product is good? Because it's surprising that there'd be so much excess good product out there because we've seen, in general, strong retail sales over the past few months and quarters. So is this specific brands that have been underperforming or is it just because, like I said, you're just ramping up ahead of the cost increases?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "First of all, our packaways, we only do packaways when we see wonderful deals. This isn't about mitigating costs, it's really about the product itself. And second of all, across the board, we're pretty excited about the amount of products. So it's really across the board.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. And a big piece of this, Evren, it's not just what we bought this year, it's also that the quantities of packaway that were available last year were very...", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Minimal.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Very minimal. So a piece of this is more opportunity this year, particularly at the end of the season. There are a lot of cancellations -- there are a lot of late arrivals of goods in the fourth quarter. We were able to take advantage of that as we crossed over into this year, but that was up against very low levels of packaway last year. So that's part of what's impacting the year-over-year comparisons.", "Ernie Herrman", "And I would just jump in and say also the merchants have been selective through that process. So it's not like we just buy every packaway, but the availability was so plentiful. We stayed selective as we went through that whole list of packaways.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Tunick. [JPMorgan Chase].", "Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I guess two quick ones. I guess, Jeff, I was surprised on your comment regarding the flattish Marmaxx margins over the next few years. It seems like, as you guys have talked about inventory turns, it seems like HomeGoods has been the number one focus, and that Marmaxx is still in the early innings. So why should Marmaxx margins be flattish? Aren't there still some decent markdown opportunities ahead for the Marmaxx division? And on T.K. Europe, what kind of margin expansion are you guys assuming in the back half? And is that more on the sales leverage returning or is that on the markdowns?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "All right. Brian, we'll go through all the Europe numbers, because I think it'll be very beneficial for everyone to understand how conservatively we are planning it and what the opportunities are. Again, we plan conservatively, and we will continue to do that in terms of Marmaxx and HomeGoods. And I like to end each quarter and each year being on the positive and beating our plan. So do we believe there's opportunity? Absolutely. Do we think it's prudent to just plan conservatively? Absolutely. And that's what we do and will continue to do. So yes, we do believe there is opportunity. You want to go through Europe?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. And, Brian, that's just -- obviously, that's what we're putting in. We've got a 3-year model that gets us to 10% to 13% EPS growth. Baked into that is a 1% to 2% comp. So we think that the conservative way to plan it is to -- flat profit margin on a 1% to 2% comp. It takes some SG&A cost reduction to get there. And there's probably gross -- but we think there's more gross margin opportunity than, to Carol's point, than there is risk, but I think that's the prudent way to plan it. So my comment is related more to the model. But I tell you the management view, obviously, we're striving to beat it. In terms of the assumptions for Europe, I'll give you the Q2 and the second half. So as you look at the comp, right now, we're calling for a 0% to 2% comp in the second quarter, and that's on top of a minus 4% last year and a 6% the year before that, plus 6%. In the second half, we're calling for a 2% to 4% comp. That's on a minus 4% last year and a 3% the year before that. So if you start -- and you guys can do this math off-line. But if you actually start looking at the 2- and the 3-year stacked comps for the second quarter of this year and the second half of this year, we do not have a significant -- we have a slight improvement in trend, but not a dramatic improvement in trend. I'd say, it's nothing that's -- that I would characterize as heroic. And we think those are makeable numbers. In terms of the profit, the thing to realize is that in the back half of the year -- last year, we came up against -- we had almost a 400 basis point hit on the gross margin line in the back half at Europe. Q1 this year was down pretty significantly, as well as, Carol mentioned, we took a lot of markdowns. But we were up against basically a flat margin last year. So what's happening here is we're going to -- as we move from Q1 into Q2 and into the second half, the margin comparisons get significantly easier. The comp comparisons get easier. And so we think as we look at the plan, that we planned it, what I would refer to as, prudently. And we've also planned it candidly below what our internal expectations would be for the business. But we think that's right way to do it, given some of the trends that we've seen over the last 9 months.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And just a couple of comments on Europe. We've done quite a bit here, and we've really strengthened the team. We have a high-level team now and veterans, and we're feeling pretty good about the group. We became very liquid. We're absolutely focused on the right brands and the right values. We have this -- have had this in the past in our businesses, and we've certainly fixed them. We are more country-centric, and we've slowed the growth. And next year, we'll have a minimal number of stores. And we'll play it by ear, and we can react very quickly. We're certainly starting to see some positive signs. And Ernie was just over there, and I think he's feeling pretty positive. And what about the goods you've seen over there and the market?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, I was just there recently. I'm feeling better about the fashion as well as the brands that we have in the mix. So I think that's equally important in Europe. I think we're headed in the right direction, in terms of the overall values that we're delivering to the stores and to the customers. I think what's helping there is that the market in Europe has been yielding some very exciting opportunities. And our merchants have been able to, as Carol said, we're liquid, so they've been able to take advantage of these opportunities. And at the same time, they have really been focused on buying the best of the best. So I think throughout that process, I think the mix in the stores from a fashion and brand perspective is feeling a lot better than it did a few months ago. So again directionally, without being too optimistic, I want to stay balanced here, I would say the goods in the stores are feeling better.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And as we've said, we're still planning it, within the total, very conservatively. Hopefully, there's upside.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Adrianne Shapira. [Goldman Sachs]", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I actually have one clarification and then a question, if that works. Just, Jeff, if you could -- on the guidance for Q2, I just want to be clear. Does that include -- the $0.81 to $0.86, does that include the $0.03 benefit related to the inventory?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "It does. So it would have a flip on the mark-to-market, Adrianne. That's worth, we think, somewhere around 30 basis points as well to the bottom line.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, great. And then, Carol, just as we're focusing obviously on Europe and Canada as opportunities in the back half. I guess, on Europe, the markdowns that you had to clear the goods, are we clean as we enter Q2 in Europe? And then on Canada, it sounds as if your commentary about May off to a good start, should we also read that the weather has gotten more accommodating in Canada and you've seen better trends in Canada as well?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, first of all, the -- Canada, we're -- we had a 10 point differential in terms of home product to apparel. So we are starting to see apparel get a little bit stronger in Canada. So I think that's going to bode well. And Canada is not an issue for us. We really believe that it was a weather issue. So I think going forward, we feel pretty confident in that.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "In Europe, are we clean?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. In Europe, we are clean. And as I said before, for the first time, we are starting to see turns faster than last year. We absolutely cleaned out first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Stacy Pak. [Barclays Capital]", "Stacy Pak - Barclays Capital", "So I guess just a follow-up on Europe, and then I'm hoping to get your opinion, Carol, on direct and what that means for T.J. But just on Europe, can you explain to us why you're confident that this -- your execution issue, and maybe if you're seeing differences in experienced buyers to less experienced, if that's the issue? Or you're seeing differences in countries? And tell us if you started TV and what you're seeing there. And then on direct, Carol, what does direct mean to TJX? Do you think you're going to start selling over the web? What do you think about the private sale opportunity? What kind of product could you sell? I'm just kind of wondering if you are going to start doing that.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So how many questions is that?", "Stacy Pak - Barclays Capital", "It\u2019s really 2. It's a follow-up -- more clarification on Europe and then address direct. But I was just giving you...", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Let me get back to Europe, first. We really put the A players who are focused and mentoring. We are focused on the right vendors, on the right values. The guys know what turns the goods and what sells. We have a plentiful market. More importantly, Ernie has worked with the group, and they are very, very liquid and very, very focused. We're country-centric now, more so than we were a year ago. So all of the moves that had to be made have been made, and that's where our confidence level comes. Again, having said that, we don't want to overpromise. So that's where we are with Europe. In terms of e-commerce, we are using some of our bench. We have developed a team. We've done a lot of research in this arena. We look at e-commerce in the future in combination of a great marketing tool and tremendous leveraging of our stores. So the idea of having brick and mortar and e-commerce, together, is really where we see the future. So as I said before, we want to do it right. We see tremendous opportunities for us in terms of all of our brands, and we believe that we are slowly setting up a situation that will be very positive. But again, I want to come back to, we see the opportunity not just for e-commerce, in itself, but really using that to maximize our store traffic and leverage the top line of our business.", "Stacy Pak - Barclays Capital", "Will you say when you'll begin selling online?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We haven't said that yet.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger. [Morgan Stanley]", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "My question is on inventory. I'm wondering, Jeff, if you can just help us understand the magnitude of the increase at -- in the packaway levels. In other words, was packaway 2% of inventory last year and 10% this year? And so we can just try to figure out, excluding the packaway, what the inventory levels look like. That would be really helpful. And then just a clarification. I wanted to make sure that I heard your comp guidance by month correctly. It sounds like you're expecting the best comp in May, but that's the toughest comparison. So I'm just wondering what's happening in June and July that gives you pause in your forecast.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "So yes, on the packaway, it's never more than 10% of what we do, Kimberly. We were up against lower levels of -- very low levels of packaway last year. We're not specific on the quantity. I don't want to get into the mode of taking specific components of our inventory and quantifying it. But I can tell you, it's the lion's share of the increase that you're seeing year-over-year, and we feel, as Ernie said, very, very comfortable with that inventory. That it's -- it wasn't a strategy to manage margins in the back half, it was all about great values, great brands and just an abundance of available products. So in terms of the comparisons, I would tell you that May is reflective of what we're currently seeing, where I think the June, July guidance is more reflective of continued concerns about the economy, the economic environment, and frankly, being a little conservative.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Stein. [Soleil Securities]", "Jeffery Stein", "Carol, question, again, back to Europe. And I'm wondering if you've taken a look at, is there anything that has changed fundamentally, either with respect to the customer or even the vendors in Europe? For example, I know for years you've talked about the fact, there was just a myriad of closeout opportunities here in the U.S., but you have those same opportunities and those same relationships with the vendors in Europe, which give you conviction that maybe something may have -- may be changing there?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, it's really about our focus. And when you grow too fast and you have less experienced group and you're bringing in a lot of new buyers, the tendency is to run to fill your open to buy. And what we did do is we filled it with more moderate goods, which obviously turned off the customer. And so today, we have it very, very focused on what's acceptable and what's not acceptable. We have the pros guiding the next tier and teaching. So it just keeps coming back to focus and execution. And that's why I believe it's very fixable. There is plentiful goods out there. But we are not allowing the buyers to buy things that are not up to a certain standard and level, and they know it and they understand it today.", "Ernie Herrman", "Jeff, and I would just jump in. Similar to what I said on the packaways is, even on the -- all the other goods that we're buying, they are being selective. And I think that's what Carol was just talking about. We are buying pretty balanced assortment now. I think we're a little too moderate prior. And so whether it's goods at the high end, goods on the middle level, the merchants are all in that page. And generally, that's what works best for us when we're buying across the board. So we're feeling much better about that.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And I think the other thing we're learning is, which vendors work in which countries. And there's a big difference between the U.K. and Germany.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Roxanne Meyer. [UBS]", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank", "My question is on inventory turns. You've mentioned that there's still an opportunity to improve there and generate margin gains over the long term. I'm just curious at the Marmaxx division specifically, what areas of the store do you think have the best opportunity to improve turns, and to what extent are systems necessary to recognize these improvements? I know you talked about getting the right product in the right place at the right time. So, just curious how those play out.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Obviously, because we're off-price, we don't look at each specific area. We could be in a business that we're not necessarily in a year ago. But what we look at is we are investing systems -- into systems. This is going to be a short- to long-term process. And again, it's going to enable us to do some of the things that we do manually today. Systems will allow us to do it a lot quicker, a lot more efficiently. So that we're much more perfect in terms of our timing, in terms of our, what we call, the Sun Belt, the northern region, being store-centric. We've ranked each store. It will allow us to rank them more efficiently. So all of this will lead to more positive margins in the future, at least that's what we're hoping we will be able to achieve, faster turns, freshness and more excitement to the consumer.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "And I think in the short term, before we're in a position to deploy those systems, there's a lot of things that we can do manually and through spreadsheets that we're doing. And I think the one thing that gives us confidence is the variation in store-level turn across our businesses is pretty wide. And that tells us that with the businesses that are turning a little bit more on the slow side, that there is an opportunity. In fact, we talked about that in the last call.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin. [William Blair & Company]", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Just a -- I guess I'll first ask about the inflation picture, and I apologize if this was discussed at the beginning. I missed the first minute or so. In terms of cost inflation and how the degree to which you're able to pass that through and what sort of impact, if any, you see on unit sales. I know you price competitively with the marketplace with the umbrella. And I guess one final clarification question on Europe, if I could, regarding the results that you've seen the last few weeks. Would you attribute that to the early signs of improved execution, or is it kind of what Ernie described in terms of just really good availability of product?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think it's really about execution. There's no doubt that if you're picking the right product -- there's always plentiful goods, and it\u2019s about putting your people on executing the right vendors and the right value. So that's what we're beginning to see. The market-to-market, there's always again -- we're never shy on goods, in great goods. So many opportunities there. In terms of inflation, our average ticket is fairly flat today, and our intention is to continue to give the consumer just great, great value. And if we're at certain category and prices increase out there, well, we're going to keep our distance in terms of the value. You got to realize we have so much flexibility in terms of categories, zigging and zagging in many, many different ways. So we're pretty excited about the value that we're giving our customers. So it will seek its own level. If the world is out there at higher price points, then we have the ability to raise our price points. But again, we want to keep that distance between everyone else, and that's really what our job is.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Do you feel like the inflation picture is creating broader disruption that's benefiting you, broader disruption than the overall retail landscape?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Probably because anything that changes or is unknown usually tends to benefit us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Jaffe. [Stifel, Nicolaus]", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just a little bit more detail, if you could, on the operating margins by division. You broke out a comment on Marmaxx that you anticipate that being flat. If you could provide some detail on the others, that'd be great.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. On the full year, Richard, we're providing the guidance. So Marmaxx essentially flat on a 2% to 3%, with -- in the case of HomeGoods, we are planning that business up 20 to 40 basis points. So that would be 9.7% to 9.9%, which is a phenomenal, given where we thought the business \u2013- [indiscernible] be. And that's on a 3% to 4% comp. In terms of Europe, we're planning that business at -- the comp is flat to 2%. And that's $100 million to $110 million on a full year basis, which is 3.4% to 3.6% at a segment profit margin. And then in Canada, we're planning that business at a 13.2% to a 13.3%. And that's on a, essentially, a flat comp, and that's against the 14.0% last year. So there's some deleverage, given that we plan the comp flat. That's said, obviously, if we can beat that comp, then there's an opportunity to maintain the margin. So that's the all-in. As I mentioned, bottom line, we're planning a 10.4% to 10.7% on a pretax against 10.6% last year, and that's on 1% to 2% comp. So we're planning it down 20 to up 10 [basis points] on a 1% to 2% for the year. So we remain comfortable with that. That's essentially the same guidance that we gave you at year end.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And the German business continues to be a drag on the European business, as in, not yet breakeven?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes, I think for the year, we, right now, we would project it slightly below breakeven.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Montagna. [Avondale Partners]", "Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC", "Quick question, just about marketing. You mentioned increasing your marketing spend this year. Is that also going to include Europe? And are you talking about an increase in dollars or a percent to total sales? And what exactly are you looking to increase?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Mark, it\u2019s about 10 basis points across the board. So we are getting a little bit more aggressive. Most of that is going to be Q4 driven, because we have a whole initiative going on there that we're pretty excited about. We learned a lot last year in terms of network TV. We learned a lot that we think will also help Europe, as well as Canada. So we're going to be continuing to accelerate some of those things that we tried last year that we think we have some pretty good numbers.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "If the other -- just the other comment there, if I could jump in. A.J. Wright consolidation really helps in terms of marketing because, in essence, we've got 90 stores that contribute marketing dollars. And so we were able to increase the Marmaxx and the HomeGoods budgets in line with the sales that we're getting from those converted stores, which gives them more money to spend. That's all -- it's about leveraging, right. So that -- there's a benefit to advertising as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is Paul Lejuez. [Nomura Securities]", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Just wondering if you could maybe talk about merchandise margins by division for the quarter. And also just wondering, Jeff, what was going on in the corporate overhead line?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Can we handle?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, go ahead.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. So merchandise margins, if you look at them by division in the quarter -- maybe I'll just break out the gross profit margins. So the G -- gross profit margin was down 40 [basis points], 30 of that was mark-to-market. So of the remaining 10 basis points decline, we did get some B&O leverage. So our overall merchandise margins were down in that 30 to 40 basis point range, Paul, and the majority of that was Europe. We actually had a little bit of an increase at HomeGoods, a little bit of a decrease, really slight decrease to flat at Marmaxx and a small decrease at Canada. So it's really -- the merchandise margin was really about Europe deleveraging almost 300 basis points. And again, our view is on the merchandise market. And our view is that, that will, as we go forward through Q2 and Q -- the back half, we start coming up against similar kind of decreases. So we think there's an opportunity, given the content and the turn we're seeing in the business and the level of a markdown that we had LY. That's a big part of what's driving the improvement in that business and in our forecast. Your second question?", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Corporate overhead.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Paul, are you asking if that's lower?", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "No, corporate overhead was up a bunch this quarter. Just wondering what was behind that?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "On margins, Paul asked -- you're asking about Q2 on the margins, right, Paul?", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Correct.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes, okay. So yes. So I think if you look at the expenses, I think the thing to call out here is that the G&A rates were up 70 basis points in Q1. The factors that drove it were deleveraged from Europe, the expense timing, as we absorb talent and other costs from A.J. And we're basically running at full staffing right now, so we have no vacancy. Typically, at any point in time you're going to have 2%, 3% of your headcount will be open. Right now, we have no vacancy, and we've been building a bench. We used some of the A.J. talent to build the bench, which we think is smart for the future. We also didn't have the full quarter of sales from the conversion stores, which impacts our expense ratio. So that's really what's driving the G&A rate. I think the other thing is to call out, and I get to corporate expenses, but the other thing to call out is again the G&A we're seeing for the full year, up 10 basis points to up 20 on a 1% to 2%, which is in line with our model. And 10 basis points of that deleverage is coming from advertising. So we think, overall, as we look at the year, we feel very comfortable with our G&A and our G&A leverage. So what about corporate expenses? Well, obviously, you have some geography here where we have some expenses that are hitting corporate. The first is on the talent, the headcount, the bench, much of that cost is hitting corporate. Some of this is related to initiatives. Carol talked about e-com and building a team there, we have TJX University that we're aggressively using to teach people going forward, building a bench, that's all hitting corporate. We also had about $6 million of onetime items. The largest of which was a write-off that -- we moved one of our buying offices and there -- a lease write-off. It was a movement within the city, but it was still a new premise that allowed us to expand to accommodate the growth. And then finally, we have some costs in corporate that are related to our data center. We're in the process of moving our data center. We have a data center that's many years old, and we're in the process of replacing it and there's some costs. And we'll see those as we go through the year. But all this, candidly, is all baked into the guidance that we've given you on G&A for both Q2, the back half and the full year.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Got you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And in terms of the university, we are funding both for Europe, so that we have teachers in Europe, and the United States and Canada. And this is all what we think is very positive for the future.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Marni Shapiro. [The Retail Tracker]", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "I have one quick question. Can you give us an update on the Cube and the Runway? How they're doing here? And if there's a possibility -- it seems, just from store checks, that the merchandise there in those areas are very picked over all the time, and very shopped. So I guess is there an opportunity to expand them within -- putting it mildly. Is there an opportunity to expand them within the stores they exist? And then I was also curious if you have a similar aspect of this in Europe.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, we do. We have Gold Label in Europe, which is pretty similar to the Runway, which is doing quite well. And in terms of being picked over, that's, I guess, music to my years, because it means that we're turning very quickly. Our junior business is very strong, and our Cube is working very well. It's in every Marshalls store. Do we have more upside? We probably do. And the Runway, we're careful that they are in our top, top stores. And as we do get access to more merchandise, sometimes we'll take a store out of it and shift it to another store. But we'll continue to grow that, but very slowly. But we do want to have flow.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Right, makes sense. And then can you also give us a quick update on some of the accessories business, like handbags and personal care, which I see flex up and down depending on the time of the year and the store?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Both those areas are doing very well.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Excellent.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeffrey Black. [Citigroup]", "Jeff Black - Citigroup Inc", "Just two quickies. On the pricing environment outside of packaway, what are we seeing? And then what is the packaway inventory? Is it winter stuff that gets unleashed this coming winter? Is it spring '12 that gets unleashed in spring '12? Any clarity on that?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Packaway is really throughout the seasons. So some of it is planned. It'll be coming at fairly current, and some of it is for October and November. So it really varies. And that's part of the increase in the store commitments, so it's really laid out by month. In terms of pricing, the pricing environment, as I said before, our ticket remains pretty flat to very slightly up, and we're just seeing fantastic deals. So we just keep looking at it and saying we want great, great value for the consumers. So we're just taking advantage of the environment, quite frankly.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Howard Tubin. [RBC Capital Markets]", "Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Just a quick question on in-store inventories. Can you tell us roughly how much they're down versus last year, and what the opportunities to maybe reduce them further going forward?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "They're closer to mid-digits down. And each year, we take a look at that. So we have some opportunities by division. And again, when I talked about the investment in terms of our systems and supply chain and that will be over probably a 2- to 3-year period of time. That hopefully, we'll be able to take advantage of that and further out, utilize the things that we do manually and, again, be able to reduce the inventory level and maximize the sales by store.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Weiner. [Deutsche Bank]  [Operator Instructions] We'll move on to the next question. Our next question is from Patrick McKeever. [MKM Partners]", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC", "What was the final split in terms of the A.J. Wright conversions between T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods? It looks like maybe just a handful of HomeGoods stores, and then the balance would've been kind of 1/2 and 1/2 T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. Just wondering if that was the case.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "HomeGoods store?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes, 74 and 16.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "74 and 16.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "So 74 Marmaxx and 16 HomeGoods.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC", "So what was the split in within Marmaxx and T.J. versus Marshalls?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It was pretty, pretty similar.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "We don't have that here, maybe a few more Marshalls but not...", "Carol Meyrowitz", "A few more Marshalls but not many. It was pretty close to 50/50, might've been 60/40.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC", "And then just a related question. How many vendors were you doing -- how many vendors did you stop doing business with when you -- with the shutdown of the A.J. Wright change. I mean, is that a big number?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, it's not a big number. But we don't discuss vendors.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC", "But I'm just curious with the continued growth in the number of vendors, I was just wondering if the -- it's at 14,000. I'm just wondering if the A.J. Wright vendors would've -- the unique A.J. Wright vendors would've represented a big number now that the...", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I can tell you that the unique A.J. Wright vendors were taking full advantage. And some of the things that worked in A.J. Wright, we have kept it in some of our other stores. And there are areas, vendors, categories, items that have done very well, that we're taking full advantage of it in the Marmaxx chain. So again, as I said before, we're just learning a lot. And so we're just hoping that this opportunity just keeps growing and growing. We're seeing some interesting results, but it's very early, very early on.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC", "Got it, got it. Okay, well, the converted stores look great to me. So it looked like real home runs.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you. We're happy with them.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Laura Champine. [Cowen and Company]", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Just had a question about the gross margin guidance. Implied in the back half, have you modeled for product cost increases, or is the way you buy this so different from full priced that it won't touch you?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Your second is correct.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes, I think -- again, much of what we buy, we buy close to the time it's in our stores. So we really have the kind of flexibility to respond to markets. And I think the evidence of that is if you go back to the fourth quarter 2008 post-Lehman, our merchandise margin was almost flat. I think we were down 10 basis points. So this shows the ability of our business to course-correct and take advantage of opportunities and respond real time to what the market's giving us and telling us. So I think we haven't priced in any margin compression.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And we are more open to buying than we were a year ago. So we actually have more liquidity.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. That said, we also haven't priced in any -- if you look at the margin guidance and our guidance, we haven't -- we have assume sort of a flat to maybe very slight increase in the average ticket. So I -- we think we've been appropriately -- appropriate in our -- in the assumptions we've made about the back half.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I want to thank everyone, and we look forward to reporting on our second quarter.

Welcome to the TJX Companies Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, August 16, 2011. I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of the TJX Companies Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you, Ellan. Before we begin, Sherry has some opening statements.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning.

Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website, www.tjx.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today's press release and posted on our website, www.tjx.com, in the Investor Information section. In addition, that section of our website also includes reconciliations of guidance with respect to non-GAAP measures to guidance on a GAAP basis.", "Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Good morning. Joining me and Sherry on the call are Ernie Herrman and Jeff Naylor. Let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with our second quarter results as our 23% adjusted EPS growth significantly exceeded our original guidance. This also marks the sixth consecutive year of second quarter EPS increases of 20% or greater.", "Our 4% overall comp sales increase was also ahead of plan, representing the sixth consecutive year that comp store sales have grown 3% or higher in the second quarter. It is very important to note that we continue to achieve these strong results year after year in both good economic times and weak ones, which speaks to the consistency of our business model and our ability to sustain top and bottom line growth through all types of cycles. Customer traffic continues to be up over significant increases last year, which tells us that our value continues to be as important as ever to the consumer. ", "Before I begin, let me turn the call over to Jeff to recap the second quarter results.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. So I'm going to just run through the numbers here. Net sales reached $5.5 billion for the quarter, that's an 8% increase over last year. And second quarter consolidated comp store sales were up 4%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.90. That compares to last year's reported $0.74 per share. However, last year's results included a benefit of $0.01 per share from an item impacting comparability. So if we exclude that benefit, diluted EPS in the second quarter was up 23% over last year's adjusted $0.73.", "This year's results include a $0.03 benefit from foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments on our inventory-related hedges. So excluding this impact, the underlying growth would be slightly lower than the numbers implied, but still very strong. As a reminder, our guidance contemplated this impact. ", "Consolidated pretax profit margin for the quarter was 10.2%. That's above our original guidance and up 60 basis points on an adjusted basis over the prior year. The increase was driven by improved gross profit margin, partially offset by very slightly leverage in SG&A expense, which has been expected. Currency contributed 10 basis points of the increase.", "The gross profit margin improved 70 basis points versus last year, primarily due to buying and occupancy expense leverage, as well as the positive impact of mark-to-market adjustments on our inventory-related hedges. Merchandise margins were flat for the company against large increases the past 3 years, but merchandise markets are actually up approximately 10 to 20 basis points in our North American business.", "SG&A expense was up 10 basis points over prior year, which was better than we had guided on our first quarter call, with the increase entirely due to higher advertising expense. ", "Now you may recall that we expected SG&A to deleverage in the first half of the year, primarily due to the timing of certain expense items as we absorb certain costs from A.J. Wright and our other businesses, as well as deleverage from Europe. At the time, we said that these factors would moderate as we move through the year, which is exactly what we saw in the second quarter. We continue to expect SG&A rates to be up very slightly for the year on a 2% to 3% planned comp.", "As to inventories, at the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventory on a per store basis, including the warehouses, increased 16%, up 15% on a constant-currency basis, and that's versus a 13% decrease last year. As we've discussed on prior calls, we really have been talking about all spring, this increase is primarily due to our having selectively taken advantage of much larger quantities of end-of-season branded packaway product compared with very low quantities in the prior year. And this packaway product doesn't start flowing to the stores until the third quarter.", "It's important to note that the overall increase is purely a timing issue as our forward purchase commitments for the back half are significantly lower than at this time last year. Additionally, the increase in inventory is all in our distribution centers. Our store inventories remain down versus prior year and are turning more quickly. Therefore, we feel like we're in an excellent position to capitalize on the opportunities we're currently seeing and believe we will continue to see in the marketplace.", "In terms of shareholder distributions, we retired 5.9 million shares, buying back $311 million worth of TJX stock during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have retired 13.1 million shares, buying back $673 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back approximately $1.2 billion worth of TJX stock this year.", "Now let me turn the call back to Carol. I'll provide details about our third quarter guidance and recap our guidance for the full year at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Jeff. So moving to the key points. There are 2 major things that I want to highlight. First, our strong second quarter and our ability to post EPS gains of 20-plus percent for the sixth consecutive year reflects the consistency of TJX. Second, we have many exciting opportunities for the back half of 2011 and beyond. ", "Beginning with consistency. Our strong top and bottom line results in the second quarter are yet another example of how the flexibility of the TJX business model succeeds regardless of the strength of the economy. To recap our divisional results, in the U.S., we are very pleased with Marmaxx and HomeGoods continued excellent performance. Once again this quarter, both of these divisions have strong comp and bottom line performance on top of very challenging comparisons last year. And Marmaxx comp sales increased 5% over 3% increase last year, and on top of a 4% increase the year before that. ", "Segment profit margin was 13.1%, up 50 basis points over last year's very strong performance. Marmaxx continues to excel through great execution, continuing to show gains in customer traffic. We have great confidence in the ability of our largest division to continue to grow successfully. Importantly, we will continue to evaluate the potential number of Marmaxx stores, given the strong performance of our new stores and our ability to trade across a wider income demographic.", "At HomeGoods, comps increased 3% over last year's very strong 8% increase and on top of a 9% increase 2 years ago. Segment profit increased 7% with segment profit margins down slightly, due to the increased advertising investment, as well as certain costs associated with the A.J. Wright store conversion. At HomeGoods, our success is also a testament to this division's sharp execution. If you've been in the HomeGoods lately, you know that the store looks terrific with fresh and exciting assortments from around the globe. ", "TJX Canada's second quarter results were disappointing. Cost decreased 3% versus a 6% increase last year. Cost is delevered on a negative comp, although much less than we would have expected due to the strong inventory management and expense control. We believe that we could have better execution, particularly in women's and the kids' -- and the children's business, both of which performed poorly. Importantly, our team in Canada is extremely focused on these issues, which we believe will be fixed in the back half. Further, our store inventories and forward commitments are well below last year's level. ", "While still early, we are very pleased with Marshalls in Canada. Customer response has been overwhelmingly good and the impact on nearby Winners stores has been much less than we had expected. We're especially pleased with how Marshalls dominant footwear assortment is differentiating the Marshalls brands from Winners.", "Moving to TJX Europe, we've had -- we have done a significant amount of work in this business and are where we expected to be in terms of our progress exiting the first half. For the quarter, comps were flat, which was in line with our expectation, and segment profit was $7 million, at the high end of our expectation, including a modern -- moderate currency benefit. Some merchandise categories are performing well, and we continue to work on improving others. We feel good about our inventory turns and liquidity, which positions us very well to pursue the plentiful buying opportunities in the European marketplace.", "We're also pleased with both the quality and quantity of the merchandise and the brands that we are seeing there. As we exit the first half, our comparisons in Europe become much easier, and we continue to expect greater improvement in the second half, which is when TJX Europe typically earns the majority of its profit. We're also confident that we understand our missteps in Europe over the last year, and have plans in place to get this business back on track. By slowing store growth in Europe this year, we're giving our team time to refocus on the core off-price fundamentals that helped build TJX Europe into a successful business.", "Importantly, the team is more seasoned and is now a year smarter. And we are focused on buying more country-specific goods. Fundamentally, we continue to have a very strong business model in Europe. Europeans love quality, they love fashion and they certainly love value. The vendor marketplace is very receptive and full of opportunities. We're the only major off-price retailer in Europe. And long term, the retail landscape there holds vast opportunities for our business.", "I'm sure you're all curious as to how the recent unrest in the U.K. has impacted our business. We did have a few days of business interruptions, but I'm relieved to say that we're back on track and operating normally since this past last weekend.", "Now to our opportunities in the back half of the year. First, let me say that while our comparisons become easier, we continue to plan conservatively, especially in the current environment, as Jeff will detail in a moment. At the same time, we are always motivated to surpass our goal. Here are some of the many opportunities that do get us excited.", "First, I feel very good about our inventories entering the back half. Our inventories are up again due to timing issue, due to high-quality branded packaway we've carrying all spring. Our forward commitment through the fall selling season are significantly lower than at this time last year. This puts us in a great position to chase buying opportunities in a marketplace that is quite plentiful right now. I believe that our best brand penetration gets even stronger every year, and we will be offering both brands and fashion at tremendous value. ", "Second, I have never been more excited about our back half marketing. I love our marketing plans and ideas, and I'm confident that these efforts will continue to drive customer traffic. While we're increasing our advertising spend slightly this year, we are gaining much higher penetration. We're deploying what we would have been A.J. Wright ad dollars to other divisions, and also doing a much better job of leveraging our spending across the company. I believe our marketing campaigns are stronger than ever, and you will be seeing a lot of us in the back half, including on television in Europe.", "Third, our investments to upgrade the shopping experience continue to pay dividends. We're seeing sales lift in our newly remodeled stores comparable to when we began the program. We're on track to complete about 370 store remodels across the company this year. In terms of Marmaxx, by year end, we expect we will have upgraded 2/3 of its stores as we began the program 3 years ago.", "We believe that the enhanced marketing, combined with our improved shopping environment and experience, will help us increase our customer base and our market penetration. We still have tremendous opportunities in the front of us -- in front of us. While we improve this year, our data tells us that there is still 75% of U.S. shoppers who have not visited a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls in the past 12 months. ", "Fourth, in terms of the macro environment, we see the economic volatility and confusion around cost and sourcing as a positive for our business. Historically, uncertainty in the marketplace has benefited us and to create very favorable off-price buying opportunity. Value continues to be more important than ever, and the key for us is maintaining our pricing distance from traditional retailers. We have enormous flexibility in terms of merchandise categories, zigging and zagging in many ways. ", "We're very good at shipping categories, and I believe that we can respond faster to pricing and fashion trends than just about any other retailer. So regardless of whether our other retailers raise their prices or absorb rising costs, our flexibility should allow us to buy into current trends, take advantage of the opportunity and drive merchandise margin.", "We are planning our average ticket to be slightly up in the back half, which should only enhance the value we are offering compared to other retailers whom we believe had -- have generally planned price increases. As always, we will remain focused on maintaining our value GAAP with traditional retailer.", "It's interesting to note that our average basket has been trending up, primarily due to the number of items customers are buying per basket. If this continues, it bodes well for the fall selling season and beyond. Tremendous value is our mission, and we believe that we are in a great position to keep bringing consumers through our doors and keep them coming back.", "Finally, we have many category initiatives underway across the company for the back half. As usual, we'll be extremely gift focused for the holiday, and believe our customers will be very happy and more wowed than ever this year.", "Before closing, I want to cover a couple of other key points. First, while still very early, the economics of our converted A.J. Wright stores are essentially in line with our expectations, and we remain confident in the short and long-term economic benefits to our business. Additionally, the cost to close and consolidate this division was much less than we had originally estimated. The important thing to remember here is that consolidating A.J. Wright has given us the opportunity to grow the Marmaxx space more than we had believed we could in the past. We are learning more about the customer demographic and really are just getting started to perhaps surface in terms of what Marmaxx can do in a more moderate demographic market.", "Second, our continued cost reduction initiatives are another reason for our confidence in our margin's sustainability, short and long term. We remain on track with our plan to reduce cost by approximately $50 million to $75 million in 2011, which should help protect our profit margin and offset other cost increases.", "Third, we continue to make significant investments to support the growth of our businesses. We remain focused on hiring and developing the best talent, which is key to growing our business. Investing in infrastructure, both at the supply chain and systems and building an e-commerce team for the future.", "So summing up, we're confident about our opportunities for the second half of 2011 and beyond. Our strong top and bottom line growth in the second quarter achieved on top of years of profitable growth clearly demonstrate the consistency of this business to both recessions and recovery. We have excellent opportunities to the back half of the year, when our comparisons become easier and our marketing really kicks in. ", "At TJX Europe, we are where we thought we'd be at this point and are beginning to see progress, and we are looking for greater improvement in the second half. We see the volatility in the macro environment and confusion around sourcing and pricing as playing to our strength. And we will use our flexibility to take full advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace. Our customer traffic increases clearly tell us that value remains the top priority in consumers' minds. And further, this business delivers superior financial return. Our strong operations generate enormous amounts of cash. And after reinvesting in our business, our management team is focused on returning excess cash to shareholders. ", "And finally, the thing I love most about our business is the flexibility of our model. At the end of the day, if we're on our execution gain I have every confidence that we will continue to grow and succeed.", "So now I'll turn it back to Jeff, who'll go through guidance before we open it up to Q&A.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Thanks. I'd like to cover 2 items before I get to guidance. First, I'd like to speak to the impact of currency on our Canadian and European division's second quarter results, which are available on tables we posted on our website, but then we wanted to call out on this call given the pretty significant movement in currency rates during the quarter. ", "For TJX Canada, we report USD $92 million in segment profit compared with $82 million in the prior year, and a 40 basis point improvement in segment profit margin. Now if you exclude the benefit of currency, segment profit actually declined slightly by about $3 million and segment profit margin was down 70 basis points. That said, this is a very strong performance on a 3% comp store sales decline and much better than we would have expected and reflects very strong inventory and expense management. ", "For TJX Europe, we reported USD $7 million in segment profit for the quarter, compared with $2 million last year and a segment profit margin improvement of 70 basis points. Now if we exclude the benefit, currency segment profit declined very slightly by about $3 million to $5 million. So Europe was still profitable on a -- on the -- excluding the currency impact. And segment profit margin declined 70 basis points on a flat comp.", "That said, we are encouraged that Europe posted a profit for the quarter given our efforts to improve the performance at this division. And again, I would note that, that was on a flat comp for the quarter. Second item I want to cover before getting into guidance is to briefly recap the A.J. Wright consolidation, which is now essentially complete. Through the end of the quarter, all 90 stores have been converted, 74 to Marmaxx and 16 to HomeGoods. It's important to note that these conversions began in mid-March and ended in early June. So while it's still -- so while it's still very early to assess their performance, thus far, it's going as we expected. In terms of the cost to close the A.J. Wright division and convert the 90 stores, we came in significantly below our original estimates.", "First, to close the A.J. Wright business, we had originally estimated the after-tax cost will be $150 million to $170 million or $0.38 to $0.43 per share, of which $40 million to $50 million was cash. The actual after-tax cost came in at $170 million or $0.29 per share with an after-tax cash cost of approximately $20 million, well below our original estimates. Second, the cost of converting the 90 stores to Marmaxx and HomeGoods centers, which represents cost incurred during the go-dark period, as well as the cost to grand reopen the stores reduced EPS by $0.03 in the first quarter. And that was at the low end of our original $0.03 to $0.04 estimates.", "Finally, in terms of the benefits. We remain confident that the converted stores will, on a run-rate basis, generate $25 million to $35 million of after-tax profit, which was in line with our original estimates. Approximately $15 million to $20 million or $0.4 to $0.05 per share of this is incremental to what we were earning with A.J. Wright. So the economics of this action are very positive. We continue to expect that approximately $0.02  to $0.03 per share of this benefit will be realized in the current year, and this is reflected in the guidance.", "It's also important to reiterate that it's still early. Generally, the economics we're seeing from the conversions are in line with our expectations. But frankly, we need more time to properly read the impact. And of course, the larger benefit is going to come from the incremental profit of opening stores previously earmarked for the A.J. Wright division as Marmaxx stores as we go forward. So that's a quick recap on A.J. Wright.", "Now on the guidance. As you can see from today's release, we have provided fiscal 2012 guidance on both a GAAP basis and on adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the A.J. Wright consolidations, as well as the impact of a nonoperating item in fiscal 2011. Details of our adjusted guidance, along with the related reconciliations to GAAP financial information, can be found in the table in the Investor section of our website. I encourage you to refer to these at your leisure. And I'll speak to the adjusted numbers in my remarks today.", "So for the full year, we are raising our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $3.89 to $3.97, which represents an 11% to 14% increase over the adjusted $3.49 in fiscal 2011. This guidance is now based on a 2% to 3% comp store sales increase and adjusted pretax margins in the 10.6% to 10.7% range, which is flat to up 10 basis points over the adjusted fiscal 2011 pretax margin of 10.6%.", "The $0.04 increase at the high end of the guidance range is entirely due to the second quarter exceeding our original expectations, and we've left the back half guidance unchanged. As a reminder, for the back half, we continue to expect EPS of $2.22 to $2.30, up 13% to 17% over the adjusted $1.97 in the prior year. I should note that this guidance is based on comp store sales growth in the 1% to 2% range. And pretax profit margins up 20 to 40 basis points over last year's adjusted 11.0%. So that's the full year in the back half. ", "For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be the range of $1.03 to $1.07, a 12% to 16% increase over our diluted earnings per share of $0.92 last year. We are assuming third quarter sales of approximately $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, with a comp sales increase of 2% to 3% on both a consolidated basis and at The Marmaxx Group. As for monthly comps, for the month of August, which as a reminder, was the strongest month of the third quarter last year, we're planning comps to increase of 1% to 2% on a consolidated basis and approximately 2% to 3% at The Marmaxx Group. In each of September and October, we expect comps to increased 2% to 3% on both the consolidated basis and at Marmaxx.", "The pretax profit margin is planned in the range of 11.1% to 11.3%, which is up 30 to 50 basis points versus 10.8% last year. We are planning our third quarter gross profit margin in the range of 27.8% to 28.0%, up 30 to 50 basis points over prior year. We expect SG&A, as a percentage of sales, to be in the range of 16.5% to 16.6%, flat to up 10 basis points over last year. For modeling purposes, we're planning a tax rate of 38.1%, up 50 basis points over last year, net interest expense in the $10 million range and weighted average shares of approximately $385 million.", "Our full year guidance implies fourth quarter EPS in the range of $1.19 to $1.23 compared with adjusted EPS of $1.05 last year. Once again, this excludes the A.J. Wright segment from last year's results, which is again detailed on our website.", "This fourth quarter high-level guidance we're providing today assumes a 1% to 2% comp sales increase in the quarter. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call. Finally, our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels.", "So we'll now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] So thanks, and Ellan, we'll turn it back to you know for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Evren Kopelman.", "Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I had an industry-level question. What do you think is driving the larger quantities of the branded and the seasoned products out there? And is it more concentrated in certain categories and brands, or is it more broad-based?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, first of all, I'm hoping today, it's not much different than any other day. There is plenty of goods out there, and there always is. So we don't see a big difference. We're targeting the categories that we believe are really going to drive the business. So we're always -- there's always a plentiful marketplace, and we are keeping our guys home. And we do see a lot of opportunities. But I think it's going to be a strong back half, but we're always seeing that. It's not a big change from the past.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Tunick.", "Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just question on the gross margin, just wanted to make sure that we had it right. So did you say that merchandise margins were flat and the rest was occupancy leverage? And I'm just trying to understand, as you think about gross margins going forward, sort of which divisions have the best opportunity to improve inventory turns and where you think that could go from here?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Right. Brian for the second quarter, our gross margins were flat. In the America businesses, they were slightly up. In terms of going forward, in terms of opportunities for gross margin, Southern Europe is...", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes, I mean I think it depends. So I think Brian's question was probably talking to beyond this year. But I think if you look at the balance of this year, we would see the merchandise margins again up slightly with most of the opportunity coming from Europe, who had a 370 basis point decline in the gross profit margin and the merchandise margin last year, Brian. So I think there's a big opportunity to make up ground there. And all the other businesses we've planned essentially flat in the back half. And I think as we look out beyond that, we think there's continued opportunities for margin improvement. It -- I think it comes from investing in supply chains and systems that allow us to turn our inventories faster, get the right inventory to the right stores. But I would tell you, we have not put any gross margin improvement in our long-range model as we look at the 3-year model that we share at investor conferences and talk about in our one-on-one marketing meetings. There's really no gross margin further improvement baked in there. That said, we think there is opportunity to turn our inventories faster and to drive -- it drives further improvement. It's going to take some improvement in the supply chain and some investments.", "Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And just one more on the gross margin, again. I mean, one of your competitors talks about packaway inventory having higher gross margin but obviously, having distribution costs associated with it. How does your packaway flow through the P&L?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Well, we have a significantly lower level. I think what you're referring to is that -- the competitor you're referring to, when they cap it -- when they have inventory increases, there's cost that gets capitalized in the inventory. As inventories get reduced, those costs flow through. For us, packaway is such a lower percentage of our business that it doesn't really register on our P&L.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Brian, we're under -- we're always under 10%. So it really doesn't have a major effect on our business either way.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Adrianne Shapira.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Carol, just how do you think about it? Things do slow. It does seem as if TJX is better positioned to capitalize on it this time versus last time, given your ramped up marketing initiative and also the fact that 2/3 of the store base has been remodeled over the past 3 years. Just help us think about, how do you think that manifests itself in terms of share gains or profitability?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Right. Well, Adrianne, I think we're planning our business appropriately, conservatively. We're looking at 3 -- 2-, 3-, and 4-year comps. Having said that, I sort of alluded to I'm pretty excited about our marketing plans. And as our stores continue to get remodeled, I think the customer experience gets better and better. But it just keeps coming back to how we execute. And as we just keep raising the bar and the level and the fashion and the value of our products, that's how we're going to build our business. And that's what we believe in. So you know our long-term goal is to get to be a $40 billion company. And I think that's the way we do it. It's detailed, vigilant and constantly upgrading our mix and getting better.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. So then just the follow on is that the fact that the back half comp guidance of 1% to 2% unchanged despite the fact that the ramped up marketing, even the packaway, is starting to be unleashed in the third quarter. How should we think about that guidance in the context of some pretty exciting stuff hitting in the back half?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. Again, it really comes back to being prudent in terms of the way we plan our business and to -- just looking at the 3- and 4-year comp history. And again, coming back to just planning our business and hopefully beating it. And that's our goal.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes, I think, Adrianne, we look at the comps back. So I think if you look on a 2-year basis, you would say it's a very, very conservative plan. If you look on a 3- and 4-year basis, you would say that the numbers we have in for the back half really wind up with those trends. So It really depends. Are you -- does the business behave on more of a 2-year basis, or does it behave more on a 3- to 4-year basis? We're going to find out. But we think the prudent way to look at it is that -- look at that 3-year comps back and plan it that way. And if look -- if you do the numbers, you'll see that Q3 and Q4 really line up with the Q1 and Q2 trends. I said if you look on a 2-year basis, you'd say there's opportunity. I guess we'll find out. We're well positioned for it. We're very, very flexible. You heard Carol saying it's the level of commitment  for inventory commitments this year is less than it was last year. So we've got a lot of open to buy and flexibility to chase, which is exciting.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It's always market plan and chase.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "Jeff, my question is on new store productivity, and I did just have...", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Kimberly, one minute. We're just having trouble hearing you so...", "[Audio Gap]", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, sorry about that. My question is on new store productivity, which looks like it surged here in the second quarter. And we're just trying to parse through it and understand what the contribution was from those new A.J. Wright stores coming in. It looks like, relative to the old A.J. Wright store volumes, even a modest Marmaxx plan would put those store volumes up 10% or 20% relative to the legacy volumes. Is that correct.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Well, yes. I think we're not...", "Carol Meyrowitz", "74 stores, Kimberly, let's start with that.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes, it's a relatively small piece, obviously, of the overall estate. And for that reason, we're not -- there's been a lot of interest that the investing public has had in the store economics for the stores, looking at average sales and contribution margins, et cetera. I guess all I can say is that we're pleased with what we're seeing. We don't really want to break out the economics for these stores separately given that it's a small piece of the overall estate. But we think there's clearly an opportunity there that's why we took the Marmaxx potential up to 2,300 to 2,400. We have seen productive productivity in all of our new stores, not just the A.J. Wright stores. It's interesting that over the last several years, our stores have consistently beat the pro forma models that we have, and then at or slightly under the level of cannibalization that we projected. So we've had a very successful new store program. I think that's what you're seeing. But again, we opened a lot of new stores. I don't want to get into sort of isolating this small segment.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Kimberly, I think the key is we keep learning and we keep increasing the Marmaxx count. So we're today, we're very comfortably at 2,300 to 2,400 stores, which again, is very different from a year ago and hopefully, we'll exist in a year from now and we'll see more opportunity. But we're pretty excited about the Marmaxx chain.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "That makes great sense, Carol. And my clarification was just, I think I heard you correctly, you said in the second quarter with the 4% comp, traffic was up and the average value of a transaction was up as well, driven by higher units per transaction?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, correct.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So ticket's been running flattish, and you're planning for a slight uptick in the second half?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Slight -- slightly. When I say slightly, I mean slightly.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "I think it was up slightly in the quarter, Kimberly, but the units per transaction were a bigger driver of the basket.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We really, really want to read value.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeffrey Black.", "Jeff Black - Citigroup Inc", "Carol, can you talk about Home? On a 2-year basis, it looks like HomeGoods came off a little bit at the end of quarter. What's going on there in terms of traffic and anything to note there in terms of ticket and/or promotional activity that would have accounted for the margin? I think you discussed some A.J. Wright noise in that margin?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I mean, HomeGoods business is very, very strong. Their traffic is up and their inventories are very, very lean. And if you look at the profitability, it's basically 100% the combination of A.J.'s and a slight uptick in advertising. So we feel very, very good about HomeGoods in the back half. We're planning it, I think, appropriately. If you look at, again, a 3 and a 4, even a 2-year comp comparison, we're up against very, very aggressive numbers. But I'm loving the mix, and I feel very, very good about this business in the back half. So the mix in terms of getting the margins to LY and better was strictly those 2 issues, very solid business.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "I just want to be clear here on the facts. So HomeGoods in the first quarter, it was a 6 on a 15, on a minus 1 if you look over 3. It's like 20%, 3 year. And in the second quarter, it was 3 on an 8 on a 9, which is the same. It's the identical trend if you're looking on a 3-year basis. And then, as we look at the back half, we're guiding you at 2 to 3 on top of a 2, on top of a 15, which is that same 20% 3 year stack. So the way we look at it, we think that the trend is entirely consistent in the back half, which we saw in the second quarter, which is entirely consistent with what we saw in the first quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And we are planning segment profits flat, slightly up for HomeGoods in the back half.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rick Patel.", "Rick Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just a question on TJX Europe. You made some nice sequential improvement in that business. Can you just touch upon the geographical performance there and with the recent market volatility over there, I'm just curious which markets you're outperforming and how we should be thinking about the underperforming ones in the back half?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We don't really talk to the different market in the U.K. I can tell you that we had a couple of days with the rioting, and we're back on track. But we don't really break out by regions.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jennifer Davis.", "Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "One clarification and one question, if I may. First, on the $50 million to $75 million in cost reductions, how much have you realized so far, or how much are you planning on realizing in the back half? And then, I was wondering, Carol, if you could talk a little bit about Canada, what you're seeing there? You said that Marshalls, I forget your wording, but basically, it's doing well. So could you talk about maybe what you're seeing at Marshalls versus Winners and maybe some of the trends in Canada?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. In terms of our cost reduction, we're very much on track through the total year. We're actually looking at what our initiatives for next year and trying to put that together because we still think there is opportunity, and we're going to keep doing this every single year. So we're very much on track for the year. And in terms of Canada, I'm going to have Ernie talk to that. We were both up there recently, and we are pretty excited about Marshalls and a couple of areas that he may want to talk about.", "Ernie Herrman", "Jennifer, I think Marshalls, we tried to -- again, this is something which has started a little while ago, so we do want to be too specific. We're bullish on the initial results. It looks good, so we're feeling good. I guess the way to sum it up is for an initial launch business, the way we opened it with a few stores and add another couple, we're happy with the way it's going. In terms of Winners overall, how does that compare? I think Carol mentioned a little bit earlier, we've had a couple of execution issues really centered around the ladies and kids businesses, and I think over the last few months, we're really happy with some of the content shifts we've seen there. I would tell you that I think we're a little shy on some of the fashion items that we could have been into a little bit better way in those areas. But we're really feeling better about it. Carol was just up there recently. We've been seeing some categories turning again better than they were in the past. So we're pretty feeling better about where we're heading about the Winners business, but we want to give a little time.", "Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Are those 2 separate teams for the Marshalls in Canada and Winners?", "Ernie Herrman", "It's actually a bit of a, I guess, you would call it a hybrid. So the teams are, in some ways, the same teams but sometimes we have some focusing being done on one or the other. Primarily, they're the same team, but we do, as with every business, have a specific differentiation categories that we go after. So a little bit earlier, I think, we discussed our shoe business is pretty strong in Marshalls. So again, we have some focus on shoes in Marshalls, that's a little bit different than shoes in Winners, albeit most of the team is the same team.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It's somewhat similar to the way we do Marshalls in that.", "Ernie Herrman", "Right.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dave Weiner.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a question on -- Jeff, just a question on Europe. I think last quarter, you gave some indication on kind of what your internal plan was on comps for the back of the year. So I'm wondering if you could update that? And also, just kind of related to that, as you talk about on the Internet in Europe, it looks like you've been running that -- I don't know exactly for how long, but if you could talk about if you're seeing any contribution yet from that to the overall business?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. I think as you look at the assumptions for Europe for the back half, it's pretty -- it's largely unchanged. We had -- we're still planning at 2 to 4 comps on top of the minus 4. So that hasn't changed. In terms of the profit margin, the reported profit margin would be 6.9% to 7.4% in the back half. But that would include a currency impact. And if you back out the currency impact, it would be up 7 4 to 7 9, so it's about 50 basis point impact there on the -- from currency. So adjusted for currency, 7 4 to 7 9. So it's really largely unchanged. I think the thing we would say is, as you think about the conservatism or aggressiveness of it, we've got a 2 to 4 on top of a minus 4. So on a 2-year stack basis, that's flat to down 2. That same 2-year stack for June and July ran down 3 and for Q2 it ran down 4. So there's a slight improvement that's baked into the comp expectations. And on the bottom line, we had a 370 basis point gross margin hit in Europe last year, and we're assuming we get back a little bit less than half of it this year. So I think we're being appropriately prudent. And I think as it relates to the Internet, not in the motive, that's not a big contribution, and it's not a big hit. It's -- we're really in the mode there of testing, of learning, experimenting, and learning what we can. So it's not a big operation at this point, but it's also not having a negative impact on profits.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Are you doing that in -- are you running that and kind of managing that internally, or you kind of outsourcing that?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. We're running it internally, and actually, it's helping us learn to launch in the U.S. in the future. So we're getting a lot of information from it, but we're keeping it small and tight.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Just because we're running it internally, the one piece that is outsourced is the platform. We haven't developed our own technology platform. We're using a third-party for that.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG", "And how long has it been up? Sorry, last -- the last question. How long has the Internet been up on T.K. Maxx?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It's really not fully up. It's really in a...", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes, it's -- again, we've had it up about 1.5 years now.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It's very isolated in an isolated category.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. It's not the full board what we have in the store. It's some -- it's a handful of categories.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Stacy Pak.", "Stacy Pak - Barclays Capital", "So I'll try not to kill you with my questions as I normally do. So I guess, the sort of big question is, what are you seeing in pricing to you from vendors? Does it seem more or less favorable? What are you seeing in pricing to your customers? Are you taking any pricing, whether it's through mix or otherwise? And did heard the discussion with Kimberly. And what are you seeing in the industry? And then I guess, on the T.K., I wanted to just follow up, and ask -- I guess, I thought I'd see a better margin this quarter because I thought you cleared the inventory. And so I'm wondering what --  could you just help me understand that a little bit better?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. Well, Europe -- first of all, Europe was very much where we thought it would be. And we're going to continue to see progress. So we're not surprised. As a matter of fact, going from where we went from first quarter to second quarter on a flat comp, we're pretty comfortable. And I think we're on our way to seeing better turns and on our way to start comping at a positive zone, which will read extremely well. We're also planning the back half, yes, fast improvement against a year ago certainly. But we're sort of trying to take it halfway and build. We still believe that it's going to continue to build and accelerate, and be a very, very strong business for us. So we're just, again, planning it conservatively. In terms of pricing, Stacy, I mean, we are -- again, we're in the mode of keeping our guidance back. There are a lot of goods out there. There is tremendous value that we think we can bring to the customer whenever there's volatility and it seems like every single year, there's something else going on. I think everybody knows about the cotton prices. The numbers are crazy. They accelerated beyond belief. And now, I think there's something like 50-something percent less than they were when it all started to hike up. So it's going to be very, very interesting. We love our value and what we did with cotton, cashmere, we think we are a tremendous value to our customer. And we're sticking to that. So we think we're going to have an exciting back half. But when things are all over the place, we love it.", "Stacy Pak - Barclays Capital", "And then just as one last follow up, and I promise, that's it. The August number that you gave, the comp guidance looks lighter than I would have thought for the 3-year even, if my math is correct. Is that conservatism -- you know what I'm saying, conservativism or has there been a slowdown at all in August?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, say, what we did was we strategically are keeping our inventory, our in-store inventory very, very lean. Our clearance is way below last year. We're turning faster than last year. We're going to start to slow our packaways, not currently, but very shortly and we're in a great position going forward. But we are keeping our inventories very lean starting this season. And I think it's going to bode very well for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "I guess just a follow up on that, aside from inventory being lean, have you seen any change in the purchasing patterns of the customers, aside from what you're doing internally? And then I guess a little more detail would be helpful on what has enabled you to continue to improve the merchandise margins in the U.S.? Is it mix, is it some of the inventory management initiatives you talked about earlier?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. I mean, the merchandise margins, we are continuing to reduce our in-store inventories. At the end of the year, we will probably be flat in total inventory. Packaways will probably be equivalent to last year or slightly up, but we talked about it a lot. We are investing in our supply chain and a lot of our cost initiatives are -- we're doing so that we can reinvest that money. We're very, very far from really shipping the right goods to the right store at the right time. We still do quite a bit manually. So this is going to be a year-over-year process. It's probably going to take us 2 to 3 years to get through to where we want us to be. But our intent is to reduce our in-store inventories each year slightly, quickening the turn. So it's a combination of that. And obviously, the buying environment, and that changes all the time. So all of that allows us to feel like we can sustain and, hopefully, increase our margins.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Dan, I think in terms of August, our guidance at this point in time would reflect -- obviously, we put our guidance based on what we're seeing with our business. As Carol mentioned, we are managing inventories very conservatively in-store and trying to turn them so that we start to see them leaner. And as we put ourselves in the position to chase in terms of having lower levels and forward commitments. So that's how we're thinking about in managing the business. The other color I'll give you is August is the more -- most challenging comparison versus -- comparisons get easier as we move through September and October in the quarter.", "Ernie Herrman", "Daniel, I'd just like to jump in on one thing on the goods. Some of these things become numbers discussions on the inventory levels, but I think the other thing that's been happening is the buyers have been doing an overall good job at getting the right goods at the right values. As Carol mentioned before, values has been key and top of mind. So obviously, turns have to be a function of the customer boding. They like the goods that are out there. So even if the inventories are lean, and they didn't like the goods, you wouldn't see the turns that we've been seeing. So I have to give our merchants actually, a fair amount of credit on really executing to good mixes. So I thought I'd throw that in.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Okay. That's -- no, that's helpful. I mean, it's not -- I guess, just to paraphrase it, it sounds like maybe there's a little bit of inherent conservatism built in as well, not just in terms of how you're managing the inventory but also what the offtake might be, maybe partly because of the prior-year comparison in August. But maybe also because of the environment. Is that fair to say?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I hope so.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Okay. Free cash flow expectation for the year at this point?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "We expect we'll end of the year with $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which is -- that's the number that we gave you at the beginning of the year, and that's the number we still feel very comfortable with.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I guess just one bookkeeping question is to follow up and also the second, maybe we could dig a little bit more on the e-commerce. So first, bookkeeping, just profitability, operating margin and comps by division, your expectations? If you could detail the guidance a little bit more, that would be helpful.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "You want the back half guidance?", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes, please.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. So the back half, always take it by division. So Marmaxx's for the back half is a 1% to 2% comp store increase. On that, we have segment profit margin at essentially flat. At HomeGoods, a 2% to 3% comp increase, segment profit margin anywhere from down 10 to plus 20 basis points. So for both Marmaxx and HomeGoods, really the segment profit lines up with the -- what we've expected with the comp range. TJX Canada, we're 0 to 1% on the comp. The segment -- the margin we would report is 70 to 80 basis points down. Excluding FX, it's down 160 to 170, that's year-to-date. We are down 120, so there's a little bit more baked in, but we're up against very strong comparisons in Canada, so we're being a little bit conservative on those numbers. TJX Europe, we have a 2 to 4 comp and we have segment profit margin up 220 to 270. On a reported basis, you just strip out foreign exchange, it's up 270 to 320. And again, as a reminder, we had a 370 basis point reduction in our merchandise margins last year. And we're assuming that we get a little bit less than half of that back plus leverage on a forward comp at the high end. So that's how you kind of -- the numbers kind of work there. And for the total company, we've got -- for the back half, I've already given you the EPS numbers. We've got an 11 -- where on sales, we've got $12.3 billion to $12.5 billion. And we've got a pretax margin that's up 20 to 40 basis points. And that's primarily driven by the gross profit margin. G&A is planned flat to 10 basis points of leverage. The balance of that, the 20 to 40 basis point improvement on the bottom line, is gross profit.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "In terms of e-commerce, and we are -- we have no set date. We want to do it right, so that a few times, we want to make money. We are absolutely hiring top talents and getting them involved in our business. And that's part of our bench and part of our cost that we are setting aside. We -- our intention is to really maximize both the brick and mortar and the Internet business and e-commerce to the future. So we're feeling pretty good about it. And again, we're not ready to say when our date is, but we're building the team. And our intent is to do it right.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And the other part of that, the Internet channel as a marketing or relationship building? Obviously, there's some of that going on. Is there opportunity to accelerate that or invest into it?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We are doing a lot of -- again, in the back half, we are shipping a lot of dollars to social networking. I think we're being very smart on how we're handling our marketing dollars, and we're learning a lot about that. So the marriage, again, between the future of where we see the Internet and our business is going to be a combination of various things that we're doing to drive both parties. So we're pretty excited about it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Howard Tubin.", "Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Just one clarification on inventory. The total -- the per store number now that's up 16%, do you envision that coming down over the course of the rest of the year as you flow the packaway into stores, or will that stay up?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, that will be coming down.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. As we look at the end of the year, we think on a per store basis, flat to slightly up. It really depends on the quantity of the packaways that we have at year end, which is somewhat difficult to predict and really depends on the environment we see as we close out the year.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Again, we always do packaways more than 10%, but we'll see. I mean, it could be 5%, it could be 10%. That will be the difference in the year end.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. That's the volatility of the environment right now that we think as a wildcard.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, to Jeff's point, sometimes as we get to the year end and based on what happens with everything around us, those packaway numbers are a little bit unpredictable. But when they -- if they do end up there, it's a good thing because it's buys that we felt were the right branded value.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Could you just tell us what the merchandise margin change was by division in the second quarter? And also, I just wanted to make sure I heard you properly earlier on -- did you say that you expected in the back half merge margin to be flat at all divisions except T.K., you expected up?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "We said, as a company, it's planned flat up in the back half. Clearly, we should get a big lift at Europe so that it would say that essentially, our other divisions in aggregate are planned essentially flat, Paul. So in terms of the second quarter, I think we've already broken it out pretty well. I mean, the -- We've got merchandise margins for the quarter that was flat. And we said, it's up roughly 10 basis points -- in a 10 to 20 basis point range for our North American businesses. So I think that's all the guidance we really want to provide at this point in time.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Does that include the mark-to-market in Canada?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "No, that's all excluding the mark-to-market. So the mark-to-market -- so if you look at the gross profit margin, we've got buying and occupancy leverage. You've got the mark-to-market and then excluding the mark-to-market, the merchandise margins were full -- the pure merchandise margin was flat.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "And -- but specifically in the U.S., were we up in the U.S. and down in Canada? Is that how we should look at it?", "Jeffrey Naylor", "No, you're up in both -- you're actually up in both places. You're up slightly in Canada, which again speaks to the way they manage the inventory. They manage the inventory very lean up there with commitment...", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, it's on a negative 3 comp.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "On a negative 3 comp, to have a merge -- again, it speaks to the flexibility of our model and how, again, as Carol said, zig and zag and respond to opportunities and stay flexible. Not unlike what happened in the fourth quarter of 2008 where you had Armageddon and our merchandise margins were flat. It's the beauty of the model.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Laura Champine.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Most of my questions have been asked, just a final point though on the European pressure in the merged margin, which I know you expect to improve. Is that business structured in a different way because of number of vendors or types of vendors that would keep its merge margin below Marmaxx over the long-term?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, not really, Laura, no.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the Jeff Stein.", "Jeffrey Stein - Ticonderoga Securities LLC", "Carol, I'm interested in your comment regarding your pricing plans for the back half of the year. So are you going into the fall with lower initial mark-ups due to the fact that you're keeping your AUR up only slightly, or are you just buying better, which is allowing you to maintain your initial mark on?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, our mark on is pretty much -- pretty flat, pretty similar to where we planned it. And we see opportunity in mark downs. We'll see how the back half goes. But you got to remember that we're far from being bought up in the back half. So we've got a long way to go.", "Jeffrey Stein - Ticonderoga Securities LLC", "And your marketing spend for the back half of the year, is it planned to be up as a percent to total sales?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No. It's flat in terms of percent, slightly up in dollars but much, much greater penetration. We have a completely different -- not a completely, but a different strategy from last year. So you're going to see it a lot more on TV, and we're pretty excited about it.", "Operator", "Our final question today is from Mark Montagna.", "Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC", "Just a question about Europe and Canada. Europe struggled for about a year, Canada, for just about 6 months. And you had indicated your confidence in Canada for the second half. What's the difference between the 2 in terms of why so -- such confidence in such a short term on Canada versus how long it's up for Europe?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Ernie?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. I think a primary difference is, and we've talked about this before, in Europe, we grew probably too fast, all right? In Canada, we did not. So Canada's more of a short-term execution issue where we, I'd say, we took our eyes off the ball really in a couple of areas. In Europe, again, some of the infrastructure I'd call it was strained with the quick growth. So it takes a little bit longer to come out of that type of situation, I'd say at a high level, those have -- that's really the key difference between the with 2.", "Jeffrey Naylor", "Yes. As we've been talking about, as we've been talking about at the meeting with investors, it really is a function of kind of outgrowing the ability of the organization to support the growth, support the business. And whereas in Canada, that hasn't been the case. We've got a real experienced team up there, and we're confident that will -- can come back more quickly.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. And with -- and I think we talked about a little bit earlier, in Canada, again, we've already seen a little bit of life in 2 of the areas that were actually a bit of a struggle for us fairly recently. So I think a quicker turn than we even experienced out of Europe, where some of the things did not happen as quickly all over there. Now again, we're seeing some improvements in categories that in Europe were slow prior. So we're feeling good also in Europe. And we're also looking at the availability of what's happening with key branded goods over there. And that's looking pretty good for us going forward. But very different, very different issues to -- that started the problem, so are the execution issues. And so different ways of coming out of it.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I want to thank everyone, and we look forward to reporting our third quarter.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Wednesday, February 27, 2013.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thank you, Elonne [ph] . And before we begin, Sherry has a few words.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially.

Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis. Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website, www.tjx.com.", "Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today's press release or otherwise posted on our website, again, www.tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Finally, our fiscal '13 full year and fourth quarter comparable store sales are for the 52- and 13-week periods ended January 26, 2013, versus the same periods last year.", "Thank you. And I'll turn it to Carol now.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Good morning, everyone. And joining me and Sherry on the call today are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg.", "And 2012 was another great year for TJX, on top of many great years. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 28% and our 5-year compound annual EPS growth was 21%. We achieved this profit growth on sales of nearly $26 billion in 2012, which was almost $3 billion more than 2011. Consolidated comps were up an extremely strong 7%, over 4% in the prior year. This marks the fourth consecutive year of very strong sales and double-digit EPS growth in a very competitive retail environment and volatile economy.", "All of our divisions delivered excellent results, and we begin a new fiscal year in a great position to continue our strong performance. After so many years of strong performance, we hear the question a lot out there, how are you going to keep this going?", "So let me be clear, we are very confident that our top and bottom line growth is far from over. In 2013, despite fewer selling days in the retail holiday calendar, we are maintaining our 10% to 13% long-term annual EPS growth model. It's important to recognize that we are maintaining this model while we plan to continue investing in our future growth in 2013, including our brick-and-mortar business, e-commerce and supply chain. We are confident that we will achieve these plans. And at the same time, we certainly have a management team that is passionate about striving to surpass these goals.", "As confident as we are in the near future, as CEO of this company, I will tell you that I'm even more excited about the long term, which will be the focus of our call today. With our brands, fashion and value mission, we have tremendous opportunities for the future, and we are well on the road to being a $40-billion company and beyond.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Scott so he can recap the numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Just to remind you that the fiscal '12 adjusted numbers we refer to today exclude the impact of the A.J. Wright consolidation.", "Now to recap our full year fiscal '13 results. Net sales for the 53-week fiscal year reached $25.9 billion, a 12% increase over last year. Consolidated comparable store sales on a 52-week basis were up by a very strong 7%, well exceeding our expectations, and on top of very strong increases in the 3 prior years. Diluted earnings per share were $2.55, a 28% increase over last year's adjusted $1.99. This year's results included approximately an $0.08 per share benefit from the 53rd week in our fiscal '13 calendar.", "On an adjusted 52-week basis, EPS growth was up 24% on top of increases of 14%, 23% and 48% in the last 3 years. Foreign currency exchange rates had a neutral impact on EPS, which is the same as last year.", "For the full year, the consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.9%, a 120-basis-point increase over last year's adjusted margin and above our expectations, primarily driven by merchandise margin improvement and expense leverage on our above-plan sales. The 53 week -- the 53rd week also benefited pretax margins by an estimated 20 basis points. Gross profit margin increased 100 basis points above last year's adjusted margin, again, driven primarily by merchandise margin improvement at all divisions and expense leverage.", "SG&A expense improved 10 basis points over last year's adjusted ratio. A number of items impacted SG&A during the year, partially offsetting our expense leverage. These items include a contribution to The TJX Foundation, as well as the third quarter items detailed in today's press release, which together had a 30-basis-point unfavorable impact.", "As to inventories, at the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the warehouses, were down 6%. We begin the fiscal year with excellent inventory levels and very well positioned to buy into the plentiful opportunities we see in the marketplace, and continue shipping fresh merchandise to our stores.", "In terms of share repurchases for the year, we bought back $1.3 billion of TJX stock, retiring 30.6 million shares. During the fourth quarter, we bought back $350 million of TJX stock, retiring 8.1 million shares. After reinvesting in growth, increasing shareholder distributions through our dividend and buyback programs and acquiring Sierra Trading Post in fiscal '13, we still ended the year with $2 billion in cash and short-term investments.", "Now to recap fourth quarter results. Net sales for the 14-week fiscal quarter were $7.7 billion, a 15% increase over last year. Consolidated comp store sales increased a strong 4% over a 7% increase in the prior year. EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.82, a strong 32% increase on top of 3 years of very strong growth. The 53rd week also positively impacted EPS by approximately $0.08 in the fourth quarter. In addition, foreign currency rate -- exchange rates had a $0.01 positive impact compared with a neutral impact in the prior year.", "Consolidated pretax profit margins were 12.5%, a 120-basis-point increase over the prior year. The increase was largely driven by merchandise margin improvement, with some expense leverage on our above-plan comp [ph] . The 53rd week had a 60-basis-points positive impact on pretax margins.", "The gross profit margin was up 140 basis points, driven by merchandise margin improvement. SG&A increased 20 basis points with expense leverage on our strong sales, more than offset by approximately 50 basis points from the impact of our contribution to The TJX Foundation, higher incentive compensation accruals due to the above-plan results and transaction expenses related to the Sierra Trading Post acquisition.", "Now let me turn the call back to Carol, and I will recap our first quarter and full year '14 guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Scott. Before I move to longer term, I'll highlight some divisional numbers for 2012, which were terrific.", "In the U.S., Marmaxx and HomeGoods delivered excellent performance, with comps up 6% and 7%, respectively, on top of 3 years of great results. Internationally, TJX Canada delivered a strong 5% comp sales increase. And TJX Europe had an outstanding year, with comps up 10% and segment profit up threefold over the prior year.", "Since our strong performance year-over-year speaks for itself, let me move to the future and our many opportunities to continue driving top and bottom line growth.", "First, we are convinced we will continue to attract more U.S. and international customers with our value. In 2012, customer traffic increased for the fifth consecutive year. Our comp growth has been driven by customer traffic since 2008, and we have also widened our demographic reach over that same time. Most recently, we've been excited to see a larger percentage of younger customers among our new U.S. customers, which bodes very well for our future.", "While we have grown our customer base in the last several years, our market penetration remains well below department store levels, which indicates to us that we have significant opportunities to continue to gain market share. We will continue working to attract and retain more new customers with our aggressive marketing, upgrading shopping experience, many in-store initiatives and above all, our extreme value.", "The next major opportunity is global store growth. We don't know where the end game is. But today, we see the potential to expand our store base by over 50% with our current chains in our current markets alone. We are raising our estimates today for how big we believe our U.S. businesses can be. And internationally, we will continue to see vast opportunities.", "At Marmaxx, we still have plenty of room to profitably grow our largest division. We are raising our long-term potential for Marmaxx to 2,400 to 2,600 stores, which is 100 to 200 more stores than our prior thinking. Marmaxx's consistent excellent results give us great confidence and the performance of our new stores have been outstanding, significantly beating our performance over the last 4 years. Further, we have been very successful in expanding the geographic opportunities for Marmaxx, opening up in many smaller, more rural markets, as well as large cities, like New York. We also continue to widen Marmaxx's demographic reach.", "We also see HomeGoods as an even bigger business than our prior thinking. We are raising our long-term view for HomeGoods to 750 to 825 stores versus our prior estimate of 750 stores. HomeGoods has also driven consistently strong results for several years, and its 2012 fleet of new stores significantly outperformed performance.", "Internationally, we see enormous growth potential for TJX. TJX Europe had a fantastic year in 2012, which is very encouraging for this important growth vehicle. Segment profit margin reached 6.6% in 2012, about a 400-basis-point increase over last year. Further, we are seeing broad-based strength across geographic -- geographies in very different economic climates.", "In Europe, we believe our opportunities are nothing short of staggering. For now, we see the long-term potential to grow to up to 875 stores, with just our current chains in our current countries alone. While we're still relatively small compared to 875 stores and don't want to get ahead of ourselves, we could see this number moving upwards in the future.", "In 2013, we will be steadily growing our store base as we take a prudent approach to growth.", "In Canada, we continue to see significant growth ahead. The launch of Marshalls has been successful. Marshalls has reached profitability in less than 2 years, underscoring our ability to expand profitably, internationally. We see the potential to expand this chain to about 100 stores in Canada. Overall, we believe TJX Canada has the potential to grow to about 430 stores.", "Beyond our current portfolio, we see many opportunities for global growth. However, we have brought our off-price concept around the world, our value proposition has resonated -- I'm sorry, wherever we have brought our off-price concept around the world, our value proposition has resonated with our consumers. We believe we are the only retailer in the world with our deep understanding and experience in successfully bringing the off-price concept to different countries, and that this is greatly underappreciated by others.", "In Germany, our 4-wall store contributions are approaching Marmaxx levels, which speaks to how much we have learned. We see our international knowledge as a tremendous advantage for future geographic expansion.", "Now to e-commerce, which we know is a topic on a lot of your minds. Our goal is to launch our T.J. Maxx website in a controlled small test mode in the back half of this year. As we have been saying all along, we believe e-commerce will be a huge opportunity for TJX, but we will take our time to do it right and make money doing it. More importantly, we will not disappoint our customers. It is also important to understand that with the success of our brick-and-mortar businesses, we view e-commerce as another way to reach consumers with our great value. Whether brick-and-mortar, e-commerce or mobile, we will be targeting an extremely wide customer demographic. Again, while we intend to start slowly, long term, we do see this as a great opportunity to the future of TJX.", "We were absolutely delighted to add Sierra Trading Post, an off-price Internet retailer, to our family of businesses in December. We will run Sierra as its own banner as we develop our TJX e-commerce initiatives. We are excited about the opportunities to gain leverage in both businesses. Sierra Trading Post is truly a diamond in the rough. We see Sierra providing immediate scale, giving us tremendous knowledge and infrastructure for our e-commerce initiatives. In turn, they can use TJX's merchandising strength to build their brand further.", "As we have brought Sierra into the fold, we really like the Sierra organization and people, and already see our similar corporate cultures working extremely well together. We believe the synergies between Sierra and TJX will yield very positive results in the medium and long term.", "The next major factor giving us confidence in our top and bottom line growth is our supply chain opportunities. As we pointed out many times, running with leaner inventories over the last several years has done great things for our business. It allows us to buy closer to need, giving us the ability to drive higher merchandise margins. It has also led to a more exciting shopping experience and better values in our stores, which we believe has driven customer traffic and the top line.", "The key here is that we are continuing with our supply chain investments to become even more precise at delivering the right goods to the right store at the right time. We are being very deliberate with this initiative, so we still have about 2 more years before we expect to start seeing the benefits from our investments.", "To wrap up on our future growth, I want to emphasize that while we clearly planned for the year ahead and have a 3-year growth model, our strategic vision for TJX goes well beyond that. As a management team, we are laser focused on sharp execution in the near term but are simultaneously looking forward to the future, aiming to position this company for successful growth for many, many years to come. We encourage intelligent risk taking, sharing ideas across divisions and test many new initiatives, constantly finding new ways to grow.", "In 2013, we will continue our investments to support our growth, investing in infrastructure, store growth and e-commerce as we position TJX for the next phase of growth and for fulfilling our vision of being a $40-billion-plus company.", "So summing up, I hope that I've shared with you today -- hoping that what I've shared with you today helps you understand why I'm so excited about the future and confident in our top and bottom line growth. All of our businesses delivered terrific performance in 2012, which we can build and capitalize upon in 2013 and beyond. We are growing our U.S. and international customer base and attracting younger customers for the future. We have increased our long-term growth estimates for our current portfolio and may move up the end game in the future.", "We are excited about leveraging the success of our brick-and-mortar businesses with e-commerce, another platform for our value proposition. Further, we are confident that our supply chain improvements will continue to be meaningful top and bottom line drivers.", "Beyond this, we believe we have so many new seeds to plant for our future successful growth. Our management team is focused on 4 large powerful divisions, which we expect to continue to leverage as we grow. As always, the extreme flexibility of our business model and our financial strength gives us tremendous confidence. As we begin a new fiscal year, our winning formula has not changed. We will continue to raise the bar in execution of all the elements of our off-price business model that we have made -- that have made this company great.", "Finally, above all, we remain focused on our value mission to be a retailer for today and for tomorrow.", "And now I'll turn it over to Scott, and he'll go through guidance. And then we'll open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol. Before I move to guidance, I'll cover a couple of points. In terms of where Sierra Trading Post and our TJX e-commerce initiatives are reflected, both for guidance and reporting, they are included in our Marmaxx segment.", "Also, as we've said in our press release today, beginning with the second quarter of fiscal '14, we will no longer be reporting sales on a monthly basis. Instead, we will move to a quarterly reporting practice. While reporting monthly comps has been the retail industry standard for many years, the vast majority of retailers has now discontinued this practice. We believe that moving to quarterly reporting is the right thing for our company and our shareholders, as it reflects the long-term approach we take in planning and running our businesses.", "Now I'll move to fiscal '14 guidance, beginning with the full year. For modeling purposes, I'll remind you that fiscal '14 is a 52-week year compared with the 53-week period in fiscal '13.", "For the full year, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.66 to $2.78 over $2.55 in fiscal '13. Again, fiscal '13 included an $0.08 benefit from the 53rd week. Excluding the extra week, fiscal '14 full-year EPS would be 8% to 13% over the prior year's adjusted $2.47. Our EPS guidance assumes consolidated top line sales of about $26.8 billion to $27.1 billion, a 3% to 5% increase over the 53-week period.", "For comp store sales, we are assuming a 1% to 2% increase over both -- increase, both on a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group.", "For the year, we expect pretax profit margins to be 11.7% to 12.0%. This would be down 20 to up 10 basis points versus 11.9% in fiscal '13. Again, the 53rd week contributed approximately 20 basis points of growth in fiscal '13. We're planning gross profit margins to be 28.1% to 28.3%, which is down 10 to 30 basis points versus fiscal '13, which again, benefited from the 53rd week.", "We expect SG&A in fiscal '14 to be approximately 16.2% to 16.3% of sales versus 16.4% last year. Foreign currency exchange rates, assuming current levels, are expected to have a $0.01 negative impact on full year EPS growth versus a neutral impact last year.", "In fiscal '14, we plan to continue to balance the use of cash between investing to support our growth and returning excess cash to shareholders. We're planning capital spending in the $925 million to $950 million range. Our investments in store growth and remodels are planned similar to last year, and we will also continue our investments in our distribution network, systems and home office facilities.", "We are planning a stock buyback in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and expect that our Board of Directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 26% on top of our 21% increase last year. Even with this level of shareholder distribution, we still plan to end fiscal '14 with approximately $1.7 billion in cash, which provides significant financial flexibility.", "For modeling purposes, we're planning a tax rate of 38.2%, net interest expense of approximately $29 million and a weighted average share count of 724 million shares.", "Now to Q1 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.62, a 7% to 13% increase over last year's $0.55 per share. We're assuming a first quarter top line of approximately $6.2 billion. This is based on comp sales growth of flat to up 2%, both on a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group.", "As to monthly comps, for February, we expect consolidated comps to be approximately flat versus a 9% increase last year. At the Marmaxx Group, we expect February comps to be down 1% versus 8% increase last year.", "For the combined March, April period, both on a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group, we are planning comp sales to be in the range of 1% to 3%. In March, we are planning comps in the range of down 2% to flat on a consolidated basis, and a decrease of 1% to 3% at Marmaxx. In April, we are planning comp store growth in the range of 6% to 8%, both on a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx.", "First quarter pretax margins are planned to be 11.4% -- in the 11.4% to 11.8% range, flat to down 40 basis points versus the prior year. We're anticipating first quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 21 -- 28.1% to 28.4%, down 10 to up 20 basis points versus the prior year.", "We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 16.4% to 16.5%, a 20 to 30 basis point increase versus last year. This is due to timing of incremental investment spending to support our growth, which we expect will have a greater impact in the first quarter but flat year-over-year, as well as deleverage from e-commerce expenses.", "Foreign currency exchange rates, assuming current levels, are expected to have a $0.01 negative impact on this year compared to a $0.01 negative impact last year.", "For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.2%, net interest expense of about $7 million, and we anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 733 million.", "Finally, our guidance for the first quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels.", "I'll wrap up with our store growth plans for fiscal '14. On a consolidated basis, we plan to add about 165 new stores, with about 15 planned closings. This will result in approximately 150 net new stores for a total of about 3,200 stores planned by year end, increasing square footage by approximately 5%, which is at the high end of our 3-year growth model.", "In the U.S., with the continued excellent results and new store performance at Marmaxx and HomeGoods, we will continue our aggressive expansion of these businesses. Our plans call for us to net 75 new stores at Marmaxx and 30 new stores at HomeGoods.", "Internationally, we continue to grow our store base steadily. At TJX Canada, we plan to add about 20 new stores in fiscal '14, including 13 Marshalls stores. At TJX Europe, we expect to add around 25 new stores this year.", "Now we are happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And now we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jeffrey Stein.", "Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research", "Wondering if you can -- and Carol could possibly talk about what's kind of been going on in February? If we kind of call around, we're hearing that the early part of the month was pretty tough because of the weather and then some concerns over increase in payroll tax, higher gas prices, delay in tax refunds. Wondering if you've seen this in your business, given the fact that you now have virtually the entire month behind you?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Jeff, first of all, we are not seeing any difference in terms of the demographics. Whether it's a $50,000 income area or below or higher income, we're not seeing a difference. We are truly, truly being affected by weather. I mean, the difference is so dramatic between New England, which is comping negatively, and the Southeast and Florida, which is comping positively. We almost see it to a day. A few days after the snowstorm, as to the Midwest, we saw huge comp increases. In addition, our clearance levels are slightly below last year. We kept our inventory very lean in the colder zones strategically, because we knew it was going to be a colder and snowier month. So this is really absolutely a weather story for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jennifer Davis.", "Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "My question is, of course, on e-commerce. Could you talk a little bit about what the site will look like? Will it be like Sierra Trading Post or more like a flash sale website or maybe a little bit of elaboration there?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It's going to like T.J. Maxx, and it's going to be great value and it's going to be very, very exciting. Sierra Trading, we are so thrilled with this acquisition and the combination of what we can bring to Sierra Trading, which we're not going to toy with because they are a great company. What we can bring to them is tremendous leverage. We can bring to them, certainly, financial backing, market penetration, the ability to get access to many new vendors and vice versa. In turn, they are absolutely brilliant in their analytics. They have a wonderful platform. We are less than 2 months into this and each day, we're finding more and more areas that we can leverage each other. But for right now, they're going to be a separate entity. In addition, they have a wonderful outdoor business, which we think could be very, very interesting for us in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Baker.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Geez, tons to ask here. I guess, I want to ask about the corporate G&A line. I think you've been investing a lot in e-commerce and systems and the like there. So it's been -- it's actually up, I think, 2x over the last years and up 47% this year. Should we expect that line item to continue to grow, grow at a slower pace, flatten out? Are we sort of past the investment stage of e-commerce? How should we think about that line?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Scott? Our investments are flattening out. Scott, you want to go through...", "Scott Goldenberg", "He asked a couple of different questions. I'll try to do one, so the difference there. In terms of corporate expenses, this year, clearly, we had a large increase in corporate expenses, the increase largely due to foundation, higher incentive accruals, a little with our STP transaction expenses and the third quarter items that we talked about, and the closed store expenses that we, again, talked about in the third quarter. Next year, we expect a significant decrease in our corporate expenses, from in and around the range of this year's $333 million to approximately $285 million next year. And again, it's the reversing of not spending as much money, although we'll still be spending in the foundation, not having -- we're anniversary-ing that closed store reserve and less -- a little less spending on the incentive accrual. So the bottom line is we have normal growth, but we do have a significant reduction in corporate expenses. As regards to incremental investment spending, we were on plan this year just to reiterate that, but it did have a -- certainly, there was a growth. But over next year compared to this year, we have a level spending in our incremental investments. So it's still spending in some of the same areas, systems, talent, DC, supply chain. But again, it is leveling off this year compared to the spend of last year.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Perfect. It makes sense. If I could slide in one more. I'm intrigued by Germany approaching Marmaxx 4-wall contributions. Any reason why the other countries can't do that? And then does, ultimately, Europe hit the Marmaxx total margins or is the infrastructure greater there such that it never gets to that level?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, we're learning more and more about each country. We're pretty happy with Poland. I think another area that's very interesting is our home businesses because both Canada and HomeGoods have been absolutely staggering. And Ernie will tell you a little bit about the momentum at HomeSense. The costs in Europe are a bit higher, so I'm not going to sit here and tell you that it's going to reach Marmaxx's level. We've given a model of, I think, about 8%. But obviously, in my heart, I think we can surpass that as we leverage it because we have 850 stores in the mix today. But we'll -- obviously, year-after-year, I think there is more potential there, and we'll be able to leverage it a little bit better. But costs are greater. But Ernie here, he was just over in Europe.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Michael, I was just there few weeks ago. And one of the things we've obviously fixed over there is the execution in Germany. And as we've done that, the 4-wall contribution has gone up significantly. I guess, before we start thinking about what the other countries could mean, Germany still has a lot of room for growth for us. So yes, we're excited about the potential. But like everything else, we like to be conservative in our expectations where we could go there. But it is -- as we like to say, Germany is one of the biggest potentials we see and a country the we're already in, and Carol had that in the script. On HomeSense, as we talked about, same iteration, we only have about 25 stores over there. So lots of opportunity with HomeSense, which has shown consistent performance, as Carol just alluded to, during this past year. Our home business, in general, has been healthy, but HomeSense, specifically in U.K., has been very strong. The other thing we're looking at, given the environment in the U.K. and in Europe, is there should be -- like we are with everything else, there should be some real estate opportunities. Things are tough over there. So we might find similar real estate opportunities actually in the U.K. in a place where we were starting to get at the upper end of our store count. However, there's some great real estate sites that may show up, so we're pretty bullish on that as well. So I guess all that says, yes, we think the profit model could go up there. But as always, we want to be conservative in our expectations. The other thing I wanted to bring up and this kind of plays into the real estate opportunity discussion we talked about earlier, when we're talking about the weather, similar to real estate, weather situations out there create opportunities for us in this model of business with opportunistic buying. So that is something everyone should keep in mind. We may get hit with the weather in the short term, but there might be a benefit later.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I also think, as Ernie is getting that execution going, and Michael, HomeSense, years ago, we didn't see the real estate opportunities. There may be some tremendous advantages there in the next period of time for us to even increase our HomeSense store count, so we're going to take a look at that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Tunick.", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So I guess 2 questions. First, just trying to understand inventory per store, down significantly. You're still making supply chain investments, I guess. Just wondering, particularly at Marmaxx now, what do you think the opportunity is to continue to find merchandise margin expansion? And then where are the inventory turns sort of now across the different businesses? I know HomeGoods had been where you made your investment. So where are they there versus the other chains?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Brian, we don't really talk about our specific turns. I can tell you that we certainly are turning a lot faster this year than we did a year ago, so we are pretty pleased. So do we see more opportunities? I mean, Marmaxx is planning their inventories a little bit lower this year. I think a lot of this remains to be seen. Because I talked about, probably for the last 2 years, about our investment in our supply chain. So we really don't know what that's going to yield. And we still think there's this great opportunity in shipping more perfectly, regionally, by category, by store. And we really won't know what that's going to yield, probably until 2 to 3 years out, when we get all our systems in play. So again, what we're doing right now is a little bit more, I won't say, totally manually, on a $26 billion business all manually, but more manually than we would like to, which just doesn't give us all the opportunity. So certainly, in Canada, there are some chains that have more opportunity to bring the inventories lower this year than last year, but we don't really know the end game to this yet. So again, we plan conservatively, and we hope very much to beat our plans.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-on with Carol. You've talked about the supply chain improvements and a couple of years out before we see these things impact. Is it simply software or is it more than software? If you could you talk about the various investments and how you see them playing out, software, DCs, in-store hardware, et cetera.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It's mostly software. It's mostly DC and software. It's not as much in-store. But obviously, as you move your inventories a little bit leaner, your stores operate more efficiently, and it's easier for the in-store labor to function and drive sales harder. But that's really where mostly our investments are. When we get the Marmaxx West Coast DC in, a very large portion of our goods come in  through the West Coast, which is going to allow us to get to the stores a lot quicker. And it's both -- it's a regional and a chain DC, so we're pretty excited about that.", "Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Is it just one additional DC or there are several on the books?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We have shipping centers. We have a whole strategy. We have a whole game plan on our supply chain, which includes the Marmaxx DC. We're looking at some changes in HomeGoods in the future, which we will be investing in, to make that chain move quicker and more efficiently. And then we also use shipping centers, strategically. We add them in so that we can, again, get to the services stores faster. And sometimes, in some cases, even ship a store once or twice a day, if they're in a big city.", "Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Right. So this is all part of the supply chain initiative?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It's all part of supply chain initiative, exactly.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Oliver Chen.", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Regarding your outlook for the comps in first quarter and next year, could you speak to us a little bit about what metric may moderate in terms of you forecasting low single-digit range versus the tremendous year you're coming off of? And as a follow-up, your earlier comments regarding the widening demographic, could you just elaborate on -- is that driven by your marketing or your product efforts? And also your comment on market penetration in regards to department store reach, could you just help us understand what that may mean quantitatively?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, we're pretty much going in with the same model that we went in a year ago. Again, it's very important for us to work hard at putting a model together that makes sense, being somewhat conservative and beating that plan. So we don't look at the metrics and go, \"Well, this is exactly what we think we're going to do.\" We look at it logically. We look at it last year. We look at it on a long-term trend. But having said that, last year, we put out a 0% to 2% and we ended up with a 7% comp. So we strive to beat the numbers. In terms of the wider demographics, as we learn to ship our stores better and, again, getting more focused by region, we find that an income level of $50,000 works for us and we have customers that are in an income level of millions. We just have a very, very wide demographic, and that's what's exciting about our business. Our market penetration in relationship to department stores is they have 35% plus and we are way under that, so that, again, gives us tremendous opportunity to grow. The last point that is very important is we have stores that are 18 years old that are still comping. There's not a lot of companies that can say that. We talked about the end game, we don't really know what an average store ultimately can end up doing. But our job is to take each individual store and figure out how we can drive sales in it.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Oliver, I'll just jump on, on one thing. On the conservative comps, one other thing to remember is, in our model, because we buy so close to need, we're able to chase. So we're able to -- no matter how conservative the plans are, as witnessed by what Carol said about last year, we're able to well outperform. And a lot of that is because of the model that we execute to. It allows us to, when things are good, continue to drive harder. And if it slows up, we can pull it back a little. So again, that's always something to keep in mind, I think.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes. Having said that, I don't think a lot of retailers were able to pull back their inventory as quickly as we did for February, looking at it by zone. It's the flexibility of the model. It's really a wonderful model.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Morris.", "John D. Morris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I think it's for Ernie. Talk a little bit more about where you saw the strength in the assortment at Marmaxx in the U.S.? And you mentioned in your prepared remarks, maybe diving a little bit deeper into that, that you saw strength coming from some of the younger customers. And so maybe if you can tell us what's driving that? Is it -- what kind of product? Is it the product? And maybe talk about it in terms of a girls versus guys strength?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes, I would say, John, it's actually more about, I guess, age than it is about gender. So we have -- and Carol has talked about this before, we have tried to go after the younger customer, and it's interesting. That was I think part of -- in Oliver's question, he was asking demographic-wise, if product was part of the places that we've had a shift, and it is, and that we've gone after some more of the younger departments. I would tell you the success in the younger departments is we've been in an environment where there's plenty of opportunities in the market in the younger demographic -- younger age department, so that's really what we've driven hard. It's not really gender-based. It's really more about an age-based thing, which is, I think, what you were getting at. So we look at that, again, as part of the future. We want to capture the younger customer earlier so that they're our customer for us down the road.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "So I think the other thing is our business, what is exciting is, even going into February, is our ladies apparel business is very strong. Our turns are terrific. So that really bodes well so that we have a home business that's very, very strong. And we believe that home across the board is going to be much stronger this year as percent to total for a lot of businesses. But having said that, our apparel business looks pretty healthy, so that absolutely bodes well for the future.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Howard Tubin.", "Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "You had some great TV ads running during the fourth quarter. What are your -- maybe you can give us an update on your marketing plans for 2013 in TV, in 2013 versus 2012.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I can tell you that our penetration is going to be even stronger. Our impressions are way up this coming year. We are really excited. It's probably a year that, again, we are going to leverage even greater than we did a year ago. We are finding when our brands are working together, they're taking the best of the best of each of their campaigns and they're using it. So some of the campaigns that work in the States, work in Canada, vice versa in Europe, which is allowing us to do things we haven't done before. Our tri-branding is absolutely terrific. Nan up in Canada is doing some very interesting new things. We are just getting more and more knowledge and more analytics around our marketing. So I think you're going to be pretty pleased. In addition to the impressions going up, Marmaxx is going to be on TV more weeks this year, which is exciting. And you'll be seeing some new things that you haven't seen before.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just wanted to, I guess, get into the guidance a little bit from the standpoint of -- I know a year ago, your initial plan was basically the same comp guidance for 20 -- for the past year. Are you thinking there's the opportunity to deliver this type of upside again? I mean, not to hold you to it at this early stage, but is there anything that is becoming -- from a market share standpoint, you're seeing some of the full price retailers doing a little bit better? Do you think -- is that still the biggest opportunity for upside in earnings, from just sales and leveraging fixed costs?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Dan, we are going to do what we do best. And I'd be out of my mind to sit here and say, \"We'll just do a 7% comp again.\" Again, we are -- we do everything and strive to beat our plans. We are very excited. But we have to execute our business, and that's what we're focused on.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Yes, I mean, do you feel like merchandise margins have similar opportunities going forward? Or is it more going to be driven on just how strong the sales are versus your initial plan?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Ernie is going to do everything in his power to drive sales and drive the business. That's what we all focus on.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "And actually, Dan, I have a comment here from -- if you think back in Carol's speech where she said, \"We have a management team that is really passionate,\" and I would tell you, they are very passionate about driving sales. Their intention is to not just deliver the planned sales. But again, we can't commit beyond that as to what that means. All I can tell you is they are driven to drive sales.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Roxanne Meyer.", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I was wondering -- I know you mentioned that weather played a big role in the February performance. I was just thinking about how other companies are also talking about the change in tax refund timing, increase in payroll tax. I was wondering if you had any comments about the change in consumer behavior, spending pattern, as a result of those things. And also, can you comment on the comp and margin contribution of some of your smaller rural stores versus other stores? And really, over time, what percentage of the fleet do you think will come from some of these smaller markets?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I mean, I can just tell you, our small and rural stores, we make a lot of money with and we'll continue building in there. As I said before, February is, across the board, I really don't -- for us, we're not necessarily seeing this change in the payroll tax and affecting our business. It's across the board, and it's very, very weather-related. So I really can't comment on other retailers.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Carol, it looks like about 11 of the 145 stores that you opened last year were in Europe. And I'm wondering, given what a great future opportunity that is, what is your plan for 2013 store openings in Europe? And what is it that you're looking for to drive an acceleration in the store opening rate there?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I think we're moving -- is it 21 or 26 stores?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "25, I think.", "Scott Goldenberg", "25.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "25, yes. We're moving to 25 stores. As I said before, what we don't want to do is to make the same mistake we made a few years ago and grow too quickly, so we are increasing the number. If there are some terrific real estate deals, Ernie and the team will definitely go after them. So if the number comes up a couple of stores, so be it if it makes sense. But I think that feels really good, and then we'll see what happens by the end of the year. We're still building the infrastructure. We're still building the talent. We're still teaching. Again, each time, each year, they get better and smarter, we'll be more comfortable about ramping up slightly.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Carol, given the sort of human resources constraints around that growth, is there a sort of upper limit that you have in mind in terms of either a number of store openings per year or a growth rate that you would prefer not to exceed in order to make sure that you've got the right infrastructure in place to support that growth?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It depends by brand. Marmaxx is obviously a lot easier for us. HomeGoods is -- again, we ramped that up a few years ago. In Canada, we are ramping the talent because of Marshalls, a new chain. In Europe, we talked a little bit about HomeSense opportunity. Different countries, you want to make sure that you have the right talent base there. So that would be a little bit more of an aggressive build. So between Europe and Canada, you really want to get that talent in place.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Kimberly, on that initial plan on Europe, that's where we've had a major focus on the talent build. Because we talked in the past, that's where we had to play catch-up a little bit. And we think we made a lot of progress there these last 12 months, a lot of progress. So we'll start to get more comfortable with more stores there as time goes on. But like Carol said, we want to do it in a very orderly, orderly timeframe.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Every year under our belt is a lot better.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "A lot better.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Montagna.", "Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Just a question about your guidance. I think, normally on this call, you also give your fiscal year guidance for segment profit margins by division.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Scott will get you that.", "Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "If I might have missed it, can you just -- can you review that?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, Scott?", "Scott Goldenberg", "No, you didn't miss that, Mark, so I'll take you through the ...", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We were waiting for that question.", "Scott Goldenberg", "So just to get 2 things out of the way. Again, the 53-week calling out had an approximate 20 basis point benefit to fiscal '13. I'm going to be presenting the numbers on a 52-over-52-week basis and, again, x FX. Starting with Marmaxx, we have a comp plan of 1% to 2% against last year's 6% comp; segment margin guidance of 14.1% to 14.4% against last year's 14.5%; and sales, $17.6 billion to $17.8 billion. Moving to HomeGoods, guidance of 0% to 2% comp against last year's 7%, with a range of 11.8% to 12.1% against last year's 12%; and sales, approximately $2.8 billion. Canada, down 1% to up 1%, so a flattish comp on last year's 5%; with guidance 13.6% to 14.0% against last year's 14.0%, with sales of approximately $3 billion. Europe, 2% to 4% comp against last year's strong 10%; 6.7% to 7.2%, recall 7.2% is the highest we ever had in Europe, and that was a few years ago, against last year's 6.2%; a 50 to 100 basis point improvement on $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion in sales. And again, recapping, Marmaxx, a 1% to 2% comp on a 7% last year guidance; 11.7% to 12.0% against last year's 11.7%, or a 0 to 30-basis-point improvement on $26.8 billion to $27.1 billion in sales. Again, this is all on a 52-over-52-week basis. And that's it.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Scott, I think it's important to note, Marmaxx, because of e-commerce, because otherwise you'd be basically up 10 basis points.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, so on that 2% comp, as Carol have reiterated, it shows us down 10 basis points. There is some deleverage due to the e-commerce initiatives, which I called out at the beginning of the guidance section, which we are putting STP and e-commerce in there. Real pleased with the STP division, it's a profitable division. We have growth built into our plan. But the growth -- still with the growth, we are at a profit margin that is not at the very high levels of Marmaxx. And we are still investing in the e-commerce business, so we have some incremental expenses. So as Carol noted, that's the reason for the delevered [ph]  -- the base business...", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Marmaxx base business is very strong.", "Scott Goldenberg", "It's very strong.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It continues to be.", "Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then do you -- don't you also give this for the quarter or maybe not?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "No, we don't. You'll find out in a few months.", "Operator", "Our final question today is from Lorraine Hutchinson.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about how you develop your long term store count goals? And then what role has the roll out of e-commerce played in your model?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Our e-commerce, right now, what we're planning is obviously the costs are all in and we're planning it very conservatively. So when we get to FY '15, we'll be slightly more aggressive. But today, our sales are very minimal. And again, our investments are all in those numbers. In terms of the store count long term, we look at, as I said before, what each business can really handle in terms of the opportunities for real estate, number one, and the talent to be able to back up and drive the sales. So we talked about Europe being a little bit more aggressive than last year but not being too aggressive; Canada, getting Marshalls up and running; Marmaxx being pretty stable, so that's 75 stores; and HomeGoods being 30 stores. Again, that team is pretty stable. So that's really the way we look at it, and our model is a 4% to 5% store growth per year.", "So I look forward to reporting our first quarter, and thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today.

Welcome to the TJX Companies Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, August 20, 2013. I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thank you, Elan, and good morning, everyone. And before I begin, Sherry has a few words.", "Sherry Lang", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed April 2, 2013. Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies. Any recording, retransmission, reproduction or other use of the same for profit or otherwise without prior consent of TJX is prohibited and a violation of United States copyright and other laws.", "Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript. Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis. Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release in the Investor Information section of our website, www.tjx.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today's press release or otherwise posted on our website, again, www.tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you. And now I'll turn it back to Carol", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Sherry. And joining me and Sherry on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg.", "So let me begin by saying that once again, it is great to see our strong performance continue over such strong year-over-year comparisons. Earnings per share increased 18%, which is well above our plan and achieved over last year a 24% increase and several years of double-digit second quarter EPS growth. Consolidated comps were up 4%, also above our expectations, and over a reported 7% increase last year.", "With above-plan performance in the first half of the year and the third quarter off to a solid start, we enter the back half in an excellent position. Further, we see many growth opportunities for TJX with market share growth potential, our brick-and-mortar businesses, e-commerce, supply chain and more. We remain confident we will achieve our plans for 2013 and beyond. And as always, our management team is passionate about surpassing our goal. We operate a highly flexible, differentiated business model with tremendous advantages. And we are convinced we will grow TJX to be a $40-billion company and beyond.", "But before I dive into why we're so confident, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap the numbers", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. We're going to handle the financial recap a bit differently today than we have in the past. Since most of the financial metrics I usually discuss are in this morning's press release, I'm going to keep my comments brief and focus on providing some additional color on our results.", "As Carol mentioned, our second quarter consolidated comparable store sales increase of 4% was achieved over last year's 7% reported increase. This was also on top of comp increases of 3% to 4% in each of the prior 6 years. Clearly, we continue to demonstrate the ability of this business to drive strong comps on top of strong comparisons year after year.", "Comps were driven by a combination of increases in traffic and ticket in the quarter. Our diluted earnings per share of $0.66 was up 18% over last year's $0.56 and above our expectations. Foreign currency exchange rates had a neutral impact on earnings per share, which is the same as last year's neutral impact. We are extremely pleased with the high flow through on our above-plan sales and quality of earnings.", "Consolidated pretax profit margin was 12% for the quarter, which marks a second quarter record and was up 50 basis points versus last year's strong margin and well above our plan. This increase was driven primarily by strong merchandise margin improvement and volume and occupancy leverage on our above-plan sales. This increase within gross profit was partially offset by 20 basis points of SG&A deleverage. This was primarily due to increased investments in marketing, our e-commerce businesses and funding of The TJX Foundation. As to Marmaxx, comps increased 4%; apparel comps were up 3%; and home fashions, up 5%. Geographically, comps in most regions were around the chain's average. Florida and the West Coast were the top performing regions.", "Now let me turn the call back to Carol, and I will recap our third quarter, back half and full year fiscal '14 guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Scott. So before I move to our growth opportunities, I have a few comments on divisional performance. Our U.S. division delivered terrific results over very strong year-over-year comparisons and drove excellent flow-through to the bottom line. The Marmaxx 4% comp increase was achieved on top of a 7% increase last year, and prior to that, comp increase is up 3% or more for 5 consecutive years. Segment profit margin increased by a very strong 50 basis points. HomeGoods comped up 8% over a 9% increase last year. We were extremely pleased with HomeGoods' bottom line performance, with segment profit margin up an outstanding 170 basis points.", "Now to our international divisions. At TJX Canada, while results were a bit less than we would have liked, we were pleased with the improving comp trend from the first quarter. U.S. currency exchange rates put some pressure on merchandise margins in the second quarter, and we had some deleverage from our investments in talent to support our growth of Marshalls in Canada. That said, for the first half of the year, segment profit margin adjusted for currency was down just 30 basis points on flat comp. This does speak to the TJX Canada strong inventory and expense control, and ability to flex its business and we \u2013 and react to market trends, which led to favorable markdowns and helped protect merchandise margins. TJX Canada begins the back half well-positioned with lean inventories, fresh flow and many initiatives planned.", "Now to TJX Europe, which had an excellent second quarter. Comps increased by a strong 6% over a 10% increase last year, and segment profit adjusted for currency increased 190 basis points over last year. We were very pleased to see TJX Europe's consistent strong performance continue and by the very strong financial metrics we continue to see in Germany and Poland, which bodes well for the future.", "Now to our confidence that our top line and bottom line growth will continue. You'll hear me reiterate the same things we've discussed before, which we don't think is a bad thing, as they repeat -- they bear repeating. Beginning with our market share growth potential. Our research tells us about 75% of U.S. shoppers have not shopped at T.J. Maxx or Marshalls in the past year. Clearly, we have untapped opportunity and we are convinced our value proposition will continue to attract more U.S. and international customers.", "Our store remodels and in-store initiatives, which improve our customer shopping experience and even more powerful marketing, are all key to continuing to attract and retain more new customers. In the back half, our commercials will be on U.S. television for several more weeks than last year, with a significant increase in impression. I love our marketing campaigns and think they are even better than last year. We also have some exciting in-store initiatives up our sleeves, but you'll just have to wait to see what they are.", "Second is the growth potential of our brick-and-mortar business. We operate 4 large divisions, all with tremendous growth opportunities. As we've said before, we see the potential to grow our store base by about 50% with our current chains and our current markets alone. We believe we are the only retailer in the world with our deep understanding and experience in bringing the off-price concept to different countries, which is a huge advantage.", "Beginning with our U.S. businesses, we continue to aggressively grow Marmaxx and HomeGoods. The consistent excellent performance of both these divisions for many years gives us great confidence. While Marmaxx is nearing the 2,000 store mark, we are even more excited about its new store performance and potential. New Marmaxx stores have been significantly beating our expectations as we continue to expand and we believe our long-term store growth estimate of 2,400 to 2,600 stores could be conservative. HomeGoods new stores have also well outperformed our expectations and we also could envision growing beyond our current long-term store growth estimate of 750 to 825 stores. There are other U.S. home retailers that are double HomeGoods current size, which underscores the potential for this chain.", "Internationally, we have great growth opportunities for TJX. In Europe, our current long-term store growth estimate is 750 to 875 stores with just our existing portfolio in our current countries alone. However, we can see growing beyond this. We see opportunities with other retailers closing doors in U.K. and in Germany. We see plenty of retail whitespace. Our HomeSense chain operates only 27 stores in the U.K. today. So we have great potential for this chain alone beyond the growth we see in T.K. Maxx. In Canada, we believe we have the potential to expand up to 430 stores overall, with Marshalls growing to about 100 stores. This week, we're opening our first Marshalls stores in Alberta and Qu\u00e9bec. We are excited about bringing this chain to more provinces.", "Beyond our current portfolio and countries, we believe our off-price model could work nearly anywhere consumers seek great fashion and brand at great value. Beyond the growth potential we have in our successful brick-and-mortar businesses, we see e-commerce as another opportunity for long-term growth. We are on track with our plans and expect to launch our T.J. Maxx website in a controlled mode by late fall. While we are excited to be nearing the launch, we are continuing with our deliberate approach. We plan to do e-commerce profitably and most importantly, not disappoint our customers. Grow smart is our motto. I want to reiterate that while we see e-commerce as a significant long-term opportunity for TJX, we view it as a strategy in offense.", "Our retail chains have been extremely successful without e-commerce, other than a small website in the U.K. and a safer [ph] growth in online sales throughout retail. We believe online will be another platform for our value and avenue to attract those consumers not already shopping T.J. Maxx. We also see it as a way giving customers the ability to shop 24/7 and when weather patterns may hold back the traffic to the stores. As a reminder, while we have e-commerce expenses reflected in our plans, we have only a little top line benefit built into the near- and long-term models at this time.", "We continue to be very pleased with Sierra Trading Post's fluid transition into TJX. We see their deep e-commerce experience, scale and infrastructure as great advantages as we continue to develop TJX -- tjmaxx.com. We're very happy with this acquisition.", "But before I wrap up, I want to reiterate our supply chain opportunity. We've often discussed the many advantages of running with leaner faster-turning inventories and what this has done to our businesses. Combined with even better brand penetration, it has led to an even more exciting shopping experience for our customers. As much progress as we have made in this area, we believe meaningful top line opportunities remain. We're investing in our supply chain to become even more efficient and precise at delivering the right goods to the right stores at the right time. To reiterate, our rollout of all these systems remains a couple of years away.", "So summing up, we exceeded our expectations for the first half of 2013 and have great growth opportunity for the second half and beyond. The third quarter is off to a solid start. We are in an excellent inventory position and see great product in the marketplace. We have many exciting initiatives planned for the back half. I believe our gift-giving, brand penetration, merchandise mix, marketing and most importantly, our values will be even better than last year.", "Longer term, we have many opportunities in gaining market share, as well as growth of our brick-and-mortar chain and e-commerce, giving us confidence of the numerous advantages of our business, which we believe set us apart from many other retailers and can be underappreciated. We have expanded profitably in 6 countries and have deep knowledge in what it takes to operate successfully internationally. We have been investing in e-commerce for 3 years and already have an established loyalty card program. We see ourselves as a global sourcing machine, with more than 16,000 vendors in our purchase universe. We have over 800 associates in our buying organization alone. And our merchant organization, all in, is even larger. Our supply chain is designed to support our flexible off-price buying and keeps improving.", "Further, our management team is focused on 4 highly synergistic divisions and Sierra Trading Post should only benefit our pillars even more. To support our growth, we continue to invest in new stores, store models -- store remodels, infrastructure and talent, which is a huge emphasis for us. Of course, our financial strength also gives us great confidence. We are convinced our strong growth on top and bottom line will continue. We are confident that we will achieve our near- and long-term plans and as a management team, we work hard to beat our goals.", "Now I'll turn it over to Scott to go through our guidance and then we'll open it up to questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol. Now for fiscal '14 guidance, beginning with the full year. For modeling purposes, I'll remind you that fiscal '14 is a 52-week compared with a 53-week period in fiscal '13. The extra week contributed approximately an $0.08 benefit to the fourth quarter, second half and full year.", "As we noted in our press release today, with our above-plan second quarter results, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance. The new guidance calls for full year earnings per share to be in the range of $2.74 to $2.80 over EPS of $2.55 in fiscal '13, which again included an approximately $0.08 benefit from the 53rd week. Excluding the extra week, fiscal '14 full year expected EPS would be an 11% to 13% increase over the prior year's adjusted $2.47.", "Let me recap the changes versus the guidance we provided on the first quarter earnings call in May. We now estimate consolidated comp store sales growth of 2% to 3% for the full year compared to our prior guidance of 1% to 2% growth. Also, we now expect pretax profit margins of 11.9% to 12.1%, which would be flat to 20 basis points higher than last year's margin of 11.9% and 10 basis points better than the guidance we provided in May on the high and low end. A couple of reminders that this guidance includes the impact of our e-commerce investments and last year, the 53rd week positively impacted pretax margins by approximately 20 basis points. Lastly, our EPS guidance now includes an additional $0.01 per share negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, which was not contemplated in our guidance provided on May 21.", "Let me now discuss the back half guidance. We expect EPS to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.52 over EPS of $1.44 in fiscal '13, which again included the extra week. Excluding the extra week, expected EPS for the back half of fiscal '14 would be a 7% to 12% increase over the prior year's adjusted $1.36. This guidance is based on consolidated comps store sales growth in a range of 1% to 3%. We're planning pretax profit margins to be 12.0% to 12.3%, down 10 but up 20 basis points over last year. As a reminder, this guidance includes our e-commerce investments and in fiscal '13, the extra week positively impacted pretax margins by approximately 30 basis points. This EPS guidance also includes the additional $0.01 per share negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates.", "Now I will move to the third quarter guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.72, which would be an 11% to 16% increase over last year's $0.62 per share. We're assuming a third quarter top line in the $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion range. This is based on expected comp sales growth in the 2% to 3% range on a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group. Third quarter pretax profit margins are planned in the 12.0% to 12.3% range, up 30 to 60 basis points versus the prior year. We're anticipating third quarter gross margin -- profit margin to be in the range of 28.7% to 28.9%, down 10 to up 10 basis points over the prior year. We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the range of 16.5% to 16.4%, 50 to 60 basis points favorable to last year. As a reminder, the third quarter last year was negatively impacted by several items we called out, which combined, had a 60 basis points negative impact on last year's margins.", "Foreign exchange rates, assuming current levels, are expected to have a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the third quarter versus a neutral impact last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.1% and net interest expense of approximately $9 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately $726 million.", "Our full year guidance implies fourth quarter EPS in the range of $0.77 to $0.80 compared to $0.82 last year, which included an approximately $0.08 benefit from the extra week. This guidance reflects consolidated comp sales growth of 1% to 2%, which includes having 6 fewer selling days before Christmas. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call.", "Finally, our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels. Now we are happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks. And now we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jennifer Davis.", "Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "My question is on inventory. How much lower do you think it can go, Carol? I mean, I think the store looks great, they're much easier to shop. Just wondering how much room you still think you have there?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, Jennifer, we're really focusing more on how much freshness we can bring to the stores. So we have a variance in certain chains, some chains we can take the inventory a little bit lower. Others, we want to just actually ship more often. So it's really about driving sales versus getting the inventories lower and lower. And that's what we're putting into the systems going forward. It's really about driving sales.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just a question about the -- I guess, you characterize the new store performance in the United States as particularly encouraging. Just interested in your comments about what -- where that's coming from. Is that coming more from top line? Is that coming from the cost side or some of each?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Oh, it's absolutely the top line. I mean, we're driving sales. And if you drive sales, you leverage it, you can see by Marmaxx's margins.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. So just -- I mean, it's top line driven and the associated flow through to the bottom line?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Right.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the weather. I know you guys don't like to use the weather as an excuse, but it seems like it was a rather challenging setup here in the second quarter. And then just look at the broader environment, a number of retailers out there are struggling. And I'm wondering if you have any observations, just in general, about what's going on in the retail environment. And TJX seems to be maneuvering extremely well through the environment. What do you hear from customers in terms of the reasons that they're coming to TJX and maybe skipping their trips to the other retailers?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "So, Kim, that was 3 questions, okay. I don't like to talk about weather. Periodically, we will, we do. And yes, we had some weather -- extreme conditions in Canada and certainly in Europe and even the United States. But having said that, what I'm really pleased about is that both our apparel and our home businesses were very strong across the board. So we are very, very encouraged by that. The broader environment, I can say it a million times, we perform whether it's a good environment or a bad environment. If you take Germany versus the U.K, which have completely different scenarios in terms of the strength of the consumer, both are doing extremely well. We don't say to our customers, why are you going to T.J. Maxx or Marshalls versus someone else? I just -- we focus on our job and executing and just -- Ernie is pounding away, constantly at raising the bar, getting great brands and he and his team are doing an amazing job.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Oliver Chen.", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Regarding strategy and your customer profile, could you just update us on what you're seeing with regard to demographics? I know that you had some really favorable dynamic changes going on there. And just as a quick follow-up, the third quarter gross margin guidance, where do you -- it's a little bit more moderate versus what you've actually been doing. So what are the kind of drivers and your outlook there?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay. In terms of the customer, we're really getting it from all over. Our increase in customer is coming from a younger group of customers. However, we're certainly targeting and focusing on our current customers and will be for the future. So we see this last couple of quarters, a little bit of increase in traffic, a little bit of increase in retail. We have very, very high penetration in terms of our marketing in the back half, but we're absolutely bringing in younger customers. That's where our increase is coming from. Scott, you want to go through Q3 gross margin? I'm going to say, Oliver, we plan our business and we hope to beat it. So I think our Q3 is a pretty good number, but again, we're going to be -- as always, we're going to go for it. Scott, do you want to?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. Not much detail that I was going really go into here. It's, again, continuing \u2013 it'll be driven on the high side by the continued improvement in our lowering the inventory levels and some built in markdowns associated with that, which has been a consistent story over the past few years. And that's really about all the details to go into in -- at this point.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I can tell you, we have a pretty exciting market.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I'm just wondering on the merchandise margin improvement and strength that you've been seeing, has that been driven more by less clearance activity, so fewer markdowns? Or is it more on the I&U side, driven by grade availability? I'm just wondering if you can maybe quantify kind of which of those pieces for us and how you're achieving that improvement?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I mean, it's really from both, but our markdown rates are definitely going down as we're turning our inventory faster. So predominantly there. Again, Ernie's team is just focused on giving extreme value.", "Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then how does that change in the second half with you not expecting as much improvement on the gross margin line?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I'd hope we'd beat it. Ernie has the markets.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes. Paul, I think, Carol is saying that we just like to be conservative on these plans, especially on the gross margin plans. So we're still opportunistic, we don't like to get ahead of it too much and forecast where margins are going to be. But I would like to tell you that the market continues to have a lot of goods, it's across all areas in the market, all families of business. Obviously, varies from one to another, so not the same in every family of business. But overall, we're feeling pretty bullish on the amount of exciting value buys that are in the marketplace.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Tunick.", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I guess 2 questions. One, it sounds like you think you're several years away, Carol, from maximizing the systems and supply chain at Marmaxx. And I guess, HomeGoods, you always tell us that it turns the fastest. So maybe when you think about the sales or margin lift you've seen at HomeGoods, what could be the potential impact on Marmaxx as you implement the roll out? And then the second question, maybe as you guys think about the housing cycle and the lag between the home furnishing pickup. HomeGoods, obviously, has been benefiting a lot. What do you think the overlap is from a product perspective at the Marmaxx home business for what you're seeing and learning from HomeGoods?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, both businesses are very strong in the home area and there's enormous differentiation between HomeGoods, Maxx and Marshalls. So the way we operate is all 3 divisions leverage each other but differentiate. So that's what makes it so wonderful is the no walls and the idea that we're leveraging. So obviously, the team is going after the home business as it's strong, but I have to keep coming back to our other businesses are very strong; our apparel businesses, our accessories businesses. So we have an opportunity to go after all of it and I think that's so wonderful about it. In terms of systems and the supply chain, we don't give a number. I mean, really, our goal is to keep improving our in-store experience and to keep shipping fresher goods so that we can elevate the volume of each store. I have no idea what the end game is. This new system in the future will also allow us to differentiate even more store by store. So hopefully, you can even put stores closer to each other. So it remains to be seen what that all looks like. So we've changed the end game on Marmaxx, I don't know, several times. And I don't know what the end game is, I'm hoping it's pretty big but we will see.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Baker.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So maybe more of a mundane question, but I think interesting. The corporate G&A line item, so I think you've guided for that to be down 50 basis points year-over-year. It's actually up, I think, year-over-year for the first half. So is the plan for that still to be down \u2013 sorry, I said 50 basis points, I meant $50 million. If it's down $50 million, that would translate to about 30 basis points of leverage just on that line item. So how does that play into your guidance of margins being flat to up 20 basis points when you're 30 basis points right there?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Sure. Now, Michael, you're talking now going to the full year?", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Are you \u2013 yes, okay. So our full-year guidance, again, just to recap, we are now saying we're going to be 20 to 40 basis points higher than -- this is including FX, than we were last year. And like you said, we do have some -- we have a bit more on the corporate expenses due to the foundation and some home office moves that were not contemplated, that's now included in our full-year guidance. We also absorbed, just for instance, a bit more interest expense in the FX that we did not have on our last forecast. But when you do apples-to-apples, we feel we're still leveraging net-net about 20 basis points when you adjust out the savings there versus some of the other items that we have which is -- and again, remember, we also have the e-commerce businesses. So when you offset those with the -- some of the decrease that you're talking about in corporate expenses, net-net, we still feel we have a healthy increase on a 3 comp.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So just to summarize that, so corporate G&A, originally, you had said it'd be down $50 million for the year, now it'll presumably be down but just not quite as much. Is that the right interpretation?", "Scott Goldenberg", "That's correct. So we're -- we've increased a few expenses in the -- both in the second quarter and the back half that will make the drop in the corporate expenses a bit less.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just one clarification, I jumped on the call late...", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "[indiscernible] not significant\u2026", "Scott Goldenberg", "It's not a big deal. I think the bigger point is that we're still leveraging when you adjust out what we would call the onetime items that we called out in the back half versus what we have on, which again is the e-commerce and some of the other costs, net-net, we spoke there we have a -- we're about up where we expect to be on that.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, sure. I actually feel the bigger point is that you're going to get a lot of leverage on that line item. So to me, it makes your total operating margin guidance that much more conservative when you're going to get some nice savings just on that line item. So I'm not concerned about the expenses being a little bit higher. One other clarification because I jumped in the call late with all the other retailers today. Could you talk about the trend in sales throughout the quarter? And if not, could you comment on that?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes. We did a solid 4 and we're not doing monthly on purpose.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Well, some retailers don't report them each month, but as they report the quarter, they'll go back and tell us with comps store sale. So wondering if you guys can do that.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Fairly consistent, fairly consistent.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dana Telsey.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Can you talk a little bit about what you're doing in men's department, as I know there's been enhancements there? And obviously, the Europe operating margin was tremendous in terms of the improvement, buckets of improvements. And long term, could Europe be a double-digit operating margin business?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Dana, you always get to the details, okay. We're testing a lot of things in marketing and, Ernie, you want to talk a little bit about one of many tests?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes, we don't like to give too many specifics obviously, Dana, but we have tested men's marketing as a push. We did a test last fall and then one this spring and I guess what we would leave you with is that the results were encouraging and we're feeling pretty good about the results. We'll be kicking the tires a little bit more in that arena. But again, we talked about, Carol mentioned earlier, about the 75% of the customers that are an opportunity out there and we think men's is one of those avenues that we would take a hard look at in terms of the marketing and in terms of our merchandising opportunity. In addition to that, total impressions and total marketing campaign for us this fall will be up. So we will continue that trend, which I think we've also talked about before. Again, this was a men's question you asked but our total marketing push will be up throughout the back half and we're feeling good about that as again trying to drive our top line and take advantage of the environment that we're in, as you guys talked about earlier. Carol, do you want to talk about Europe or we can both...", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Go ahead.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Europe, could it be a double-digit, Dana, you asked could it be a double-digit operating income? We always smile at that question. We would like to think so. We will never at this point say that because of all the reasons we've said already about wanting to be conservative. We're very happy about where we sit in Europe today in terms of the people, in terms of the trend, which all of you are aware of. We're feeling very encouraged about the sales trend. Again, it's all execution. So a couple of years ago, we are not happy with our sale trend. That was really all based on our own execution, not the environment. So we would like to emphasize that whatever happens in Europe is still up to our own doing and really not as much about the environment. We are very -- feeling very positive, however, about the situation there. And we are looking for further expansion in Europe so.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We also increased the number of stores by 5 in Europe. That's how strong we feel. Ernie's side...", "Ernie L. Herrman", "The original plan was about 25 stores, we're heading to approximately 30 stores in Europe.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And one other thing, Dana, in terms of -- yes, in terms of the results, I mean, the 190 basis points increase that we had x FX on the merchant strong margin was a combination of good expense leverage and a slightly even bigger portion that came out of merchandise margin, gross margin increases.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "And Europe, Germany and Poland, outstanding, really outstanding.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "So, Dana, that really goes to your question, we're believing that the opportunity in Germany exists and that is a -- heading to a profitable margin. So that really somewhat will support your question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Omar Saad.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So I wanted to follow up on the question on the new stores that you have at the beginning of the quarter, it's really above your expectation. Is there something going on there in terms of are they slightly a different format or presentation? Are you trying any new things in some of the new stores from an inventory standpoint for the locations? Or have you really kind of thought about what's driving that performance in the new stores? And then really quickly on the Europe comments, you accelerated the store openings a little bit. Any thoughts on when you might really start to go back to some of the square footage growth rates internationally that you've seen in the past to really accelerate \u2013 press on the accelerator overseas?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, we are going to -- we are eking it up, there's no doubt that we put more people in the real estate site in Europe and we will continue to build that and eke it up. The new store performance, it's -- there's nothing different. We'll just continue -- and that's why I think we're feeling so good because there are stores in A, B and C markets, and they're all doing extremely well, we're not doing anything different. So we're pretty excited about the results.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes, we have a nice mix there with the stores across the board whether it's urban markets or suburban or rural. Again, the pattern seems to be consistent across all of those markets.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Bodes well for the future.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess a question about the timing of investments and the reaping of the benefits. Obviously, Europe has been very successful from a top line standpoint. Do you have a time horizon on when that becomes a meaningful contributor to operating profit? And could you comment on Europe and its real estate challenge? You said it's been historically tough to find the sites, particularly in Germany and Poland, and wondering if that's changing or if your tactics have changed to enable you to have greater visibility for square foot growth in Europe or in Germany and Poland?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, our tactics have been just adding more people on the real estate side. And in terms of the U.K, obviously, as we added 5 more stores within the U.K. because we just see a lot of opportunity. Look, there are people going out of business, so we're going to take full advantage of that. And they've set up the team that way to take full advantage of it. So we shall see. I mean, we're not going to walk away from anything that we think is viable, that's for sure.", "Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Can you just provide the divisional profitability? You usually you walk us through comps and operating margins by division but I'm just...", "Scott Goldenberg", "Omar, an update on the full year guidance, that's what you're...", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "That's Richard.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Richard. I'm sorry, Richard. On the full year guidance, is that what you were...", "Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes. Sales, comps and operating margin by division for the year.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Okay. Sure. Again, just to clarify here that I'm going to be giving the numbers on a 52-week over a 52-week basis, including FX. So I'm going to start with Marmaxx. Marmaxx's current is now 2% comp versus last year's 6%, that's a 14.5% and a load of 14.6%. So 0 to 10 basis points up and just as a call out, that has approximately a 20 basis impact due to the e-commerce businesses being included, so you'd be 20 to 30 basis points on the low and the high, and that's $17.7 billion to $17.8 billion on sales. Moving to HomeGoods, a 4% to 5% comp against last year's 7% comp, 12.6% to 12.8% versus last year's 12% or 60 to 80 basis points on $2.9 billion of sales. We just mentioned in our previous guidance, that's an increase from a 2% to 4% comp, now to the 4% to 5% comp on a full year for HomeGoods. Canada, 0% to 1% comp against last year's 5%, 13.2% to 13.4% versus last year's 14.0% on $2.9 billion in sales. And finally, Europe, 4% to 5% comp against last year's 10%, margins of 7.1% to 7.4%, and again, that's a 70 to 100 basis points improvement on $3.4 million in sales. And again, just to repeat, the full year is 11.9% to 12.1%, 20 to 40 basis points up on $20.6 billion to $27.1 billion in sales.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Could you provide us with an update on the environment in Canada, the performance of Marshalls there and then any expectations for that region in the second half?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Ernie, you want to talk about Canada?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Lorraine, I would say, first -- your first question, we've been pleased with the Marshalls results. One of the things we've been doing up there, however, is to get our staff to staff up so that we can further help with the differentiation of Marshalls in that environment. So given where we've been, we're very pleased. It's been one of our better new business opening businesses for such a short time period. We're heading up to, I think, close to 20 stores-ish. So again, we're taking a very methodical approach there, however, because we don't want to go too aggressively. So pleased, we're very pleased. Your second question, was that regarding the environment?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "The environment is a little up in the air, I would say, in Canada. You have a situation where the economy has softened a little. It came a little bit later than other countries, so that was a funny dynamic. However, we still look at our own execution as the crux of the matter, whether it's good or bad, it's pretty much up to us. So we have been happy with the way the sales have been. I think there's been some execution issues in a couple of categories that we're taking a look at, but we're feeling pretty bullish on the back half and feeling like sales will continue to be a bit more of an opportunity as we move into the back half of the year. The currency has been a funky issue in that it's been in one of -- and I've seen it over the years go in many cycles. Sometimes, it's fairly stable for a time period. But right now, over the last, I would say, 6 months, Scott, we'd have this volatile environment on the currency, which plays a little bit of chaos in terms of with the buying of goods because a fair amount of the buying of goods is done in U.S. dollars as well.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "And very close to need.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "And very close to our model, the good thing about our model is we buy close to need. And in situations like this, a volatile currency can come into play there. So on that, I would -- yes, it affects us. I don't get too crazy and we tell our teams not to get too crazy because it's something out of their control. So I think that, Lorraine, is a good recap of Canada.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bob Drbul.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "The question I have is many retailers have missed sales during the second quarter and you guys did a very good job. When you look at the inventory levels that are out there from an industry perspective, has that changed the dynamics in the buying environment at all over the last several weeks and months?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, I'm going to say it, and I could say it 100 times, there is always more goods than we could possibly have an appetite for and that has not changed. We spend all of our time trying to teach our buyers to buy the best of the best. So I'm going to tell you, it's a great environment, we have great brands, we love our mix going forward but there's never a lack of merchandise out there, ever.", "Scott Goldenberg", "In fact, Bob, I would say right now, we've -- we are -- this would apply to all 4 divisions, are having to really pace themselves because there is so much availability in the market. And we always need to do that but I would say the availability right now is at a significant level.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Stein.", "Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research", "Guys, a question on the outlook for seasonal goods for fall. Do you have any visibility into the availability of top name cold weather goods for the fall? We've had 2 consecutive miserable winters, at least it hasn't been as bad as expected. And I'm wondering if there may be potential shortages in some of the better categories there.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I don't think you have to worry about shortages.", "Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research", "Okay. So cold weather is not going to be an issue?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "No.", "Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research", "Okay. So one other follow-up question real quickly and that is, I've noticed in your -- in men's area, some of the stores in my region are now showing men's runway department. Is that something new? Is that something you're going to expand? And how of them are there currently?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We're always testing new things. And, Ernie, you want to comment on...", "Ernie L. Herrman", "And, Jeff, it's a bit of a moving target. It somewhat depends on the buys we make as to how to many stores it's in. So it is in limited stores. I wouldn't give a number on that only because it changes. It's really not new. It might be new in the stores you're looking at because sometimes, we hit some other stores that we hadn't hit in a bit.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Montagna.", "Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "A question about, you took on some additional debt. Is there a specific purpose for that or could that be used next year for possible increase to share buybacks?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, both Scott and I will answer that, that we're always looking for opportunity so there's always a possibility of increasing the buyback. But right now, we're $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion is our...", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. I mean, the primary reason to do it early in the year and in hindsight, it was clearly a good move with\u2026", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, it was.", "Scott Goldenberg", "We took advantage of a 2.5% coupon rate that we were able to get and that's really not much more than that. So clearly, we have, as you can tell from our balance sheet, have over $2 billion. But I just would call out again, approximately half of that is overseas. But no it's -- the majority of the reason was doing -- taking advantage of a great rate at the time.", "Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, when you were -- when, Carol, you were talking about the store potential, does that also include smaller markets?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes. Absolutely.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Marni Shapiro.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "I just want to say all my questions were asked, I can take the last few off with Sherry, but best of luck for fall and I hope there's enough inventory out there for you guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Laura Champine.", "Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "My question is about, you've done such a great job on inventory turns. As you start e-commerce again, will that be big enough to make a meaningful change in those turns? Meaning, will you have to stock up more to stay in stock online?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Probably not because we're really going to run our e-comm very similar to our store business, so in terms of the treasure hunt. So it remains to be seen. I don't even want to comment on -- we have no idea how big this is going to be. All I know is that it's differentiated, we're excited about it and we think it gives new customer opportunity, we think that it is an opportunity to shop 24/7. We think it's great. If there's bad weather, it's another opportunity. So we shall see.", "Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And, Carol, can you do e-commerce without creating expectation to see lots of colors or lots of sizes available? I'm just wondering if it's going to be a problem if the customer doesn't -- that treasure hunt works so well in the store. Can that translate online?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I believe it can, and I think the thing you've got to realize is how important our brands are. T.J. Maxx is a very well-known brand. It's not like we're launching something that people aren't aware of a great brand. It has built in marketing ready, we have our TV, we have radio, we have social, we have so many aspects that we can go after. So you can't look at it as a brand-new endeavor.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Patrick McKeever.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Question on, I think, Carol, you talked about the performance across the store base from some of the higher-income area stores and lower-income are stores and whatnot and seeing consistency there. Was that the case again in the second quarter? I guess I'm especially interested in how some of the former A.J. Wright stores perform that have been converted to Marshalls or T.J. Maxx stores?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes. Actually, they're doing quite well. And across the board, our stores are performing very consistently. However, as we stated, Florida and some of the warmer weather climates were slightly better. And that was a little bit of weather impact. But in terms of the demographics in the A and B and C markets, they're really very consistent.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then a very quick one. On the remodeled stores, maybe you could give us just a little bit of detail what you're seeing there and perhaps some color around the cost and if that's changing at all and so on and so forth?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, we don't comment on our remodels. We're happy with them. I can make that comment. And we're continuing on our plans of 300.", "Operator", "And our final question today is from David Mann.", "David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "When you look at the comp outperformance in the second quarter, would you characterize traffic or ticket as being the driver for that?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It's a little bit of both. Our average retail is up slightly and our traffic was up very slightly.", "David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "And when you look at the second half, would you see a -- do you see bigger opportunity in one or the other?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "No, I can only tell you that we're marketing pretty hard. So we'll see. I think we've got a great mix, a lot of opportunity and I love our marketing campaign. So again, we will strive to beat our numbers and hopefully all of those formulas will help us get there.", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, today, November 19, 2013. I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer for The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Ally, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin this morning, I'd like to introduce Debra McDonald (sic) [McConnell], VP of Global Communications, with some opening statements. Debra, who has been with us for many years, is now leading TJX Investor Relations. Sherry Lang is taking on a more of an advisory role after more than 2 decades with our company. I want to thank Sherry for all of her years and many contributions to TJX. Go ahead, Deb.", "Debra McConnell", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning.

And now I'll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Deb. And joining me and Debra on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg. So let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with -- to see our momentum continue in the third quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased 21%, well above our original plan and achieved over last year's 17% growth. Consolidated comp store sales were up 5%, also above our plan and over last year's 7% reported increase. Once again, these results demonstrate our ability to drive strong performance regardless of the retail environment and on top of strong year-over-year comparisons.", "I'll keep my comments brief today since we just had our Investor Event on October 22. So as a reminder, the presentations and Q&A from the event are available on our website.", "We talked a lot about the magnitude of our near- and long-term growth opportunities, and why we're so confident that we will become a substantially bigger company, driving both the top and bottom line. We hope you're as excited as we are about the global-ness of our business and the path for growth that we see in front of us. The fourth quarter is off to a good start and we are pursuing many exciting opportunities for the holiday season and the remainder of the year. We're confident that we will achieve our plans and, at the same time, we are a management team passionate about striving to the surpass our goals. Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap the numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. As I did last quarter, since most of the financial metrics were included in this morning's press release, I'll use my time to provide some additional color on our results.", "As Carol mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comp store sales increase of 5% over last year's 7% reported increase marked yet another quarter of strong comps on top of strong comps. Our third quarter comp was driven by a combination of increases in ticket and traffic.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.86 compared with last year's $0.62. Our third quarter EPS includes an $0.11 benefit detailed in today's press release. Excluding this benefit, adjusted earnings per share were $0.75, a 21% increase over last year, marking 5 consecutive years of double-digit EPS growth.", "Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.01 negative impact on earnings per share, compared with a neutral impact last year. Consolidated pretax profit margin was a record 12.6% for the quarter, up 90 basis points over last year's strong margin and above our plan. This increase was driven primarily by gross profit margins being up 50 basis points due to buying and occupancy leverage on the above-plan comp and improved merchandise margins.", "SG&A improved 40 basis points, primarily due to several items that negatively impacted third quarter margins by 60 basis points last year. There were several factors this year that partially offset the 60 basis points of year-over-year favorability. These included costs related to home office moves, increased advertising and e-commerce.", "In terms of inventories, we are in fantastic shape going into the fourth quarter. As to Marmaxx, comps increased 4%. Apparel comps were up 4% and home fashions were up 6%. We are particularly pleased to see both apparel and non-apparel categories do so well in this retail environment. Geographically, comps in the Northeast and West Coast were the strongest, and all other regions were around the chain average.", "Now let me turn the call back to Carol, and I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year fiscal '14 guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Scott. Before moving to our future growth potential, I'll recap third quarter divisional results. All of our divisions delivered strong performance over strong prior year comparisons and drove great bottom line flow-through. Our U.S. divisions, once again, achieved powerful results. Marmaxx posted a 4% comp increase over 7% growth last year and segment profit increased 80 basis points to 14.7%.", "HomeGoods delivered another outstanding quarter. Comps were up 10% and segment profit was up 110 basis points, 13.1%.", "Moving to our international businesses. TJX Europe continued it's very strong trends. Comps were up 5% over an 11% increase last year and segment profit was up 130 basis points to 10.4%.", "I was just in Germany last week and could not be more excited about our talent, product mix and real estate opportunity there. At TJX Canada, comps increased 2% and adjusted segment profit increased 30 basis points to 16.6%.", "Now to our growth catalyst, beginning with the holiday season in fourth quarter. Going into the fourth quarter, we are in great shape. We have plenty of open-to-buy and the marketplace is flooded with outstanding products. I believe our gift-giving selection this year will be the best we have ever had. You've heard me say this in the past year that I truly believe we get better and better every year as we keep raising the bar. We have many exciting initiatives up our sleeves. But you'll just have to shop our stores to see what they are.", "Second, our gift-giving selection will be extremely fresh. Our buyers will be in the marketplace in December and will be shipping to our stores right through the holidays.", "Third, our commercials will be on TV every single week in the U.S. throughout the holiday season and overall impressions will be up significantly. Our holiday campaigns just launched last week and I hope you love The Gifter as much as we do. We have also upped all of our social media penetration and are engaging consumers in more ways than ever. Plus, we are confident that our remodel programs will continue, upgrading our stores will be another draw this holiday season. Most importantly, we will be offering customers extreme value and we are convinced that value would be absolutely key to consumers when they shop this holiday season.", "Now to our future growth potential. Last November, I said on our earnings call that I have never been more excited about the future of TJX. I certainly continue to feel that way today. At our Investor Event, we focused on all of the elements that can help us achieve our vision to grow TJX to a $40 billion business and beyond. I'd like to briefly highlight the key themes from the day.", "First is the magnitude of TJX's growth potential, both near- and long-term. We are convinced that TJX is the retailer for today and the future. We talked a lot about that huge opportunities we see to gain market share and pursue the millions of untapped customers we see in both the U.S. and internationally. We also see enormous store growth potential for our brick-and-mortar businesses. We raised our long-term store growth potential to over 5,100 stores. That would be about 60% more stores than our current base, with growth in just our existing markets, with just our existing chains alone.", "The most significant driver of this increase is our belief that Marmaxx can be an even bigger business and grow to 3,000 stores. That's 400 more stores in the high end of our prior range and about 1,000 more stores than today. We also see home, overall as a category, as a substantial growth vehicle for the future. Between our pure home chain, HomeGoods and HomeSense and home products in all of our other stores, we believe there is great opportunity.", "Internationally, we see vast opportunities. We sized up our potential in Europe alone, which we see as tremendous and representing billions of dollars of growth just in brick-and-mortar and in just our current chain. We also raised our long-term segment profit margin target for TJX Europe to 10% plus, and discussed why we're so confident we will achieve these goals. I'll take a moment here to mention a few of the many factors we see on our side as we expand into Europe.", "We are a differentiated unconventional retailer with enormous flexibility, offering amazing brands and fashion all under one roof. More importantly, we are bringing consumers extreme values and we see value as a concept that's just growing more in Europe. In addition, there's a vast retail-light space in Europe. Beyond our current European markets, we see the opportunity to expand to other countries. In short, we believe that our value model resonates wherever consumers seek fashion, brands and quality at great prices.", "In terms of TJX Canada, we upped our long-term store growth potential to about 450 stores. That would be 30% more stores than our current base and reflects our potential to grow Marshalls in Canada.", "Beyond our brick-and-mortar businesses, we see e-commerce as another long-term growth catalyst. We want to be there for our customers when they want to shop online, and we see e-commerce as another platform to offer great, great values. While we were strategically low key about our launch of TJX tjmaxx.com in September, customer response has been terrific. We will continue with our deliberate approach and plan to grow smart. But we are very excited about giving consumers the ability and convenience to shop 24/7.", "We also continue to be very pleased with the smooth transition of Sierra Trading Post. Although we're in no rush, we can see e-commerce working for all our TJX brands.", "Now let me reiterate the key advantage that we believe differentiates TJX and sets us up extremely well to achieve our goals for growth. It all begins by offering extreme value. The value has been our mission since Day 1, and we believe it resonates in all environments. We have tremendous flexibility and consistency. We believe we have one of the widest demographic reaches in retail. We are leveraging 4 large synergistic divisions as we grow. We have successfully expanded internationally and have decades of experience operating outside of the U.S. We have a world-class buying organization of over 900 associates. Teaching and developing the next generation of leaders are top priorities for us. We have built a global sourcing machine over 36 years, which is not easily replicated. And we have a vendor universe of over 16,000 vendors.", "We keep improving our supply chain to support our growth. We're confident our supply chain investments will help us become even better at shipping the right goods to the right stores at the right time and drive growth on both top and bottom line. I truly believe we are leaders in innovation. We strive to be ahead of the curve, never complacent, and make our stores more exciting every day. This is our mission: always raising the bar in fashion, brands, quality and value every day.", "Summing up, our robust plan year-to-date performance demonstrates, once again, the ability of this company to drive sales and profit growth even in uncertain retail environments and over strong comparisons. We entered the fourth quarter with great momentum and in excellent position to pursue our many opportunities for the holiday selling season. We are convinced that our stores will be gift-giving destinations this holiday season. Longer term, we are very confident we will grow TJX to be a $40 billion business and well beyond. As a management team, we remain laser-focused on near-term execution and, at the same time, keep our sights set on strategic vision for the future.", "So now I'll turn it back to Scott to go through our guidance and then, we'll open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol. Now to fiscal '14 guidance, beginning with the full year. For modeling purposes, I'll remind you that fiscal '14 is a 52-week, compared with the 53-week period in fiscal '13. The extra week last year contributed $0.08 to earnings per share in the fourth quarter and full year.", "As we noted in our press release today, we are raising full year earnings per share guidance to reflect our third quarter performance. Our guidance now calls for full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.91 to $2.94 over $2.55 last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding the $0.11 tax benefit in the third quarter, this guidance will be $2.80 to $2.83. This guidance will represent a 13% to 15% increase over the prior year's adjusted EPS of $2.47, which excludes the approximately $0.08 benefit from the 53rd week last year.", "In addition, our fiscal '14 guidance includes a negative $0.02 impact from foreign currency compared to a neutral impact last year. This outlook is now based on estimated consolidated comp store sales growth of 3% for the full year.", "We also expect pretax margins of 12.1% to 12.2%, which is 20 to 30 basis points higher than last year's margin of 11.9%. As a reminder, this guidance includes our e-commerce investments. And last year, the 53rd week positively impacted pretax margins by approximately 20 basis points. Our full year outlook continues to assume fourth quarter EPS in the range of $0.77 to $0.80 compared with $0.82 last year. Again, this included an approximately $0.08 benefit from the extra week last year. We expect fourth quarter EPS to be negatively impacted by $0.01 due to a higher tax rate this year versus last year.", "Now to further details on the fourth quarter. We are assuming fourth quarter sales in the $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion range. This is based on estimated comp sales growth of 1% to 2% on both a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group. As a reminder, this guidance reflects 6 fewer days in the Christmas selling season compared to last year.", "Fourth quarter pretax profit margins are planned in the 11.9% to 12.2% range, down 60 to 30 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, the extra week had approximately 60 basis points positive impact on pretax margins in the fourth quarter last year.", "We're anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margins to be in the range of 27.7% to 27.9%, down 90 to 70 basis points on a reported basis versus the prior year. Again, last year had the benefit of the extra week, which almost all of the 60 basis points impact in gross margin. In addition, this year, we expect gross margins to be negatively impacted by 10 basis points due to foreign currency.", "In terms of SG&A as a percent of sales, for the fourth quarter, we are anticipating a rate of 15.7% to 15.6%, which is 30 to 40 basis points favorable to last year. As a reminder, last year's SG&A ratio was negatively impacted by a combination of items we called out last year, which together totaled about 50 basis points.", "Foreign exchange rates, assuming current levels, are expected to have a neutral impact on EPS in the fourth quarter, which is the same as last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.2%, which as I just mentioned, would have a negative $0.01 impact on the fourth quarter EPS. We're expecting net interest expense of approximately $10 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 720 million.", "Finally, our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels.", "Now we are happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks, and now we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I guess, speaking about the divisional performance, HomeGoods continues to be a standout. I mean, fairly, I guess consistent trends on a multiyear basis. But can you comment where you're seeing, you think, some of the biggest gains either by category or versus other competing formats?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, Daniel, we don't usually go into categories. So I can just tell you that, overall, we're very pleased with the total home business and all the divisions, including HomeGoods and HomeSense. And as usual, we weatherproof our business and are very flexible with all of our categories through the season. So we tweak them up and we tweak them down as we see appropriate.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And I guess, just as it relates to Canada, obviously, it's a positive comp. It's the lowest growth of the divisions. Anything that you're seeing either execution-ally or is it weather or other factors that are maybe keeping that division below some of the others?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "For us, the Canada division, they're actually doing a little bit better than what we planned for this year. We took into account the Marshalls store cannibalization. We took into account the fact that we invested dramatically in talent this year and last year and we are a little bit still in a teaching mode. We also took into consideration other retailers coming in, so actually, we're pretty pleased with Canada's business.", "Operator", "Lorraine Hutchinson.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask for your thoughts on the real estate environment, longer term. What are you seeing in terms of opportunity for the next year or so, both domestically and then for your expansion in Europe?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay. Well, actually, I'm going to turn it over to Ernie in a minute because we're pretty bullish on our real estate. And this year, we're over our account. And so Ernie, do you want to maybe talk about the opportunities, which were pretty terrific?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Sure. Lorraine, we see the environment as continuing to offer up opportunities. It's a healthy thing there, as Carol alluded to, whether domestically or in Europe. So in FY '14, for example, we are coming in over our original store count plan of 150 stores heading to -- we're projecting more like 165 stores. And one of the exciting parts of that is we think we're going to get an additional 7 stores in Europe for this year. Additional store in Canada, where the store count growth isn't as high. 5 more stores than planned in HomeGoods, which is obviously very exciting to us. And an additional 2 stores above the original plan in Marmaxx for the year. So that just bodes well, yes, for FY '14 going into FY '15. But we're confident as we move forward that we're going to be able to continue the real estate growth in the next couple of years based on the environment. So great question.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "So Lorraine, we'll be talking about our store count at year-end going forward. But I assure you we're going to take advantage of every opportunity possible.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Oliver Chen.", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Regarding the environment now, are you seeing the volatility in traffic that we're noticing in the marketplace? And also the merchandise margins being up is very, very impressive. Given the promotional nature of holiday and how everyone's speaking to this, can you sustain the momentum in the merch margins? And if you could just brief us on what drove ticket, I'd appreciate it.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I'm sorry, what was the last one? What drove what?", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Ticket.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay. So our traffic increase was a combination -- it was a combination of average ticket being slightly up and traffic being up. So we were very pleased with the combination. In terms of the merchandise margins, we're just absolutely thrilled with our positioning in terms of our inventory and our open-to-buy. As I said before, we really have a flooded market and we're going to be buying straight into the holiday season. And I'm going to throw it over to Ernie. I think the guys are just absolutely thrilled with what they're seeing.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "I think as we've said many times before, controlling the teams is probably our most difficult challenge. So the availability of desirable product is certainly consistent across most families of business. And the neat thing is it's in all the different areas of the business, whether it's in the moderate level or on the better level, it's pretty widespread. So with that, I think we've had a little bit of opportunity on the markup amidst all of that.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, so Ernie and I have our hammers out and we're hoping the guys go in as of the last week of the holiday season, so that's what we're aiming for. So we really believe we're going to keep our outrageous values and be very competitive.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Terrific. And Ernie, I'm wondering, I'm looking at the total inventory number. It would suggest that maybe you've got a little more in-transit this year. Is that a reflection of those amazing fall buys that you guys were seeing during the third quarter? And how are you thinking about attacking holiday? And are you happy with what you've got still open-to-buy for fourth quarter?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Well, I'll let Scott -- Scott can talk a little bit about the in-transit. I think, that you're looking at it.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. So Kimberly, you're exactly correct. The balance sheet inventory was up 11%. As we discussed in the press release, the average per store inventories were down 4%. Just as a reminder that the numbers exclude, on the average per store, the in-transit inventory and the e-commerce inventories, which clearly were -- we didn't have the STP business and the tjmaxx.com at this time last year. The in-transit inventory, as I'll briefly talk, and Ernie can add on to, are higher primarily due to the calendar shift at the end of the third quarter this year being closer to Christmas than last year, certainly speaking to the, I think, the fresh flow of our merchandise. And Ernie, do you want to add anything else there?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Well, I think -- and I think Carol referred to this earlier on, we are in better shape for our gift-giving holiday season. I think many buys were more gift-giving related this year, so we're feeling very good about that. We're also feeling good about buying later into the season than we did last year. So we're feeling -- we're going to be a little fresher. You have these -- you have the funky sixth day scenario where you're going into holiday, which actually, we are going to take advantage from a flow-it-later perspective. So I think Scott has kind of described to you what's going on with the in-transit, but we're feeling very good about the content of the goods that are on their way and the content of what's, a, in the store now obviously; but further -- furthermore, for our gift-giving, we're feeling terrific -- feeling very excited about that. And we have more families of business participating this year in the gift-giving initiative. So I think that answers your question, Kimberly.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess a question about -- bookkeeping question about updated sales, comps, operating margin by division for the year. And then I think you've addressed, which is the product flow being later in the shorter Thanksgiving-to-Christmas period. But if you could talk about how that's going to work post-Christmas and how you're thinking about the whole period, call it, to-date through January 10?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, the percent of freshness is up and that's what we strive for, which is pretty exciting. We also have a very good strategy coming out of the Christmas season, going into January and switching over. So where you're going to be the most -- you're going to see the most exciting change from Christmas into January that you've ever seen before. So we're pretty excited about that as a potential. Our Gift Cards are way up this year. We think our customers are going to come back. We're going to lure them back. And for the first time in Marmaxx, we're going to be doing some additional advertising in the month of January that we did not have last year. So we think this is going to be an interesting scenario between December and January. But we're doing everything to drive the customer back into our stores right after Christmas, in addition. Scott, you want to do year? And I'll do by quarter.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Right. So I'm going to update the full year current guidance. Again, just as a couple of things to point out, I'm going to give the numbers on a 52-week over 52-week basis, including the FX impact. Also, just as a reminder, the division segment numbers I'm going to talk about are posted on our website as well. So starting with Marmaxx, a comp of 2% versus 6% last year, segment margins of 14.7% to 14.7%, again, versus last year's 14.5% on sales of $17.8 billion to $17.9 billion. Just as a point there, the impact of the e-commerce businesses is about 20 basis points year-over-year to Marmaxx. HomeGoods, 6 to 7 comp versus last year's 7 comp, 12.8% to 13% versus last year's 12% or 80 to 100 basis points higher than last year. TJX Canada, 0 to 1 comp versus last year's 5 comp. 13.6% to 13.7% versus last year's 14% on $2.9 billion. Europe, 4% to 5% versus last year's 10%; 7.3% to 7.5% versus last year's 6.4%, 90 to 110 basis points higher than last year and on $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion. Just as a point, all of the businesses had segment margin increases higher than the guidance we gave in August. Marmaxx would be 10 basis points higher; HomeGoods would be 20; Canada, 30; and Europe, 10. And just to repeat, on the full year, we're 3% comp against last year's 7%, 12.1% to 12.2% versus last year's 11.7%. 40 to 50 basis points higher on $27.2 billion to $27.3 billion.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Mike Baker.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So a couple -- I wanted to ask about the merchandise margins expectations in the fourth quarter. You talked about gross margins being down and all that seemed to be the occupancy from the extra week. But what do you -- how do you think about merchandise margins in the fourth quarter? And I guess related to that, and Ernie touched on this, the merchandise margins in the third quarter, you mentioned higher markups. Are you also associating lower markdowns, i.e. better inventory productivity?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, it's a combination. You want to -- Scott, you want to go through the merchandise margins for the fourth quarter?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. Hold on 1 second here. Merchandise margins, basically at the high end of the range, 27.9% versus last year's 28%. Again, a 10 basis points impact due to FX. So essentially flat on a 2 comp. So about what we would expect.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "And Mike, we'll always try to beat it.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right, understood. And are you still seeing benefits from lower markdowns?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We are seeing some benefit from markdowns, yes. We are turning our inventories faster than a year ago.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And just as a point, in terms of cash -- Carol talked about the turns being faster than they were last year, certainly, through the first 3 quarters. We entered -- we talked about the overall average store and warehouse inventory on a per-store basis. We also enter the fourth quarter with inventories still down in the low-single digits on a per-store basis on the in-store only inventory.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Right. And we still see some opportunities there. So as a result of that, yes, we do have a slight -- a decrease in markdowns, quicker turns. So we are seeing that and, hopefully, we'll continue to see some benefits there in the future, too.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right. Fair enough. And then 1 more, if I could. Carol, you did a great job -- we're talking some of the Analyst Day takeaways. One thing that I thought was interesting at the Analyst Day, which I don't believe you recapped, was the store remodel and refresh program that you're going back and touching all your stores again. So if you can just talk about some of the things that you're doing in the store and how many you've done and how long that will be around for?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes. So far, we have done 315, I think. We started the year saying we would remodel a little over 300 stores. We're probably going to continue at that pace and we'll talk to that at year end. You saw T.J. Maxx, believe it or not, we just started our remodels. So between that and new stores, we already have 159 done to date. So we're pretty excited about that. We're pretty aggressive on touching our stores in every division and we're going to continue that pace.", "Operator", "Stephen Grambling.", "Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I realize it's still early, but can you provide some initial color on the e-commerce results, specifically, how the category mix and customer base may vary versus the store on your expectations, as well as, maybe what the response has been from brands that are online?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We are very pleased with our results. And I've said it a million times, be it small, we're pretty excited about it. We're not going to discuss specific categories but we certainly have a differentiation strategy and we are pleased with that. We're learning every single day, the combination of the buy of STP has been absolutely sensational. So we are very, very pleased and we're going to continue to invest appropriately. I'll keep coming back to Marmaxx, if you take the e-com number out, it's going to make a 15% segment profit. So I think slow growth smart and slow and steady will win the race in the end. But we're going to continue. We're very excited about it.", "Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just a very quick follow-up to that would just be, are there any brands that maybe weren't on there now that we're waiting to see, kind of, how things initially trended that maybe can be brought back? And we saw that there's this Maxx flash element to the site now, I don't know if that's another way to get new brands brought in?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Hopefully, you'll shop some of our -- we've had our -- an interesting Maxx flash recently. We're going to continue to do that, and you'll see some things that we'll be testing through the holiday season. Some of the buyers are getting more excited and we're going to keep building this. I have all the faith in the world that we're going to build it the same way we built our business with great brands.", "Operator", "Roxanne Meyer.", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I just got 2 follow-ups. One on the e-commerce, certainly it's early days, but we are seeing some unbelievable brands showing up. And just, overall, the assortment does seem to skew upper- and middle-income and with price points probably higher than what's in your store. Just wondering if that's the strategy that you think you're going to be pursuing over the longer term? And then secondly, on the remodel program, I'm just wondering if you've got any plans for some of your other divisions to get remodeled?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, that 315 isn't just Marmaxx. We have a remodel program in every division. And next year, each division is going to come back to Ernie and myself with their proposal of remodeling, and usually we're pretty aggressive with it. So we want to make sure that all of our stores are very current. In terms of e-com, we're just -- the strategy is going to build and build and build. And we're adding more product everyday. We have home product we're adding, we're learning. This is going to be a combination of good, better and best products on e-com. This is a great way to reach a customer. We don't have runway, we don't have some of our product that can reach across the U.S. today. So it gives us the ability to do that. But our strategy is going to be all levels, all good, better and best going forward. So we're pretty excited. It all seems to be working.", "Operator", "Brian Tunick, your line is open.", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I guess, Carol, given you're now almost as large as the biggest department store player, we're just wondering, are you still focused on that delta below department store pricing? Or do you -- does your model now have more pricing power today given the market share gains and your overall buying power with the vendors? And then our second question is, if you could just give us some color on marketing spend, either dollars or rate, for Q4 versus last year?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "So our advertising spend is up 10 basis points for the year, I believe. It's up that for Q4, Scott?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, so it's about 10 basis points, Brian. As far as the power of pricing, we just continue -- with the number of vendors and our buying getting smarter and smarter and we keep teaching -- and the growth of our buying group, we just try to keep raising the bar. In the end, it's all about vendor relationships. And we build a business with each vendor, that helps them make money and it helps us make money. And that's really our strategy going forward. We're going to continue that. So to us, it's all about the relationships. That's not going to change.", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right. So my question, I guess, was on the ticket as far as sort of what your pricing ability is. Do you still monitor all the department stores to see where they're at going out the door or do you now have more pricing power yourself given the category?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Brian, we still monitor -- a big part of what our merchants do is to monitor the out-the-door prices at other retailers. So we always want to show the appropriate value gap between us and the other retailers. I'm not sure, is that what you're asking or?", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, exactly.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Back to Carol's point, that will not change. And that approach, regardless of the buying power -- yes, and I know what you're saying, our buying power has gone up exponentially over the last 5 years. It does not affect that approach to us because, really, we want to offer the customer, in the end, the best value.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We have to be competitive, that's who we are and that's what we'll continue to be. It's always the distance between us and the department stores.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a big picture question. As I look back over the last 10 years, your SG&A rate has been in the band between 16.3% and 17% of sales. And I'm just wondering if you see -- and this is probably best for Scott, if you see that moving out of that band at some point, in theory, to the lower end? I think you said closer to lower end right now. Can you move even lower? And then Carol, just a quick one for you, just in the near term, who do you see as the greatest threat from a competition perspective -- competitive landscape perspective?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Paul, a couple of things, actually, I'm just going to add on a previous question or 2 about our remodels. Of the 315 remodels that Carol talked about that would be done this year, approximately 2/3 get -- of that get done in Marmaxx and then in the 30 to 40 range, which is proportionate to keeping all of those stores fresh. That's always an ongoing thing. And as Carol said, in that 30 to 40 range, sometimes, we tweak it up higher depending on the state of the stores at that point. But again, just wanted to reiterate that. In terms of the expense structure, just as a point, part of the benefit we've been getting on expenses is through the leverage in the gross profit on the buying and occupancy. So clearly we, over the years, don't break out exactly what that has been over a many year period. But clearly, we've been leveraging in that line due to our above-plan comps and I think the great deals we've been getting. In terms of the SG&A, a lot will depend on what the comps will be. We think our expenses -- at this point, we haven't done our plan for next year. Certainly, we'd expect to be, on a 2 comp, relatively level. But I think long term, it depends on the amount of investment spend that we will be doing and other initiatives and how much we'd want to put in advertising, et cetera. But certainly, we want to stay at the low end of the number you talked about.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes. I mean, Paul, I think we also want to leave ourselves some flexibility in terms of e-com because as that -- we like the initial results. If that starts to take off, we may be a little bit more aggressive in years 1 and 2 to fund for the future, but that remains to be seen. Again, I keep saying we need to grow smart and evaluate that. In terms of what do we see as the greatest threat. I know this is going to sound a little hokey, but the greatest threat is us being complacent. If we do our job and we keep raising the bar on the products and the value and the brand and what we're giving the customer, I sleep very well at night. So I really look at it internally in how we're doing versus all competition. There isn't 1 threat. To me, I look at everybody as a threat, and we all do. So it's really within us and our execution and that's what's going to make us continue to grow.", "Operator", "Howard Tubin.", "Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Can you just maybe give us an update on new store productivity, how that's been trending in your stores over the last couple of years?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "I can tell you that our new stores are performing above plan. We are very, very happy, which is why we started to increase our store count. Our old stores continue to comp, and that's what's so amazing about our business, that we're getting it really across the board. We don't give specific numbers but I can tell you that we're very excited about our new store performance.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Howard, I'll just -- give just a little here on -- in terms of our -- in terms of our Marmaxx and HomeGoods, as we've said for many years, for several -- for a long period of time at Marmaxx, we've been beating it by -- in the mid to -- mid double digit, that 10% to 15% range. HomeGoods, we've had great performance also in the last few years. And clearly, by the way, we've been bullish about Europe. We've been beating our pro formas there for the last several years as well. And in Canada, we've had very good performance as well. So really, Marmaxx, a long period of time but all the other divisions are quite strong, and in many cases, it's been in that low double-digit amount.", "Operator", "Jeff Stein.", "Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research", "Carol, a question for you on gifting. And I suppose everything in your store can qualify as a gift, but as you define it internally, I'm wondering if you could just give us some guesstimate in terms of what percent of your fourth quarter sales would be defined as gifts? And I'm speaking of the type of items when you set up these tables in the stores and have items for -- under $10 gifts, under $20 gifts and so forth. And secondly, can you talk to us a little bit about what families of business you're expanding the gifting categories to this year that you did not offer last year?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, you're not going to like my answer because we really don't talk about the family of businesses that we would expand or decrease. In addition, we have so much and more open-to-buy that we can't even tell you what the percentage of gift-giving is because we're wide open to go in. And if it ends up being like crazy coats at outrageous value, you don't categorize that as gift-giving but it's going to be -- we want it to be mind-blowing, so to speak. So it's very hard, today, in November, to tell you what percentage it's going to be. We're going to continue the tables. We have great, great flow. Our stores are set up to understand that whatever product comes in, they know how to take the product and set it up as gift-giving. But we wanted -- the buyers are very, very focused on it being extreme, extreme value. So just about anything that comes into our store from now on should be outrageous gift-giving product.", "Operator", "Marni Shapiro.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "I was curious about something that you haven't really talked about and it seems the department stores have continually spoken about shoes and accessories and handbags as a particular interest, a strong point in their own businesses. And obviously, one of your competitors has standalone footwear and accessory store. If you can talk about -- update on the Marshalls shoes and an update on this segment and your thoughts around the segment as either its own entity or as a shop-in-shop like the runway or what you have going on with shoes across many of your chains?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "First of all, the categories are all very, very strong for us and they continue to be. I think we are definitely a destination for handbags, shoes and accessories. So that is growing dramatically for us. We love the fact of flexibility. So we really have been very careful not to set up a store that's too small. It doesn't have the ability to have many family of businesses and give us the flexibility. Today, it could be outrageous, tomorrow, it could not be outrageous. And so we don't ever want to put ourselves in a position that we're focused on 1 or 2 or 3 categories alone. We just find that our model is perfect to have many, many, many categories in that flexibility.", "Operator", "Dana Telsey.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Carol, tremendous results, and as you think about the allocation of store space in the store, with home doing well, and other categories doing well, how do you see the store size, what you think about is the right size going forward given the expansion of categories?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Well, as we've reduced our inventories, we're kind of loving our store size. It gives us tremendous flexibility and we still think there's a little bit of room. Actually, I walk into the stores today and I think both Ernie and I say, \"Oh, we could probably bring the inventories down a little bit more and create more freshness.\" But we're very, very pleased with our store size. As you know, we have all kinds of sizes and shapes, and the ability to be able to do that. In Europe, we have many stores that are on 2 and 3 floors. We take advantage of the space that is available. If it's a good deal, we're going to go after it. But it's not like we're going to look at 80,000 square-foot stores. However, we do have some ideas, as always.", "Operator", "Laura Champine.", "Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Obviously, a lot of retailers got caught with too much inventories. What's the status of your packaway? Have you been building that? And any quantification you can do with that as a percentage of inventories will be great.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "It's pretty flat for last year and we remain -- it's not a big part of our business. Our packaway remains pretty small as a percent of our business because more importantly, we want to be current. We want to be the most current fashion. So we don't build tremendous packaways. We'll take advantage, but today we're pretty much flat to last year, which is very comfortable for us.", "Operator", "Mark Montagna.", "Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "A question just about the merchandise margin. So it sounds -- merchandise margin is up, and you've gotten some gains on lower markdowns. But is higher IMU helping? And if so, which quarter did the higher IMU start? And then just for Ernie, you said the market is flooded with merchandise, would you say it's more flooded this year versus last year?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Mark, in terms of the market, yes, I would say there are more goods this year than last year. It might vary by certain families of business or departments, but in total, there's more merchandise. I think your first question, though, was about markup? Mark-on...", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Mark, you want to know the mark-on?", "Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "What I'm trying to understand is you've got the higher -- you're getting the higher merchandise margin, and some of that is lower markdowns, but is some of it also higher IMU? And then, if so...", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes, it's a combination. It's a combination. And we don't break that up by quarter. But again, as you have -- as you're buying closer to need, you have the opportunity to gain on the mark-on and the markdowns because you're more current, you're more fresh. And as our trends continue, you get the benefit of both. But there are outrageous deals out there and we have plenty of open-to-buy. So that's always going to be a positive.", "Operator", "Patrick McKeever.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "I know Black Friday is not a big deal for you but certainly those -- the whole Thanksgiving weekend is an important time for the company. And so I'm just wondering, with so much more going on, on Thanksgiving Day, some competitors, department stores opening up at 8:00 and some even earlier than that. What you're thinking about, just from a strategic standpoint, over the Thanksgiving weekend?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "We're going to do what we always do. It's have outrageous products. I mean, we don't play in special deals and special discounting, but we have some outrageous goods going out and we are very excited about that. We're not planning on being open on Thanksgiving. We have a handful of stores that have to deal with some leases. But we really would like our employees to enjoy Thanksgiving with their family. We just feel, culturally, it's very important. So we're really not going to play in that arena. But we feel very good about our product that's coming in through the holiday season.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Did you see an impact last year from these Thanksgiving store openings, either to the negative or even, perhaps, to the positive by seeing more business on Black Friday morning than you might have seen otherwise?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Patrick, we have really not seen a lot of impact. We've studied this over the years, and because we haven't jumped into the promotional play, we're not up against it. So what happens is we kind of -- I think our customers know that and they aren't expecting it. We have, over the years, looked at the hours and we've taken care of that but essentially, now, there's no change in that, like Carol said.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Yes. Quite frankly, I've gotten some incredible positive e-mails from customers actually thanking us for not being open on Thanksgiving. I mean, we believe that's important.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "I'll throw my thanks in as well as an analyst. And then a quick one on the tax rate, what would the tax rate have been absent that pickup? What would it have been on a normalized basis in the quarter?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Sure. Give me 1 second here. It's approximately, for the third quarter, 38.1% so -- versus last year's 38.3%. So down. And the reason it was down versus last year, because we had the benefit of Worker's Opportunity Tax Credit, which Congress passed last year during the fourth quarter. One of the reasons why we're down in the fourth quarter tax rate that I called out earlier and had the benefit in our -- slight benefit in our overall tax rate due to the composition of our income with more of our -- a little more of that income coming from Europe, so that helped benefit. So 38.1% versus last year's 38.3%.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "Okay. I think we only have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And that comes from David Glick.", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Just a question for Ernie. I was just wondering how you're thinking about and strategizing the seasonal categories. I mean, they've been tough the last few fourth quarters. And your business has been strong despite that. And I'm wondering if that's part of the flood of merchandise that you're seeing and if that's part of your flow strategy to be able to potentially take advantage of a more favorable outlook for seasonal categories? And whether that could be a positive catalyst for your ticket and transaction value and in particular, where your comp store sits at?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "So David, let me just get a little clarification. When you say seasonal categories, you're talking about...", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Outerwears, sweaters.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes, outerwears, sweaters, cold weather goods, et cetera?", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Yes, sorry.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes, we -- first of all, some of those categories are very gift-giving related, if you actually think about it. So we have not run into a shortfall of goods there, so that's been good. So those are categories that we plan to be in, in a meaningful way. I cannot tell you whether it's dramatically different than last year. We can't give that information out. But we had good success there last year. I think we're a little more excited this year because there's some fashion going on in some of those categories, more so this year than last year, which generally, in our environment, bodes well for being more successful there. So I think if you're asking do we plan on seasonal categories being more important this year? I would say yes, to a degree. Does that make sense? Does that answer it?", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Yes. And I'm just also wondering if there's a lot of incremental availability and if weather kind of moves your way, whether that's something you can take advantage of as the quarter unfolds and [indiscernible]", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes. We can -- in other words, if the trend gets even better there, as the model -- and this is what's great about our model, we can chase those businesses more aggressively because, yes, there is availability. Not in every seasonal category, but in a fair amount of them, I would say. So yes, we can do that.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz", "However, David, we don't want to get into the fray of everybody marking down certain categories. We have very exciting newness coming in, as I said, as we transition out of December into January. So we'll take advantage of it, but to the degree that we feel is appropriate for our business.", "Thanks, everyone. And we look forward to coming back fourth quarter. And have a wonderful holiday season. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. You may all disconnect.

Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you, Elan, and good morning, everyone. So before we begin, Deb has a few comments to make.", "Debra McConnell", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company\u2019s results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company\u2019s plans to vary materially.

Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis. Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today\u2019s press release in the Investor Information section of our website, tjx.com.", "Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s press release or otherwise posted on our website, www.tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Deb. And joining me and Debra on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg. 2013 was another successful year for TJX on top of many great years. Earnings per share increased 15% which was above our plan. We achieved this growth over last year\u2019s robust 24% adjusted EPS growth on a 52-week basis.", "Over the last five years, our compound annual adjusted EPS growth was a strong 24%. Consolidated comp sales increased 3% in line with our plan, and over last year\u2019s very strong 7% increase. Excluding the extra week last year, three of our four divisions delivered the highest annual segment profit margin in their histories.", "Our 2013 performance once again demonstrates the power and resiliency of our off-price business model. With our value, mission and enormous flexibility, we drove excellent results in a very competitive retail environment. Value remains top of mind for today\u2019s consumer, and we are convinced that our values will continue to attract U.S. and international customers.", "Today, I want to share with you the magnitude of our top and bottom line growth opportunities. While we are approaching $30 billion in annual sales, we see tremendous global growth potential ahead for TJX. We are maintaining our 10% to 13% long-term annual EPS growth model, while continuing to invest in our future growth.", "As always, we will strive to surpass our goals, which we have done successfully for the last five years. We are in excellent position as we begin a new year, and are well on our road to becoming a $40 billion company and beyond.", "Before I continue, I\u2019ll turn this call over to Scott to recap the numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks Carol. Beginning with our full year fiscal \u201814 results. Again consolidated comparable store sales increased 3% on a 52-week comparable basis on top of four years of comp increases of 4% or higher. Our full year comp increase was driven by ticket with traffic being slightly positive.", "On an adjusted basis, excluding the third quarter tax benefit of $0.11 per share, fiscal \u201814 diluted earnings per share were $2.83, a 15% increase over the prior year\u2019s adjusted EPS of $2.47, which excludes the approximately 8% benefit from the 53rd week in fiscal \u201813. Fiscal \u201814 represents the fifth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth.", "Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.01 negative impact on earnings per share compared with the neutral impact last year.", "For the full year, consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 12.1%, on an adjusted basis, excluding the approximate 20 basis points benefit from the 53rd week in fiscal \u201813. Fiscal \u201814 pre-tax profit margin increased 40 basis points from last year.", "Gross profit margin was 28.5%, up 10 basis points over the prior year. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.3%, a 10 basis points improvement from last year, in line with our plans. For both gross profit and SG&A, I\u2019m comparing against reported 53-week results last year. So on an adjusted 52-week comparable basis, the year-over-year improvement was actually a bit better.", "Now to recap fourth quarter results. Consolidated comparable store sales increased 3% over last year\u2019s 4% reported increased and a 7% increase in the prior year. Our fourth quarter comp was driven by an increase in ticket.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.81, a 9% increase over the prior year\u2019s adjusted EPS of $0.74 which excludes the approximately $0.08 benefit from the extra week last year.", "Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.01 positive impact on earnings per share compared with the neutral impact last year.", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margins were 12.0%, excluding approximately 60 basis points benefit from the extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201813. This represents a 10 basis points increase from last year, due to SG&A favorability.", "Gross profit margin was 27.6%, down 100 basis points versus the prior year. This was due to a combination of factors. First, almost all of the 60 basis point benefit from the extra week in fiscal \u201813 was in gross margin. Secondly, merchandise margins decreased this year, primarily as a result of our aggressive pricing and markdowns in the fourth quarter. Carol will elaborate in just a moment.", "SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 15.6%, an improvement of 40 basis points versus the prior year. This was due to year-over-year favorability from a combination of items that negatively impacted last year\u2019s ratio by about 50 basis points.", "At the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis including the warehouses and excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories were down 8% in constant currency. We began the new fiscal year in a great inventory position with great flexibility to take advantage of buying opportunities in the marketplace.", "Now to some detail on the impact of FX on TJX Canada. The steep decline in the Canadian dollar had a negative impact on TJX Canada\u2019s merchandise margins in the fourth quarter.", "Let me explain further. TJX Canada buys over 50% of its merchandise in U.S. dollars. While our inventory hedges can help mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations, in fiscal \u201814, the Canadian dollar depreciated even more dramatically beyond the hedges that we placed throughout the year. Effectively, this increased our cost of goods bought in U.S. dollars.", "As always, we remain focused on our value gap with the competition and priced our merchandise accordingly. As a result, we had significant pressure on our merchandise margins, which is reflected in the 160 basis point decline in the adjusted segment margins at TJX Canada in the fourth quarter.", "Moving to our financial strength and excellent financial returns. Our business model continues to generate tremendous amounts of cash and superior financial returns. In fiscal \u201814, our ROIC reached 23%. This is up from 19% at the end of fiscal \u201810 and we believe is one of the highest among major retailers. We continue reinvesting in our growth and remain strongly committed to returning cash to our shareholders.", "We returned $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders in fiscal \u201814 through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Even after increasing the shareholder distribution programs and our investments in the business, we still ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash and short-term investments.", "Now let me turn the call back to Carol, and I will recap our first quarter and full year fiscal \u201815 guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks Scott. So before I discuss our global growth potential, I\u2019ll share some additional color on the fourth quarter.", "I am very happy with our holiday business, with sales in November and December well above our plans. We made a strategic decision to price our merchandise aggressively in the very promotional selling environment and deliver extreme values.", "While this pressured merchandise margins, we are convinced our value to help drive holiday sales and will keep customers coming back to our stores long-term. Well, I don\u2019t like talking about the weather unless I have to. In January, we believe the severe winter weather in most of the U.S. and Canada kept many shoppers home and did dampen sales.", "We stuck to our off-price discipline and took aggressive markdowns in January, particularly in apparel to clear the product. Although this impact in merchandise margins, it allowed us to begin the New Year with extremely clean inventories. This positions us well to capitalize on environment right for TJX.", "We see a marketplace absolutely loaded with buying opportunities for branded merchandise and a value-minded customer. I should also note that in the U.S. regions where weather generally wasn\u2019t unusual including the West Coast and Florida, trends continue to be strong. And at Marmaxx, our less weather sensitive categories, including home fashions, footwear, jewelry and accessories had the strongest performance. We believe all of this bodes well for when weather does improve. We are ready to ship fresh assortments at exciting prices and we are well positioned for 2014.", "Now to the magnitude of our U.S. and international growth opportunities. First, we see huge potential to gain consumer market share. As we\u2019ve discussed before, while we have grown our customer base significantly over the last several years, our U.S. consumer penetration levels remain below those of most major department stores, which speaks to our opportunity.", "We believe Marshalls in Canada will help us grow in their country and the opportunity to expand our reach in Europe is back. Throughout 2013, we saw a greater percentage of younger shoppers among our new customers, while continuing to serve our core demographic. We attract household incomes anywhere from $50,000 up to millions of dollars and will continue to target a very wide customer demographic.", "To reach even more consumers, we are leveraging our global marketing capabilities. During the holiday season our tri-branding campaigns allowed us to leverage three of our retail brands at the same time in all intensely competitive environments.", "Further, we know that people who shop more than one of our chains on average spends considerably more on us. In 2014, we plan to become even more aggressive with our marketing with several more weeks of advertising activities in last year including TV, radio and social media. We\u2019ve tested some things last year, and we liked how they worked and have up our sleeves for this year.", "To retain the new shoppers, our marketing is attracting, and now are already loyal ones, we plan to keep upgrading the shopping experience in all of our chains. In 2014, we plan to remodel approximately 250 stores across the company. We are also working on a new Marshalls prototype in the U.S.", "Customer service is an ongoing focus for us. And we are pleased that our customer satisfaction scores increased in 2013. We still see a lot of opportunity for improvement and to raise the bar on our customer shopping experience. To keep wowing our shoppers with current fashion and trend right merchandise, we remained focus on building our brand presence in our stores.", "We are expanding our global sourcing to get even closer to the source of the product. Our vendor universe numbers over 16,000 vendors around the world. Of course we have exciting in-store initiative plans for this year, like you\u2019ll have to visit our stores and see them for yourself.", "Now to our enormous global store growth potential. At our investor event last October, we raised our long-term store growth estimates to 5,150 stores and remain extremely confident in our potential. With over 3,200 stores today, we would be 60% more than our current base with just our existing chains in our existing markets alone.", "I\u2019ll briefly recap our potential beginning in the U.S. Long-term, we see Marmaxx growing at about 50% to 3,000 stores. As we discussed at the investor event, this reflects 400 more stores than our earlier estimate. Marmaxx\u2019s excellent new store performance and continued strong results give us great confidence.", "In 2013, comps increased 3%, over 6% increase last year. Marmaxx has averaged 5% comp growth in the last five years. Segment profit reached 14.6%. Excluding the extra week last year, this was a divisional record.", "Further, we are successfully locating stores closer to one another and co-locating more T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, while keeping cannibalization levels where we would expect.", "At HomeGoods, our long-term store growth estimate of 825 stores could be conservative. Some other U.S. home retailers currently operate over 1,000 stores. HomeGoods new store performance has also been terrific and its performance has been outstanding.", "HomeGoods posted a 7% comp in 2013 over 7% growth last year, and segment profit reached 12.9%, another divisional record. Over the last five years, HomeGoods sales had nearly doubled and segment profit had been increased eight fold.", "Internationally at TJX Canada, our long-term estimate of 450 stores represents 30% growth and reflects the potential to grow our Marshalls brand to about 100 stores. In 2013, TJX Canada comps were flat, while segment profit margin declined. It was in line with our plans for the year. We continue to be pleased with Marshalls in Canada where we saw business accelerate as the year progressed.", "At TJX Europe, we see vast potential for our company. We believe we can grow to 875 stores, more than double our current space with just our existing change in our existing European markets alone. This division delivered outstanding results in 2013 with comps up 6%, over 10% growth last year.", "Adjusted segment profit margins, excluding foreign currency reached 7.7%. This is another divisional record with 500 basis points of improvement in the last two years. We saw broad-based strength across the different geographies, economic climates and consumer environment in which we operate.", "With TJX Europe firmly on track, we plan to accelerate the pace of openings this year to 40 stores, which are 25% more than last year. In Germany, we expect to more than double the number of store openings versus last year. And in the U.K., we had planned opening in some fabulous locations.", "Beyond 2014, I am excited to announce we plan to open our first few stores in Austria in 2015. We see expansion into Austria as a natural extension of our European business. We have learned our lessons in Europe, and we are confident that we have the right infrastructure and organization in place to support this next move.", "We have been analyzing Austria for a long period of time and we are confident we know that marketplace and the customer. I\u2019m very excited about the strength of our European business and our international growth potential. In 2014, almost 25% of our store growth is planned in Europe. And in 2015, we plan to enter our next new country.", "We are one of the few U.S. retailers to have expanded successfully internationally and remain the only major brick and mortar off-price retailer in Europe. 2014 marks our 20th year in the U.K. and that experience is not easily replicated.", "Beyond brick and mortar, we see e-commerce as another major long-term opportunity for TJX. I am very pleased with our e-commerce business in 2013. We learned a lot, and see opportunities to leverage this channel even more. Customer response to our launch of tjmaxx.com last fall was better than expected.", "We are delighted to offer consumers the convenience to shop our values 24x7 and see e-commerce as an additional platform to attract new shoppers and drive traffic, both online and in our stores. In fact, the majority of tjmaxx.com returns are going to our stores. We see this as a great opportunity to introduce our stores to new customers who have discovered us online.", "We are very pleased with our acquisition of Sierra Trading Post. Beyond the smooth transition during its first year as part of TJX, we\u2019re even more excited about the future opportunities we see to leverage knowledge and expertise in both directions. And in Europe, while e-commerce is a small piece of their business, we\u2019re also pleased with the progress at tkmaxx.com.", "Longer term, we can eventually see e-commerce working for all of TJX retail brands. We will continue to take a deliberate approach to online growth, grow smart is our motto.", "Now I\u2019d want to cover some key points on why we see TJX so strongly positioned to achieve the next level of growth. First, we see ourselves as leaders in innovation. We are constantly seeking the right categories, newness, current fashion and exciting new brands. We\u2019re always testing new seeds and I am happy to share with you that later this year, we plan to open two new Sierra Trading Post stores.", "This will be a value-driven outdoor concept, based on the same off-price model of all of our stores. We are never complacent. We continue to invest in our supply chain and distribution network to support our growth. Our goal is to be even leaner and faster, delivering less inventory to our stores more often. While we are already very good at this, we believe we can become even better at shipping the right goods at the right stores at the right time. This is what helps create the treasure hunt experience of shopping in all our stores.", "As I\u2019ve discussed before, we are investing in merchandise systems initiatives that we believe will further enhance our supply chain precision. We are being very methodical with this initiative and expect to begin a gradual rollout next year.", "So in closing, we are very pleased with our performance in 2013. This marks another year of above planned results as we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive top and bottom line growth in both strong and weak retail environment. Looking ahead, we see tremendous near and long-term opportunities for TJX.", "We began the New Year with very clean inventories and well positioned to capitalize on the numerous buying opportunities we see. While many of the retailers are now focusing on value, at TJX, value has been our mission since day one. Although there may be a race among the rest of retail to the lowest price, we will always be about true value, which for us is a combination of fashion, brand, quality and price.", "We are delighted to offer customers the ability and convenience to shop in-stores and online. We are excited about our marketing ideas for 2014 and beyond. We continue testing new seeds including two new Sierra Trading Post stores this fall. We are leveraging four large synergistic divisions as we grow.", "Our three divisions other than Marmaxx are approaching or exceeding $3 billion in annual sales. So they are each big businesses in their own right. We are thrilled with TJX Europe, and we plan to enter our next European country in 2015. I could not be more excited about our international potential. TJX Europe is approaching $4 billion in annual sales and next to Marmaxx with second largest divisional contributor to our 2013 earnings growth.", "We see Europe as a big part of our future growth. To support the next level of growth for TJX overall, we continue to reinvest in our business.", "And lastly, our management team is laser focused on near-term execution, while setting our sights on our long-term strategic vision. We see TJX in an excellent position to bring value around the world.", "And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to go through our guidance and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks Carol. Now to fiscal \u201815 guidance beginning with the full year. For the full year, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.19 over $2.94 in fiscal \u201814. Again fiscal \u201814 included a tax benefit of $0.11. Excluding this benefit, fiscal \u201815 full year expected EPS would be 8% to 13% over the prior year\u2019s adjusted $2.83.", "Our EPS guidance assumes consolidated sales in the $28.8 billion to $29.2 billion range, a 5% to 6% increase over the prior year. For comp store sales, we\u2019re assuming 1% to 2% increase, both on a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group.", "For the year, we expect pre-tax profit margins to be 12.0% to 12.3%. This would be down 10 basis points, to up 20 basis points versus 12.1% in fiscal \u201814. We\u2019re planning gross profit margins to be 28.4% to 28.7%, which is down 10 basis points, to up 20 basis points versus fiscal \u201814.", "We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 16.3%, flat with last year. Foreign currency exchange rates, assuming current levels, are expected to have a $0.01 negative impact on full year EPS growth versus a $0.01 positive impact last year.", "In fiscal \u201815, we plan to continue to balance the use of cash between investing to support our growth and returning cash to shareholders. Similar to last year, we\u2019re planning capital spending of about $975 million. We are planning investments in store growth and remodels, and we also continue our investments in our distribution network, systems and home office facilities.", "We are planning to stock buyback in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, and expect that our Board of Directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 21% on top of the 26% increase last year.", "Even with this level of shareholder distribution, we still plan to end fiscal \u201815 with $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion in cash, which provides significant financial flexibility. For modeling purposes, we\u2019re planning a tax rate of 37.8%, net interest expense of approximately $35 million and a weighted average share count of 703 million shares.", "Now to Q1 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.66, a 5% to 6% increase over the last year\u2019s $0.62 per share. There are several items that we have assumed will negatively impact our expected growth rate in the first quarter. These include; the reversal of the mark-to-market adjustment that benefited the fourth quarter, the negative impact of FX on TJX Canada\u2019s merchandise margins and the timing of some expenses. So our underlying growth rate without these items would be stronger than the numbers imply.", "We\u2019re assuming the first quarter consolidated sales in the $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion. This is based on comp sales growth in the 1% to 2% range on both, a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group.", "First quarter pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 11.4% to 11.5% range, down 40 basis points to down 30 basis points versus the prior year.", "We\u2019re anticipating first quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.1% to 28.2%, down 30 basis points to down 20 basis points versus the prior year. We\u2019re expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the 16.5% to 16.6% range versus 16.5% last year.", "Foreign currency rates, assuming current levels, are expected to have a $0.01 negative impact on EPS this year compared to a $0.01 negative impact last year. For modeling purposes, we\u2019re anticipating a tax rate of 38.0% and net interest expense of about $9 million. We anticipate weighted average share count of approximate 713 million.", "Again, our guidance for the first quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels.", "I\u2019ll wrap up with our store growth plans for fiscal \u201815. On a consolidated basis, we plan to open about 182 stores, with about 10 planned closings. This would result in approximately 172 net new stores for a total of about 3,391 stores planned by year-end. This represents square footage growth of approximately 5%, which would be at the high end of our three year growth model.", "In the U.S. with the continued strong performance of Marmaxx and HomeGoods, we plan to continue our aggressive expansion of these businesses. Our plans call for us to net 75 new stores at Marmaxx and 35 new stores at HomeGoods. As Carol mentioned, we also plan to open two new Sierra Trading Post stores.", "Internationally at TJX Canada, we plan to add 20 new stores including 10 Marshalls stores. At TJX Europe, as Carol mentioned, we expect to increase our pace of openings by approximately 25% and add 40 new stores this year.", "Now we are happy to take your questions. To keep this call on schedule, we are going to continue to ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. We appreciate your cooperation with this. Thanks and we\u2019ll now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question today is from Omar Saad.", "Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group", "Thanks, good morning. Congrats on a great year guys. A question about the quarter. It was kind of on insane quarter with all the weather that you talked about, the shortened holiday period. Can you talk about either from a high level or maybe anecdotally how \u2013 some anecdotes around how you were able to kind of leverage the flexibility you guys have in your buying organization and your inventory flows to really deal with the quarter \u2013 to deal with all the volatility that was going on in the quarter? It\u2019d be helpful to have a better understanding of how you were able to manage through it so well?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well first of all, we actually \u2013 we ended our Q3 very lean, and our plan was to increase fresh flow a little bit higher than a year ago between November and December. And basically what we did is we made a decision that by year-end, we wanted to end very lean which I absolutely love our inventory positions.", "So as we started to get into November-December with sales were good, we did clear out cold weather goods pretty quickly. And then we took pretty aggressive markdowns in January, so that we would end the year nice and clean. And that was mostly on the apparel categories. Does that answer your question?", "Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group", "Do you still have cold weather products in the store given that \u2013 yes, do you still have cold weather product in the store given the lingering cold weather or you already [indiscernible].", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, we\u2019re completely clean. We had very little cold weather even in January. We were pretty cleaned out by December.", "Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group", "Got you. Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, most of the markdowns were really on non-cold weather apparels. It was predominantly where we took our markdowns.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi, thanks very much guys, and a good quarter despite some of the challenges. Just curious about your thoughts regarding the internet, both as a marketing and relationship building tool and obviously as, what appears to be an effective selling tool as well. You commented briefly on it and it\u2019s been a while, I\u2019m wondering if your outlook for it has changed in the future?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. So I\u2019m going to sort of repeat what I said because it really is so small to us. And it\u2019s a building process and we are very, very pleased. We did beat our sales plan, but having said that, we\u2019re getting close to $30 billion without e-commerce.", "So it\u2019s just going to be something, we\u2019re going to keep building we\u2019ve learned. We have some interesting plans. And our intention long-term is to have all our brands, be able to sell to the customer online and in stores. What we\u2019re particularly pleased about is the fact that most customers are returning \u2013 their returns are going back into the stores.", "So what we need to understand is new customers \u2013 are we gaining new customers? We have a lot of information, but we are very pleased with the launch. And we did make sure that we really satisfy the customer during the holiday period also. So we didn\u2019t really have any glitch in terms of getting it directly to the customer quickly, and that\u2019s really what we strive for our first back half out with tjmaxx.", "Richard Jaffe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Roxanne Meyer.", "Roxanne Meyer \u2013 UBS", "Great, thanks. And let me add my congratulations on a terrific end to the year.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Roxanne Meyer \u2013 UBS", "I\u2019m just wondering in terms of your international expansion, plans going into Austria. You\u2019ve told us that as you\u2019ve expanded into new markets, you\u2019ve really needed to localize the product, and you\u2019ve obviously pulled in some of your seasoned managers from the U.S. to go over to Europe. And I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re going to be approaching new markets from here, and what kind of further infrastructure investments or distribution investments you\u2019ll need to make?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, I think right now we\u2019ve been looking at a few places obviously. And we think that this is particularly interesting. And those eight million people, very high demographic and very similar to our German mix. So we really don\u2019t see any increase dramatically in infrastructure. We\u2019ll put a slight amount into systems and that\u2019s really about it. And we\u2019ll have some other opportunities in the future too to leverage that way.", "Ernie Herrman", "Well Roxanne, I\u2019ll just jump in a little bit here also. As Carol said, our infrastructure \u2013 and we\u2019ve talked about this couple of times I think over the last year or two. We\u2019re in pretty good shape in terms of our merchandising planning areas. Over there we call our merchandising area.", "So as we look at this is an extension of Germany, it\u2019s really allowing us to not even distract the organization with any big type of initiative or new type of business. So it will be a pretty seamless transition into the few stores into Austria.", "Roxanne Meyer \u2013 UBS", "Great, thank you so much.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think the other thing that we should stress is that Ernie and his team had been looking at the country a few years out. So they\u2019ve really got the lay of the land. And that was very important. We have a team, and the infrastructure is absolutely there.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, as opposed to just jumping at this we did not \u2013 to Carol\u2019s point, we\u2019ve been talking about this for a while. So this was not a new \u2013 we\u2019re new in announcing it, but we\u2019ve looked at this for quite a while.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We\u2019re really excited about Europe.", "Roxanne Meyer \u2013 UBS", "Great. Well, thank you so much, and best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Baker.", "Michael Baker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thanks guys. So I wanted to ask about some of the department store competition, and they seem to be getting sharper in price, and I know generally bigger picture how you compete with that. But is that having impact on your business, and maybe part of that question is J.C. Penney and you\u2019re asked all the time and you say it does have an impact, but if you look at 2012 J.C. Penney gave up about $4 billion in sales, in 2013, it will be about $1 billion in sales and your comps did decelerate in 2013 versus 2012. Is that just coincidence, or are you gaining a less share from department stores in J.C. Penney in particular? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Look, we look at Penney\u2019s, we look at everyone. We really don\u2019t see that dramatically affecting our business at all. And in terms of the distance between us and being able to offer value, we don\u2019t see any issues there. There are more goods available.", "You have to understand first of all, we do businesses with over 16,000 vendors. We are global. We have the advantage of European fashion, domestic fashions, brands all over the world. That is very different than what is typical. So again we don\u2019t really see Penney\u2019s. We didn\u2019t see it a year ago or two years ago. We just need to keep executing well.", "In the fourth quarter, we definitely did get a little bit hurt by weather, but we are positioned extremely well for 2014. We will strive to beat our plan again.", "Michael Baker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question today is from Jeffery Stein.", "Jeffery Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Good morning, Carol. Question on your strategy in the fourth quarter to be more promotional. I\u2019m wondering, A; was it reactive or proactive? And B; given the fact that it looks like the industry is probably going to come out of the fourth quarter with higher than normal inventory. What is your thinking strategically for the first quarter and first half of the year in terms of how you\u2019ll price? Are you going to again be more promotional do you believe?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks for asking that question, because we were very strategic in setting ourselves up for Q1. We have a lot more open to buy than we had a year ago. And the market is absolutely fresh. We thought that way. We knew that we wanted to end nice and clean and be very up to-date on our fashions in going forward.", "So we did ship a little bit more freshness in November and December than we did a year ago. And we paid a little bit more for that, but I think it was the right thing to do. But we also felt the right thing was to do to end very, very clean at the end of the quarter. And I mean Ernie, you want \u2013 the market is \u2013 again, Ernie is out there with his hammer every morning with the buyers.", "Ernie Herrman", "And we could feel it all year along from going back into the first half, the amount of availability which does always good. And it just built the little bit more than even in the past. So we were \u2013 as Carol said, going into fourth quarter, we were strategic and staying more liquid and open to buy. And the good thing with this model of business is when you do get hit with weather, that we get hit like anybody else but in the short-term, we\u2019re able to take advantage of opportunities in the market.", "And so the challenge of course is to maintain that open to buy given all the goods that are out there. So our jobs right now are to keep all of the divisions from buying too much too soon because of that much of availability out there.", "Jeffery Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research", "So was the decision driven by what you saw in terms of the availability of open to buy, was it a reaction to what you saw from competitors in terms of what you did to get you into\u2026", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It\u2019s a combination.", "Ernie Herrman", "In terms of the pricing.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Right. We hit pricing, but again we pushed some areas in December a little bit harder than we did the year before strategically. And those are the areas when the weather hit us a little bit in January, we got more aggressive, because we didn\u2019t want to be sitting with it. So it\u2019s a combination and we said, let\u2019s be really lean because there is tons of great deals out there. So that was really a combination.", "Jeffery Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great, thanks so much. I am hoping you can talk about the rollout in Europe, and I know that there were a number of different strategies that you all employed for the rollout. You\u2019re just beginning to do relative to the \u201808, \u201809 experience. And I am hoping you can just sort of go back in a little bit and talk to us about the sort of prep work you\u2019ve done, so that we can look forward I think enhanced sales and margin growth in that region over time?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Kimberly first of all, I said it a lot, that we have learned a lot. And we certainly took our heads several years ago. And you can see the progress. Again we\u2019re planning Europe, quite a bit up next year again because we feel that the infrastructure and we feel that everything is in place to do business.", "Now, we have increased the number of stores. But having said that, we\u2019re not going crazy by any means. And Ernie you can comment on the real estate. I think we\u2019re in a great position there also.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, Kimberly, I just got actually back from Europe a week and a half ago. And one of the things we talked about over there was the real estate that we\u2019re going after and making \u2013 and showing that we\u2019re going after quality sites and not forcing the issue of the number of real estate\u2019s sites, really going after the quality sites, which in the past in \u201808, \u201809 I don\u2019t know if we did as good as job back then.", "Secondly, the other thing we\u2019re doing a much better job on is we have the people in place. That is really the driver of any of these expansions with a number of stores. As long as we have the buying and merchandise planning areas intact and they\u2019ve been in their jobs a lot longer than they were back then. We\u2019re really able to \u2013 so really do a much better job in replenishing and shipping all of those stores.", "In addition, in order to ensure that our real estate that we are choosing going after as more strategic, we have staffed up aggressively over the last two years in terms of our real estate I guess dealmakers you call it, as well as our real estate market analysis. So that whole team now has \u2013 I don\u2019t know the exact number, but we\u2019ve gone up in size quite significantly. And so we\u2019re much more analytical when we open our stores over there.", "So all of those factors I think really make us feel very comfortable in ramping up over there.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Also Kimberly, the fact that our second largest buying stores in Germany, isn\u2019t too shabby either. So we see opportunities to some pretty big volume stores in the high streets.", "Ernie Herrman", "In fact the second largest store in the corporation.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "In the corporation, right.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Well, terrific. Thank you so much, Carol.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co", "Good morning. Congrats on a well-managed quarter. It gets interesting environment. Just had a bit of question on the traffic versus ticket dynamic. You indicated again in the fourth quarter that it was primarily if not all ticket. Just wondering how that kind of squares with what was a more promotional environment. What drove the ticket increase? Was there higher initial price or mix related, just what was that dynamic? And then going forward, would you expect more of a balance between traffic and ticket or would you expect sort of more ticket once again?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. So first of all, in terms of traffic, first and fourth quarter were our least \u2013 in terms of traffic, second and third where weather did affect us without a doubt when we got into January. So that was a little disappointing because going into November and December, we were pretty pleased. Our mix \u2013 the average ticket was driven by our mix. We really went after gift giving.", "I\u2019m not going to go into the details of certain categories, but we went into some categories that we thought would be really a wow to the customer. So our average ticket was really doing it by the mix. We felt our values were absolutely terrific. We have a lot of plans next year to drive traffic and we feel very good about it. We had a lot of tests going on this year, so we feel pretty good about going forward.", "So all in all, we were very pleased, but there is no doubt that Q2 and Q3 last year, our traffic was up. And where we did get a little bit hurt by weather in the first and the fourth quarter, we did see a bit of a hit.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co", "Fair enough. And I guess just one other regarding the e-com. Would you say that the vendor sign-ups \u2013 how was that trended. I know early on, you said you were seeing better than expected sign-ups by vendors to participate in tjmaxx.com. Is that continued?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I would say to you, slowly but surely people are feeling more comfortable, because we\u2019ve really set up the site, so that we are very, very vendor friendly. So we are capturing more vendors every day and that\u2019s going to continue to build.", "Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Tubin.", "Howard Tubin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot guys. Can you maybe just comment on inventory? You\u2019ve done a great job and obviously you\u2019re entering spring very clean. Should we expect inventory of per store to stay down throughout the spring season?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Slightly. We\u2019re planning it slightly down, but we\u2019re still planning our inventories down, yes. And by having said that again, our goal is to try to deliver more frequently to the stores and we\u2019ll continue on that path less more frequently.", "Howard Tubin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We\u2019re very happy with our turns.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick.", "Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank. And my congrats as well, Carol and team. I guess maybe Carol if you could just talk a little about HomeGoods, just sort of what you thought the weather impact was for them in Q4 to generate that comp, and was there any change in your outlook? I know some other retailers have posted some softer numbers in the home side of the business recently. And then Scott, if you could just give us either the sales or comp or segment margins in your 2014 guidance, that would be fantastic. Thanks very much.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, honestly I am thrilled with HomeGoods and I was pretty happy. They have more stores obviously in the Northeast and in the cooler climate, so they got hit a little bit more, but having said that we\u2019re very happy with their performance. They also were aggressive in cleaning out. So they\u2019d be fresh for spring, but we love HomeGoods and we continue to see tremendous growth there. Nothing unusual going on there.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And so I\u2019ll give you the full year \u2013 I assume you wanted the full year guidance?", "Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yes, that would be helpful.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. So starting with \u2013 and again I want to do this for the foreign divisions excluding FX. So first with Marmaxx, we have planned 1% to 2% comp against last year\u2019s 3%. The segment margins at low 14.4% to 14.8% against last year\u2019s 14.6%. So down 20 basis points to up 20 basis points at the high. And sales $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion.", "Now to HomeGoods, 1% to 2% comp, against last year\u2019s strong 7%. 12.6% to 12.9%, again at the 30 basis points to flat at the high. $3.2 billion in sales. TJX Canada is zero to 2% comp. 12.7% to 13.1%, against last year\u2019s 13.6%, down 90 basis points to minus 50 basis points at the high at $2.9 billion to $3 billion in sales.", "Europe, 3% to 4%, against last year\u2019s 6% with 8.3% to 8.7%, against last year\u2019s 7.8%. And 50 basis points to 90 basis point increase. And again the total number on the TJX consolidated 1% to 2% against the 3% this year. And excluding FX, zero to 30 basis points on the high.", "Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen.", "Oliver Chen \u2013 Citi", "Hi team, congratulations on a wonderful year and finish. Regarding your earlier comments on the new store prototype, could you just share with us where you\u2019re headed there, and if that should impact how we think about productivity in square footage? And you\u2019ve also bought up in your prepared remarks, how you\u2019re becoming closer to the source of the product. I was curious about the strategy there and how it may benefit you on a near and long-term basis?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. When you\u2019re talking to the prototype, are you talking about Marshalls, or are you talking about STP?", "Oliver Chen \u2013 Citi", "Marshalls.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. So we had a new prototype that we rolled out pretty aggressively in T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. We\u2019ve learned certain things that we need to do in Marshalls that we learned through the T.J. Maxx prototype, but we want to upgrade and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. We think it\u2019s time. And some of the things will benefit just making it more customer friendly, easier to shop. A lot of the things that we\u2019ve learned overtime and also through customer surveys. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. And continuing to differentiate the two chains.", "So it\u2019s exciting to be able to walk into both. Differentiation is very, very important which allows us again to put our store closure together. So we are seeing when we put Maxx next to Marshalls, it\u2019s really becoming a mecca and certainly at HomeGoods. We\u2019re actually putting HomeGoods right near my house because I needed to have HomeGoods and the Marshalls within a mile distance of shopping.", "So we\u2019re pretty excited about that, but we\u2019re always going to upgrade our stores. It\u2019s just part of our process. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re around the 250 mark versus being a little bit more aggressive on our remodels, because we\u2019re starting a new prototype.", "Oliver Chen \u2013 Citi", "Got it. Thanks. And on the sourcing side, you spoke to some driving more efficiencies?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, that\u2019s really about building the talent and our team to be all around the world. We\u2019ve increased our buying offices all over. We have more people in New York, more people in California. We have more people in Europe. We have people in India. We have people in Australia. We continue to build that, so that we\u2019re constantly opening new vendors and more excitement. And that includes some of the smaller guys that are very hard for typically a department store to find. And they are little niche vendors that make our mix very eclectic and very unique. And that\u2019s part of the treasure hunt. So we find that very exciting.", "Oliver Chen \u2013 Citi", "Thank you. Best regards.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson.", "Heather Balsky \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi good morning. This is Heather Balsky on for Lorraine. I just had a question regarding the competition. I guess as other off-pricers are opening more in some of your core markets, and you continue to expand in your existing markets, how does the competition impact your sales? Is there any cannibalization or do you benefit from having those competitors in your [indiscernible]?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We actually like it because it does create more traffic and it becomes sort of a mecca. So we do like it.", "Heather Balsky \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, thank you. And just as a follow-up in terms of the testing of the Sierra brand and opening new stores, I know it\u2019s early on, but do you have any insight into how big that business possibly could be? Could it be a fifth brand for the company in the U.S.?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I have no idea. We are just very excited about this \u2013 the whole outdoor, the whole space we\u2019re very excited about and we think of the kind of like HomeGoods in the active and outdoor space. So we\u2019re excited about it, but I couldn\u2019t tell you. I mean we\u2019re just starting to open our stores and look \u2013 like anything else, we hope it\u2019s going to be a big chain in the future.", "Heather Balsky \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Drbul.", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Nomura", "Hi, good morning. I guess the question that I have is when you look at what drove sort of the business holiday and throughout 2013 from a category perspective, and you look at the years on top of the comp increases that you\u2019ve driven, what categories do you think will lead you in 2014, or what categories are you most excited about in driving the business?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, I\u2019m sorry Robert, but we don\u2019t talk about the categories. We do have competition out there that looks at it periodically.", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Nomura", "Okay. And then \u2013 yes.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "[indiscernible] our stores.", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Nomura", "All right, I do. Trust me. And when you look at the home category in general, you talked about the home fashion did well at Marmaxx. Was there any difference between what worked in the Marmaxx stores versus what was working in the HomeGoods stores?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well the mix is very different. So they go after in a very different way. So the categories \u2013 there were categories that were strong throughout. There were some unique things that Marmaxx did that certainly HomeGoods didn\u2019t do. And there was certainly unique things that HomeGoods did that Marmaxx didn\u2019t do.", "So they are two different operations. They just leverage each other on the total buying, but they differentiate.", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Nomura", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question today comes from Mark Montagna.", "Mark Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners", "Hi, just a quick housekeeping question, and then actually a real question. The Europe, what did you say the revenues were expected to be for Europe, and then what is the comp leverage hurdle that you need to leverage gross margin occupancy and then SG&A? And then the more real question is, the Sierra stores, how are they going to differ than the outlet stores that Sierra has at this point?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I\u2019ll answer the Sierra. We\u2019re creating a brand new prototype. So it is going to look very different from the Sierra stores today. We\u2019re really \u2013 if you think of it like again the idea of a HomeGoods field in the outsource space, but it\u2019s going to have some very unique things. It\u2019s going to be pretty interesting. It\u2019s going to have a real unique look. But value, value, value, I can\u2019t say it enough in every category. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going after.", "Mark Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners", "And when you say\u2026", "Scott Goldenberg", "And you wanted the Europe sales for next year?", "Mark Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners", "Yes.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "He wanted it.", "Scott Goldenberg", "So comps of 3% to 4%, against this year\u2019s 6% comp. Segment margins, again this is excluding FX, 8.3% to 8.7%, against last year\u2019s 7.8%. A 50 basis points to 90 basis points improvement, and sales in U.S. dollars of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion.", "I\u2019d give it to you in terms of \u2013 the way we look it because a lot of our expenses in margin increases are built into the model \u2013 if we beat our comp by 1% comp going into next year, then we\u2019d expect to have about 20 basis point improvement. And on the full year, we\u2019d have approximately $0.08 if we beat by a full 1% comp.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And hopefully we\u2019ll strive for that at least.", "Mark Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners", "I\u2019m sure you will. Carol, just a follow-up question. When you were talking about the outdoor space, do you include things like basketball, more athletic things because on the Sierra website you can see things that I wouldn\u2019t really consider outdoor, but are you considering all sporting goods as outdoors?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. It will be an expansive assortment. It will be an exciting store.", "Mark Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners", "Sounds good.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "All right. Well I thank you everyone and we look forward to reporting Q1. And thank you, Elan.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Welcome to the TJX Companies\u2019 First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, May 20, 2014. I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you, Elan. And before we begin, Deb has a few comments.", "Deb McConnell", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company\u2019s results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company\u2019s plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed April 1, 2014.", "Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies.

Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis.", "Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today\u2019s press release in the Investor Information section of our website, tjx.com.", "Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s press release or otherwise posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Deb. And joining me and Deb on the call are Ernie Herrman; and Scott Goldenberg. Our first quarter consolidated comp sales increased 1% and earnings per share was $0.64 versus $0.62 last year.", "Our EPS results were $0.01 below our expectations as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates was $0.01 more than our guidance assumed. While sales were not as strong as we would have liked, especially in apparel, we were pleased to see overall business trends improve as the quarter progressed, and we are very well-positioned as we entered the second quarter.", "While we clearly saw dampened consumer demand for apparel in some of our North American regions during the first quarter, having learned from the fourth quarter I am pleased with the way manage our inventory.", "We were extremely strategic in how we flowed inventories to particular regions and categories. Expenses were also tightly controlled. All of this helped mitigate the impact of markdowns overall.", "Further, I could not be happier with TJX Europe, which delivered another spectacular quarter. This bodes very well for our future growth plans in Europe as we expand our international footprint.", "We entered the second quarter with lean inventories, and we see a marketplace absolutely loaded with buying opportunities for quality, branded merchandise. We are well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. We are maintaining our EPS and comp outlook for the remainder of the year and are confident we will achieve our plans for 2014. Scott will cover guidance later.", "On today\u2019s call, I will reiterate the magnitude of the top and bottom line growth opportunities we see for our business. We remain convinced that TJX will grow to be a $40 billion company and beyond.", "But before I continue I will turn the call over to Scott to recap the numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks Carol, and good morning, everyone. Again, our first quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 1%, and we were pleased to see sales trends pick up as we move through the quarter. Our first quarter comp was driven by an increase in ticket. While customer traffic was slightly down for the quarter, we did see improvement as the quarter progressed.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.64 versus $0.62 last year, and $0.01 below the low end of our expected range. The mark-to-market adjustment on our inventory related hedges had a $0.02 negative impact on earnings per share, which was $0.01 more than we contemplated in our guidance. As a reminder, we had a $0.01 negative impact from FX last year.", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 11.3% for the quarter, down 50 basis points versus last year due to a decline in gross margins.", "Gross profit margin was 27.9%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower merchandise margins versus strong improvement last year and expense deleverage on the 1% comp. In addition, the mark-to-market adjustment I just mentioned also had a negative impact.", "SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was unchanged from last year's ratio as expenses were tightly managed. At the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including the warehouses and excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories were down 1% in constant currency.", "This was versus substantial decreases in the last couple of years. We begin the second quarter in a lean inventory position, which enables us to take advantage of the abundant buying opportunities in the marketplace.", "In terms of share repurchases, during the first quarter, we bought back $360 million of TJX stock retiring 6 million shares. We continue to anticipate buying back 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion of TJX stock this year. In addition, the Board of Directors approved a 21% increase in the per share dividend in April, marking the 18th consecutive year of dividend increases.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Carol, and I will recap our second quarter and full-year fiscal \u201815 guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Scott. Before moving to our global growth opportunities, I will share some comments on the first quarter performance by division. In the U.S., Marmaxx comps were flat with last year and segment profit margin decreased 60 basis points. This was primarily due to expense deleverage on the comp, as well as 10 basis points of deleverage from our e-commerce businesses and slightly higher utility costs.", "We are pleased that Marmaxx held merchandise margins relatively flat on a flat comp. This is a testament to Marmaxx slowing inventory vary strategically, feeding regions and categories where trends was stronger and maintaining lean inventories where business was softer. Where we weather was a factor, there was as much as 4 point comp spread with less impacted regions.", "We also see some execution issues in our junior and dress businesses that we are currently addressing. As always, we evaluate and work to improve what we are not happy with, and we are confident we will fix these issues.", "Our strongest category was total accessories and the jewelry businesses. Going forward, Marmaxx has some exciting marketing plans in order to drive traffic in the second quarter and the back half.", "Home Goods delivered a 3% comp increase on top of 7% growth last year, and segment profit margin was up 10 basis points over last year\u2019s significant increase. We are very pleased with HomeGoods ability to continue driving strong performance over strong comparison.", "Now for international division, at TJX Canada, comp sales were down 1% and adjusted segment profit margin decreased 210 basis points. We believe the severe weather across Canada had a significant negative impact on both customer traffic and demand for spring apparel. Further, as we expected, the decline in Canadian dollar pressured our merchandise margins. We were encouraged to see business trends improved by the end of the quarter.", "TJX Europe delivered another outstanding quarter, comp sales increased 8% over 4% increase last year, and adjusted segment profit margin was up 180 basis points. We continue to see broad-based strength across the different geographies, economic climate, and consumer environments in which we operate, which is very encouraging for our growth prospects in Europe. We are very excited about our German business, which is delivering terrific performance.", "As to e-commerce, we were pleased with the performance of our online businesses overall in the first quarter, which was above our plan. At tjmaxx.com, we continue to add more categories and open more vendors. We are investing carefully as we learn more about our online including the differentiation from brick-and-mortar stores.", "Now to the magnitude of our global growth opportunity, first, we see huge potential to gain additional U.S. and international customers. We believe our customer penetration levels in the U.S. remain below those of most department stores and the opportunity to expand our international reach is vast. We continue to target a very wide customer demographic.", "As we work to drive customer traffic, we plan to be even more aggressive with our marketing. In the second quarter, we have significant increase planned in our overall media impressions in the U.S. and U.K.", "Our TJX rewards loyalty program is another way we can attract more customers, increase shopping frequency and encourage shopping across our chain. We are expanding our successful credit card loyalty program to including a non-credit card choice.", "We\u2019ve seen from our test, it\u2019s a great way to invite even more customers to join our loyalty program and have plans to rollout this new option nationwide in the U.S. in the second quarter.", "We know that customers who shop more than one of our retail brands spend considerably more with us on average and we see the loyalty program is a way to better engage with them. Our customer satisfaction scores across divisions keep going up, yet we still see room for improvement. We are focused on raising the bar as always.", "We continue to upgrade the shopping experience in our stores, across all of our chains we plan to remodel approximately 250 stores in 2014. We are also on track with our plans for our new Marshalls prototype.", "We see ourselves as leaders in innovation. We are constantly testing new ideas and seeking the right product categories, current fashion and top brand. We are excited about our plan to open two new Sierra Trading Post stores this fall. We really like the outdoor space and see this initiative as a way to offer more categories and brand that are not in our stores today.", "Now to our vast store growth opportunities, with over 3,200 stores today we see the potential to grow to 5,150 stores long-term that would be about 60% more stores than our existing base, with just our current chain in our current market alone.", "We have many reasons giving us confidence. At Marmaxx we see the potential to grow our largest most profitable division to 3,000 stores long-term. That represents almost the 1,000 more stores than today.", "The performance of our new stores remains excellent, which underscores our confidence. Further we are successfully co-loading -- co-locating stores closer to one another, while keeping cannibalization levels where we would expect.", "We believe HomeGoods ultimately has a potential to be a chain of 825 stores, which certainly could be conservative. HomeGoods new store performance is also terrific. There are about 100 markets where we operate the T.J. Maxx or Marshalls without HomeGoods which speaks to the opportunity.", "At TJX Canada, we see the potential to grow the 450 stores long-term, which includes growing Marshalls to 100 stores in Canada. We believe our 20 plus years of experience and knowledge will continue to serve us well as we further our Canadian expansion.", "At TJX Europe we see enormous growth potential for TJX. Long-term we believe we can be more -- we can more than double our current store base to 875 stores surely with our existing chains in our existing countries.", "As a reminder in 2014, we planed to accelerate the pace of our store openings in Europe to 40 stores, which is 25% more than last year. This includes more than doubling the number of openings in Germany versus the prior year. To support our growth in Europe we have added more resources to our real estate group which is helping us to secure some amazing locations.", "We also see vast opportunity to expand beyond our existing country. We are working on entering our next European country with plans to open our first few stores in Austria in first half of 2015.", "Beyond Austria, we believe our off-price concept can work in any country where consumers love great fashion brands and quality, all are great value. TJX Europe is the major part of our future growth plan and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities for this business. We are the only brick-and-mortar off-price retailer of significant size in Europe. We have decades of experience and knowledge that cannot easily be replicated.", "Beyond the success of our brick-and-mortar businesses, we see e-commerce as another long-term growth vehicle for TJX. We view online as another way to attract new customers and drive traffic, both to our websites and stores. Our e-commerce businesses offer consumers the convenience to shop our values 24 hours a day, seven days a week.", "We remain delivered in our approach to e-commerce growth. We plan to keep adding more categories and increasing our assortment on T.J. Maxx.com, offering consumers even more online choices at amazing value. In addition, we could now be happier with our acquisition of Sierra Trading Post both on the standpoint of its online businesses as well as brick-and-mortar growth potential in the outdoor value based for the future.", "In closing, we are in an excellent position as we enter the second quarter and remainder of 2014. We like our lean inventory levels, are in a great position to buy into plentiful opportunities we see in the marketplace. We\u2019re delighted to offer consumers amazing values both in our stores and online.", "We keep raising the bar on fashion, brands, quality and price. To drive customer traffic, we have many marketing initiatives underway. We are significantly increasing our marketing impressions in the U.S. and the U.K. in the second quarter.", "We are also very excited about our planned nationwide expansion of our loyalty program. We keep testing new seeds. Innovation is our DNA. We are never complacent. To support our growth plans, we continue to invest in our supply chain and distribution network.", "We expect to begin a gradual rollout of our operating merchandise systems in the next couple of years. We are thrilled with TJX Europe\u2019s performance which is sensational. I\u2019m so excited about our international growth opportunities including our plans to enter Austria in 2015.", "I have said this many times before but I will say it again. I truly believe it\u2019s underappreciated how much time, energy and talent it takes to establish the infrastructure to build an off-price international business. Our EPS and comp outlook for the remainder of the year remains same as our original guidance. And we are confident that we will achieve our plan and as always we will strive to surpass our goals.", "This is a company that has grown successfully through strong and weak environment, which gives us great confidence. Over very -- over a very long history, we have a consistent track record of day sales and profit growth. We're very confident about the future of TJX as we bring our values around the world.", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott to go through guidance and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks Carol. Now to fiscal \u201815 guidance, beginning with the full year. We now expect fiscal \u201815 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.17 over $2.94 in fiscal \u201814. We are lowering the high end of the range by $0.02 to reflect our first quarter results in maintaining our outlook for the remainder of the year.", "As a reminder, fiscal \u201814 included a tax benefit of $0.11. Excluding this benefit, our full year expected EPS would be 8% to 12% over the prior year's adjusted $2.83. We continue to expect consolidated comp store sales growth of 1% to 2%.", "For the year, we continue to expect pretax profit margins to be 12.0% to 12.3%. This would be down 10 to up 20 basis points versus 12.1% in fiscal \u201814. This now reflects expected gross margins of 28.3% to 28.6%, which would be down 20 basis points to up 10 basis points versus fiscal \u201814.", "And now -- and we now anticipate SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 16.2%, a 10 basis point improvement versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates, assuming current levels are now expected to have a $0.02 negative impact on full year EPS versus $0.01 positive impact last year.", "Now to Q2 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74. This would be a 6% to 12% increase over the last year's $0.66 per share and on top of many years of double-digit EPS growth in the second quarter. We\u2019re assuming second quarter consolidated sales in the $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion range. This is based on expected comp sales growth in the 2% to 3% range on both the consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group.", "Second quarter pretax profit margins are planned to be in the 11.7% to 12.1% range, down 30 to up 10 basis points versus the prior year. We're anticipating second quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.5% to 28.8%, down 30 to flat versus the prior year.", "We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be 16.6% versus 16.7% last year. Foreign currency rates, assuming current levels are expected to have a neutral impact on EPS this year, which is the same as last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 37.7% and net interest expense of about $9 million.", "We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 708 million. Again, our guidance for the second quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels.", "Now we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we're going to continue to ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. We appreciate your cooperation with this. Thanks. And we will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Oliver Chen.", "Oliver Chen - Citi", "Hi. Congrats on the global success here. We just had a question on your gross margin guidance going forward. What does that anticipate for merchandise margin and how should we think about -- how merchandise margin had trended throughout the quarter that just elapsed, and what are the strategies for looking at that line item going forward? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, for Marmaxx in Q2, our merchandise margins are planned flat to slightly up. Scott, do you want to go over the aggregate?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Just to be clear, do you want more breakout on the first quarter gross profit margin?", "Oliver Chen - Citi", "Yes. I\u2019m curious like on a month-to-month, and if that\u2019s trended in any way, like that kind of corresponds to how we should think about them going forward? And then if the junior business is kind of related to this in terms of the opportunity you see there as well?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So Oliver, in terms of merchandise, I\u2019m going to go back to Q1 for Marmaxx. Merchandise margins were fairly flat, which I think is a testament to the way they manage their inventories. But going forward, in Q2, we are planning them flat to slightly up. So I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape.", "In terms of juniors, we missed some trends. The guys are working on it. We have a couple of execution issues, and I feel pretty good that we\u2019re going to be fixing them in the near future, but are you asking -- did I answer your question or\u2026?", "Oliver Chen - Citi", "Yeah. That\u2019s clear. Thank you. Thank you. That\u2019s encouraging.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Grambling.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, one quick follow-up to that. Could you just provide a little bit more color on the puts and takes to the merch margin in the first quarter as it relates to kind of initial markups and -- versus markdowns?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Sure. So, on the gross profit margin decrease, I mean it was a combination as we said between the merch margin and deleverage on the one comp, so we had 10 basis points due to mark-to-market, a portion also due to buying and occupancy deleverage, and then the rest of it was due to merchandise margin miss.", "And again, that was a combination of a couple of items. It was due to Canada that we had a miss due to the currency -- the devaluation of the currency compared to the U.S., so the mark on dropped there. We also had some additional mark-ons at both Canada and Marmaxx due to the performance of sales versus our plan at the low end, and that was really -- but having said that as Carol said, Marmaxx still was relatively flat overall, in addition\u2026", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Most of it was driven by markdowns.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Markdowns.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Our markup is pretty healthy.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs", "Great. That\u2019s helpful. One other follow-up if I may. Just as you are talking about entering Austria in the first half of \u201815, can you provide a little bit more detail on the investments required to make that happen as it relates to talent, distribution, and maybe how quickly you think you can ramp there versus other markets? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Pretty leveraged. Ernie, do you want to comment?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, Steve, actually -- I was just over in Europe last week, and one of the things we talked about is how it\u2019s a pretty seamless entry for us really. We get to leverage most of our central buying and planning areas. It\u2019s more about talent acquisition in terms of the field, you know the first few stores that we open. So, on that front, very little talent needed on top of what we already have.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We think the mix is very similar to Germany, unlike going from the U.K. to Germany.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs", "So, even talent would come from Germany versus pulling people in?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs", "Okay.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We didn\u2019t need extra people, no.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks so much. Best of luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Omar Saad.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Thanks. I think a pretty good result given everything that\u2019s going on out there. I would like to dive in a little bit on the power and flexibility of the model that served the company so well, the ability to react and respond. Can you talk about either big picture or maybe some examples of kind of what\u2019s been happening last couple quarters? What you've learned, areas where you can be more flexible and some areas where maybe it's been a little bit harder? Especially from the -- with extremely cold weather, maybe how could you -- were there places where you could have been a little bit better positioned for that cold weather in terms of the business' ability to be flexible? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "You know what, we learn from every quarter and I think we learned from the fourth quarter, which is why Marmaxx merchandise margins were in pretty good shape. However, if I look back and I said what else could be learned for next year, which is what we do, I would probably feed the warmers zones a little bit heavier, and I would probably again pull back a little bit on the northern regions and switch a little bit in category. So they made some pretty big moves, but I still think there is some room there -- a spectacular quarter.", "But you know what, we move on and for the year, I am not going to use the world weather too many times because we are excited about the year, and we believe in the model for the year certainly.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Thanks, Carol.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company", "Hi, good morning. Just I guess a little bit of follow-up in thinking about the fourth quarter and then into the first quarter. Maybe just if you could kind of help us better understand the company\u2019s strategy during let\u2019s say a period when sales are a little bit light , I think a lot of us are so used to the company you are very nimble, you are able to react late in the season. What in terms of just the way you run the business let\u2019s say results in a situation where you find that you are taking some greater markdowns. Given how lean you run the business and how kind of late you make buying decisions relative to full price? Thanks very much.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So obviously, our home business was spectacular as you saw in home goods in Europe. That was pretty consistent in terms of whether the business was great. I will reiterate, every quarter, we evaluate and we have certain businesses that are extremely strong and we are feeding into them. Our inventory position is spectacular right now. We are more open to buy than we had a year ago. We are actually turning faster in Marmaxx than we did a year ago, and as we go through the quarter and as we transition for each quarter, especially first and fourth quarter, we are going to take into consideration all of the patterns that we have seen and do some tweaking with that, and that\u2019s usually how we get better each quarter.", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company", "So is it fair to say that to some degree because you want to have the sales floor very fresh, that if you find that for whatever reason the product isn't quite selling the way you expected for weather or other reasons, that you just choose to basically move it out right then as opposed to holding it in the store? ", "", "Carol Meyrowitz", "What we do is, I mean, we look at every single category and we would see certain categories harder in the north that are less weather, we call weather proofing. And then we would see the southern zones of the warmers climate is a little bit heavier and that\u2019s a tweaking we do.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And Daniel if I could just jump in. The other thing is we did keep it as Carol mentioned earlier. We kept inventories lean even in the places where we would get or categories we would get hit by the weather. And so really the liability in terms of any major lumps and the inventories don\u2019t create, that\u2019s one reason there are much nice margins held in there pretty well. Even with the category where the weather was hitting it, we will lean so the liability wasn\u2019t major and that the flexibility. I think when you first talk -- when you talk fourth quarter and first quarter, that\u2019s kind of how we run it all the time. And then we chase. So we generally don\u2019t -- we chase the trends. So we don\u2019t have to own a huge liability really in any category.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I mean ARPU we could have pushed inventories in Marmaxx and have higher sales, but we probably would have add more markdowns and you are always making -- you know you are always balancing that. Having said that, specifically, there are definitely areas that we could put more inventory into that would drives sales in areas that we don\u2019t need to feed. And those are tweaks we would make.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Which we do ongoing all the time right every quarter\u2026", "Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company", "All right. Well, thanks,guys. I appreciate that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning. This is (indiscernible) filling in for Brian. Thanks for taking our question. We wanted to ask about Europe. Comps have been clearing very strong now for 10 quarters in a row. So we\u2019re wondering who you think you're gaining share from in Europe and how your marketing initiatives compare to the ones in U.S.?", "And now from a real estate perspective, you clearly have pretty ambitious store opening plans, actually both in the U.S. and Europe. But I guess it\u2019s easier for us to see here where you may be getting these larger boxes that further downsizing at some department stores and maybe even consolidation among office suppliers retailers. So, wanted to see if real estate dynamics are similar in Europe as well and maybe if there are any retailers that you want to or look to co-locate within Europe. Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Look, first of all, we believe in Europe. We are taking a bit of share from everyone. I mean, we see everyone as our competition. Off-price is very new to Europe not to U.K. because we\u2019ve been there for a long time. But in Germany, it is very new and people are very, very excited about it. In terms of the real estate Ernie and the team had put on quite a few additional people that are seeking sites which is why we are able to increase our count in Germany and obviously go into Austria and we will see how that goes. But it\u2019s a matter of manning it and continuing to build and leverage the infrastructure that we have that took us 20 years to build.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Baker.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you if there\u2019s anything we should think about in terms of market share. JCPenney did better this quarter in a quarter where your comps didn't do as well. I mean, its sounds to me as if it's a lot of weather. But just wondering if you think some of the JCPenney doing a little bit better has any impact. And I guess really after you answer that, just explain to us how you understand that. What specifically you look at to get an indication as to how a situation like that might be impacting you guys? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Michael, we do a pretty deep analytical study on stores that are next to our stores, stores that are within a mile away, three miles away, five miles away. And quite frankly, we didn\u2019t see the impact when Penney\u2019s comps were substantially down and we\u2019re really not seeing an impact going the other way, but we do a deep dive and we analyze it.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. One more quick one. It sounds like you said your outlook for the balance of the year isn\u2019t changed, but you\u2019re now looking at 2% to 3% comps in the second quarter. Is that what you would have been planning all along? Or does that -- a reflection of maybe you lost some weather business in the first quarter but think that comes back into the second quarter?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "There is a little bit of pent-up demand. Ernie and I feel, there are couple of areas that we can execute a little bit better, and our marketing impressions are up 35% in Marmaxx and we're really excited about some of things that we are doing in our loyalty program in Marmaxx.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank", "And you would view our all long plans for those impressions to be up, or that was a shift when you saw the business meter?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, that was just our plan.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "That's also part of our analyzing Q1 into Q2, the weather patterns, all of that. That's where we wanted to put our dollars.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Roxanne Meyer.", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS", "Great. Good morning. Just looking at 1Q, I know this is probably difficult to parse out, but you mentioned a 4% comp differential in weather impacted regions versus none. I'm just wondering if in total you can describe how much weather was an impact overall to our 1Q shortfall at Marmaxx versus the impact of dresses and juniors underperforming? And how do you feel about the inventory specifically in the dresses and juniors category and how long maybe it could take to right size that inventory? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, as I said before, probably, we would certainly be at the high end of our range on looking at the numbers. We can\u2019t come up with an exact specific number but it's pretty clear to us, when we look at the different regions and areas that it was probably about four points in Marmaxx. It was actually more than that in HomeGoods, so it did hit us. In terms of both categories, dresses and juniors are improving. I think we are going to see a substantial improvement in the second quarter and we are working on it. I can't give you specific numbers and I don\u2019t usually do that. But we're working on it. And usually as a company, we fix things pretty quickly.", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Scott Goldenberg", "I would also jump in at the weather analysis that Carol was talking about. If you ever did, I guess dollar it out to figure out the impact that would be far greater than junior dress business execution impact. Yeah impact, I think you had asked that in your question.", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS", "I see. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Tubin.", "Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks guys. Can you give any update you can give us on stores opened in the last one or two years, new store productivity kind of by chain, how does that look?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Actually the productivity of our new stores is sensational, to say the least. It just continues to be incredibly strong. We are getting better and better at our sites there. Brand new stores and their performance is incredible, both Marmaxx and HomeGoods actually every chain. We are very happy with new store performance.", "Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets", "That\u2019s great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Stein", "Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research", "Good morning, Carol. I would like to delve into your loyalty program a little bit. Can you talk about the number of members you have currently, the average spend and how you intend to, kind of get the word out that you don\u2019t have to be a credit card holder to join the program?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So you are asking me for some things I\u2019m not going to give you. But what I will tell you is we tested the loyalty program in several markets last year and we saw a substantial increase in the number of visits. And we are rolling that out across the country starting really today through June. So we're pretty excited about it, and there are a lot of special some things like stores opening early for that customer, giving them e-mail information on things that are coming into the store. We have several little trigger points that we have been testing over the last year. So this is very, very exciting to us. So, we will see what happens when it rolls out.", "Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research", "Can you talk at all about the average spend of the loyalty customer versus non-loyalty?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I don\u2019t go -- our loyal customers spend a great deal more but more importantly, the visits are substantially up.", "Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research", "Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Marni Shapiro.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Hey, guys. Congrats. Great job in a miserable first quarter weather. If you could give me just a quick update on -- you talked about Home and HomeGoods but any update on it? Was it as strong as the Marmaxx Group? And then some of the smaller departments within Marmaxx tend to pick up where the peril is weak link like, whether it's beauty or fitness or footwear. Could you just talk about some of those offsets other than accessories which I think you touched on? ", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So, Marni, I don\u2019t usually do a deep dive into our categories for competitive reasons. But HomeGoods and Marmaxx was pretty strong, big furniture. We had some issues with some of our big-ticket items. But generally, home across the board was certainly stronger than apparel. I will tell you that women's apparel has increased dramatically coming into May. So we are pretty pleased with that, but across-the-board, the categories were pretty similar in most divisions.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Fantastic. Thank you, guys. Best of luck for the second quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Drbul.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura", "Hi. Good morning. Just had a question on the -- in the movement around increasing marketing impressions in the U.S. and the U.K., can you give us, just an example over the last few quarters, when you were able to make those investments and where you sort of significantly outperformed the quarter and the confidence level that you have in sort of a change in the trend on traffic around these investments?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I mean, it\u2019s hard to measure very specifically, but I think it's usually a combination of how you market and the number of impressions. So we have a group of things going on, which you will see from TV, social media, Facebook which we have millions and millions of people and it's really a combination. So we are pretty excited about our plans. But I think a big piece of it is going to the loyalty piece of it also. But you can\u2019t measure specific question equal this.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura", "Okay. Okay. And then just on the store expansion plans, are you seeing increased competition for real estate that's impacting your plans at all?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, there is always competition for real estate but we are not having any issues in selling the number of stores we need at the appropriate ROI. And we think that there will probably be some opportunities going forward. There are some specific changes that are certainly not in business and are planning on closing quite a few stores. I think that is going to be an opportunity for us.", "Scott Goldenberg", "No difference than in the past.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura", "Okay.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And just to mention, we are really in a good place in terms of where we are positioned on new store opening targets going forward, so we are feeling very good about where we look going forward.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We are filling to our open to buy hopefully. And Ernie has a complete open-to-buy in Europe, if it\u2019s beyond the 40 stores.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Champine", "Laura Champine - Canaccord Genuity", "Good morning. Carol, you mentioned stepping up your marketing this quarter, when was that decision made and what drove that decision? Is it an expectation that people want more apparel now that the weather is more normal or am I reading too much into it?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No. We\u2019ve laid it out. It was a strategy that we laid out at the end of the year. Again, we learned from the fourth quarter. We look at -- we look at each corner and what it can be. We try to mitigate what we think of the negative impacts. We try to take advantage of what we think are positive and we felt that this was a very good strategy.", "Laura Champine - Canaccord Genuity", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Mark Montagna.", "Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners", "Hi. A question about inventory, you've been reducing some of the levels per store. Are we at the point where you've gotten halfway down to where your target is, or if there is more to go? And then within juniors, Carol, do you expect the merchandise to be at your level of expectations by back-to-school?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I would hope so. I\u2019m answering that question either way.", "Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners", "Okay.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah. As far as our inventory levels, we are certainly halfway is not -- we are not going to be halfway leaner, but what we are going to do is continue to deliver the stores more frequently, more freshness, which allows you to have leaner inventories. So there are two things.", "We still have some room there but in addition, we have some opportunities to feed the stores individually, what's driving their individual sales and that\u2019s what all this investment in systems is all about to the future. And we\u2019re doing some different foundational things that are going to allow us to expand internationally a little bit better than we are today. So we\u2019re really setting things up and investing for the future. That will give us an opportunity to hopefully move a little bit faster.", "Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners", "Okay. Yeah. When I said halfway, I mean, is it fair to say that the majority of your per-store inventory reductions are in the past and there's a little bit less more to go?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "There\u2019s less more to go, but I think there could be some sales opportunity.", "Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners", "Okay. Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick McKeever.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wondering if you could give us a little additional color on tjmaxx.com -- just how it's ramping since the launch in the fall and if anything there has surprised you, either positively or negatively? Just also wondering if you're still as bullish on that opportunity as you were in the fall and what the plans might be for perhaps a marshalls.com or to extend it into other concepts? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think, what we\u2019re learning is we\u2019re increasing our SKUs, we\u2019re increasing our categories. We\u2019re very pleased with the business, certainly since the launch. We have in our plans to continue the investment and we're very pleased with it. We want to again make sure that we\u2019re differentiating because we want to build the thing the right way and we keep learning. And I think once we cycle a year, we\u2019ll have a lot more information on newness in customer, what\u2019s bringing us back into brick-and-mortar. We are seeing most of returns coming back to the stores which is terrific. But we\u2019ll have a lot more analytics to it. But our goal right now is just build tjmaxx.com as big as we can get it.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "And then just a question on, what was said earlier on the weather impact at Marmaxx. Did you say it was about 4 points of same-store sales? ", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Versus the -- yeah. Just in the group of stores that we felt was impacted by weather.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "Okay. So four point. Okay. Thanks for that.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It would have been closer to the high end of guidance.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "Okay. Okay. Thanks for that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from John Kernan.", "Jerry Gray - Cowen", "Hi. This is Jerry Gray on for John. I just have a question about the assumptions that are built into your SG&A guidance. It seems like you have some increased marketing dollars and then some investments in the real estate team and accelerating store growth in Europe. And I was just wondering if you could give us some more details on what's driving the leverage in your assumptions? Thank you.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Sure. So all the above is built into the plans and all those were built into the original plans. So just to reiterate what Carol said today, our plans for the back half of the year in the second quarter were what we gave or reflected in our February guidance. But in terms of the SG&A, again no major changes. There is some leverage due to anniversarying some spend in our technology investments, some of that is due to our datacenter move which is almost complete, so that some of the benefit in the rest of the year. And also, we had expenses last year in the back half of the year related to some of our home office moves, again which were anniversarying and are built into some of the favorability that are implied in our guidance for the rest of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Mann.", "David Mann - Johnson Rice", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning. In terms of what you\u2019re seeing in the channel, in terms of merchandise availability, can you talk a little bit about the pricing you\u2019re seeing of goods, or any material change there one way or the other?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, David. The market also as Carol mentioned earlier is really loaded and across most categories and across most sectors whether it\u2019s more moderate goods or the better brands. And with that, there is often time, especially given the weather situation, many vendors and manufacturers experienced ramifications of that weather. So we\u2019re seeing some pricing than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Our objective is to always maintain strong relationships with our vendors. So amidst all the better pricing we want to have the consistent approach that is a partnership with our vendor community, but the pricing has definitely gotten sharper over the last I would say 60 days.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I would also tell you David that I think we\u2019re even opening more some additional very unique vendors. So it\u2019s pretty exciting out there.", "David Mann - Johnson Rice", "And then generally speaking, when you see a period like this where it might see some incremental improvement in pricing to you, is your intention to bank that or potentially -- you think you're going to need to use that to be more aggressive in pricing to the customer?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think it\u2019s up to each buyer and what they do is really balance their mix, so we may buy something that are like zero margin and then we think it's appropriate. We put them out. There might be a mix that has high margin. But as I said we\u2019re generally planning our margins slightly up in our big box and we feel we will achieve that with outrageous values.", "David Mann - Johnson Rice", "Great. Thank you. Good luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Bridget Weishaar.", "Bridget Weishaar - Morningstar", "Yes. Good morning. In the past, you've discussed that differentiating between the brands is key to placing stores close together. Can you discuss how you're going about doing this and how you would like to define the brands within the increased marketing messaging?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah. Bridget, we don\u2019t talk about how we differentiate. In fact, specifically the brands have separate marketing agencies, teams. The way we brand is very different and we differentiate in many, many ways and we look at that every day. The buyer that buys for T.J. Maxx and Marshalls is the same buyer, so they have the ability to differentiate. And they know exactly how to ship to a store to make it look different. So that\u2019s been since day one.", "Scott Goldenberg", "We physically -- and you\u2019re in the U.S. if you look at even the way our HomeGoods stores are fixtured physically from where our Marmaxx stores in the home areas are fixtured, we take a different approach. We make sure that Marshalls and T.J. Maxx physically they look different in size, in addition to what Carol have mentioned. So on all fronts, whether it\u2019s marketing or the physical plan or certainly the merchandise mix, we have plans in place for differentiation.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "However, the one thing they do, do is leverage together. It\u2019s great because they can see and say, I want to put this here, I want to put this there. So they really all know what's going on with each other and are able to leverage it.", "Bridget Weishaar - Morningstar", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question is from Sandra Barker.", "Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell", "Yes, just to clarify on traffic, was it back to positive by the end of the quarter? You said it improved. And then just more broadly on the competitive environment, obviously it's hard to tease out how much was weather. But as you see -- it's already been talked about that Penny is recovering, but some department stores did better. And then Rack also, Nordstrom Rack, had a very strong comp, obviously they are somewhat differently located geographically. But could you just take about the competitive environment more broadly? So two questions, traffic and weather?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yeah. I mean, we\u2019ll start with the competitive environment. We have that all the time. As weather hit a lot of people, most people got aggressive. I think they'll continue to, I think there is a promotional environment. But I think our business model in itself is absolutely terrific and provide very well in all environment. And we will take full advantage of it. Not going to specifically talk about traffic each month but I mean, we\u2019ll improve and it did improve. And we were slightly down with our ticket up for the quarter.", "Operator", "And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I want to thank everyone. And we look forward to reporting on our second quarter. Thank you and thanks \u00c9lan.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, August 19, 2014.", "I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Carol Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Elan. And before I begin, good morning everyone and Deb has a few words.", "Deb McConnell - Global Communications", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company\u2019s results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company\u2019s plans to vary materially.

Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis. Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today\u2019s press release in the Investor Information section of our website, tjx.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s press release or otherwise posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Deb. And joining me and Deb on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg.", "So, let me begin by saying that I am extremely pleased with our second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share increased 14%, which was above our expectations and over an 18% increase last year. Consolidated comp store sales grew 3% at the high end of our plans and over 4% increase last year. We were delighted to see both sales and customer traffic gain momentum throughout the quarter with positive traffic in July. This is the beauty of our flexible business model despite a highly promotional retail environment in the second quarter and strong comparisons to last year. We drove strong sales and EPS increases and solid merchandise margins. Further, we accomplished this while continuing to invest in e-com, our infrastructure and organization to support our growth and has always delivered extreme values to our customers.", "Over 37-year history, we have sustained steady sales and earnings growth through many types of economic retail and consumer environments. This includes 22 consecutive quarters of consolidated comp store sales increases. With our strong second quarter performance, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance which Scott will take you through in a moment. The third quarter is off to a solid start and we have many exciting initiatives planned for the back half of the year. We remain confident, we will achieve our plans for 2014 and beyond, and as always, we will strive to beat them.", "As we approach $30 billion in annual sales, we are convinced that there are still tremendous opportunities. Today, I want to share with you our pillars of growth. I will also discuss the key advantages that we believe differentiate TJX in the retail industry and position us so well to pursue our U.S. and international growth plans.", "So, before I continue, I will turn the call over to Scott to recap some of the numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Carol and good morning everyone. As Carol mentioned, our second quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 3%, which was at the high end of our plan. Our second quarter comp was driven by an increase in ticket. Customer traffic was essentially flat for the second quarter and positive in July compared to last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.73 compared with last year\u2019s $0.66.", "Second quarter earnings per share include a $0.02 extinguishment of debt charge related to their early redemption of the company\u2019s $400 million 4.2% notes due August 2015. Excluding this charge, adjusted earnings per share were $0.75, a 14% increase over last year, which was above the high end of our plan. Foreign exchange had a neutral impact on earnings per share, which is the same as last year\u2019s neutral impact. Consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 12% for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, excluding an approximately 30 basis point impact from the debt extinguishment charge, the consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 12.3%, up 30 basis points versus last year.", "Gross profit margin was 28.6%, down 20 basis points versus the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of mark-to-market adjustments on our hedging instruments as well as the impacted e-commerce and merchandise margins. Merchandise margins were flat for the second quarter. For our brick-and-mortar businesses only, merchandise margins were slightly up. In addition, we had some buying and occupancy deleverage in the quarter.", "SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.2%, down 50 basis points versus last year\u2019s ratio largely due to a favorable adjustment to our insurance reserves based on improved claims experience as well as other cost savings. At the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including the warehouses and excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories were flat on a constant currency basis. We begin the third quarter in an excellent inventory position and ready to take advantage of the plentiful buying opportunities in the marketplace.", "In terms of share repurchases, during the second quarter, we bought back $440 million of TJX stock retiring 8 million shares. Year-to-date, we have retired 14 million shares buying back $800 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of TJX stock this year. As we announced in June, we completed the sale of $750 million of 2.75% 7-year notes. We took advantage of an attractive marketplace to refinance our $400 million 4.2% notes due 2015 and to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital in other general corporate purposes. As a reminder, with our international operations approximately half of our cash remains outside of the U.S. Even with this additional debt, we continue to have a very conservative balance sheet. Further, we remain committed to maintaining our very strong credit ratings and continuing our share buyback and dividend programs.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Carol. And I will recap our third quarter back half and full year fiscal \u201815 guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Scott. Before moving to our growth strategy and key advantages, I will share some additional color on our second quarter performance by division. In the U.S., Marmaxx comps increased 2%, over 4% increase last year. Segment profit margin was up 20 basis points and merchandise margins were flat including the negative impact from our e-commerce businesses. For our brick-and-mortar businesses only, merchandise margins were slightly up.", "Customer traffic improved every month of the quarter versus last year and was slightly positive in July. We were also very pleased with the improvement of our apparel businesses, particularly ladies apparel. As we discussed on our last call, in the first quarter, we had some execution issues in juniors and dresses. I am happy to say that we saw improvement in those categories in the second quarter. That said, there is always work we can do to execute even better. I can tell you that when we speak something, we can improve when not patient in fixing it. Going forward, we have very exciting initiatives planned for the back half to drive traffic and plan to bring our gift giving, up another notch this holiday season.", "HomeGoods delivered another outstanding quarter. Comps were up 5% over 8% growth last year and segment profit margin was up 40 basis points. We are even more excited about HomeGoods\u2019 excellent new store performance in its new markets as we believe this bodes well for the continued growth of this division. We are thrilled about our prospects for HomeGoods. To support its future growth, we are planning to open a new distribution center for HomeGoods in the back half of this year. ", "Moving to our international division, TJX Canada\u2019s results significantly improved in the second quarter. Comps increased 3% versus 2% last year and segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was up 130 basis points with improved merchandise margins. We are very pleased with our Marshalls business as we continued to rollout this chain across Canada. TJX Europe drove another terrific quarter. Comp increased 6%, over 6% increase last year. Segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, reached a second quarter record of 5.3%, up 30 basis points. We continue to see excellent performance across all of our European countries. It couldn\u2019t be more excited about our European business and our opportunities to open new countries in the future.", "As to e-commerce, we continue to be pleased with our overall online businesses in the U.S. and the UK. At tjmaxx.com we added men\u2019s luggage and sunglasses in the second quarter. We plan to keep adding more categories, but you will have to wait and see what they are. Further, we are focused on adding more brands and differentiating the selection from our stores to drive traffic in both directions. We are seeing most returns coming to our stores, which is the great way to enable us to introduce online shoppers to our physical stores. We continue to be very pleased with Sierra Trading and recently added Sierra to our TJX Rewards credit card program. We are also very excited about our new STP store opening next week, which I will discuss in a moment.", "Now, I will move to our confidence in continuing to drive profitable growth from many years to come and our four pillars for growth, driving comp sales, brick-and-mortar growth, e-commerce expansions and innovation. Starting with the first pillar, driving customer traffic and comp sales, we see enormous opportunities to gain U.S. and international consumer market share and we are pursuing them. We are still under-penetrated versus the U.S. department stores and see huge opportunities internationally. Our job is to get a bigger piece of the pie regardless of how big the pie is. We have many initiatives to gain new customers and to encourage our existing customers to shop us more often and shop more of our retail brands.", "We are leveraging our global marketing abilities and I believe we become better every year. At Marmaxx, through the back half 2014, we are increasing our total marketing spend and TV impressions and our commercials will be on TV even more weeks than last year. You will also be seeing more of our successful dual and tri-branding marketing campaign. I love our creative campaigns for the back half. I think they are our best yet. We also continue to use social media more effectively. We are happy with the growth of our social media followers and with their level of engagement. Further, we are delighted to launch our HomeGoods app called The Goods in July.", "Our TJX rewards loyalty program is another way we are attracting more customers, increasing their shopping frequency and encouraging more shopping across our chains. In the second quarter, we rolled out our access loyalty card nationwide in the U.S., which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours. Our tests have shown that it\u2019s a great way to invite more shoppers to join our loyalty program and for us to engage with them more frequently. We also continue to work on making our stores better everyday.", "We are on track with our plans to remodel about 250 stores across our chains this year as well as our development of our new Marshalls prototype. We see ourselves as fashion leaders and keep building the brand presence in our stores. Our customer satisfaction scores across all divisions continued to improve, but we are always striving to become even better. Above all, offering consumers amazing value is what I am convinced will keep driving customers to our stores. Value is our focus everyday.", "Now, to our second pillar of growth, which is our enormous brick-and-mortar potential. With over 3,200 stores today, we see the potential to grow to 5,150 stores long-term with our existing chains in our existing countries alone. The magnitude of our store growth opportunity, especially internationally is tremendous. Something we believe is often underappreciated externally. In North America alone, we see the potential to add over 1,400 new stores. Our new store performance continues to exceed our expectations, which gives us great confidence.", "Internationally, we could not be more excited about our growth potential. In Europe, we believe we can add more than 450 stores, which is more than double our existing base in just our current countries, with our current chains alone. We are on track to open 40 stores in Europe this year, up 25% from last year and may further accelerate the pace of store openings in 2015. Our 2014 plans include more than doubling the number of stores in Germany versus the prior year. Our new store performance across Europe continues to be excellent. We are looking forward to expanding into our next European countries, with our first few stores opening slated for Austria in the first half of 2015.", "We view this as a business, which we can support with our existing organization and infrastructure in Germany. Beyond Austria, we see a tremendous retail landscape for us in Europe. We remain the only brick-and-mortar off-price retailer of significant size in Europe. Looking beyond Europe, we are convinced our model can work in any country where consumers love great values on brand name fashions. We see TJX in an excellent position to bring value around the world.", "Our next pillar is e-commerce expansion. While it\u2019s still early, we are very pleased with our e-commerce businesses and see online as the growth vehicle for the future. Some investors have asked why we are not moving faster online. To be clear, we are taking a deliberate approach to growing e-commerce to ensure that online growth is incremental to our successful brick-and-mortar business. It\u2019s also important to note that we bought Sierra Trading, an e-commerce business that makes money and we are going to learn from them. We view online as another way to attract future generations of customers and offer shoppers 24/7 access to our values. Eventually, we can see e-commerce working for all of our retail brands.", "The fourth pillar is innovation. I truly believe we are leaders in innovation. We are constantly testing new ideas and developing new speed, which can lead to big things. At any one time, we can be testing over 100 different ideas throughout the company. We are always seeking the right categories, newness, current fashion, exciting new brands, along with analyzing new countries. As I mentioned, we have a Sierra Trading Post grand opening next week and just wait until you see it. This will be the first of two Sierra Trading Post stores in the Denver area, which leverage our deep brick-and-mortar experience. We are very enthusiastic about outdoor and the active categories and we see great promise in offering consumers more options in this space with our off-price values. Further, this can be another way to attract more male customers as Sierra reaches the higher percentage of men\u2019s than our other chains.", "We are convinced that our focus on innovation is what will drive our business now and in the future and will differentiate TJX from the rest of the retail world. To support our growth domestically and internationally, we continue to reinvest in the business. Our key investments include new stores, store remodels, e-commerce, supply chain, which includes our new planning and allocation systems, teaching and talent. It\u2019s important to note that we view all of these investments as top line drivers.", "Moving on, I want to spend a moment on TJX\u2019s key advantages that we believe differentiate our company and set us up extremely well for the future. First is our global leverage, which we are convinced sets us apart from so many other retailers. We have decades of international experience and have built a world class team operationally, infrastructure, and have infrastructure in five countries outside of the U.S. Our no walls communication is key. We have a true global awareness and are gaining even more leverage as we grow internationally.", "The major way we are leveraging our business globally is our sourcing universe. We see ourselves as a global sourcing machine. We have built a world-class buying organization over nearly four decades, that is 900 people strong and we plan to keep growing it. We sourced merchandise from a universe of more than 16,000 vendors in over 75 countries. We keep opening new vendors all over the world and I believe we are very far from done. We are also leveraging our relationships to bring the newest fashion to all our chains. We truly believe that there are few other retailers that can offer the eclectic mix you will see in our stores or build new categories as quickly as we do.", "Next, we are one of the most flexible retailers in the world. Our flexible store format and nimbleness allow us to react to changing market trends and consumer taste. We serve an extremely wide demographic reach, which we believe is one of the broadest in retail. We attract shoppers with extremely large range of household incomes. And of course, our leadership in innovation, which is discussed earlier, is another important differentiator. We see all of these elements of our business as major advantages for TJX that differentiate us from so many other retailers. None of these factors are easy to replicate. Most importantly, we are convinced as these key advantages set us up extremely well as we continue our path becoming a $40 billion plus retailer.", "So, in summing up, we are extremely pleased with our second quarter results. The first quarter is off to a solid start and we are excited about the back half. We have many initiatives planned to drive customer traffic in the near and long-term. We see a marketplace loaded with branded quality goods. We are working to up our game even further with our marketing, gift-giving, and most importantly, our values. Every year, we look at the glass as half empty to see what can we do to raise the bar on execution. Long-term, we are very confident in the huge opportunities we see for our business in driving comp sales, U.S. and international store growth, e-commerce expansion and innovation. We remain very confident in our near and long-term goals. And as a management team, we always strive to surpass our goals.", "And now, I will turn the call back to Scott to go through guidance and then we will open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Carol. Now, to fiscal \u201815 guidance beginning with the full year, as we noted in our press release today, we are raising our adjusted full year diluted earnings per share guidance. On a reported basis, we expect fiscal \u201815 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.08 to $3.16. On an adjusted basis, excluding the second quarter debt extinguishment charge of $0.02, we now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.18 over $2.94 in fiscal \u201814. This reflects our above plan second quarter EPS results. As a reminder, fiscal \u201814 included a tax benefit of $0.11. Excluding this benefit, our guidance for full year adjusted EPS would be 10% to 12% over the prior year\u2019s adjusted $2.83.", "We continue to expect consolidated comp store sales growth of 1% to 2%. For the year, we expect pre-tax profit margins to be 12.0% to 12.2%. On an adjusted basis, excluding the debt extinguishment charge, we continue to expect pre-tax profit margins to be 12.0% to 12.3%. This would be down 10 basis points to up 20 basis points versus 12.1% in fiscal \u201814. This reflects expected gross margins of 28.3% to 28.5%, which will be down 20 basis points to flat versus fiscal \u201814. We anticipate SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 16.1% to 16.2%, a 10 to 20 basis point improvement versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates are expected to have a $0.01 negative impact on full year EPS versus a $0.01 positive impact last year.", "Let me now discuss the back half guidance. We expect EPS to be in the range of $1.71 to $1.80, excluding the $0.11 benefit \u2013 tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal \u201814, this would be a 10% to 15% increase over last year\u2019s adjusted $1.56. This guidance is based on consolidated comp store sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%. We are planning pre-tax profit margins to be 12.3% to 12.7%, flat to up 40 basis points over last year. This EPS guidance also includes a $0.01 per share positive impact from foreign currency exchange rates versus a $0.01 per share positive impact last year.", "Now, to third quarter guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.85. Excluding $0.11 tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal \u201814, this would be an 8% to 13% increase over last year\u2019s adjusted $0.75 per share, which was 21% above the prior year. We are assuming third quarter consolidated sales in the $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion range. This is based on comp sales growth in the 1% to 2% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Third quarter pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 12.4% to 12.8% range, down 20 to up 20 basis points versus the prior year.", "We are anticipating third quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 29.0% to 29.3%, down 30 basis points to flat versus the prior year. We are expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be 16.4% versus 16.6% last year. Foreign currency rates are expected to have a $0.01 positive impact on EPS this year versus a neutral impact last year. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 37.7% and net interest expense of about $10 million. We anticipated a weighted average share count of approximately $700 million.", "Our full year guidance implies fourth quarter EPS in the range of $0.90 to $0.94 compared to $0.81 last year. This guidance assumes consolidated comp sales growth of 1% to 2%. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call. Finally, our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the end of the quarter.", "Now, we are happy to take your questions to keep the call on schedule. We are going to continue to ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. We appreciate your cooperation with this. Thanks. And now we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thanks. (Operator Instructions) Our first today is from Omar Saad (ISI Group).", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Thanks. Good morning. Really nice quarter guys.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Carol, big picture question on traffic, it\u2019s obviously just a question that\u2019s been plaguing retail in general over the last few years. I wanted to kind of get your big picture thoughts on what you have been seeing the last several quarters? How you are thinking about physical traffic, especially in strip centers, where maybe some of your cohorts in those centers are kind of the electronics retailers or book retailers, some of the ones that have their bull\u2019s eye right on their back in terms of losing share to the internet. Is TJ now the primary driver in a lot of those centers and how you think about it long-term? That would be great. Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I mean, I think you got to take it center by center in terms of are we the ones that are driving the traffic to the center. We think \u2013 we look at our traffic. We have done a lot of things in terms of marketing, a lot of initiatives that I think we are starting to see the fruits of our labor. And I think we have a lot of initiatives going forward that are going to drive traffic. So, in terms of real estate, we are going to always look at the best deal, the best shopping center, the best situation. So, we are feeling very positive about the second quarter and month by month. So, we are just going to keep driving our traffic as hard as we can.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson (Bank of America Merrill Lynch).", "Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the e-commerce business, how dilutive was it to the quarter\u2019s merchandise margin? Is this business profitable? And how big do you think it could get over time?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, it\u2019s very small. And I think I have to put e-commerce in perspective, because we are close to a $30 billion business and our e-commerce is a little bit more than 1% of our business. So, we really look at it as defensive and offensive to really drive traffic to both brick-and-mortar and give our customers the convenience of being able to shop us. So, we will continue to invest in it. We are very pleased our average order value in our tjmaxx.com is very high. It\u2019s actually over $100, which is very exciting. What\u2019s even more exciting is an opportunity to offer the runway to over 900 stores that don\u2019t have the runway. So, we are going to continue investing. We love Sierra. We are learning a lot, but we are going to do it slow, because we do want to make money.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen (Citi).", "Oliver Chen - Citi", "Hi. Congratulations on awesome results. Regarding the gross margin guidance, what is the main driver there in terms of the dynamics of March margin? Also as you do step up gift giving and the opportunity there going forward, is it \u2013 are you planning to offer a stronger value if there is any more insight into what\u2019s the opportunity there? That would be great. Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, to the back half on pretty much gross margin and merchandise margins, they are planned up. Our gift giving, every single year, we look at it and we try to I will say raise the bar in terms of the value. We have learned a lot from each year. And this year we have some exciting things that we are doing in our stores that are going to be very different than a year ago and pretty exciting. We also have a whole new marketing campaign, that\u2019s both Ernie and I love. So, we have a lot of initiatives going on. We had a pretty strong December last year. We think we can again up our game and we are really looking forward to the back half.", "Oliver Chen - Citi", "Thanks. And just a quick follow-up, your inventory management has been so superior, what\u2019s on the horizon for planning and allocation over a longer term?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. So, we have been working on our planning and allocation systems. And probably one of the first things that we are focusing on is to be able to expand countries. So, we are looking at that and we are continuing to build as we have talked about it being able to deliver the right goods to the right store at the right time. So, we are excited about that. Primarily, we are looking at these as sales drivers. And obviously if we drive sales and we bring fresh, more freshness more frequently to stores, it may mitigate markdowns, but that remains to be seen. We are keeping our inventories probably by the end of the year pretty much flat to LY.", "Oliver Chen - Citi", "Thanks. Congrats and best regards.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez (Wells Fargo Securities).", "Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities", "Hey, thanks guys. You said that traffic picked up in July. Just wondering if there was any one division in particular that that was more pronounced or was it across the board? And then also, I was just curious about the size of the reversal on the insurance reserves or the adjustment, I should say? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, you can see by the comp. So, our traffic was pretty strong in HomeGoods. It was strong in Europe and Canada. And we also saw the improvement in Marmaxx as we went through the months. So, Scott, you want to talk about insurance?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. Paul, well, I will talk about in terms of our SG&A beat to guidance, the adjustment to the insurance service represented the largest factor in the beat, but it wasn\u2019t the majority of the beat to guidance. In addition, Paul we had cost savings that were really spread across multiple areas and divisions with no one item to call out. So it\u2019s really how I would parse that.", "Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thanks guys. Good luck.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Jeffrey Stein (Northcoast Research).", "Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research", "Yes, just a couple of questions real quick. First, Carol I am kind of intrigued by the potential to use your e-commerce business as a traffic driver, one of your competitors last week indicated that they are getting over 70% of their returns from their online business into their stores and I am wondering is it that high or maybe even higher for your business and how important do you see e-commerce as a traffic driver?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It\u2019s actually higher than on our returns, so we are kind of thrilled about that. It\u2019s still early in the game and we are really looking at measuring and putting our stats together, but we are definitely seeing that the customers coming back to the stores and buying. We haven\u2019t quite measured it yet, but I think we are feeling pretty positive about it.", "Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research", "Great. And could you talk a little bit about your marketing plans for the back half of the year, are you planning to increase marketing spend as a percent of sales and how much would you guesstimate your marketing impressions will be up in the back half? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So we are planning pretty much flat the dollars, but our impressions are going to be up. And we are leveraging our tri-branding and we are pretty excited about that. And as always we will go through the third quarter and reevaluate the fourth quarter where we want to go. But more importantly, some of the initiatives that we started in the second quarter, such as our TJX Reward card and adding Sierra Trading and our loyalty we think some of that will start to set in even stronger in the back half. So again, we really like our marketing plan for the back half.", "Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger (Morgan Stanley).", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you. I will add my congratulations as well on a great quarter. My questions are on the gross margin, can you talk about the reasons behind the B&O deleverage in the second quarter, is that sort of temporary or is that a lasting headwind. And I assume that the 10 basis points of the 20 basis points decline was actually the FX hits from the Canadian division, could you just confirm if that\u2019s the right assumption there?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Overall, as there is always there is a bit of rounding and when you are doing rounding to the 10 basis points, so yes the FX was 10 basis points. And the occupancy was some of that, but it\u2019s not a full 10 basis points. It was some of the deleverage to get down to the flat excluding \u2013 when you exclude FX and some of the B&O and some of the e-commerce impact on the overall gross margin. So it\u2019s really a combination of the 10 basis points for the FX and other two components we talked about.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Understood, that\u2019s super helpful. And then just to clarify, I think Carol mentioned that e-commerce had a little bit of merchandise margin pressure within the Marmaxx division, even with that I think you said Marmaxx was flat, in terms of the e-commerce business pressure, is that really from the Sierra Trading Post side of the equation or are you actually seeing a touch of merchandise margin pressure on the tjx.com or the tjmaxx.com website as well?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "It\u2019s a combination.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. It\u2019s internally \u2013 again the merchandise margins at Marmaxx were up slightly when you exclude the e-commerce businesses. And it\u2019s a little bit of both, from both STP and tjmaxx.com in terms of margin pressure.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Which is in our plans.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Which again is in the plans.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks and good luck for the second half.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Grambling (Goldman Sachs).", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about the under-penetration versus the department stores, as it pertains to the consumer. Is there any detail that you can provide on who that consumer is or you are still going after? And as a correlation maybe you can expand on how the customer base is involved and how you are seeing any differences from the customer base online versus in-store? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, it\u2019s too early to really analyze the customer online versus our stores. Our job is just to gain customers. We have talked about gaining younger customers, which we have been doing, but it\u2019s really across the board, because we have such a wide demographic. I just think it\u2019s a big opportunity and to teach them about values and also price.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs", "So, just to confirm it is that younger customer base that you feel like you are under penetrated?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think it\u2019s across the board, because the percentages are so high in terms of the opportunity, but we are focused on the younger customer.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks. Best of luck in the back half.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Drbul (Nomura).", "Robert Drbul - Nomura", "Hi, good morning. Scott, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the new store openings across the formats and sort of how they have been performing versus the plan?", "Scott Goldenberg", "No real change there, Robert, in terms of new store performance. All four of our divisions continued to outperform their performance as we have been talking about for the last seven years and \u2013 the last several years, so consistently in very big beats as you would expect, as we have been talking about in Europe, HomeGoods is in continued beats and our TJX Canada and Marmaxx businesses, so no change there and these are significant beats to our performance.", "Robert Drbul - Nomura", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Jaffe (Stifel Nicolaus).", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "Well, thanks very much guys. You mentioned HomeGoods getting a new distribution center I am wondering what the distribution center outlook is for the whole chain both domestically and internationally, where your capacity is and where it needs to go to achieve the 5,000 store growth?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think honestly we just added Phoenix, which is huge for Marmaxx and we are in our plans as the HomeGoods DC, so that should set us up for quite a while. So, we don\u2019t see any huge, huge expenses in the future, probably for at least I would say two to three years.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "So, overseas is okay as well?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, we are in very good shape overseas.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Roxanne Meyer (NYSE:UBS).", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS", "Great, thanks and congratulations on a great quarter. Your inventory was extremely well positioned, but I am just wondering if you could comment on the carryover inventory at the end of the quarter from the Marmaxx division? And then secondly as you think about new store growth for Marmaxx and actually for all of your U.S. divisions, I am just wondering if you are contemplating other types of formats and locations aside from the traditional strip center and where we could see our stores popping up over time? Thanks a lot.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Let me \u2013 your first question I am not quite understanding because we don\u2019t have carryover.", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS", "I guess I would say more clearance type of inventory that\u2019s maybe more tied to summer product?", "Ernie Herrman", "No, in the stores. Yes, we are very \u2013 Roxanne, we are very clean in the stores, in fact our inventory, well, it\u2019s been lean off season and with given the second quarter with sales picking up, our clearance levels are very under control. No real liabilities there.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I can tell you it\u2019s positioning very well.", "Ernie Herrman", "Very well, yes.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "In terms of formats, Roxanne we go for the best deal. If it makes sense for us we do it. If it\u2019s a larger format, we go for it, a smaller format, we are always looking for real estate opportunities and are we heading to all the A malls? No, we are not, but we see again the flexibility and the variety that we can deal with is really an advantage for us.", "Ernie Herrman", "And that applies to actually all the countries we have tried different formats, but like Carol said, we are very opportunistic when we do it. So, if there is a site that we think it\u2019s right demos and traffic, even if the layout is not traditional, we will flex them be in the type of building we will do small, large, different configuration. So, we are pretty flexible.", "Roxanne Meyer - UBS", "Great, thanks so much and best of luck in the third quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick (JPMorgan).", "Brian Tunick - JPMorgan", "Thanks. I will add my congrats as well. I guess two questions. One, maybe Carol, the longer term view for Marmaxx merchandise margins, just trying to think through the puts and takes there, so the promotional environment the last year or two very heightened, curious about your views to remain 30% below your competitors\u2019 price points versus your supply chain and in-store inventory initiatives, so just what\u2019s your view longer term and where you think Marmaxx merchandise margins can go? And then the second question on HomeGoods, can you maybe talk about the acceleration you saw in the quarter? It sounds like a tougher big ticket quarter out there. So, what drove the improvement and also wondering if you think J.C. Penney is in that competitive set for HomeGoods? Thanks very much.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, I mean, first of all I am going to answer the HomeGoods question, because our business across the board in HomeGoods is really absolutely sensational. So, whether it\u2019s big ticket or small ticket and I can\u2019t answer the Penney question, because we didn\u2019t see deterioration \u2013 we didn\u2019t see the increase when Penney\u2019s business was tough and vice-versa. So, we don\u2019t see that as an impact. Marmaxx, we plan our margins pretty flat to slightly up. They did a fantastic job this quarter with a slight increase in the brick-and-mortar business, which I think is sensational. And as I said, as we deliver more often and we do get our systems in. Hopefully, we will reap some additional benefits from that, but I think it\u2019s prudent for us to just plan conservatively and beat our plans. So, that\u2019s the way we are looking at the future.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Baker (Deutsche Bank).", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Just curious as to what you are seeing with the department stores and the promotional environment. I think their inventories seems to be coming back in line, so are they as promotional as you think they were in the last few quarters or is that any sign that\u2019s being alleviated? And then one other quick one if I could slide it in, your comp guidance for the next quarter is 1% to 2%, I think going into this quarter, you were guiding to something higher than I think it was 2% to 3%. Was that 2% to 3% for this quarter, was that just because of the weather shift or is there some other reason why you wouldn\u2019t take the third quarter with comp as well this quarter? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Some of it\u2019s marketing, some of it\u2019s weather, but look Michael, I hope we beat the 1% to 2%. That\u2019s where our heads are at. Ernie, you want to answer from promotional, the gap?", "Ernie Herrman", "Sure. Michael, I think the environment I would say like in the second quarter, it felt a little more promotional I think than last year. And I think the business environment is a little mixed out there. So, we react \u2013 our model fortunately is we are buying so close in that we are reacting to whatever the environment is. Certainly, the market continues to have plentiful availability and I guess at the end of the day that\u2019s our biggest hedge against all of that situation. So, we are always watching the environment. It does seem like it could get that way. We are about to enter a third quarter, where I would guess it will be typical to last year, because it\u2019s the beginning of the fall season, so tough to predict, tough to predict, but our model allows us to flex according to whatever happens there.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And Michael, I will just add in also when you look at the third quarter \u2013 the second quarter versus the third quarter, we are planning it pretty similar on a 2-year and 3-year stack in terms of our comp. So, I think it\u2019s just planning it pretty similar to the way we plan the second quarter.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank", "Understood. Thanks, appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick McKeever (MKM Partners).", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "Hi, good morning, everyone. Question on e-commerce and the question is are any of the learnings, let\u2019s say, the e-commerce learnings, are you learning anything that applies to potentially applies to bricks and mortar? I am thinking about the high average ticket and the fact that you have all this knowledge on where the customer is. So, one thing I was wondering is if the high average ticket implies perhaps that the runway sales are pretty strong and might you roll that concept out to more stores for example in different places where you might not have thought it would work?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So Patrick, we probably won\u2019t rollout the runway to too many more stores, we will do some. And it\u2019s \u2013 we really look at it as a back and forth and the opportunity to get a lot more email addresses and communicate with the customer. So I keep going back to it\u2019s offensive and defensive. And it\u2019s an opportunity to really leverage both and that\u2019s the way we look at it.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "Just to clarify, you said it was less than 1% of total sales?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "A little (more) than 1%.", "Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners", "Little more than 1%? Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from John Kernan (Cowen).", "John Kernan - Cowen", "Hi guys, good morning. Just a question on Europe, it seems there is obviously a lot of momentum on the comp side of things and also on the margin side of things, what is \u2013 in terms of new markets you are identifying what are you seeing and what gives you such confidence you can take it out of your existing \u2013 take the concept out of your existing markets? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "First of all, I think we have been really analyzing the last several years and we are pretty clear in terms of our \u2013 the countries that we know we can move into that we can leverage and we have been working pretty hard on countries beyond that. So I think I will go back to some of the mistakes we made in the past which is something we are not going to do in the future. And the mix in itself and Ernie can talk to that has been so talk about raising the bar on the mix in Europe that we believe today it works in many countries in a very different way than it would years ago. But we are pretty clear on exactly what mix goes into what country in the future.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, I think John, we have I think Carol was alluding to this. We have developed the organization over the last couple of years to ensure that the mix is appropriate in each country and we take each market step by step with a lot of analysis before we go there. But the model works in many, many countries as we have shown in Poland and Germany which profitability wise are right there where we need them to be in a relatively short time. So we are feeling very bullish because our organization is in place and we don\u2019t just jump into a country without the amount of research ahead of time. And we are now certainly not doing it without the organization in place to make sure that the mix is appropriate in that country. And I think those are two of the big learnings that we have had of the past and that\u2019s why we feel confident going forward.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think John, the other thing is Europe and just in last quarter has opened hundreds of new vendors. So we are even more excited about it because the opportunities are really vast.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And our buying teams are actually we are buying from numerous locations. So we are also in a place now where we are able to create a mix in different markets that will really can fit the mix, we can learn after we go in, but we really have a strong buying organization now supporting the Europe business.", "John Kernan - Cowen", "Okay. So I am sorry and thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ike Boruchow (Sterne Agee).", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one I think you guys mentioned that our store traffic was positive in Europe, HomeGoods in Canada and the traffic for the quarter was flat, does that imply that the Marmaxx traffic was a little negative for the quarter and then any geographic reads of Marmaxx in the quarter too will great?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. We the traffic in Marmaxx ended up being up in July and pretty much flat across the board, right.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Okay. Any geographic trends for Marmaxx in the quarter?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So, basically we have positive, the traffic was pretty much across the board by region, pretty much positive from Q1. And the areas that were affected by weather were also in a positive trend. We didn\u2019t see any major differences by the region.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from David Mann (Johnson Rice).", "David Mann - Johnson Rice", "Yes, thank you. You called out some of the improvement in apparel, but if I remember in the first quarter, your accessory jewelry area was pretty strong. So, I was curious if you could talk a little bit about that category? Are you seeing some weakening in the footwear and accessory area and any thoughts about that?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Actually, our accessory business is very strong. Jewelry is exceptional. So those areas are still trending very well for us.", "David Mann - Johnson Rice", "Very good. One quick follow-up, earlier the comment about current availability, I am just curious when you have seen in the past that department stores improve their management of inventory, have you seen any deterioration in the availability in the ensuing quarters after that\u2019s gone on?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, absolutely not. And if anything it\u2019s positive for us. It means that they are in control of their inventory. That means that the ticket is in good shape. It\u2019s always positive for us. I can say it 100 times and I will say it again we could be $40 billion, we could be $50 billion and there is more goods than we could ever take. Everyday we are having that conversation. The availability is vast and the quality of it is terrific and we don\u2019t see that changing in the back half at all. Yet I think you have to realize when you are dealing with 900 buyers across the globe and the number of vendors, Scott is laughing, because we said 16,000 and the number keeps growing. It\u2019s a quite a job to control all that quite frankly. And that\u2019s what we do best, but we are \u2013 there is more goods than we could ever, ever buy.", "David Mann - Johnson Rice", "Carol, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Marni Shapiro (The Retail Tracker).", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Hey, guys. Congratulations.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hey.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "I had a really quick question on the marketing, because you said the spend was up in the back half. Does that include HomeGoods and what will it be up as well in Canada and Europe or is this just specifically in the U.S. that you are increasing the marketing?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "The impressions are pretty much up across the board. And it\u2019s a variety depending on the divisions, some divisions are \u2013 they are higher in terms of TV. Others money is being shifted in terms of social. So, it is really pretty much across the board. The impressions are up in the back half.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Fantastic. Best of luck for the fall season guys.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Now having said that, we will reevaluate it also after the third quarter and if we feel that we need to put more spend to it, we certainly will, but I think we are feeling pretty good about our plans right now.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Fantastic. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Champine (Canaccord Genuity).", "Laura Champine - Canaccord Genuity", "Good morning. Carol, you mentioned that you might accelerate the growth in the TJMaxx division next year. Can you give us any more color on to what magnitude you might do that?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We will in January. At our year end call, we will tell you our plans.", "Laura Champine - Canaccord Genuity", "Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bridget Weishaar (Morningstar).", "Bridget Weishaar - Morningstar", "Good morning. Congratulations, again. You called out that TJX Canada had really performed well and it certainly did with the comps much improved and the margins. Can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving that and is the margin improvement mostly due to leverage or also merchandise margins? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think all three of us will answer that. First of all, weather is always, it got a little bit better in the second quarter. And Scott, you want to talk about the margins and Ernie maybe a little bit about Canada\u2019s business?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. Again, I think the comps were better than we had anticipated. So, we got some leverage on the three comp. The merchandise margin was better than we had \u2013 again we also had than we had planned internally. We have mitigated more than we have thought in terms of the FX impact on the mark-on. So, that was favorable and we had some favorable cost savings and some benefit of some timing of expenses that did benefit us in the second quarter that were planned in the second half, but they are baked into our second half guidance at this point.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. I think also when the weather was difficult in first quarter that created additional opportunities in the market. So the good thing is our merchants up there kept their liquidity, which is always Carol was talking earlier about how difficult it is to hold back sometimes with so much goods out there, but in Canada, we did do a good job. The team I thought did a great job of taking advantage of market opportunities going to the second quarter. And if you look of the nice thing that we without giving any specifics is we had an uptick in businesses across the board, whether it was apparel or accessories, even our home business. So, again, I think a lot of it was good execution of the opportunities that were in the marketplace, so\u2026", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think the other point is we have a great team focused on Marshalls too and our Marshalls business\u2026", "Ernie Herrman", "Is very strong.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We are very pleased with. So, again, Ernie has really built the infrastructure in that team there similar to Europe. So, we will start to leverage that.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And one other component, I mean, we obviously had the weather impact in sales in the first quarter. They went into the quarter with inventories well-controlled and maintained that.", "Ernie Herrman", "Open to buy control.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Open to buy, they had the good, they had the above \u2013 had the good comp and so obviously translated into some markdown savings as well.", "Bridget Weishaar - Morningstar", "Great, thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Sandra Barker (Montag & Caldwell).", "Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell", "Could you talk a little bit more about online just in terms of the lower margins? Does that have to do with scale? Does it have to do with mix? Does it have to do with free shipping? I mean, what\u2019s the most significant difference there and do you expect that to continue going forward?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think it\u2019s a combination of all the above. And I don\u2019t \u2013 there aren\u2019t a lot of e-commerce businesses out there that are making a ton of money. And I think we are very happy with Sierra. We are learning. We do want to make money with our e-com business and \u2013 but more importantly, I keep coming back to \u2013 we want to balance pushing the customer to brick-and-mortar and back. So, we have a lot of plans. It\u2019s early games, it\u2019s early now. I can say it a million times, it\u2019s 1%, a little bit more than 1%, but we feel very good about some of our thoughts going forward and we will keep learning, but we are going to do it carefully.", "Scott Goldenberg", "I mean, just to echo a little on what Carol said, I mean, it\u2019s less than one year old, our tjmaxx.com business. And as with any small business, you don\u2019t leverage \u2013 yet you are \u2013 we are nowhere near leveraging the scale of our buying organizations and the rest of the infrastructure as we grow it. So, we would expect it to get better as we move forward.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Our plans are certainly to get better.", "Operator", "And I am showing no further questions at this time.", "Carol Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thanks everyone and I look forward to reporting on the third quarter.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Wednesday, February 25, 2015.", "I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Elan. And before we begin, good morning, everyone. Deb has a few words.", "Deb McConnell", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company\u2019s results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company\u2019s plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings including, without limitations, the Form 10-K filed April 1, 2014.", "Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies.

Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today\u2019s press release in the Investor Information section of our website, tjx.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s press release or otherwise posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Deb. And joining me and Deb on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg.", "Let me begin by saying that we had a terrific fourth quarter. Earnings per share increased 15%, well exceeding our expectations. Consolidated comp sales grew 4% over last year\u2019s 3% increase, also above our plan. We\u2019re extremely pleased to see the comp almost entirely driven by customer traffic. We also like the sequential improvement in comps and traffic we saw at all divisions from the third quarter.", "I\u2019m also very pleased with our 2014 results. Adjusted earnings per share increased 12% over last year\u2019s 15% increase and above our plan while we continue to invest in our many initiatives for the future. 2014 marks the sixth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Over this time, our compound annual adjusted EPS growth has been a strong 22%.", "We were delighted to see customer traffic improve each quarter throughout the year. Consolidated comp sales were up 2% for the year over last year\u2019s 3% increase.", "Today, I will recap our four pillars for growth and share with you our raise estimates for long-term store growth potential. In 2015, we are planning comps increases consistent with prior years and assuming more conservative EPS growth primarily due to macro factors. Our underlying business remains strong and we are reiterating our 10% to 13% annual EPS growth model.", "We are confident we will achieve our goals and as always, we strive to surpass them. In 2014, we retail [ph] a $30 billion in sales which underscores our confidence in becoming a $40 billion company and beyond.", "Before I continue, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott to recap our fourth quarter and our full year numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin with our fourth quarter results. As Carol mentioned, our consolidated comparable store sales increased 4% over a 3% increase last year and above our plan. We were very pleased that our comp was almost entirely driven by customer traffic and that all of our divisions ended the year with traffic increases. Further, it was also great to see a strong increase in our units sold.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.93, a 15% increase over last year\u2019s $0.81, which was above our plan. Foreign exchange had a neutral impact on EPS compared with a $0.01 positive impact last year. This was $0.02 better than we planned resulting from a mark-to-market gain on our currency hedges due to the dramatic decline in the Canadian dollar and the British pound at the end of the quarter.", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 12.4%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year. Gross profit margin was 28.2%, up 60 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by strong merchandise margin improvement as well as buying an occupancy leverage on the strong comp.", "SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 15.7%, up 10 basis points versus last year\u2019s ratio. SG&A was less favorable than anticipated due to contributions to the TJX Foundation and legal costs not contemplated in our most recent guidance.", "At the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including inventories held in warehouses and excluding in-transit and eCommerce inventories, were up 5% on a constant currency basis versus an 8% decline last year. Average in-store inventories at the end of the quarter were flat versus last year.", "Now to recap our full year fiscal \u201915 results. Consolidated comparable store sales increased 2% over a 3% increase last year. The comp was driven by a combination of increases in average basket and customer traffic. We were very pleased that customer traffic improved sequentially every quarter of the year.", "Diluted earnings per share were $3.15. Excluding a second quarter debt extinguishment charge of $0.01, adjusted EPS was $3.16, a 12% increase over last year\u2019s $2.83 which excluded a tax benefit of $0.11 from reported EPS of $2.94. Our 12% increase exceeded the high-end of our most recent guidance.", "Foreign exchange had a $0.01 negative impact on earnings per share compared to a $0.01 positive impact last year. For the full year, consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 12.2%. Excluding an approximately 10 basis points impact from the second quarter debt extinguishment charge, adjusted pre-tax profit margin was 12.3%, up 20 basis points versus last year\u2019s 12.1%.", "Gross profit margin was 28.5%, flat versus last year. For the full year, merchandise margins were slightly up. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.1%, a 20 basis points improvement over last year\u2019s ratio.", "Moving to our financial strength and shareholder distributions. Our business continues to generate excellent cash flows and strong financial returns. In fiscal \u201915, free cash flow was $2.1 billion, approximately $415 million more than last year. OIC remained a strong 23%, thanks in large part to a disciplined approach with capital allocations.", "We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders while continuing to reinvest to support our growth for the long-term. We returned $2.1 billion of cash to shareholders in fiscal \u201915 through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Even after increasing the shareholder distribution program and our investments in the business, we still ended the year with $2.8 billion of cash in short-term investments.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Carol and I\u2019ll recap our first quarter and full year of fiscal \u201916 guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Scott. Before moving to our pillars for growth, I\u2019ll share some highlights of the fourth quarter.", "We are extremely pleased with our strong holiday season and fourth quarter results. We are convinced that our tremendous values, plus shipments of gift-giving assortments and our effective marketing attracted more shoppers to our stores. Further, based on our learnings from last year, we did a much better job of shifting our merchandise mix by region. In general, weather was also more favorable for most of the quarter versus last year.", "Looking at our performance by division beginning in the U.S., Marmaxx comps were up 3% over a 3% increase last year. The increase was entirely driven by customer traffic. Second, profit margin was up 80 basis points and merchandise margins were up solidly. It is terrific to see Marmaxx finish 2014 with its best quarter of the year.", "HomeGoods delivered another outstanding quarter. Comps were up 11% and segment profit margin increased 120 basis points. We are thrilled of HomeGoods\u2019 consistently strong results and could not be more excited about this division\u2019s prospect for the future.", "So moving to our international divisions, at TJX Canada, comps increased 7% and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was up 30 basis points. While our Canadian organization did a nice job mitigating some of the currency impact on our mark-on as we anticipated, the rapid decline in the Canadian dollar continue to negatively impact merchandise margins.", "Also, we were extremely pleased with customer traffic and the response to our initiatives at all our Canadian chains. We clearly have a very loyal customer base in Canada.", "TJX Europe comps were up 2% over a very strong 8% increase last year. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was down 20 basis points. It\u2019s important to note that this includes our investment in talent to open additional country ahead of our original plan and research other new countries. I\u2019ll elaborate on this later. We are pleased to see sequential sales improving from the third quarter across all of our geographies.", "We also offer customers amazing gift giving selections on our eCommerce sites in the U.S. and the U.K. throughout the holidays. At tjmaxx.com, we were very pleased with our above plan sales in the fourth quarter. We are excited about all our online businesses. And in a moment, I\u2019ll detail a number of initiatives planned for 2015.", "Now to our four pillars of growth. Starting with driving customer traffic and comp sales, we like our fourth quarter traffic increases and also continue to see enormous opportunity to gain U.S. and international consumer market share. We remain underpenetrated versus U.S. department stores and the potential to expand our reach internationally is back.", "We target a very wide demographic base and like the growth we\u2019re seeing in the millennial shopping across our divisions. We operate a diversified international portfolio with an eCommerce offering that is differentiated from our brick-and-mortar store. We see all of this as a great advantage.", "In 2015, we will continue to pursue many initiatives to drive traffic. First, we have become better every year at leveraging our global marketing capabilities. In 2015, we plan to continue our multilayered advertising approach to reach consumers through television, radio and digital media.", "Second, to drive more frequent business and cross shopping, we will continue to grow our U.S. and Canadian loyalty program. The initial customer response to our non-credit Access loyalty card, part of our TJX work program has been excellent since we rolled it out in the U.S. last summer.", "Based on the success of our North American initiative, we are testing a non-credit loyalty program in the U.K. We are very pleased with the initial results.", "Further, we plan to keep upgrading the shopping experience and making our stores better every day. In 2015, we expect to remodel approximately 225 stores across the company. This includes our new Marshalls prototype which we\u2019re rolling out this year.", "We remain focused on building our brand presence and bringing consumers trend-right merchandise at outstanding value. Our buying organization now numbers more than 1,000 people positioned around the globe.", "Our merchant source from the vendor universe of over 17,000 vendors in more than 100 countries. We are also delighted that our overall customer satisfaction scores improved once again in 2014 to a record high and we\u2019re striving to be even better in 2015. Our brand recognition is getting better every year.", "Our second pillar is our enormous brick-and-mortar global growth potential. Today, we are raising our estimates for our long-term store growth potential to 5,475 stores, 325 more stores than our prior target. This would be more than 2,000 stores or greater than 60% growth over our current base.", "In 2015, we plan to add 181 stores across our chains. In the U.S. alone, we see the potential to add over 1,400 stores.", "At Marmaxx, we see the long-term potential to grow our store base by over 40% to about 3,000 stores. We see significant white space remaining for Marmaxx across the U.S. including in both rural and urban location. Marmaxx\u2019s consistent results underscore our confidence in our growth plans. In 2014, segment profit margin was a strong 14.6%.", "We are pleased with the sequential improvement we saw in customer traffic each quarter of the year and are pursuing many traffic-driving initiatives in 2015.", "At HomeGoods, we\u2019re raising our estimates for its long-term growth store to approximately 1,000 stores. This is double the current base and 175 more stores than our prior estimate.", "HomeGoods has delivered consistently excellent results over many years which is a major factor in our confidence. In 2014, segment profit margin hit a divisional record of 13.6%. In addition, some other U.S. home retailers operate over 1,000 stores today. HomeGoods is a phenomenal business and we see an exciting future prospect for this chain.", "Moving to our international division. In Canada, we continue to see very solid growth potential. We are raising TJX Canada\u2019s long-term store growth estimate to around 500 stores, 50 more than our prior estimate. With Marshalls alone, we see the potential to grow this chain to about 100 stores.", "Marshalls\u2019 performance continues to be excellent. We believe that Marshalls\u2019 successful growth in Canada is due in large part to the knowledge and expertise we\u2019ve gained in operating that country for nearly 25 years.", "Overall in 2014, TJX Canada\u2019s adjusted segment profit excluding foreign currency was 13.5%. We are extremely proud of our success in this market.", "We also see enormous potential ahead for TJX Europe. For over two decades, we have built the European platform and organization that would be difficult to replicate. TJX Europe\u2019s adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency increased to 8.1% in 2014, another divisional record.", "Today, we are raising our long-term store growth potential estimates for TJX Europe to about 975 stores. This would be 100 more stores than our prior estimate and more than double our current store base. This primarily reflects the opportunity we see in two additional European countries.", "This spring, we are excited to expand into our seventh country, Austria, with our first floor opening plans for March, earlier than we originally planned.", "I\u2019m also happy to announce that we are planning to expand into our eighth country, the Netherlands, this year. We plan to open our first TK Maxx store in that country this fall. We have been analyzing the Netherlands for several years and are confident we understand the marketplace and the customer. This is why we decided to open this year, ahead of when we originally envisioned.", "Beyond 2015, we see vast opportunity to expand our business into additional European countries and around the world. We are convinced that our value proposition can resonate wherever consumers seek fashion and brands at great prices. We are leveraging our global presence as we grow and have decades of experience in building international teams and infrastructures. We see this as a major advantage as we continue to grow as a community of [ph] value retailer.", "Now to our next pillar, eCommerce expansion. While eCommerce overall represents just over 1% of our total sales today, we see it as an important driver of future growth. Our strategy with eCommerce is to grow smart and drive traffic both online and to our brick-and-mortar businesses.", "At tjmaxx.com, we made great progress in 2014. We are pleased to see the site attracting new customers and we are gaining incremental visits from our existing brick-and-mortar shoppers. A vast majority of our returns are going to our stores, which is a great way to introduce our online customers to our physical locations. In 2014, we added more than 1,700 brands at 11 departments including junior\u2019s, men\u2019s, jewelry and active wear.", "In 2015, we will keep adding brands and categories to the site. We just added home to tjmaxx.com and believe this category could be very strong online. We have additional categories planned for 2015 including plus sizes. Eventually, we can see rolling out eCommerce for all our retail brand.", "Our fourth growth pillar is innovation. I truly believe we are leaders in innovation and that this has been a major factor in our success over a 38-year history. We are always looking at new seeds for future growth.", "In 2014, we were delighted with the openings of our Sierra Trading Post stores in the Denver area. We are pleased with their above-plan performance. Customer response has been fantastic. We will continue to test what works best with this concept and in 2015, we are looking into opening a couple of northeast locations. Longer term, we would be thrilled to grow Sierra Trading Post as the fourth U.S. chain and eventually in Canada.", "As you can see, we\u2019ve been very busy developing growth initiatives and investing in our future.", "To support our short and long term goals, we will continue to reinvest in the business. We are in the fortunate position of having many of our initiatives working, which bodes well for the future. Our approach is to invest ahead of growth and lay a strong foundation today to position us well for the future.", "We don\u2019t cut cost in order for the short-term that could hurt us in the long-term. While simultaneously, we remain laser-focused on efficiencies. We are making important investments to strengthen our leadership position and set us up to become a $40 billion company and beyond.", "First, we were pleased to announce an important initiative on wages this morning detailed on our press release. These actions are part of our strategy to continue attracting and retaining top talent in order to deliver a great shopping experience for our customers and will allow us to remain competitive on wages.", "Second are our new stores and remodels. Third, we are investing in Europe. We are making key investments to both strengthen our brand loyalty in existing markets and capitalize on first mover advantage in new markets. The investments include opening Austria and the Netherlands sooner than we originally planned and analyzing new countries, systems and supply chain investments to support our accelerated store growth and our eCommerce platform and investing in talent to support our brick-and-mortar and online growth, including adding HomeSense stores.", "Fourth are our investments in eCommerce. We are working to get our infrastructure and people in place now in order to be in position to leverage them later. Marshalls will be our next chain to be offered online.", "Next, we are investing in new seeds that could grow into meaningful businesses for TJX. Lastly, we\u2019ll also continue to invest in our North American supply chain and distribution network.", "Now to our 2015 outlook which Scott will detail in a moment. I want to emphasize that our assumptions for comp growth remain unchanged from prior years. We have many initiatives underway to drive sales and are working very hard to surpass our goals. Further, our assumptions for merchandise margin increases remain consistent with prior years.", "That said, we are planning our earnings per share growth more conservatively this year. Our outlook primarily reflects the expected negative impact due to foreign currency similar to other major international retailers, as well as our investment in our associates.", "As to the long-term, we are reiterating our 10% to 13% annual EPS growth model. Because some of our underlying elements could change, we\u2019re not going to provide specific guidance on the components of the model. That said, we feel great about our business and I\u2019m very confident in our ability to achieve our long-term plans. Again, we have a management team very motivated to exceed our objectives.", "So summing up, we\u2019re extremely pleased to end 2014 with an excellent fourth quarter with sales and earnings exceeding our expectations. As to the start of the quarter, overall sales and traffic are both up. And in our warmer U.S. regions, sales and traffics are trending in line with Q4.", "Looking ahead, we see many opportunities in today\u2019s environment. We operate an amazingly flexible business model and an international diversified portfolio of businesses. We have many growth initiatives working well and many levers we can pull throughout our business to drive growth.", "I want to emphasize how importantly we view the investments we are making this year in our growth initiatives. As always, we are convinced that building the right infrastructure and organization today ahead of our growth will pay dividends in the near and long term. While there will always be macro factors at work in the short term, our underlying business remains very strong and we have great confidence in the combined success growth of this great company.", "And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to go through guidance and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol. Now to fiscal \u201916 guidance beginning with the full year. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 over $3.15 in fiscal \u201915. Excluding last year\u2019s debt extinguishment charge, fiscal \u201916 expected EPS would be 0% to 3% over the prior year\u2019s adjusted $3.16.", "To reiterate what Carol mentioned, we feel great about the business and there is no change to how we are planning our underlying business. Again, our assumptions for comp sales and merchandise margin increases remain consistent with prior years. However, we are planning earnings per share more conservatively this year to reflect the impact of the following factors.", "First, the most significant factor is currency exchange rates, which we expect to negatively impact fiscal \u201916 EPS growth by approximately 5% overall. Let me break this down.", "We\u2019re assuming that translational FX and the mark-to-market adjustment on our currency hedges will reduce EPS growth by approximately 3%. This is primarily the result of the dramatic decline in the Canadian dollar and the British pound rates versus last year. It\u2019s important to note that in the last six years, FX hasn\u2019t impacted our year-over-year EPS growth by more than $0.01. So we see this year as an outlier and, of course, FX rates could moderate or benefit us in the future.", "We\u2019re also anticipating that the impact of currency to our mark-on could hurt EPS growth by another 2%. This primarily affects merchandise margins at Canada, TJX Canada and TJX Europe, which buy a significant amount of inventory in U.S. dollars. Keep in mind, with our op price model, we enter hedges at about the same time we purchase inventory and a majority of our merchandise for the year still has not been bought.", "Therefore, the FX impact could change as we move through the year, as we enter into new hedges and currency rates fluctuate. Further, while difficult to completely eliminate, our guidance assumes that our management teams will work hard again this year to mitigate as much of the FX pressure as possible as they have been doing for the last several quarters.", "In addition to currency, we are assuming that our investments in our associates as well as other incremental investments and pension costs would have a combined negative impact of about 4% to fiscal \u201916 EPS growth. We are planning fiscal \u201916 prudently to reflect all of these factors. At the same time, we remain very focused on controlling cost and we\u2019ll work very hard to exceed our plans.", "Our EPS guidance assumes consolidated sales in the $29.8 billion to $30.2 billion range, a 3% to 4% increase over the prior year. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX.", "We\u2019re assuming a 1% to 2% comp increase on a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx, consistent with how we have planned the last several years. We expect pre-tax profit margin to be 11.6% to 11.8% range versus 12.2% in fiscal \u201915. Excluding last year\u2019s debt extinguishment charge, expected fiscal \u201916 pre-tax profit margins would be down 50 to 70 basis points versus the prior year\u2019s adjusted 12.3%.", "We\u2019re planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.4% to 28.5% which will be down 10 basis points to flat versus fiscal \u201915. Once again this year, we are planning for an increase in merchandise margins despite the FX pressure we\u2019re assuming.", "We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be approximately 16.6% versus 16.1% last year. This is primarily due to our wage initiative as well as our incremental investments.", "In fiscal \u201916, we plan to balance the use of cash between investing to support our growth and returning cash to shareholders. We\u2019re planning capital spending of approximately $975 million. We expect the Board of Directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 20% on top of the 21% increase last year.", "We\u2019re planning to buy back $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of TJX stock, $100 million to $200 million more than last year. Even with this level of shareholder distributions, we still plan to end fiscal \u201916 with $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in cash in short-term investments, which will provide significant financial flexibility.", "For modeling purposes, we\u2019re anticipating a tax rate of 37.6%, net interest expense of about $42 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 684 million.", "Now to Q1 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.66, a 0% to 3% increase over last year\u2019s $0.64 per share. Similar to the full year, this guidance also assumes the negative impact of several factors. These include a combined 4% from currency exchange rates. This includes 3% from transactional effects and the mark-to-market adjustment on our currency hedges and 1% from the impact of currency on mark-on.", "And we\u2019re assuming a total of 5% from our incremental investments employee payroll and pension cost. We\u2019re modeling first quarter consolidated sales in the $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion range.", "This guidance assumes a 3% negative impact of reported revenue due to translational FX. For comp stores, we\u2019re assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx versus a1% increase and flat comp last year respectively.", "First quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.6% to 10.8% range, down 50 to 70 basis points versus the prior year. We\u2019re anticipating first quarter growth profit margin to be in the range of 27.9% to 28.0%, flat to up 10 basis points versus the prior year. We are planning for an increase in merchandised margins in the first quarter.", "We\u2019re expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the 17.1% to 17.2% range versus 16.5% last year. For modeling purposes, we\u2019re anticipating a tax rate of 37.9%, which is slightly higher than the full year. We also expect net interest expense of about $11 million and a weighted average share count of approximately $691 million.", "It\u2019s important to remember our guidance for the first quarter and the full years assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the first quarter.", "A wrap up with our store growth plans for fiscal \u201916. As Carol mentioned, on a consolidated basis, we plan to net approximately 181 new stores for a total of about 3,576 by year end. This represents square-footage growth of approximately 5%.", "In the U.S., plenty of white space remains. And we plan to continue our aggressive growth of Marmaxx and HomeGoods. This year, our plans call for us to net 70 additional stores at Marmaxx and 40 more stores at HomeGoods. We also plan to open one additional Sierra Trading Post store this year.", "Internationally at TJX Canada, we plan to add 20 new stores. At TJX Europe, we expect to accelerate our pace of openings and add 50 stores this year, nine more than last year.", "Now we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we\u2019re going to continue to ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. Thanks. And we will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Stephen Grambling.", "Stephen Grambling", "Hey, good morning. Actually, a kind of a quick question on the long-term guidance in the reiteration of the 10% to 13%. Is that something where you feel like this year is a little bit depressed and then 2016 could be a little bit more outsized and so you end up kind in the same rate?", "And then also if you wouldn\u2019t mind kind of providing the components of this longer-term outlook and maybe if that\u2019s changed across sales margin and the segments.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. Steve, we\u2019re not going to give the exact model going forward. We see this year, as we said, foreign exchange currency. We\u2019ve given those numbers. Wages will have an impact next year and then we\u2019ll moderate from there on.", "Stephen Grambling", "Okay. Then maybe if I can sneak one other one in there. Just on the loyalty and rewards program, is there anything that you can provide on the details either as it relates to the percentage of sales that it currently represents your customers and maybe any difference in the frequency in cross shop that you\u2019re seeing.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I\u2019m not going to give you the specific numbers, but it is absolutely increasing across at cross shopping. And we are really, really pleased with what we\u2019re seeing just in general. Our marketing plans are terrific. And I think that\u2019s really driving customer traffic and will continue to.", "Stephen Grambling", "Okay. Thanks so much. Best of luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez", "Hey. Thanks, guys. Just given the port situations, I\u2019m just wondering when do you expect to see a pickup in availability of goods if in fact you do or perhaps you have already and is that built into your guidance? And then also, can you just confirm what percentage of your goods are sourced in U.S. dollars? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. First of all, in terms of the port, I can tell you as you know, chaos does tend to be our friend. I hate to say it. But we are seeing some things. Our pack-always are already up and we\u2019re not planning the business any different, but we are assuming that there\u2019ll probably be an increase in pack-aways and there\u2019ll probably be some pretty incredible deal. Ernie, do you --", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, I mean to your question, Paul, also an addition to pack-aways, there will be I think in the near-term some probably greater market opportunities for the current season than we normally would have had because of the ports.", "But like Carol said, there is always some dynamic going on out there. This time, it\u2019s the ports. So next time, it will be something else. So yes, this does create additional opportunities to your question and availability.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I can tell you we\u2019re staying very liquid. So Paul -- oh no, it\u2019s muted. Can you hear me?", "Paul Lejuez", "Yes.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. I was just going to say, I can tell you we\u2019re staying extremely liquid in the anticipation.", "Paul Lejuez", "But is it factored into your guidance that you will see those great deals and perhaps --", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, we don\u2019t. No, we don\u2019t factor any of that. And we planned our margins the way we typically plan on margins, which are planned up. Not anything unusual, no.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And Paul, to answer your question. Canada buys approximately 50% of their purchases in U.S. dollars. And Europe buys approximately 25% of their purchases in U.S. dollars.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Now they\u2019ll work hard to mitigate that, obviously buying as much out of Canada as they possibly can and that of Europe. But there\u2019s a reality that they do buy approximately 50%. But the guys are working pretty hard.", "Paul Lejuez", "Great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Great. Thanks. Carol, I\u2019m wondering if you can expand on the sequentially improving traffic you saw in 2014. Obviously, we\u2019re not hearing many retailers with positive traffic trends. Was there a change in your marketing strategy? Were there other contributing factors that you think sort of hit an inflection that drove that improvement?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, I think our brand awareness is really increasing. And we work very, very hard to make our stores more shoppable. Obviously, we love our mix. And I will tell you we\u2019re excited we\u2019re seeing lady sportswear really improving and business is pretty good in the apparel areas in women which is a great sign.", "So I think we\u2019re doing all the right things. Regionally, they nailed it. They shipped fresh flow. They put it in the right areas. The marketing is very strong. We\u2019re getting very, very high scores on our marketing.", "So I think all of the factors that we have been talking about just continue to come to fruition. We\u2019re excited.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Okay, great. Can I just follow up on one thing with Scott? I assume that the pressure you spoke about on foreign currency will be sort of exclusive to Canada and Europe. But I\u2019m wondering if you could help us understand magnitude of operating or segment margin impacts that we should factor into our model for 2015 on either or both of these divisions.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Why don\u2019t you break down the year for each division, Scott?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. So again, Kimberly, to your question, I\u2019ll be talking about the full year guidance for the four different divisions. Marmaxx, we\u2019re planning a 1% to 2% comp. The guidance is 14.2 to 14.4, so down 40 to down 20, with the sales at $19.4 to $19.6 billion.", "HomeGoods, as planned, a 2% to 3% comp, 13.2 to 13.4, 40 to 20 basis points down on $3.7 billion in sales.", "Canada is 1% to 2% comp. And the Europe and Canada I\u2019m going to deal with the ex-FX. So 11.3% to 11.5%. So they were down 200 basis points in the high-end and that is primarily due to the impact of currency on the mark-on. And that\u2019s on $2.7 billion. Europe, 3% to 4%; 7.9% to 8.1% again ex-FX on $4.1 billion.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Boss.", "Matthew Boss", "Good morning. On the gross margin side, can you guys talk about some of the drivers of the underlying merchandise margin expansion, particularly, any concept outliers and just some of the opportunities on a go-forward basis?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, I\u2019m not really sure what -- you\u2019re asking specifically on the merchandise margin? I mean, I think what we do is obviously we\u2019re going after the best value we possibly can. And that includes keeping open to buy, putting it in the right categories, taking it so advanced into the market. I mean, we\u2019re kind of doing business as usual but there\u2019s a ton that goes out there.", "And even with the port situation, we don\u2019t seem to be having a problem finding great value. Other than that, I\u2019m not sure how else to answer that.", "Matthew Boss", "Great. And then on the new Marshalls prototype, can you talk about some of the learnings? I actually walked one up in Boston and I thought it looked great. But just kind of any other learnings in customer reception so far.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, the customers love it. That\u2019s obviously why we\u2019re rolling it out. I\u2019m not going to say specifics due to competitive reasons. But we\u2019ve done a lot of analysis on what drives the customer and makes them happier within our store, along with really our employees because we want them to be able to maneuver and be comfortable in the store.", "So it\u2019s like a combination. We ask the stores themselves what works and our customers. And then we come up with the best prototype we can. So taking all of that into consideration, we love the new prototype.", "Ernie Herrman", "And Matthew, we really start with just a couple and we fine-tune the first couple physically and operationally and we don\u2019t begin rolling out the new prototype until we\u2019re happy with the customer surveys we get on that as well as the associate surveys, as Carol mentioned.", "Matthew Boss", "Great. First one was good [ph]. Best of luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you. That\u2019s good.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Omar Saad.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks. Great quarter, guys.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Omar Saad", "I wanted to ask about a high level question on the buying organization. I think you mentioned you\u2019re over 1,000 people at this point. You kind of keep adding --", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We are.", "Omar Saad", "You keep adding -- you keep raising your store targets in Europe and you\u2019re adding Netherlands and the growth curve seems to be keeping extending out further. How should we think about the buying organization long-term, how it scales? Does it delever when you first go into new regions or new -- or you\u2019re expanding new concepts and then it scales over time or is it one for one if you were to double the size of the business, you didn\u2019t need to double the size of the buying organization, just philosophically, how do you think about the ability or inability to scale that? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, I\u2019m going to comment and then I\u2019m going to throw it over to Ernie. First of all, in Europe, we\u2019ve done some restructuring so that we really are being set up for leveraging. So it\u2019s not one for one. I think we\u2019re at a place -- for example, next year, probably the investment in the infrastructure in Europe will be a little bit less. However, we will be adding heads but not at the pace.", "We have added a number of people in Canada to set ourselves up for Marshalls. And again, at this point, we should start leveraging because we don\u2019t need to add as many heads. As we go into each country, it\u2019s not one for one again. If we go into a new country and we find that we need to expand the vendor structure, you might add a buyer here and there. But that\u2019s really how we looked at it.", "This year was a pretty big year for expansion to set ourselves up. But we love the foundation we have in Europe. And I think they have really done a great job of looking at what the total European market needs to look like. Ernie?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. And I think it\u2019s a little different by country. So domestically here, if you look at Marmaxx and HomeGoods, as much as we talk about Europe\u2019s expansion, we\u2019ve been growing very healthy -- at healthy paces here as well. So we\u2019ve added merchants even domestically. But clearly, we do it at a leveraging rate.", "So we\u2019re always leveraging. We don\u2019t add at the rate of our top line growth. We are flexible based on opportunities and trends. If we look at categories that are trending, we tend to look to buyers to cover that. But again, we\u2019re very surgical.", "And if you go to Canada, when we added another brand, we\u2019d look at more buyers there but at a very much different rate than just adding to the rate of the business, the new stores and the growth. So it leverages very dramatically.", "But it is the lifeblood organization for this company. So we are very proactive as we\u2019ve talked before in our training of that organization. And it\u2019s not just about the numbers, it\u2019s about the quality of the merchants that we put in place. So I guess that\u2019s one reason we feel like we\u2019re pretty efficient with that group.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "And Omar, same thing with our online business. So we\u2019re excited about getting Marshalls will be our next brand because we can leverage the buying organization which is a separate organization from Marmaxx. But you have tjmaxx.com, when you add on Marshalls, you don\u2019t have to double the number of buyers. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re excited. As that volume increases, we\u2019re not going to have to add quite as many people.", "Omar Saad", "Thank you. Nice job.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Jaffe.", "Richard Jaffe", "Thanks very much, guys, and great quarter and exciting outlook. A couple of small points. If you could just comment on the eCommerce business and how you\u2019re seeing returns coming into your stores, if you could give us a percentage of that, and then commenting about the timeliness of your inventory today and the open-to-buy situation looking into 1Q. Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. Well, the majority -- first of all, we\u2019re very happy T.J.Maxx -- and Ernie\u2019s going to talk to some of those categories and things that are going on there but we\u2019re getting pretty excited about it and we love the differentiation. Very high percentage of the returns are coming back to the stores, very high percentage. So we\u2019re excited about that.", "We\u2019re not going to give you the specifics on new customers but we are bringing in new customers. And what we did towards the end of this year is we started really integrating tjmaxx.com within our stores so there\u2019s much, much more awareness.", "So we\u2019re feeling pretty good. And again, the returns are coming back which is great, what you want to see. It\u2019s also the people who are returning. There\u2019s more brand awareness. So there is shopping the other brands and awareness of that. Ernie?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, Richard, I think an answer to your question I think on the timing, we\u2019re buying pretty handsome out there relative to I think an eComm business. If you go on the site, I think you\u2019ll feel that in terms of the nature and seasonality of the merchandise. We\u2019re launching categories that Carol mentioned in the initial run-through that Home has launched, and that was pretty recent.", "Again, we\u2019re happy with the way that is going. Plus side is that in the near future, Pet is something that we\u2019ve carried in a decent way in HomeGoods. That will be online in the near future. As we put in these new categories, you\u2019ll see that the timeliness of the goods is right in sync with our stores. It\u2019s just not the exact same goods as the stores. It varies. Sometimes it would be, most of the time it isn\u2019t.", "But we\u2019re feeling good about -- we\u2019re trying to bring that op price model to the eComm, tjmaxx.com\u2019s site.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, this was the open-to-buy -- going forward, just in general, we\u2019re as lean as we always are or available for any opportunity out there. And we do believe that there\u2019ll probably be a higher pack-away opportunity this year. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it.", "Richard Jaffe", "Yes, I know. It seems like the pipeline is very full and the opportunities should be tremendous for you guys, so good to hear. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Roxanne Meyer.", "Roxanne Meyer", "Great, thank you and congratulations on a terrific quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks.", "Roxanne Meyer", "My question is around the investments and pension cost that you mentioned that are going to weigh on this year\u2019s earnings by 4%. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us the bigger buckets of those investments and just talk about what is it that\u2019s driving your pension cost up. And knowing that you guys are still methodical in terms of how you execute, I\u2019m just wondering if we should expect these to be multiyear cost that could weigh on your cost profile. Thanks a lot.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So, okay, I\u2019m going to talk to the investments. The share investments in the business is somewhere probably between 1% and 2%. Going forward, it may be less than that. The pension cost, I\u2019m going to have Scott break down the pension cost and then wages.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. So on the pension cost, similar to we\u2019re in that low interest rate environment and the pension get at one point in the year you have the interest rate gets set. It was at in the historically low rate from a pension cost. It moves, so it\u2019s already moved up, but you have to set it up, you have to set it that one time.", "Also, mortality tables as you\u2019ve probably read with other retailers and asset [ph], have been reset. So it\u2019s probably more -- the majority is due to the interest rates. And there is this portion due to the mortality tables.", "But again, some of the FX rates they could fluctuate and be a positive for next year. We\u2019re extremely well-funded. And our rates of return have been good. So again, I think the big wild card is going forward and could be favorable is the interest rates.", "In terms of the 4%, the largest component of that is the investment in associates. And it\u2019s more than half of the 4%.", "Roxanne Meyer", "And just a follow up, is this -- obviously, you\u2019re going to have some incremental cost next year as you continue to bump up the hourly rate. But aside from that, should we expect some of these others costs to continue going forward?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, as I said, I think pension, I would be disappointed if it continues to be as negative as it was this year. And as far as other costs, they\u2019ll moderate. So the wages will continue through next year and then it should moderate after that.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. In terms of the bigger portion, the 5% we talked about on the currency translation mark-to-market, at this point we\u2019d be assuming currency rates would remain the same as they are now. If that would be the case and we have not bought any goods for next year and we would assume there\u2019d be no impact essentially for both the translation mark-to-market and the impact on our currency.", "So that 5% is more to due to just the way we forecast and consistently have done that.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Right. Obviously, we have never had that kind of impact in the history of our business. So we do not think that that will be a negative factor going forward. At least, we\u2019re not assuming.", "Scott Goldenberg", "That\u2019s correct.", "Roxanne Meyer", "Got you. Okay. Well, thanks and best of luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Baker.", "Mike Baker", "Hi. Thanks, guys. I have two questions I wanted to ask. But the first is just on the competitive environment. And you guys are doing so well. Everyone else wants to get into this business. So how do you think about that? Do you think the off price market in general grows the share of total apparel or there\u2019s more competitors going after the same size market for off price? And by the way, do you guys ever quantify what you think the size of the off price market is? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, I can say to you is that we always try to get the bigger piece of the pie. And we work very hard to keep improving our business every year. And it\u2019s not so easy to just get into the off price business.", "Again, with a thousand buyers and making sure every day you\u2019re throwing really fantastic special presents, it\u2019s not the easiest thing in the world. We are very underpenetrated in the United States versus department stores. So we think we\u2019ve got a long way to go.", "And obviously international, we are the first out there. There\u2019s no other off prices out there. And we have built a very strong foundation and we\u2019re going to continue doing that and expanding. And we spent a lot of time going to a new country. And we spent two to three years really analyzing it to understand what the right mix is. We learned that a long time ago.", "So we look at everybody as a competitor. And as far as we\u2019re concerned, we just want to give great value every day and do what we do best and keep doing it better. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ll get a bigger piece of the pie.", "Mike Baker", "So striving for bigger piece of the pie and it sounds like you think the pie might get bigger as the off price takes share from departments stores. And also, just a quick question. You said that in warm weather markets, you\u2019re in line with the fourth quarter. I\u2019m up here in Boston like you guys. There\u2019s snow everywhere. I mean, is that kind of weather [ph] --", "Carol Meyrowitz", "[Indiscernible].", "Mike Baker", "I guess, what kind of impact is that having and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but March and April are much bigger months than February in the first quarter, I assume, is that right?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. And there\u2019s an early Easter. And our overall traffic is up. And where weather is good as I said, our trends are pretty similar to the fourth quarter.", "Mike Baker", "Okay. Thanks. Good to know.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin.", "Daniel Hofkin", "Good morning. Great quarter. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. One, you discussed that traffic was -- almost all of the comp increased. But I think you indicated that units per transactions were also up. Was the average unit retail down to some degree? And I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the pricing environment. That\u2019s my first question. Then I have one quick follow up.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Our average retail predominantly in Marmaxx was slightly down, yes. And units were up. Again, we are really focused on delivering great value. But having said that, our margins are up.", "Daniel Hofkin", "Is that more your own pricing initiatives or is that the overall pricing umbrella that is? And you\u2019re just kind of moving and step with it?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "But we need to really view them relative [ph] for our business.", "Daniel Hofkin", "Okay. And then just maybe just a more thematic overall picture about retail or just curious what you think is happening in terms of labor cost in general. We\u2019ve obviously -- you being one of a number of major retailers that have announced wage increases. Is something changing in terms of the amount of slack [ph] in the labor market from your perspective? Just any perspective would be helpful there.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Again, I keep coming back to we\u2019re on this mission to really improve and be the best brand out there. And the customer experience, every year that our customer surveys come back that they love the in-store experience which is really our associates who are driving that, we think it\u2019s absolutely imperative that we keep pace and that we have the best talent.", "We have very low turnover. We definitely employ a choice. But as everything else, we want to be ahead of it. We want to keep the best of the best and we want to be able to bring the best of the best in. So whether it\u2019s our stores, whether it\u2019s our merchants, whether it\u2019s home office, that\u2019s our goal. So we\u2019re doing what we think is best for our associates and our customers.", "Daniel Hofkin", "Okay. If I could just clarify the three-year EPS growth. I know you answered the question earlier. I just want to make sure that when you talk about that as kind of 13% relative to let\u2019s say, I think, your 2013 analyst day, if that inclusive of the I guess 0% to 3% EPS guidance that you have in place for this year, that it\u2019s not in adjusted kind of 13%. I just want to make sure we\u2019re understanding that properly.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, it\u2019s not -- this year, it\u2019s not a long-term growth plan. And I already said a lot that this is going to get mitigated on its own. And we certainly think the initiatives that we\u2019re dealing are the right things to drive our business. So we\u2019re feeling very good about our business.", "Daniel Hofkin", "Okay. That\u2019s very clear. All right, thanks very much.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we do have time for one final question. Our next question is from Howard Tubin.", "Howard Tubin", "Oh, thanks, guys. Just a great quarter. And just a quick question on your regional merchandising efforts and strategies, Carol, can you go to any more detail on that? And what kind of opportunity do you see going forward from these regional type strategies?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Of course not. Look, that was the way to answer that. Honestly, we were very disappointed in our fourth quarter a year ago. And we learned a lot from that. Our margins were down. And we said we evaluated everything that we thought was the right thing to do. And I think the guys did a spectacular job this year. And I think they see even more things that they\u2019re going to go after next year.", "So I really don\u2019t want to go into the individual strategies. But as many years ago in Europe, we learned whenever we have a tough situation, we go in, we dig in, and we fix it and we learn a lot from it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s important.", "Howard Tubin", "All right. Great. Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you. And we look forward to reporting our first quarter here up in Boston. And we\u2019re hoping for a little meltdown. Thank you.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for today.

Welcome to The TJX Companies First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to congratulate Deb McDonald (sic) [Deb McConnell], our Senior Vice President of Global Communications on her recent birth of her son. As Deb is on maternity leave, Doreen Thompson will start us off with some opening comments.", "Doreen Thompson - Vice President-Corporate Communications", "Thank you, Carol, and good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially.

Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website, tjx.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today's press release or otherwise posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investor Information section. Thank you.", "And now, I'll turn it back over to Carol.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Doreen. Joining me and Doreen on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg. So let me begin by saying that I'm extremely pleased with our continued momentum and first quarter performance. Our terrific merchandise mix and great values are resonating with our consumers across all of our geographies.", "Earnings per share increased 8% above last year and well exceeded our plan. Consolidated comp store sales grew 5%, also well above our expectation. This marks our 25th consecutive quarter of consolidated comp store sales growth. It was great to see that similar to last quarter, the comp was almost entirely driven by customer traffic and we had a strong increase in units sold. We were also pleased to see a strong increase in our merchandise margins.", "Importantly, we achieved these results despite significant foreign currency headwinds and while simultaneously investing in our business to support our future growth. Our underlying business is very strong and I am confident that our momentum will continue.", "We enter the second quarter in excellent shape. Our values are better than ever and accolades for our in-store experience, which keeps improving. We attribute this in part to our motivated store associate base. We have many initiatives planned this year to drive traffic and keep our momentum going.", "With our above first quarter performance, we're raising our full year earnings per share and comp store sales guidance. Further, we are expecting to surpass $30 billion in sales this year. The second quarter is off to a very strong start and as always, our management team is passionate and striving to surpass our goal. We remain confident in the magnitude of our long-term global growth opportunities and that we have the right growth strategies in place to become a $40 billion plus global value retailer.", "So before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our first quarter numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 5%, well above our plan. As a reminder, our comp sales exclude e-commerce. We were very pleased that our comp was almost entirely driven by customer traffic and that that traffic was up significantly at each of our divisions. As Carol mentioned, it was also great to see a strong increase in our units sold.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.69, an 8% increase over last year's $0.64, and also well above our plan. As we expected and detailed on our fourth quarter call, our first quarter EPS growth was negatively impacted by about 9% due to the combination of foreign currency, transactional foreign exchange, incremental investments, employee payroll and pension costs.", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 11.1%, down 20 basis points versus the prior year, and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 28.3%, up 40 basis points versus last year, primarily due to strong merchandise margin improvement, to a lesser extent buying and occupancy leverage on the 5% comp. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.0%, up 50 basis points versus last year's ratio primarily due to higher payroll cost, our incremental investments and pension cost as we had anticipated. At the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were up 4% on a constant currency basis versus a 1% decline last year.", "In terms of share repurchases, during the first quarter, we bought back $415 million of TJX stock, retiring 6.1 million shares. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of TJX stock this year. In addition, we increased the per share dividend by 20% in March, marking the 19th consecutive year of dividend increases.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Carol and I'll recap our second quarter and full year guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Scott. I'll cover our growth strategy and key strengths in a moment. But before that, I want to share some additional color on our first quarter performance by division. In the U.S., Marmaxx comps increased 3%. Similar to last quarter, comps were entirely driven by customer traffic. Segment profit margin was down 20 basis points. As a reminder, margins were negatively impacted by an increase in employee payroll and pension costs, which we laid out on our year-end call.", "Also during the quarter, we strategically brought our average ticket down in order to bring our customers even more amazing values. This led to additional supply chain cost as we had more items flowing through our distribution network. We were very pleased with the results as we saw a significant increase in units sold and a strong increase in Marmaxx's merchandise margins. During the quarter, we did a great job of delivering the right merchandise to the right stores at the right time. Marmaxx's apparel business performed well in the first quarter, and our missy sportswear and junior businesses were very strong, which we think bodes very well for the future.", "Further, home continued its excellent performance. We have many merchandise and marketing initiatives planned to continue driving sales and traffic as we focus on both our existing customers and reaching new ones. While T.J. Maxx and Marshalls are already nationally established brands, we believe we have significant market share to gain and are thrilled to see our retail brands becoming even more powerful and recognizable.", "HomeGoods delivered another outstanding quarter. Comps were up 9% and segment profit margin increased 80 basis points. Customer response to our eclectic mix of home fashions from around the world continues to be terrific. HomeGoods just opened its 500th store and we could not be more excited about the long-term potential of this chain and the opening of its next 500 stores.", "Moving to our International divisions, TJX Canada delivered an excellent quarter. Comps increased 11% and adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was up 160 basis points. I want to point out that profit margin would have been even better without the significant negative impact that the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar continued to have on this division's merchandise margins.", "However, we were very pleased that TJX Canada was able to mitigate this negative currency impact more than we had planned through focused efforts across the organization. We saw great performance across all our Canadian chains as our values continue to resonate with our shoppers. I just got back from Canada a few weeks ago and I can see why customers love us there.", "TJX Europe's comps were up 3% over a very strong 8% increase last year. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was down 120 basis points. It's important to remember that Europe's result includes the impact of several of our investment initiatives, specifically costs associated with centralizing support areas of our business as well as building out our infrastructure in order to leverage the organization and support our European growth plans. Margins were also negatively affected \u2013 impacted by transactional FX.", "During the first quarter, we successfully opened our first two stores in Austria. We are delighted to now be offering our amazing values to shoppers in five European countries and expect to enter our sixth country, the Netherlands, sometime this fall.", "As to e-commerce, we are very pleased with the performance of tjmaxx.com. Our customers are loving our new home and plus size categories. At Sierra Trading Post, we are working to slightly accelerate their store growth. We now expect to open two new stores this year, one more than originally planned. This includes plans to open our first Northeast location.", "Now, I want to recap our four pillars for growth, which we believe will drive profitable sales for many years to come. Starting with driving customer traffic and comp sales. We see meaningful opportunities to gain market share and are actively pursuing new customers in all our geographics. We are convinced the power of our retail brands will help us get a bigger piece of the pie regardless of how big that pie is. We are leveraging our global marketing capabilities and taking a multi-layered approach to reach even more consumers through our television, radio and digital media advertising. Among our new customers, we are continuing to attract a higher percentage of millennial shoppers, which bodes well for the future.", "We are growing our loyalty programs in the U.S., Canada and U.K. to drive more frequent customer visits and encourage more cross-shopping across our chains. As always, we are working to make our stores better every day and we are on track with our store remodels. We are thrilled that our numerous in-store initiatives are making our stores a must-shop destination for both younger and older customers, and believe our marketing efforts will continue to make our retail brands more top of mind. Our goal is to keep raising the bar and the overall customer shopping experience.", "Our second pillar is our enormous brick-and-mortar global growth potential. With over 3,400 stores today, we see the opportunity to grow to 5,475 stores long-term with just our existing chains in our existing countries and the Netherlands. This would be more than 2,000 additional stores or almost 60% growth over our current base.", "In North America, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for store growth. We see the long-term potential to add over 1,500 new stores on top of our nearly 3,000 stores today. This does not even include the potential of rolling out Sierra Trading Post as the fourth U.S. chain. Our decades of operating experience and knowledge in both the U.S. and Canada underscore our confidence in our future store growth plans.", "In Europe, we remain the only major off-price brick-and-mortar retailer and still see enormous store growth opportunities. We believe TJX Europe has the potential to more than double its current store base long-term. This only includes the growth of our current chains and our current countries and the Netherlands. Beyond these markets, we believe our business model can work in any country where consumers love great fashion and brand at amazing values.", "Our next pillar is e-commerce expansion. We see online as an important driver of future growth and another way to reach additional shoppers with our value. We are adding categories and expanding our brand offerings on each of our e-commerce site, and have much more planned ahead. We continue to invest in our online infrastructure and talent. As you've heard me say before, our approach is to grow smart so that online sales are incremental, not at the expense of our brick-and-mortar business. Eventually, we plan to roll out e-commerce for all of our retail plans. Our goal is to be there for the customer whenever and wherever they want to shop us.", "Our fourth pillar is innovation. We see ourselves as leaders in innovation, always driving to move forward and improve our value proposition for our customers every day. We are never complacent, and we are always testing ideas and new seeds that could fuel growth for the future. Across our divisions, we see many of our new merchandize initiatives helping to drive comp store sales growth. And we plan to keep surprising our customers with unexpected categories when they come to shop.", "We are also very excited about some of our new marketing initiatives. We constantly analyze our marketing efforts, learn from what we've done and innovate so our programs can grow stronger every year. We are confident that our focus on innovation is what will drive our business now and in the future. Today, our retail brands are truly household names and we believe they are becoming more top of mind for consumers in the U.S., Canada and Europe.", "To support our growth goals, we are reinvesting in the business. We continue to invest in new stores, store remodels, e-commerce, our supply chain, distribution network, as well as our home offices. Or course, investing in talent and training for our almost 200,000 associates remains a top priority. Our approach is to invest ahead of our growth and lay a strong foundation to position us well for the future.", "Next, I want to spend a moment reiterating the major reasons we are confident in achieving our growth goals. Among them are the key strengths that we believe differentiate TJX from most other major retailers. First, our size and scale around the world allow us to leverage our global presence. On top of our nearly four decades of off-price experience in the U.S., we've been operating in Canada for 25 years and in Europe for 20 years. Over this time, we have built powerful retail brands and refined a global supply chain and distribution network that we believe would be difficult for others to replicate.", "Our world-class teams across all of our divisions having no walls approach to communication, and are constantly sharing ideas, talent and initiatives so we can function as one TJX. As we continue to grow and expand into new countries, we believe we will have even more opportunities to leverage our global presence across the company.", "Second, we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine and believe our off-price buying knowledge and expertise is second to none. Our 1,000 plus person buying organization is positioned in 10 countries around the globe, sourcing from a universe of over 17,000 vendors in more than 100 countries. Our merchants are always looking to leverage our relationships to bring the best brands and the newest apparel and home fashion to all of our chains across all of our geographies.", "Third, we are one of the most flexible retailers in the world. Our flexible store format allows us to quickly react to changing market trends and consumer taste. And next, we believe we have one of the widest demographic reaches in retail. For example, our stores attract shoppers with an extremely large range of household incomes.", "Above all, we are convinced that our commitment to value, the core of our company since day one will keep driving shoppers to our stores. We have built these strengths through decades of global operating experience and knowledge. We are convinced that these elements of our business are becoming even more powerful and positioned us extremely well for the future.", "So, in summing up, we are extremely pleased to start the year with great momentum and above plan results. The second quarter is off to a very strong start. We are confident in our raised full year EPS comp guidance and we have a management team passionate about striving to surpass our goals.", "While there may be macro factors such as foreign currency negatively impacting results in the short-term, our underlying business remains strong. I am confident that we will keep our momentum going with our many initiatives to drive traffic, our amazing values and our eclectic mix of apparel and home fashions from around the world.", "Our four growth pillars and our key strengths underscore our confidence that we will continue to profitably grow for many years. We are convinced we are making the right short-term, medium and long-term investments to position us to take advantage of the vast global growth opportunities we see. Additionally, we believe our investment in associates will allow us to attract and retain top talent which will further enhance the customer shopping experience.", "And lastly, we see ourselves as an off-price powerhouse with powerful retail brands and over 3,400 stores in seven countries. We have developed talent, built a global organization and created an infrastructure to support our off-price business model that would take decades for other retailers to replicate. Most importantly, we have been laser-focused on off-price and offering consumers value for over 38 years.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Carol. Now, to fiscal 2016 guidance, beginning with the full year. As we stated in our press release today, we are raising our full year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect our strong first quarter results. We now expect fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.21 to $3.27, over $3.15 in fiscal 2015. Excluding last year's debt extinguishment charge, fiscal 2016 expected EPS would be up 2% to 3% over the prior year's adjusted $3.16.", "As a reminder, we are planning earnings per share growth more conservatively this year to reflect the impact of several factors. These include foreign currency, transactional foreign exchange, investments in our associates, incremental investments to support our growth and pension costs. Combined, we are assuming these items will have a negative impact of about 8% to our fiscal 2016 EPS growth. We are also increasing our full year comp store sales guidance. We now expect a comp increase of 2% to 3% on a consolidated basis and a comp increase of 2% at Marmaxx.", "We continue to expect pre-tax profit margin to be in the 11.6% to 11.8% range versus 12.2% in fiscal 2015. Excluding last year's debt extinguishment charge, expected fiscal 2016 pre-tax profit margins would be down 50 basis points to 70 basis points versus the prior year's adjusted 12.3%.", "We continue to look for gross margin \u2013 gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.4% to 28.5%, which would be flat to down 10 basis points versus fiscal 2015. We are planning for an increase in merchandise margins despite the foreign currency pressure we're assuming. We continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be approximately 16.6% versus 16.1% last year. Again, this is primarily due to our wage initiative, as well as our incremental investments.", "Moving to the second quarter, as our original guidance contemplated, we expect that Q2 could be the most challenging for EPS growth. This is due to the currency, wage, investment and pension items we referenced in the press release, as well as a favorable adjustment that benefited us last year and the timing of some expenses. I want to emphasize that our outlook for the business remains unchanged and that all of our divisions are very strong. We are a management team that works extremely hard to surpass our goals.", "Now, to Q2 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.74 over last year's $0.73 per share. Excluding last year's debt extinguishment charge, Q2 expected EPS would be down 1% to 4% versus the prior year's adjusted $0.75. Similar to the full year, this guidance also assumes the impact of several factors. These include an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 9% combined from foreign currency, transactional foreign exchange, investment in associates, incremental investments and pension costs.", "We're modeling second quarter consolidated sales in the $7.1 billion to $7.2 billion range. This guidance assumes a 3% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Second quarter pre-tax profit margin is planned to be in the 11.2% to 11.4% range, down 90 basis points to 110 basis points versus the prior year's adjusted 12.3%.", "We're anticipating second quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.5% to 28.6%. This would be flat to down 10 basis points versus the prior year, and assumes continued foreign currency pressure and additional supply chain cost. Despite these factors, we are planning for merchandise margins to be slightly up. We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the 17.1% to 17.2% range, versus 16.2% last year.", "For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.0% and net interest expense of about $12 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 686 million.", "Before I finish, I would like to take a moment to discuss our implied back half guidance. We expect EPS to be in the range of $1.81 to $1.85, which would be a 2% to 5% increase over last year's $1.77. We expect currency exchange rates, investments in our associates, incremental investments to support our growth and pension costs to negatively impact EPS growth by approximately 8%. This guidance is based on consolidated comp store sales growth of 1% to 2%. It's important to remember our guidance for the second quarter back half and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the second quarter.", "Now, we are happy to take your questions. To keep this call on schedule, we're going to ask you please limit your questions to one per person. Thanks.", "And now, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Mr. Oliver Chen. Sir, your line is open.", "Courtney Willson - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. This is Courtney in for Oliver today. We're just wondering as you look forward to back-to-school and fall, are you planning anything differently versus last year in terms of inventory planning or merchandising?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, Courtney, we always have a lot of initiatives in place, but we intend to continue to offer incredible value and we had some great marketing initiatives going forward. So, we are pretty excited about going forward with the business.", "Courtney Willson - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. And just one more, if you could comment on how the West Coast port situation has impacted the business? Thanks.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well, our packaways are up. There's plenty of goods out there.", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. We've had, Courtney, plenty of availability of exciting brands and buys. It's hard to pinpoint necessarily whether it was due to the port or not. We have to believe that some of it was. So overall, we would say that the market has had a lot of exciting deals for us to take advantage of.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I would comment that as always, we are trying to keep everybody home and back a little bit because there is a ton of goods out there.", "Courtney Willson - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks, guys, and congratulations.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Omar Saad. Sir, your line is open.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thank you. Great quarter. Congratulations.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "We noticed you guys are doing some more marketing commercials around the dotcom \u2013 the e-commerce business. Can you talk about some of the early signs of the efficacy there? How you think about that as part of your marketing plan going forward? Is it really targeted towards the e-commerce piece or do you think there's a halo there for the whole tjmaxx.com platform? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Omar, we look at everything in total brand. So the combination of tjmaxx.com and T.J. Maxx together is the way we look at it. Obviously, we're trying to leverage as much as we can. We're advertising a little bit more heavily like you'll see in-store, but we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing. And again, I have to reiterate that our online business is a continuation of different SKUs and excitement to the consumer. So I don't believe \u2013 and from what we see initially, we'll have cannibalization. So we're pretty excited about the business in totality. But more importantly, it's about building our brand and we're bringing in younger customers. So, we're pretty excited about it.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then, as you think about this accelerated comp you've enjoyed the last couple of quarters, other purveyors of soft goods in the U.S. especially are experiencing a lot of weakness recently. I'm trying to understand is there a linkage inverse correlation in terms of product availability, some of the department stores are having some struggles. Are you guys benefiting from that or is it really just uncorrelated, do you think, with the performance of the industry and it's just secular outperformance by your formats?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I...", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "...formats?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "What I would say, first of all, our apparel business and our home business is strong really across the board. So I think some of the things that \u2013 it always comes back to execution for us. So, for example, our junior business, we had said was a bit tough and I think Ernie and his team did a lot to fix the business. So it's very, very strong. We have a lot of initiatives. So I believe it's execution. Ernie, you want to...", "Ernie L. Herrman - President", "Yeah. I would say, Omar, the \u2013 well, first of all, back on the other question where there's been quite a few \u2013 the availability of goods in the market has been significant. Some of that could be a ramification of business around the environment not being as strong. I would say secondly, we've just kind of gone with the playbook, like Carol said, like we normally do. We've had good liquidity, good open to buy, and you have a lot of availability. So, we have to believe that type of execution has just allowed us to drive the sales and as we always say, to drive our sales \u2013 we try to beat our sales plan. So, to drive our sales above the plan is always our goal.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I honestly think we have outrageous value and that's what I'm the most excited about.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks, Ernie. Thanks, Carol.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Boss. Sir, your line is open.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Great quarter. Great, greater quarter, guys.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "On the competitive front, a lot was made about the incoming domestic entrant. Can you guys talk about how your store is overlapping with Primark and some of the fast fashion players globally actually perform today? And any thoughts on department store peers looking to accelerate into the off-price space?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, I've said it many times, we love being next to Primark and fast fashion because it really just drives the traffic along with the other off-pricers. So it just creates a Mecca for us. I don't usually comment on the competition, but I will comment that I think we built the machine over 38 years and we're pretty proud of it. And I think we have tremendous growth ahead of us. So I don't look at it as \u2013 I don't worry about who were near. I'm happy that anybody brings traffic, we're very happy.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. That's a good game plan. So you raised your comps forecast to 2% to 3% from 1% to 2%. Can you just elaborate a little where you're seeing increased confidence by division? And any color on performance as the quarter progress, I think, would be really helpful if possible.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So it's across the board. So we raised the comps and it includes all divisions. And as far as the February, March, April, obviously, March being the strongest, which was typical. But again, we were strong across all areas in the country, all geographies and all three months were pretty strong.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Wow! Congrats on a nice quarter.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ms. Kimberly Greenberger. Ma'am, your line is open.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you. Really terrific start to the year, Carol. And I'm wondering \u2013 I'm looking at the inventory numbers, it looks like total inventory was up 9% here at the end of the first quarter. Burt if you exclude in-transit and e-com on a reported basis, I think you said, up 2%. Is that seven-point spread largely in in-transit and is there \u2013 obviously, that would suggest a lot of fresh goods flowing in, if that's the right conclusion there. And I'm wondering if you're seeing any particular incremental favorability year-over-year from any of the sources?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, first of all, as I said before, there's a ton of goods out there. We have new stores. We had packaway. Our average ticket is down because we want to offer outrageous value and we're buying to the trends of the business. So it's all of those elements. And I think, Ernie and the guys are just, again, trying to hold back because there are great \u2013 across the board, there's a lot of goods out there and a lot of great brands.", "Ernie L. Herrman - President", "And as usual, Kimberly, we are trying to just make sure all the buyers are not buying too much too soon because of the availability. So we are very comfortable meanwhile with the number you just threw out there because it's right in line with our sales trend, packaways, like Carol said. And we look at where we were last year, where we are on the stores and the DCs and in-transit like you said. And everything is pretty much flush with the sales plan and the sales trend.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Ernie, it's amazing that you've been able to offer...", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You just have to understand...", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Sorry. Go ahead, Carol. I apologize.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I was going to say, you have to understand that our supply chain gets quicker so we can deliver. Our goal is deliver \u2013 to deliver more times during the week. So we are always building that number. So, that's really, really important. And that's part of our investment, it's \u2013 and part of our secret sauce. It's part of the way we run our business and we're going to keep making that faster and faster, which makes our goods fresher. So if you have a trend, you can buy to the trend that week and get it into the stores. And that's what you're trying to do.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Is it the faster supply chain that's driving your merchandise margin higher? Is it the greater value? Just help us bridge the gap between offering customers greater value and actually building your merchandise margin up?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. That's mostly in the buy. Obviously, it's in the buy and driving sales. Those are the two elements.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Hofkin. Sir, your line is open.", "Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Good morning. I'll add my congrats on a strong start to the year. Just a quick clarification question on the margins and then a brief follow-up on e-commerce. You mentioned and obviously, the adjusted profit margin numbers you give don't include the transactional impacts in Canada or Europe, I believe.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Is there a way that you could help quantify what maybe the margin trend or year-over-year change would have been if you could adjust for that as well? And then on e-commerce side, one very brief follow-up.", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, Daniel. We did a great job of mitigating in Canada a lot of the mark on pressure that we were seeing from headwinds. So it would have been better in Canada than the already strong numbers that we posted there. And we had some impact of currency in Europe as we do deal in multicurrency there, so there was some, I'll call it, revaluing of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the division's local currency a bit of a technical answer in terms of some of the cost that you have for the timing of multicurrency settlements. So that cost is between that and that, but it was not a big piece of an adjustment.", "The bigger piece was still in the mark-to-market and the translational impact for the quarter. And those were pretty much the translational. It's a little bit more than we had actually thought because the currency average for the quarter was actually a bit negative to us versus what we have thought. And the mark-to-market impact was also a bit more as the currencies increased at the end of the year \u2013 at the end of the quarter, again, more than we had planned. So the overall currency \u2013 total currency impact was 5% versus a planned 4% when we had started the quarter.", "Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then the brief follow-up on e-commerce is, obviously you just launched the tjmaxx website a little over a year and a half ago, so it's growing off of the beginning base. But can you talk about just the trend in the growth rate, let's say, this first quarter versus the fourth quarter, or just anything you can help us think about in terms of how \u2013 what's happening, early stages with the growth and how that's contributing so far. Is it still just 1% to 2% of sales at this point?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. It is still in that range. It is above plan, where we planned it. We're very, very pleased with it. And more importantly, we've nearly doubled the number of vendors. And again, we're increasing the categories. So we're extremely pleased with the business. And again, the most important thing is what we believe is it's not cannibalizing. And we'll see more results as time goes on. But we're very pleased with the business.", "Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks very much. Best of luck.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mr. Stephen Grambling. Sir, your line is open.", "Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning. I was hoping to just focus a little bit on the global growth here. And as you've entered Austria and prepare for the Netherlands, what are the biggest challenges that you've found in entering some of these new markets? And what are the things that you've adjusted to mitigate those risks? And then, I've got a follow-up on margins after that. Thanks.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. So first of all, it goes back to learning and we learned a lot when we entered Germany and we entered Poland. So we do a lot of investigation, research, understanding the mix, the supply chain, the customer, looking at the right real estate so that we're testing real estate in a low \u2013 a smaller market and a bigger market so that we get a feel. So there is a lot of work. It's sometimes a year to two years in advance. And we have teams that actually go and spend a lot of time. So we have a very good playbook in terms of entering new countries and we use that playbook so that we go in, we analyze and then we can grow from there. We have increased our number of European stores this year and again at year-end, we'll talk to the next year. But it gives us room to look at more real estate. We added two countries. The Netherlands has 17 million people. So, again, coming back to we have a very good playbook and we can leverage the foundation that we already have in the infrastructure.", "Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And so on that leverage point, is there anything limiting the margin potential in Europe relative to Marmaxx longer term?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, the cost of stores is certainly higher. There are some things \u2013 we put the model out 8% to 10%. I can't tell you that it's going to get to Marmaxx's model, probably not. Scott, you want to comment on that?", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I think part of it in the short-term is we're investing in a pretty good growth rate at the moment. The cost of real estate, as Carol called, the payroll/other benefit cost is higher there as well. And then you do not have \u2013 if we had several thousand stores like within Marmaxx, you're able to leverage obviously the home office and other infrastructure. So I think those are the three biggest pieces.", "Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So is it fair to say that the four-wall margin is a little bit lower there then?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, actually, Germany -", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Over time \u2013 again, I think some of the countries that might individually, like Germany, might be able to approach those levels if the four walls profit is quite good. But yeah, as Carol said, hopefully we could get somewhere in between and then we'll have to see based on the volumes. Again, the volumes \u2013 again, using Germany as an example, are quite \u2013 we do offset a lot of those costs due to the high volumes per store, but at the moment, we're not saying we can get to the Marmaxx levels.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And, Stephen, again, it's important for us to go into smaller markets and bigger markets. We open a big city in Germany, the volumes are enormous. But you want to be able to be across the country and the outskirts in addition.", "Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, guys. Thanks so much. Best of luck.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ms. Lorraine Hutchinson. Ma'am, your line is open.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the cadence of the wage increases. It sounds like the $9 rate will go into effect in June and it looks like you've guided SG&A, the ratio to be up in 2Q, but how should we think about that for the back half? And also as you both anniversary this and move to $10 next year, how are you thinking about pressure there?", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, you have it pretty much right in terms of the second quarter will be close \u2013 certainly a bigger increase. We had the state and local mandated increases in the first quarter. Investment growth, one of the reasons why the investment growth will be a bigger piece of the overall 9% that we put out there and a lot of that will be in the wage component of it. It will be relatively close in the back half of the year to what we're going to be seeing in the second quarter, so not enough to really call out as a big differentiator.", "Going forward, because of the timing of when we'll go to $10 and then annualizing some of the increase in $9, next year's impact will be higher than this year but then moderating and going down the year after.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mr. Howard Tubin. Sir, your line is open.", "Howard Brett Tubin - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thanks, guys. Carol, I was hoping you could talk maybe just generally about your marketing plans for the fall season whether in terms of dollars spend versus last year or TV impressions or radio impressions, things like that?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So the dollar spend is fairly flat to last year. However, each division has a slightly different strategy. So there's a lot more social media, a little less TV in Canada. We're revamping some things in Europe. So we have some new initiatives in Europe that we're pretty excited about. And we are leveraging all of our businesses for the back half. We have some really exciting things for gift giving in the fourth quarter across the board. So we are spending equal dollars but we think we're getting a bigger bang for the buck this year. And obviously, we did a lot of testing last year, we did a lot of analytics and we react to the analytics.", "Howard Brett Tubin - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "That's great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mr. Jeff Stein. Sir, your line is open.", "Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good morning. Carol, a question on HomeGoods and just the home category in general. Did the home side of Marmaxx perform as well as HomeGoods? And maybe you could talk about some of the categories specifically, if there are any, that you could call out that are really driving HomeGoods at the present time? Thank you.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We really don't talk to categories and our initiatives unless I will tell you something really needs to be fixed and we'll fix it. But our home categories across the board has really been very, very strong. But again, I will come back to apparel, we're pretty excited about. So we have a lot going on that's very positive.", "Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Okay. Can you talk about the loyalty program and the expansion of your, I guess, tender neutral loyalty program? And has that been an important driver here in the first quarter, your comps?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Our loyalty programs are doing very well, both our rewards cards and our soft loyalty program. We've gotten some great results in Europe and that's expanding. In Canada, it's extremely strong. So I would tell you that we're gaining more customers shopping all of our brands because when they join the loyalty programs, they really tend to shop all our brands. And as I said before, when you shop one versus two versus three brands, it's an enormous increase in the spend per year. So, we're seeing a lot of different things happening. And again, we are gaining a lot of younger customers.", "Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mr. Bob Drbul. Sir, your line is open.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Hi, good morning. Congratulations.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Two questions I have, the first one is do you think that tourism is impacting your business at all and can you comment a little bit about are you considering more combo units and how those type of units are performing within the store block?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. We do combos wherever we can and where it makes sense, where we can get the square footage and it's absolutely terrific for us. No, we're not seeing any impact in tourism. In terms of across the board, our sales, our comps are pretty consistent. So we don't believe we're being hit by that at all.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mr. Mike Baker. Sir, your line is open.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. A couple of quick follow-ups. One, the West Coast port issue, are any of those goods that you think you may have gotten from there in the stores, were they in the stores in the first quarter, so any impact to the comps this quarter, is this stuff that's all on the come?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Mike, the port, we can't tell you what it's really yielded. I mean, we pick the right goods, the best goods that we can find. In some cases, it may have been a delay from the port. But I could say this a thousand times. There is so much goods around the world that we take advantage of every situation. We have probably a piece of our business we got from the port delay. But it doesn't have an enormous impact to our business. And we will take advantage of everything in terms of packaway and great value and that's what we strive to do is just offer outrageous value.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Another follow-up, I understand March was the strongest. Was that due to Easter?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And I guess, it's more of a larger question. I know it was a great quarter and you don't want to use weather as an excuse, but I'm up here in New England, it was cold this spring, I mean weather had to have had an impact on your business. And even though Easter was early, it was so cold around Easter, my guess is Easter wasn't a great selling season. So, I guess, bigger picture question, how much did weather impact the quarter?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So we had a very strong Easter month, the month of March. And I say at some quarters you get affected by weather and it's dramatic and in the aggregate, you usually make up for it. So in the Northeast and in the North, we still had pretty strong comps. Were they softer in the month of February with the snow? Yes. And did it come back as soon as the weather cleared? Yes. So we always look at everything in the aggregate.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That makes sense. And then this is just for Scott, sometimes someone asks about quarterly expectations or margin expectations by the segments going forward, is that something you want to give us now?", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Again, we don't do it by the quarter, but I can certainly update you on the full year adjustments based on the first quarter. So I'll just, Michael, take it starting with Marmaxx, so as we said on the call, we have a 2% comp at the low and the high planned. The segment margin in the 14.2% to 14.4%, and that's down 40 basis points to down 20 basis points on volume of $19.5 billion to $19.6 billion, again, largely unchanged from the last time we gave guidance.", "HomeGoods, a 3% to 4% comp versus last year's 7% comp, 13.3% to 13.5%, down 30 basis points to down 10 basis points on $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, and that reflects an increase both to the sales and to the margin based on the first quarter results. TJX Canada, 3% to 4% comp, again this is excluding FX 11.6% to 11.8%, down 190 basis points to down 170 basis points, again, these comps and the guidance reflect the strong performance of Canada in the first quarter.", "Europe is planned 3% to 4%, again, excluding FX 7.5% to 7.7%, down 50 basis points to down 30 basis points, slightly worse again than we had guided to, again, due to the performance in the first quarter. And that's $4.2 billion to $4.2 billion on the sales line.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would not be happy if we didn't beat the 1% to 2% for the back half. Ernie and I would be disappointed and we always try to surpass our goals.", "Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Very good. We'd be disappointed too. We hope you get there.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mr. Ike Boruchow, Sir, your line is open.", "Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.", "Hi, everyone, congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on the higher DC costs that you called out for Q1. Just a little confused because I think you talked about lowering AUR and driving more units through the supply chain. I would have thought that would have been a margin benefit. Can you just help us elaborate on that callout at The Marmaxx Group?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, our merchandise margins were up, yeah.", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. We're still planning merchandise margins slightly up. There's two components that hit in the gross profit margin line. One is you're producing with the average retails down a bit more than we had planned. We did plan them down, but not to the level they are \u2013 we are now forecasting that requires additional freight cost and additional cost in our DC to process that unit. So that's why the \u2013 again, despite that, we're still planning the merchandise margins slightly up. So it's just incremental cost to the gross profit margin.", "Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And that will (54:48) the cycle and mitigate a bit towards the end of the back half. We're still driving \u2013 the retails will be down again at Q2 because we think it's the right thing to do. But then we do start to cycle a bit towards the back half.", "Scott Goldenberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. And just as a note, embedded in the \u2013 again, this is unchanged from our plan, but as we originally planned, there are some investments both for DCs and in the home office that primarily in Canada that impact and get our \u2013 impact the occupancy cost.", "Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The last question comes from Ms. Marni Shapiro. Ma'am, your line is open.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Hey, guys. Congratulations. I'm broke from shopping your stores, they look fantastic.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Did you go to the one in Bridgehampton, right, Scott?", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "No, I have not gone out there yet. I go in with the intention of just looking around and taking notes, it just doesn't work. So if we focus on the millennials for half a second because you called them out as a nice area of growth for you, and I was curious if you're seeing that growth across categories, so is it in apparel, accessories, home and online? And are you doing anything to specifically market and target this customer or is it just that she's discovering you guys?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes and yes. We are learning a lot about social media to get directly to the younger customer. We're doing a lot of in-store initiatives and the home guys are targeting a piece of their business to the younger customer. And new apartments and when kids get out of college and school and they start working, so we have a lot of things going towards appealing to the younger customer from merchandising and from the marketing perspective.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Excellent. And across all the categories, so she is shopping across apparel and accessories and home?", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Excellent. Fantastic. Best of luck with the summer season, guys.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. I want to thank everyone and we look forward to giving you the second quarter results. Thank you again.

Welcome to the TJX Companies\u2019 Second Quarter Fiscal 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded on Tuesday, August 18, 2015. I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you, Melissa. And before I begin, Deb is back and we are happy to have her back if she has a few words.", "Deb McConnell", "Thank you, Carol. Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company\u2019s results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company\u2019s plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 31, 2015.

Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis. Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today\u2019s press release and the Investor Information section of our website, tjx.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s press release or otherwise posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you. And now I will turn it back over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Joining me Deb on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg. I will begin by saying that I am extremely pleased with our second quarter results and continued strong momentum. On an adjusted basis earnings per share increased 7% above last year which well exceeded our plan. Consolidated comp store sales grew 6% all well above our expectations and over a 3% increase last year. The comp was driven entirely by customer traffic. This marks the third consecutive quarter, the traffic was primary driver and the fifth consecutive quarter that we have seen a sequential improvement in customer traffic. At Marmaxx, we continued our strategy of adjusting our pricing and merchandise mix to offer consumers the best assortment and values in the marketplace. While this led to a lower average ticket, our strategy is clearly working as we saw enormous increases in traffic and units sold. Importantly, we were very pleased with the increase in Marmaxx\u2019s merchandise margin despite the lower average ticket. We plan to continue the strategy in the back half and are convinced that this near-term decision will benefit our business in the medium and long-term by driving traffic and market gain shares.", "In terms of our other businesses, it was great to see HomeGoods and our International divisions making such significant contributions to our consolidated comp performance as we continue to expand both our U.S. and international presence. This bodes extremely well for our future growth. We are proud of our strong sales, traffic increases and merchandise margins, which are fundamental to being a successful retail business. We entered the back half of the year in an excellent inventory position with many new exciting opportunities. The third quarter is off to a solid start and our focus remains on continuing to drive customer traffic at all divisions. We are confident we will achieve our goals. And as always, we will strive to surpass them. Going forward, we see many opportunities to capitalize on our U.S. and international presence as we continue on the road to becoming a $40 billion plus global value retailer.", "So, before I continue, I will turn the call over to Scott to recap our second quarter.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Carol and good morning everyone. As Carol mentioned, our second quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 6% well above our plan. I would like to remind you that our comp sales exclude e-commerce. Again, we are very pleased that our comps were entirely driven by customer traffic and was up significantly at each of our divisions. It was also great to see a strong increase in our units sold. I want to note that the decrease in average ticket was as we had planned it and was essentially in line with the first quarter. To underscore Carol\u2019s point, we are confident that our strategies are helping us to grow our customer base.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.80 a 7% increase over last year\u2019s adjusted $0.75 and well above our plan. Our second quarter EPS growth was negatively impacted by about 5% due to the combination of foreign currency, transactional foreign exchange, our wage initiative, incremental investments and pension costs. I should note that the negative impact from foreign exchange was less than we expected. Consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 12%, down 30 basis points versus the prior year\u2019s adjusted margin and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.1%, up 50 basis points versus last year, primarily due to a strong buying and occupancy leverage on the 6% comp. Overall, merchandise margins were flat despite a negative impact from transactional foreign exchange at our international divisions and increased cost associated with moving more units through our supply chain.", "SG&A expense as a percentage of sales, was 16.9%, up 70 basis points versus last year\u2019s ratio and better than we planned. This increase was primarily due to a combination of our wage initiative, incremental investments to support our growth and pension costs as we had anticipated, as well as a contribution to the TJX Foundation.", " At the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories were up 4% on a constant currency basis. We are set up extremely well to flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the back half of the year. In terms of share repurchases, during the second quarter, we bought back $440 million of TJX stock, retiring 6.6 million shares. For the first half of the year, we have retired 12.7 million shares, buying back $855 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.8 million to $1.9 billion of TJX stock this year.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Carol and I will recap our third quarter and full year fiscal \u201816 guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Scott. Before moving to our growth strategy, I will share some additional color on our second quarter performance by division. In the U.S., Marmaxx comps grew by strong 4% and it was terrific to see that this increase was entirely driven by customer traffic, while segment profit margin was down 40 basis points, margins were negatively impacted by our investments in our associates, as well as the lower average ticket and higher supply chain costs as we had anticipated. Importantly, we were very pleased with our increase in merchandise margins.", "To reiterate, we are convinced that adjusting our pricing and mix is the right thing to do for our business and our substantial increases in traffic and units tell us that our strategies are working. I should also note that by next year we expect the impact of the lower average ticket to be largely behind us. To be clear, maintaining our value gap is what we always aim to do in our business. Unlike many other retailers, our ability to change our mix as well as the values we offer to suit our customers\u2019 needs highlights the flexibility and beauty of our model. We can do this around the world. Marmaxx\u2019s apparel business performed well in the second quarter and Home also continued its excellent performance. We are excited about the comp and traffic momentum at our largest divisions and have many initiatives planned to keep it going.", "HomeGoods delivered another outstanding quarter. Comps were up 9% for the second quarter in a row, over 5% increase last year. Segment profit margin increased 30 basis points. HomeGoods continues to deliver consistently strong comp results across all geographies, which bodes well for our growth plans. We are thrilled about the long-term potential of this chain. Consumers love HomeGoods.", "Now, moving to our international division, TJX Canada delivered another exceptional comp, posting a 12% increase this quarter. All three of our Canadian chains had stellar comp performance. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was up 10 basis points. Again this quarter, TJX\u2019s profit margin was negatively impacted by the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar and the effect on this division\u2019s merchandise margins. Once again, our Canadian organization did an outstanding job mitigating this currency impact even more than we had hoped as they truly leveraged our global organization.", "TJX Europe comp grew up a strong 5% over a 6% increase last year. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was up 30 basis points. We are pleased with the initial performance of our first two stores in Austria and are on track to open our first two stores in the Netherlands this fall. We are excited to enter our sixth European country and bring our great values to even more shoppers as we expand our global footprint.", "As to e-commerce, we continue to be very pleased with our online strategy. We plan to keep adding new categories and vendors to each of our e-com sites and offer our online shoppers a greater selection of fashions and brands at great value. Although tjmaxx.com is still a young business and a small part of TJX, we are very happy with our early metric. Importantly, the site is bringing in new customers. We are very excited about the future of e-commerce. In addition, we look forward to opening our first Sierra Trading store on the East Coast in the back half.", "Now I want to briefly recap our four pillars for growth which gives us confidence that we will sustain profitable growth for many years to come. Starting with driving customer traffic and comp sales, we are delighted that our strategies to increase customer transactions continue to take hold. We remain focused on continuing to grow our customer base and capturing more U.S. and international market share. To reach even more consumers, we are leveraging our global marketing capabilities. I am very excited about the fall and holiday campaigns we have planned for the back half of the year at all positions and I am confident we will attract new shoppers to our stores. To encourage more frequent visits and cross shopping, we continue to grow our loyalty programs in the U.S., Canada and UK. Further, we strive to keep improving the shopping experience and increase customer satisfaction every day.", "Our second pillar is our enormous brick-and-mortar global potential. With over 3,450 stores today, we see the opportunity to grow to 5,475 stores long-term with just our existing chains in our existing countries and the Netherlands. This includes 1,500 additional stores in North America and another 500 plus stores in Europe. Last month, we were excited to announce our plan to enter our next continent, Australia which I will talk about in a moment.", "Our next pillar is e-commerce expansion. Again, we are very pleased with our progress and excited about the future. We are making additional investments in our e-commerce supply chain and organization to support this important growth vehicle and our plan to eventually roll out e-commerce for other retail brands. As you have heard me say before, we are being very deliberate in our approach so that our online sales are incremental to our successful brick-and-mortar business.", "I truly believe we are leaders in innovation, which is our fourth pillar. We are constantly testing ideas and new seeds across each of our divisions that can lead to new categories or initiatives that could fuel future growth. Innovation is in our DNA and we will never be complacent. To support our growth goals and build upon our leadership position, we will continue to invest in our business. Our approach is to invest ahead of growth in the right areas of our business and to establish a strong foundation to support future needs.", "Now, to why we are so excited about our plans to acquire Trade Secret and expand into our ninth country, Australia. Our planned acquisition of Trade Secret fits right into our clear vision for continued global growth. We look forward to closing the transaction by the end of the calendar year and growing this business in the future. Trade Secret is the only off-price retailer of significant size in Australia. And it gives us immediate scale and first mover advantage in our third continent. With our Australian buying office in its fifth year, we are familiar with the market and see it very attractive for off-price. With consumer demographics similar to Canada, we see the potential to grow in Australia in a similar way to acquiring winners as a five-store chain in 1990 and growing it into a leading retailer in Canada.", "There is a strong middle class in Australia and consumers hungry for brands who have very few options for value. Trade Secret business is closely aligned with ours and we view it as a great cultural fit with TJX. We see the potential to further develop Trade Secret by leveraging our global buying scale, vendor universe, marketing, supply chain and other capabilities. Also, with Australia\u2019s season being opposite to the Northern Hemisphere, this presents us with a nice packaway opportunity, an ability to test new ideas.", "Our planned expansion into Australia is the newest example of our global reach. But before I sum up, I want to spend a moment on why we see our ability to capitalize on our global presence as such a key advantage. TJX is the only major international off-price apparel and home fashion company in the world. Over the last 38 years, we have built a global off-price powerhouse that we are sure would take decades for others to replicate. We are one of the few major U.S. retailers to have expanded successfully internationally. We have developed a highly integrated organization and infrastructure to support our off-price model. Our four large divisions and seven retail chains are highly synergistic. They all operate with our off-price business model and are centered on our value mission and same TJX culture. We function as one TJX. This is true across our worldwide buying organization, supply chain network and global operating teams including marketing, training and procurement.", "Further, we measure our success across our chains on the same metric. Being as highly integrated and synergistic as we are we share talent, ideas and initiatives across our chains. All of this gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue growing successfully as a global value retailer. In summing up, we are thrilled with our above-plan results and continued track momentum. As our core is off to a solid start, we are confident in our plan for the back half of the year. And as always, we are motivated to surpass them. We have many initiatives planned to keep our momentum going, attract more shoppers to our stores and gain market share. We will continue to offer customers amazing values on a differentiated mix of apparel and home fashion.", "Every year, we up our game in gift-giving and this year is no exception. We have many initiatives planned and I believe our stores will be more exciting than ever across the board. We are delighted about our plan to enter Australia and expand our global presence even further. Most importantly, as a nearly $30 billion retailer we have a clear vision and strategy for growth. We are a differentiated apparel and home fashion business with a laser-focused management team. We have built a world-class organization and I am proud of our team and very strong corporate culture. We are confident that we have the talent and infrastructure in place to grow TJX to a $40 billion company and beyond.", "And now, I will turn it over to Scott to go through guidance and then we will open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks Carol. Now to fiscal \u201816 guidance beginning with Q3, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.82 versus last year\u2019s $0.85 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 8% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange, which has doubled what we originally planned due to the continued decline in the Canadian dollar. Our plans also continue to reflect the 5% negative impact to EPS due to our wage initiative, incremental investments to support our growth and pension cost. I want to note this guidance also reflects our plans for a lower average ticket at Marmaxx as Carol mentioned, as well as the related costs associated with moving additional units to our supply chain that were not contemplated in our original plans.", "We are modeling third quarter consolidated sales in the $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion range. This guidance assumes a 3% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. With our strong momentum in the first half of the year, we are raising our comp store sales growth guidance for the third quarter. We are now assuming comp growth in the 2% to 3% range both on a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx versus our original plan of 1% to 2% growth. Third quarter pre-tax profit margin is planned an 11.4% to 11.6% range versus 13.0% last year. We are anticipating third quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.5% to 28.7% versus 29.4% last year. This assumes foreign currency pressure and additional supply chain costs. Despite these headwinds, we expect underlying merchandise margins to remain healthy. We are expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the 16.9% to 17.0% range versus 16.2% last year, primarily due to our wage initiative, as well as our incremental investments. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 37.5% and net interest expense of about $12 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately $680 million.", "Now, moving on to full year guidance, as we noted in our press release today, we are raising our full year diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.01 on the high end. We now expect fiscal \u201816 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.24 to $3.28 over $3.15 in fiscal \u201815. Excluding last year\u2019s debt extinguishment charge, fiscal \u201816 expected EPS would be in the 3% to 4% over the prior year\u2019s adjusted $3.16. This EPS raise reflects the incremental benefit from our strong second quarter and our raised assumption for second half comp growth. This is being largely offset by expected additional foreign exchange headwinds and higher supply chain costs for the back half of the year. As a reminder, our plans reflect the impact of several items detailed in our press release that we are assuming will negatively impact our fiscal \u201816 EPS growth by about 9%. We are also increasing our full year comp store sales guidance to reflect our strong second quarter results and raise expectations for the back half. We now expect a comp increase of 3% to 4% on a consolidated basis and a comp increase of 3% at Marmaxx.", "For the year, we expect pre-tax profit margin to be 11.7% versus last year\u2019s adjusted 12.3% in fiscal \u201815. We are anticipating gross profit margin to be approximately 28.5%, which would be flat versus fiscal \u201815. We are planning for a slight increase in merchandise margins. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 16.7% versus 16.1% last year. Our full year guidance implies fourth quarter EPS of $0.96 to $0.98 compared to $0.93 last year. This guidance also reflects our raised assumption for fourth quarter consolidated comp sales growth of 2% to 3%. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call. Finally, it\u2019s important to remember our guidance for the remainder of this year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the third quarter.", "Now, we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we are going to ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. Thanks. And now, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Boss. Your line is open.", "Matt Boss", "So, despite the FX and some of the wage pressures that the underlying margins are going through today, I mean, we are seeing stability, merchandise margins remain positive excluding the FX. So, if multiyear same-store sales were to remain in this 2% to 3% range or maybe even better, are there any structural headwinds to prevent your margins from exceeding last year\u2019s peak once some of these headwinds normalize on a multiyear basis?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, our merchandise margins, again, if you are just talking straight merchandise margins, Matt, you have to be a little bit clearer, because obviously, FX change...", "Matt Boss", "I was talking about your overall EBIT margins, if once the FX and the wage pressures subside, how to think about on the multiyear basis, is there any structural headwind from exceeding prior peaks if you are able to continue to put up two to three type same-store sales?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. I mean, we have said, every year, we try to increase our margins, but we are not going to sit here and say years from now, our margin is going to go up X percent. We run our business very well. Obviously, the future is without FX hitting us, pension, other elements should be positive. Our average retail is starting to flatten out as of next year. So, we see some of those negative things obviously turning into a positive, but we run our business everyday on the best value we can give the consumer and we always strive to increase our margins and leverage our business.", "Matt Boss", "Great. And then just one quick follow-up, as we think about Europe, can you just talk to some learnings and customer reception as you expand into some of these new countries? Are you seeing any new brand relationships and then just the best way to think about square footage expansion opportunities in the coming years?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, I mean, we go into countries and we build brands and we are constantly increasing our number of vendors in every single country. I think what we have learned prior to going into Germany is to really investigate country for a long period of time before we go in. So, you tread lightly, you are camping, you really understand the mix of the customer, and every single country is very, very different. So, you have to take a long time to study each country before you go in. So, we have lots of learnings. And now we have obviously expanded into many new countries a little bit quicker, but we did a lot of homework before.", "Matt Boss", "That\u2019s great. Best of luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question you have comes from Michael Binetti. Your line is open.", "Michael Binetti", "Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. If I could just ask on the comment that you expect lower \u2013 the impact of lower average ticket to be behind you, I think those as of next year, maybe just a little more color on that, what you are thinking there if it take its plan to be flat or up? And it looks like right now, every point of revenue or comp upside you are getting to is coming with quite a bit of additional supply chain cost. So if I try to put a few of those pieces together, it\u2019s likely because it\u2019s coming from the composition of growth being from units while pricing is lower. Can we assume that the leverage point next year has a little less headwind if the ticket declines a bit?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, you can absolutely assume that.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, I mean, we are constantly moving on mix, I mean, that\u2019s the beauty of the model that we look at every single category. It\u2019s within the category that we will look. It\u2019s looking at where we want to put our dollars. So every year, we look at where we can improve and how we can give the best value to the customer. I think we are just very, very excited about the increase in traffic. And that continues over many, many quarters. So, we feel like we are really \u2013 this is the right strategy for us.", "Michael Binetti", "Right. So, if I could just add one quick follow-up, given all the headwinds that we know about investments, the minimum wages and the FX and then adding in some of the comments you just made there, what is the flow-through rate on a point of comp now and did those headwinds \u2013 how do those headwinds kind of hand off into 2016, it\u2019s another year of EPS growth below the 11% to 12% we saw the last two years?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Well, once you have set your plans like right now of just when we gave guidance for the second quarter, we built in the average ticket. I mean, we hit the cost that we had for the average ticket, the supply chain costs we are right on. For the third and fourth quarter, now that we have built that incremental cost on for every additional comp that we would get. Per quarter, it\u2019s approximately $0.02 and we would get a flow-through of about 20 basis points to the pre-tax margin on that. And that\u2019s generally been there. So, once you have absorbed these \u2013 put these costs in, we will still get the benefit. The average ticket was because you had to put it across all of the units on an incremental basis, we would flow through close to what we would always have flown through.", "In terms of the wage and all that, again, all the incremental investments have come in both for the first half of the year as we had planned and we have no fundamental changes on incremental investments. And the only thing we are aware of right now going forward is the wage initiative, the wage costs. Other than that, as Carol mentioned, FX is too early to make a call whether it will have a positive or negative impact on next year.", "Michael Binetti", "Thanks, guys. Great quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger. Your line is open.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Great, thank you. Really excellent results today. Congratulations on that. Carol, it sounds like at Marmaxx, you have done a little bit of some sort of a strategic analysis of the marketplace. And I am wondering if you can just give us a little bit more background on what it was that you were seeing in your business that caused you to look at the pricing and the mix within Marmaxx division in order to drive those changes, what were the observations that you had about the marketplace in general and maybe just take us through the decision process to take down the AUR and how did that change the buying process internally? Thanks so much.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Kimberly, I can answer that by saying it\u2019s really business as usual. Ernie, the team, we all look at why, what we can improve upon, look at the mix we shifted, I mean this is our model. So there is no great surprise here. This is how we do business. We look at the market and then we trend the business where we want to go after it. And we have one mission, give extreme value. So the team pulled together and I think we made some great decisions. But we always look at opportunities. We see more opportunities for next year, that\u2019s how we look at our business.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "So opportunities for next year to offer even more value, but that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be through a lower AUR, Carol is that right?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Probably not, we will probably start to flatten out maybe a little bit into the first quarter and then flatten out.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Okay, great. And then just one clarification for Scott, Scott I think you said about the 70 basis points to 80 basis point headwind to SG&A in the third quarter guidance on increased wages and investments, I assume pensions in there as well, but is there a way for us to think about the 70 basis points to 80 basis points, is that sort of half of that is wages, the other half investments or is it kind of weighted towards one or the other?", "Scott Goldenberg", "I think you are \u2013 again, it\u2019s approximately half of that. It would be the wages and the rest would be the incremental investments that we called out in the new country expansion, the incremental PCI costs. So yes, that\u2019s exactly right in terms of the SG&A. So, no changes to the back half in the SG&A other than the change in the additional supply chain costs.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Omar Saad. Your line is open.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks. Great quarter, my question is on the AUR and ticket as well, should we think about the change in the strategy, a little bit slight change in the strategy and the business model allowing flexibilities, is it more that you are procuring the same types of goods and being able to sell them at a lower price with a higher turn or are you trading down a little bit in terms of the brands or the premium price points the products you are selling or it\u2019s \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a little bit more clarity on how the mix is shifting and what the strategy is there and what\u2019s working? Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So Omar, I mean Ernie, you want to talk about them?", "Ernie Herrman", "Sure. Omar it\u2019s kind a combination of multiple things, first a little bit of pockets where we did buy better on specific items, that\u2019s just one piece though. We have had a shift of because some departments trend differently, so we have had a shift in department, I mean mix of departments within the total. And then really, the last part is the balancing the mix is within the departments, within the actual departments. So we could have changed from one vendor to another vendor, not necessarily bought it better. So I would tell you it\u2019s not one issue at a time, it\u2019s all of those things.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "The other piece that we haven\u2019t really talked about is the more we become global, our choices and our mix is from all over the world. So we are able to really leverage buying in Europe using the dollar appropriately where we need to, but we get much more eclectic and much more differentiated. So all of those elements are pulled together in our mix and we are very, very integrated as a total company today and every year we get better and better at that. And we get better and better leveraging it.", "Omar Saad", "So that\u2019s really helpful. And so I don\u2019t understand, it\u2019s not that you are selling for lack of a better word, lower brands or lower quality products at lower prices these other\u2026?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Not at all, as a matter of fact we have some European goods that everybody was onboard with that are just spectacular. And we are going to be hopefully blowing everybody away with our gift-giving because we really have gift-giving from around the world. It\u2019s an international offering this year that we are just so excited about, it\u2019s a fine business.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Mike Baker. Your line is open.", "Mike Baker", "Hi. Thanks. So department store inventories looked really high at the end of the second quarter, they are high at the end of the first quarter as well, but even higher now, how do you think that impacts your business going forward, does that put pressure on merchandise margins as they may get more promotional, does that play into your strategy you are discussing today or in some ways does it help you because there might be more products available in the marketplace, so I was just wondering what you have seen in the past where department store inventories are elevated?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Mike, I am going to answer this question in the way I always answer it and that is there is \u2013 we could never ever buy the quantity of goods that are out there and that every single week, we have to hold our people back. That has never changed and it never will change. Secondly, we will always keep our distance from where the departments are and our values. That is the beauty of the model. It\u2019s the beauty of the business, the beauty of the flexibility. So it\u2019s every year something happens whether they have more inventory, less inventory, it really doesn\u2019t matter, we just have to give outrageous value.", "Mike Baker", "So, is that in some ways play into the strategy you are talking about today to be a little bit choppier because you expect that department stores are going to need to get promotional in the back half?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Not really, we are just offering we think is absolute, it\u2019s a combination of the mix, what we are offering the customer which is really absolutely wonderful and in some places that\u2019s not it\u2019s European, it\u2019s special, it\u2019s brands, it\u2019s everything.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Mike, I would also jump in and say and Carol referred to this earlier, is the model kind of works this out for us and that if the market gets promotional or if things start to back up with inventories at the other stores, it leads us to automatically ending up at better value. It might be a delay of a few weeks, but pretty much we end up with better value, only because of the supply situation in the market. So I think when Carol said earlier, that that\u2019s kind of just the way we work it, that\u2019s kind of a plus for this as well.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Effectively by hundreds of millions of dollars every week, every single week.", "Mike Baker", "Yes, thank you. I appreciate the color on the business model.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson. Your line is open.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you. Good morning, do you continue to see an opportunity of goods coming out of last year and early this year as ports slowdown. And has the composition of your packaway inventory changed at all versus this time last year?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Lorraine, I would say that the port situation \u2013 how do I put this without getting specific, I mean there is always stragglers I would call it, of merchandise that were stuck in the ports. In terms of the magnitude relative to our business, I would say not that big, but certainly, there has been some buys that were basic on that even recently. And you\u2019re your \u2013 your second question again could you ask that, was that about the packaways?", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Right. The composition of your packaway inventory changed at all versus this time last year?", "Scott Goldenberg", "No, not really. And it\u2019s just slightly up from where it was last year, but effectively the composition is very similar.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you.", "Scott Goldenberg", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Howard Tubin. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, yes. This is actually [indiscernible] calling for Howard. Could you please just elaborate a little bit on your marketing initiatives or plans for the upcoming fall season?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Well, I think I am not going to elaborate where our spend is slightly up. We have some new campaigns that are going to be very, very exciting. We have new social media. We are still hitting on all cylinders. So it\u2019s going to be very exciting. And our tri-branding and our gift-giving is going to be pretty big this year. More importantly, we are really starting to leverage our marketing across, again across all of our countries so that we can really take the best of the best and leverage it. So we are pretty excited about the back half.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question we have comes from Oliver Chen. Your line is open.", "Oliver Chen", "Hey, thanks. Congratulations and Debra welcome back. Carol, regarding the strategy, it sounds quite prudent about the ticket strategy in terms of gaining share. I am just curious in terms of your customers and shoppers do the shoppers kind of notice this change, like how is it being telegraphed? Clearly, it sounds like its working. And your comments on just the gifts sound really exciting, what\u2019s the main takeaway in terms of year-over-year difference whether it be pricing or timing of the drops?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. Well, Oliver, we don\u2019t telegraph our pricing, the customer walks in and clearly they like it, because our units are up. That\u2019s really the answer to that, that they are very excited about it. In terms of our gift giving, every single year, we strive to be better and I keep coming back to the word global, because when you have access to so many countries and you can see even food from different countries, it becomes very, very special. And every year, we look at what we did the year before and we look at how we can do that even better. And this is the continuation of building the foundation of the total corporation, years of training, years of working together. The communication between all the divisions is the strongest it\u2019s ever been. And that really leads to a very, very exciting mix for all countries. And that\u2019s how we just \u2013 every year, we raised the bar that way.", "Oliver Chen", "That sounds awesome. And just a quick follow-up on the modeling, Scott, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the number of units whether previously in your original plans. Is that just related to your revised outlook on your comps or I was wondering about the context for that statement?", "Scott Goldenberg", "That was in the context that the supply chain impact was not reflected in the third and fourth quarter or back half in the gross margin and lesser extent in the SG&A. So, now it\u2019s reflected. It was not reflected in the previous guidance. And talking about just previous guidance, I haven\u2019t updated the full year guidance. So, I am just going to take a moment now to go through the full year updated guidance by division. Marmaxx comps are three, at the low and the high. The segment margin and all the numbers I am going to be going through right now, excluding FX impact, are 14.0% to 14.1% versus last year\u2019s 14.6% on a sales volume of $19.7 billion to $19.8 billion. HomeGoods post \u2013 now the comp is 5% to 6%. Segment margin is 13.5% to 13.6% versus last year\u2019s 13.6% on volume of $3.8 billion; Canada, 6% to 7% comp, 13% to 13.1%, again, this is ex-FX versus 13.5% last year and down 50 to down 40, so quite a bit of a change on both in increasing comp and improvement in the segment margin from the last time on Canada on $2.8 billion in sales; and Europe, 3% to 4%, 7.7% to 7.8% on segment margin, again, ex-FX against last year\u2019s 8% down 30% to down 20%. And as we called out in the call, 40 basis points down ex-FX similar to our last guidance that we gave at the end of the last second quarter.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful for our models. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Richard Jaffe. Your line is open.", "Richard Jaffe", "Thanks very much and my compliments on the quarter. If you could just talk for a minute about e-commerce, the size or the volume that\u2019s involved with e-commerce and how it\u2019s broken up by country and possibly by brand? And then if you could just share with us the Sierra Trading location on the East Coast, that would be helpful?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So, Rich, I will answer your last question, because I am not going to answer your first one. Sierra Trading is going to be in Burlington, Vermont and we are pretty excited about it. Our e-commerce business, we haven\u2019t broken it out, I can tell you that we are gaining new customers. We have still a lot of steps to look at, but we believe that the differentiation strategy is working well and we are very pleased with what we are seeing. And as you can see, our comps do not include e-commerce, but we believe slow and steady wins the raise and we continue to learn a lot, but we are very pleased.", "Richard Jaffe", "Carol, if you could just clarify, are new customers new to TJX or new to your e-commerce site?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes.", "Richard Jaffe", "New to TJX?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "TJX, yes.", "Richard Jaffe", "And the technology, credit card data etcetera to confirm that?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes.", "Richard Jaffe", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question we have comes from Bob Drbul. Your line is open.", "Bob Drbul", "Hi, good morning. Congratulations.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Bob Drbul", "Couple of questions. For the back half of the year, can you talk about how you are positioned on like boots and jackets and some of the colder weather categories and what you are seeing from that perspective, vendors?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Bob, we don\u2019t specifically talk about specific categories. Again, I am going to come back to the business model, because a lot of you have asked about even our average ticket. You have to come back to remembering how close to needs, we buy. So, when we laid out the second quarter and our average ticket, we are buying so close that you can\u2019t plan everything. We are making assumptions, but that\u2019s again the beauty of the model. So, we don\u2019t specifically comment, because if a category isn\u2019t hot, we are going to switch. And if it is, we are going to go for it, but we think we have a very good insight to what we think is going to drive the back half and we are excited about it.", "Bob Drbul", "Okay. And then couple other quick questions are there any regional comp callouts that you would make either in HomeGoods or in Marmaxx?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, it\u2019s pretty strong across the board. Puerto Rico was slightly weak.", "Bob Drbul", "And question for Scott, on the expense side, are you seeing anything in healthcare costs that are influencing you or concerns as we look forward?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Our costs per healthcare have been pretty much in line with our plans. So, we built whatever increases that we do that were legislative, but no very much in line.", "Bob Drbul", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dana Telsey. Your line is open.", "Dana Telsey", "Good morning, everyone and congratulations. Can you talk a little bit about the remodeled store format? What you are seeing and any change in terms of size of box and availability? We keep hearing of more locations available, both urban and more suburban. Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So, Dana, we like what we see with our remodels. As far as real estate availability, what\u2019s probably the most exciting is the number of countries that we have to choose from. So, we did, I mean, what was 182 stores\u2026", "Scott Goldenberg", "182. Yes, roughly as we will come in this year.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. And you see some opportunity in Europe.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, we think Europe, especially, Dana given the other countries that we are going into as well as in the current \u2013 like in Germany we feel like there is more opportunity to do more stores over the next couple of years. So, we are pretty bullish there. We are filling domestically. We will continue to probably be about where we have been on the store count. And in terms of I think you also asked about size of box. We are not seeing any major change there. I think we take that location by location. So, we do adjust as we go into more stores, we do adjust based on the location the size of the box, but there is no current plan to really play with that in a major way. So, hopefully that answers that question.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Dana, what is interesting is I am sure some of you are out in the Hampton, so we have a HomeGoods there that\u2019s 13,000 square feet, which is doing extremely well. So, we are finding smaller boxes and bigger boxes all work for us. We are still planning to continue our 4% to 5% store growth and take every opportunity. And now that obviously we are in more countries, we are going to take every deal that makes sense, but we have more to choose from, which is very exciting to us.", "Dana Telsey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Stein. Your line is open.", "Jeff Stein", "Question for Scott, general corporate expense was up almost $30 million in the second quarter and I am wondering Scott, if you can give us some guidance in terms of what we should expect for Q3 and Q4. Also perhaps, maybe drill down a little bit in terms of what accounted for the $30 million increase I assume that wages are not baked into that number and also perhaps how much your contribution was to The TJX Foundation? Thank you.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Approximately half was due to the contribution to the foundation, so that made up the largest component of it. And then the other components were some of them related to our incremental investment costs, systems, pension, we have had better than planned incentive accruals. And so that made \u2013 those were the large categories that made up the rest and then some normal growth in the base corporate expense that you would expect. No large increases planned for the back half of the year in terms of corporate expense for either the third or the fourth quarter.", "Jeff Stein", "So if we were to assume Scott, maybe a normal inflation increase in the back half of the year for general corporate, that would be in the ballpark?", "Scott Goldenberg", "That would be in the ballpark, yes.", "Jeff Stein", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Daniel Hofkin. Your line is open.", "Daniel Hofkin", "Hi, good morning, congratulations on the results. I just had a question first on the wage expense, could you remind us are you still thinking about it as we look to next year for the overall impact to be greater year-over-year than it has been this year just given that you will have the full year effect of this year\u2019s increase plus next year\u2019s and then kind of looking beyond next year, what would we expect kind of a more normalized trajectory or flattening out?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. So next year will definitely be up and the following year it will be less so and that\u2019s how we are planning it. But obviously, as I said before have other hopefully opportunities between pension and foreign exchange and ticket flattening out.", "Daniel Hofkin", "Okay. And then Carol on merchandise margins, just obviously continuing to see underlying improvement, could you talk about whether some of the opportunities or whether some of the areas that can continue to drive that even though obviously inventory presumably is not going to be as big a driver it\u2019s been in the last 7 years, 8 years, what are the things that you think can at least move it directionally higher over time from here?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think it\u2019s just a continuation of leveraging and doing the best job we can. I mean, we try to plan fairly flat and then we try to beat it. But it all comes down to giving great value to the customer. But in our plans, we tend to be fairly flat.", "Daniel Hofkin", "Okay, great. Best of luck. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question is from Patrick McKeever. Your line is open.", "Patrick Mckeever", "Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone \u2013 good afternoon I guess. But on the \u2013 another question on the wage increase, I mean you did see a sequential acceleration at Marmaxx in the quarter against a little bit of a tougher comparison than the first quarter, so my question is I mean do you feel like the wage increase had any impact on your sales in the quarter. And just more broadly, how are you measuring employee performance post the wage impact, are you looking \u2013 I am sure you are looking at turnover, I am wondering if you might be able to give us some color there or perhaps other performance metrics?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We are seeing a slight positive in terms of turnover. I mean it\u2019s early on and we will see what happens over time. But along with that is we just worked very, very hard on building our culture and being a company of choice. So it all comes together. We try to work very hard to train. As we have growth in the company, there is lots of opportunities for people and we try to make it an exciting place to work. So I can\u2019t tell you if our turnover is better because of that, because of wage, but I think it\u2019s a combination of everything. We just strive to do a better job every year.", "Patrick Mckeever", "And then on Canada, also a sequential acceleration against a tougher comparison, meaningfully tougher, so what do you think there is, is some of that related to targets, pullout exit from Canada and what do you \u2013 I mean what\u2019s the expectation for the balance of the year?", "Scott Goldenberg", "I would say actually, less of that is about the target pulling out. It\u2019s a little bit of execution, I would say. And in certain categories, we did a better job of executing. And then we have also had the benefit of the \u2013 in reverse the weaker dollar has really helped the cross-border situation, less consumers in Canada are obviously crossing back to the U.S. and you might have a little bit of vice versa from U.S. going more to Canada. So I think that\u2019s been a piece that is actually helping our Canadian business. I would say the bulk of it though is better execution in terms of first of all they have done a great job on mitigating as much of the exchange situation as they can. I give our team up there a lot of credit for that. And secondly, they are going after really aggressively looking at the values of where they are versus all of the other retailers there. And that would have applied whether target was there are not. I think that team has done an outstanding job on that front. So I would say that is the bulk of the reason why the business has been so healthy there.", "Patrick Mckeever", "Great, good stuff. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Pam Quintiliano. Your line is open.", "Pamela Quintiliano", "Great. Thanks so much for taking questions and congrats on the great quarter. So I just have a few quick ones. I am sorry if I missed this, but the Labor Day calendar shift has had an impact of some others, but can you just talk through with us any potential impact you saw there?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Not really. I mean we look at back-to-school, we just dip fresh merchandise everyday and we don\u2019t get caught up on a specific day. So we don\u2019t really see that having any impact.", "Pamela Quintiliano", "Great. And then just two other quick ones, can you update us on the rewards access program and how that\u2019s going. And also, you had mentioned a couple of times gaining a new customer. In the past you have updated us with some customer awareness figures, and I am just wondering if you have anything new on that front?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We don\u2019t really have anything new. We just know that we are gaining customers and our rewards access program is definitely increasing.", "Pamela Quintiliano", "And along with the rewards access program increasing, I am assuming the credit card base as well is improving?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Both are, yes.", "Pamela Quintiliano", "Great. Thank you so much. Best of luck.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is from Marni Shapiro. Your line is open.", "Marni Shapiro", "Hi guys, just under wire. Thanks so much. Congrats. Can you talk a little bit more about Trade Secret, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, they have about 30 plus stores, will you renovate them or do you like the footprint that they operate in today. And what does the footprint looks like relative to say a Marshalls or T.J. Maxx. And was the breakdown in the stores, is it close to what you see in your Marmaxx stores today or is it different?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Now, I am just going to give you like a quick overview and then I am going to hand it over to Ernie to see what\u2019s just down there took that lovely trip. First of all, we are really excited about it. We are going to move slowly. So whenever we look at something, we say we are going to evaluate the name, we are going to evaluate, do we remodel. But the first priority is to make sure that we have a wonderful mix and we will do a lot of customer surveys and we will go slowly. So that\u2019s going to be our primary goal here initially. So, Ernie, you want to \u2013 he is really excited when he came back which I was very happy about.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. Marni, very exciting market for us, as you can imagine I think culturally it\u2019s a pretty seamless entry for us. Carol mentioned earlier, by the way we have an Australian buying office that\u2019s been there for about 5 years. And so we already had some knowledge going in. The organization that\u2019s there with Trade Secret, the store format that you are asking about, we will definitely remodel some of them. I would tell you some of them don\u2019t need much remodeling, so it\u2019s a bit of a mix. So, it will vary location by location and a bit by the different markets that they are in. And two of the major ones are obviously Sydney and Melbourne. So, we are going to kind of look at those as a strategy by market. The sizing of the boxes are very \u2013 they are probably the appropriate size actually given the size of their business and how much volume they do out of each box. I think we are going to look, obviously, step-by-step like how is it at the branding of it, etcetera, how we fold it more into the way we do business. But the number one priority, again to reiterate what Carol said is the merchandise mix, because that\u2019s still a place that we operate differently, more differently probably than they do currently, although they have done a very nice job on what they have done to-date. And so it\u2019s been a great partnership already in terms of working together to see where we are going to take it from here and we are just excited about the opportunity.", "Marni Shapiro", "Great. Will the founders stay involved? It sounds like him talking to some friends there that they have a kind of young, fun, spirit about them, it sounds like the customers like that, are they going to stay involved?", "Ernie Herrman", "What we are going to do was for a time period. They will be a little involved in the current management, merchant team and operators are going to be involved on an ongoing basis, but really, over time, by the way, our intention is to keep it very, very young and vibrant. It\u2019s a growth business, the young business. So, we feel like we are at the right time and they have been terrific.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Hey, Marni, we won\u2019t tell people are running it.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, we are not.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Actually, we have one of our top merchants from Canada going down, a team that Ernie is heading down there is spectacular, it\u2019s going to report into our head of Europe, Michael MacMillan and there are some very young fabulous A players also going down and I think Ernie was very, very impressed with the team down there that was running the business. That is going to stay intact.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, they\u2019re great and again very exciting. We will keep you guys posted over time.", "Marni Shapiro", "Great. Best of luck guys.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, thanks everybody and we look forward to coming back to you on third quarter. Thank you.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Tuesday, November 17, 2015. ", "I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Melissa. And good morning everyone and before we get started, Deb has a few comments.", "Deb McConnell", "Good morning.

And now I'll turn it back over to Carol.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Deb. And joining me and Deb on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg.", "Before I review the quarter, I want to take a moment to say how excited we are about our recent news that Ernie will become the next CEO of TJX. As you the know, the Board plans to elect Ernie as CEO at the beginning of our next fiscal year. The board and I could not be more convinced that Ernie is the right person to lead TJX into the future is proven successful track record, leadership abilities, strategic vision, discipline and focus are all characteristics that we believe make an absolutely the right choice. ", "Succession planning has always been a priority of TJX and we are confident that our long thoughtful and deliberate process will results in a seamless transition. I will remain active with the company in the role of Executive Chairman and very much look forward to continuing to work with Ernie and the team.", "Moving to the third quarter, I\u2019m extremely pleased with our continued strong momentum, we are thrilled with our customer traffic gains as we continue to strive to takes a bigger piece of the pie. We believe on many initiatives to attract new shoppers are working and that we are growing our customer base. It was great to see strong performance across our apparel, accessory and home categories demonstrating that our amazing values and merchandise mix are resonating with our consumers across all of our geographies.", "Earnings per share was $0.86 significantly above our plan, our 5% consolidated comp store sales growth over 2% increase last year continued our strong trend from the first two quarters of the year and was also well above our expectations. The comp was entirely driven by customer traffic. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter and traffic was the primary driver of our comp sales growth. ", "We are also pleased with the significant contributions of our International Divisions and HomeGoods to our consolidated comp performance ,which bodes well for our future growth. Importantly merchandise margins remain strong, even as we deliver great value to our customers and faced significant foreign currency headwinds underscoring the flexibility of our off-price model. ", "We believe our continued strong sales traffic increases and merchandise margins speaks the fundamental strength of this business. Also during the quarter, we were delighted to open our first store in the Netherlands and add Trade Secret in Australia to our family of companies. I\u2019m very happy to say that we now operate in nine countries on three continents. The addition of Australia clearly increases our already enormous global growth opportunities, which Ernie will discuss more on a year-end call in February.", "We are pleased to see our traffic increases continue in the fourth quarter and I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the holiday selling season. We have many surprises in the store for our customers, we see many near and long-term growth opportunities for TJX. To support our goals for growth and gaining market share, we are reinvesting in the business and strengthening our global foundation. I\u2019m very confident that we have the right balance of growth and investment strategies in place to become a $40 billion plus global value retailer.", "So before I continue, I will turn the call over to Scott and he will recap our third quarter numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks Carol and good morning everyone. As Carol mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 5% continuing our strong trend this year and exceeding our plan. This quarter marks our 27th consecutive quarter of consolidated comp store sales growth. As a reminder, our comp sales exclude e-commerce. We were very pleased that customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division. It was also great to see a strong increase in our unit sold again this quarter. As we anticipated, average ticket decreased which was essentially in line where we had planned it.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.86 versus last year\u2019s $0.85 and also well above our plan. It\u2019s important to note that our third quarter EPS growth was negatively impacted by 7% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 4% primarily due to our wage initiatives and incremental investments. ", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 12.1% down 90 basis points versus the record margin in the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.0, down 40 basis points versus last year. Buying and occupancy leverage on the five comp was more than offset by transactional foreign exchange at our international divisions, increased cost associated with moving more units through our supply chain and e-commerce. We are delighted that merchandise margins remain strong in the third quarter, despite these headwinds.", "While overall merchandise margins were down slightly, we were very pleased to see an increase in our brick-and-mortar merchandise margins. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.7%, up 50 basis points versus last year\u2019s ratio. This increase was primarily due to our wage initiative and increased supply chain costs as we had anticipated. ", "At the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories were up 6% on a constant currency basis. We are very comfortable with our inventory position, which we strategically increased ahead of the fourth quarter to provide more flexibility to flow fresh merchandise goods to our stores with greater precession throughout the holiday season. ", "We are in excellent position to take advantage of our flush marketplace for the quality branded merchandize and we will be buying right after the holidays. In terms of share repurchases during the third quarter, we bought back 459 million of TJX stock retiring 6.4 million shares. Year-to-date we have retired 19.1 million shares buying back 1.3 billion of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion of TJX stock this year.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Carol and I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016 guidance at the end of the call.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks, Scott. Now I'll share some color on the third quarter by division. So, in the U.S., Marmaxx comp increased 3% and again this quarter was fantastic to see the comp was entirely driven by customer traffic, while segment profit margin was down 70 basis point, we had anticipated a negative impact to margins from our wage initiative and higher supply chain cost.", "Importantly, for the fourth consecutive quarter we saw an increase in merchandize margin. We continued our strategy of adjusting our pricing and merchandize mix to offer shoppers amazing assortments and value. As we expected this resulted in a lower average ticket, our gains in traffic, units sold and merchandize margins tell us our strategies are clearly working and underscore the flexibility of our business model.", "We believe our ability to adjust our values and mix to suite customers needs and preferences, differentiates us from many other major retailers. We expect our average ticket to be lower again in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our guidance that Scott will review in a moment. We are convinced that our strategies will attract more shoppers during the holiday season, set us up well for the first quarter and benefit our business in the medium and long-term by driving traffic and market share gain.", "Wrapping up on Marmaxx, our apparel business performed well in the third quarter and home and accessories continue their excellent performance. Also, we opened our result in 1000 Marshalls store in October, a proud milestone for our business. HomeGoods delivered another excellent quarter, comps were up 6% over strong 7% increase last year. Segment profit margin increased 10 basis points and as we expected was impacted by our wage initiative.", "We are delighted with HomeGoods continued sharp execution and strong merchandise margin improvement. We believe HomeGoods offers consumer a highly differentiated collection of home fashions from around the world and we could not be more excited about its long-term potential.", "Now moving to our international division, TJX Canada drove outstanding performance again this quarter, comp sales increased 10% marking the third consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was flat, which was well above our expectations.", "As anticipated, the significant year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar negatively impacted TJX Canada's profit and merchandize margins. That said, once again our Canadian organization did a terrific job leveraging our global organization to mitigate some of this currency impact. We are very pleased with our continuing momentum in Canada and the great performance across all three of our Canadian chain.", "TJX Europe\u2019s strong momentum continue with comps up 7%, adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was down 30 basis points, primarily due to significant impact from transactional FX as well as investment in new countries and infrastructure. It was great to see sequential improvement in comp sales again this quarter and such strong performance across each of our geographies. During the quarter, we continue to broaden our European reach with the opening of our first store in the Netherland and our third store in Austria. We are delighted to now be offering great brands fashions and value to consumers in six European countries.", "Now to e-commerce, since launching tjmaxx.com two years ago, we have added more than 3,000 brand in over 25 department. At Sierra Trading Post, we opened our third store in Colorado during the quarter and our first East Coast store Burlington, Vermont last week. Ernie and I were delighted to be at the grand opening, customers love the STP concept. Our e-commerce sites in the U.S. and UK have sensational gift-giving initiatives planned for the holidays. Our aim is to be there for our consumers however and whenever they want to shop us. Our e-commerce site is our another avenue for us to attract more customers and new customers.", "Now to our opportunities for the holiday season and fourth quarter. first, you have probably heard me say this before, but I'm convinced that this holiday season our gift-giving collections are the best we've ever had. Every year we work to raise the bar and be better than a year before. We plan to flow fresh, exciting collection to our stores and online multiple times a week throughout the season. Shoppers can expect to see something new every time they visit, which we believe sets us apart from traditional retailers. ", "Second, I loved our marketing campaigns for all divisions globally, our tri-branded marketing for T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods launched yesterday and we\u2019ll be running every week throughout the holiday season. I believe it captures the nature of our customers, our company speaks to our point of difference in the marketplace will resonate with consumer. We will be leveraging elements of this campaign in Canada for Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls. In Europe, we are leveraging our T.K. Maxx marketing campaign across all geography.", "Third, I\u2019m excited about the in-store initiatives that we have planned, but they will just have to shop our stores to see what they are. Above all, we remain focused on offering consumers amazing values on quality branded merchandise and an eclectic mix from around the world. I\u2019m confident that our stores will have the best gift-giving assortment this holiday season and that will allow shoppers with our values every time they visit.", "Now, moving to our longer term opportunities which we believe will drive profitable growth for many years to come. Starting with driving customer traffic in comp sales, we are delighted with our traffic in comp sales momentum and see huge opportunity to continue growing our U.S. and international market share both through brick-and-mortar and online. ", "We are laser focused on attracting new customers of all ages and encouraging more frequent shopping visit. I believe we become better all the time at leveraging our global marketing capabilities across the company and continue to take a multi-layered approach to advertising through television, radio, digital, social media and mobile.", "We are growing our successful loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada and are pleased with the results of our program in the UK market. Further we strive to improve the shopping experience and make our stores better every day. Our goal is to keep increasing overall customer satisfaction, while making our retail brands more top of mind and must-shop destination for consumers.", "We also see e-commerce as an important growth driver and believe our online platform is differentiated some additional retailers. We continue with our growth smart approach so that both online traffic and sales are incremental to our successful brick-and-mortar business. Secondly, we see enormous global store growth potential. With nearly 3,600 stores today, we see the opportunity to grow by more than 50% to almost 5,500 stores long-term. This reflects the opportunity we see for our current chain and our current markets alone before considering our potential in Australia or other new countries.", "We were very pleased to close our acquisition of Trade Secret in Australia in October. Trade Secret fits directly into our clear vision for global growth and gives us immediate scale and first mover advantage in Australia, a market where we see great potential for our business. As I mentioned, we also opened our first store in the Netherlands, which marks the next logical step in our European expansion and leverages our established European infrastructure and organization. We have thrilled to bring our value to more consumers around the world.", "Lastly, on our long-term growth drivers continuing to be leaders and innovation remain key to our long-term success. We are always working on new seeds and testing ideas across the company that lead to new categories or initiatives to fuel future growth. I\u2019m convinced that our focused on innovation will continue to set us apart from our competition. ", "We are continuing to balance our growth within reinvesting in the business to support our goals and build upon our leadership positions around the world. We are in the fortunate position of having many growth initiatives working and we\u2019ll continue to invest in our stores global infrastructure systems and talent to support them. We\u2019ve confident our investments will help us grow our global market share including broadening reach to Australia to Austria and the Netherlands and expanding to Australia with Trade Secret.", "As to outline while it represents just over 1% of sales today, we see it as an important growth vehicle for the future. We are investing in our online infrastructure and talent to support our plans and eventually rollout e-commerce for additional retail brands. Investing ahead of our growth remains a top priority so we can ensure that we lay a strong foundation today to position us well for tomorrow and many years to come. To be clear, we are investing carefully and methodically, which is evident from our strong balance sheet.", "Summing up, we are thrilled with our continued momentum, the sharp execution across all our geographies and our strong gains and customer traffic which led to above plan results in the third quarter. Our traffic continues to be strong in the fourth quarter, we see exciting opportunities to for holiday season and as always we will strive to surpass our goals.", "We see a marketplace loaded, I would say loaded with quality, brand and merchandise and we are in excellent inventory position to take advantage of this great opportunities. We feel great about our inventory liquidity and plan to be buying right up until Christmas. We are very excited about our holiday marketing and gift-getting initiatives. I believe there are the best we have ever had and will drive traffic to our stores and online. ", "Most importantly, we\u2019ll continue to offer tremendous values for shoppers every time they visit. We are delighted with our entrance into Australia, in the Netherlands as we continue to broaden our global reach. Longer term, we have great confidence that we will continue to build on our leadership position as we keep growing TJX around the globe. We are balancing our growth and investments to capitalize on our first mover advantages in many countries to continue capturing market share and support future of this great company.", "We believe we have one the most consistent business models in all of retail. In 38-years we have seen only one annual comp decline, which very few retailers can say. Year-after-year we have delivered steady sales and earnings growth while simultaneously reinvesting in our business and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.", "Before turning the call over to Scott, I would like to take a moment, as some of you may be concerned about today\u2019s retail environment. To talk why TJX is so different from other retailers and how we continuously drive over comp store increases in many kinds of economic and retail environment, whether it\u2019s very promotional or less promotional. We have built one of the most flexible retail models in the world over many, many years. Our vendor Universe is more than 17,000 and growing and no one brand has ever a substantial portion of our merchandise mix. ", "With our global presence, we have the ability to buy all over the world and offer consumers an eclectic differentiated mix and unique selection. We are always pushing innovation which are convinced is a key to our success. We have a balanced portfolio of businesses in the U.S. and internationally which allows us to leverage our key advantages and mitigate our risk as one part of the world maybe more volatile than another at given time.", "Lastly, our customers are able to experience our treasure hunt any way they please whether at their local store or online 24x7. Over many decades, we have grown TJX into a global off-price powerhouse and we are far from finish. We have a management team that is passionate about driving profitable growth and growing TJX to $40 billion and way beyond.", "Now I will turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance and then we will open it for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks Carol. Now to fiscal guidance beginning with the fourth quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.93 versus last year\u2019s $0.93 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 5% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. Our plans also reflect a 4% negative impact to EPS due to a combination of our wage initiative, incremental investments to grow our market share and pension costs.", "I wanted to note that our plans also reflect a five-penny negative impact to EPS from a combination of factors that were not contemplated in our previous guidance. These costs include costs associated with Trade Secret as we start to integrate it into TJX, a lower average ticket at Marmaxx as Carol mentioned as well as the timing of some expenses.", "We are modeling fourth quarter consolidated sales in the $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion range. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. We are assuming comp sales growth of 2% to 3% on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Fourth quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 11.3% to 11.5% range versus 12.4% last year.", "We are anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 27.7% to 27.8% versus 28.2% last year. This assumes foreign currency pressure and additional supply chain costs. Despite these headwinds, we expect underlying merchandise margins to remain strong.", "We are expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 16.2% versus 15.7% last year primarily due to our wage initiative, costs associated with integrating Trade Secret into our business and increased supply chain costs. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 37.4% and net interest expense of about $13 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately of $676 million. ", "Moving on to full-year guidance, I want to begin by saying that if it were not for acquisition of Trade Secret and the associated of two to three pennies, we would have raised our full-year guidance. We continue to expect fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.28 over $3.15 in fiscal 2015. Excluding last year\u2019s debt extinguishment charge, fiscal 2016 expected EPS would be up 3% to 4% over the prior year\u2019s adjusted $3.16.", "As a reminder, our plans reflect the impact of several items detailed in our press release that we are assuming will negatively impact our fiscal 2016 EPS growth by about 9%. We are increasing our comp sales guidance to reflect our strong third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We are now expecting comp sales growth of 4% to 5% on a consolidated basis. We continue to expect a comp increase of 3% at Marmaxx.", "For the year, we continue to expect pre-tax profit margin to be approximately 11.7% versus last year\u2019s adjusted 12.3%. We are anticipating gross profit margin to be approximately 28.5%, which would be flat versus fiscal 2015. We are planning for a slight increase in merchandise margins. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 16.7% versus 16.1% last year. It\u2019s important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter.", "Before we start Q&A, I want to recap the impact of our wage initiatives on EPS growth as we've had a lot of questions on that. To reiterate what we've said in earlier conference calls wage increases make-up a little more than half of the 4% negative impact to EPS growth this year from the items we've called out, which is a reminder also include incremental investments to support our growth and pension costs.", "So we\u2019re anticipating a negative EPS impact of about 2% to 3% from wage increases in fiscal 2016. As we said before, we\u2019re assuming a larger incremental impact next year, because of our increase to $10 and then annualizing some of this year\u2019s increase to $9. Specifically in fiscal 2017, we would expect wage increases to have a negative impact to EPS growth of approximately 4%. In fiscal 2018, we are assuming the incremental impact will moderate back down to this year\u2019s levels. We\u2019ll talk about the other components of fiscal 2017 guidance on a year-end call in February, but I hope that\u2019s helpful in clarifying the effect we\u2019re anticipating from wages.", "Now, we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we are going to ask you that you please limit your questions to one per person. Thanks. And now we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Omar Saad [Evercore ISI]. Your line is open.", "Omar Saad", "Well thanks. Good morning, great job. Congratulations guys and Carol and Ernie also congratulations on everything going on.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thanks Omar.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Thank you.", "Omar Saad", "Clear changes. Actually I wanted to ask about weather. A year ago, you didn\u2019t mentioned weather at all the day, a lot of retailers this earning season have been talking about weather. A year-ago you guys had talked a little bit about on seasonal weather in the third quarter and unseasonably cold in the first quarter last year. What has change that you have been able to - if anything you have been able to maybe adapt and avoid some of the weather put falls that hit you last year and that are hitting some of the other retailer this year? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So Omar that\u2019s all about execution and delivering the right products to right stores at the right time and every year we learn and we get better weatherproofing our business. And it just comes back to the model, we learn and we keep ourselves very flexible. So it\u2019s just really guys executed extremely well, they did the right categories, the right timing, they did a fabulous job. So I would say rather I you know I would rather not talk about weather, but I hope every single quarter, we get better at figuring out how to transition, so just great execution.", "Omar Saad", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow [Wells Fargo Securities]. Your line is open.", "Ike Boruchow", "Hi. Good morning everyone, let me add my congrats. I appreciate the color next year on the wages and how to think about that. Just to follow that up, the increase in supply chain costs due to the sustain so many units you\u2019ve been running through the supply chain this year and also FX pressures, transaction impact into next year. Is there anything else you could help us when we think about any potential headwind that you might have on margins for next year in terms of those two other buckets?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, I mean our average ticket - as we have said we have that build into our fourth quarter, a little bit into first quarter and then that should start to mitigate at that point. Foreign exchange, I hope it\u2019s an opportunity next year and you never know.", "Ike Boruchow", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss [JPMorgan]. Your line is open.", "Matthew Boss", "Hey, good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Matthew Boss", "So we know apparel promotional and there is inventory in the channel. I guess my question is any changes that you see necessary to your price algorithm versus how you initially laid it out. And then as we think about brick-and-mortar traffic that you generating versus peers. I mean what do you think is the secret sauce that\u2019s driving the continued market share. And then as we think about the open to buying and pack way. I think more so the question is where you stand today versus historically and if you looked back how do you compare availability in the channel today versus the past?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I\u2019m going to throw it over to Ernie for availability, because we are kind of looking at each other and going Oh My God, but any way. First of all, we really aren\u2019t going to talk about our secret sauce, we have built a machine, we have buyers around the world, we think we have the most eclectic exciting mix and that\u2019s what drives our business. Last year, we felt we wanted to improve our apparel mix, I think the guys did a fabulous job of the right brands in the right fashion and Ernie talked inventory, it's just really exciting.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes, I think Matthew first of all in terms of I think your first question was about pricing. We kind of work with the - the buyers are well aware where retails are across the industry and so from there, we are pretty closed in, we decided where the value should be, obviously we need to be the best value and so that's kind of how we do the pricing. We stay consistent for that model, having said that and Carol just started to allude to it. The market as you can imagine right now have availability which we've talked about before, I would say now availability beyond the normal amount of availability, I don't want to give you any specifics, but its across numerous brands and numerous categories throughout the store. And so that certainly helps us with the competitive pricing as you can imagine down the road.", "And as Carol said by the way on the secret sauce we can't give you specifics, but what I think the color I just gave you that that's a bit of how we operate. And as you guys know we have around a 1000 buyers worldwide that are able to take advantage of all the opportunities that are out there and we're into tremendous liquidity position. Right now coming out of this quarter allowing us to take advantage of any of the opportunities with the obvious availability that's out there. As well as our inventories, really in a position to take advantage of some low hanging fruit which we felt we missed some opportunities last fourth quarter on. So, hopefully that answer your questions.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, we're in a fabulous open to buy position.", "Matthew Boss", "Great. Best of luck.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Baker [Deutsche Bank]. Your line is open.", "Mike Baker", "Hi thanks. So a couple of questions, maybe if this is a serious stuff tell me, but so it sounds like you're giving customers a little bit more value to win some share, which seems to be working out. Is that sort of the same type of merchandize, but at better price or you sort of moving the mix down to product that might be a little bit more moderate?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, Mike, some of it is mix, but a lot of it is looking at what we did last year and looking across the country at what is really the right, again the right product in the right parts of the country at the right time. So it's a combination of everything. It's just we get better at it. Every year we look and we say, what did we do wrong and what could we do better? We never look at it as let\u2019s just repeat exactly what we did. We always try and improve and that's the part of innovation, it's part of learning, it's part of our secret sauce, it's part of our sourcing, so we strive to be better every year. That's what keeps our comps going.", "Mike Baker", "Okay that makes sense. If, I could ask just two more quick sort of follow-up questions?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Maybe.", "Mike Baker", "Okay, you said that merchandize margins were up in Marmaxx but\u2026", "Carol Meyrowitz", "On the brick-and-mortar, yes.", "Mike Baker", "Oh, up in Marmaxx brick-and-mortar, okay, that's a clarification. So, why we would e-commerce drag it down? Is that mix, I assume that shipping is not in the merchandize margin, is that right?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, e-commerce doesn't produce the kind of operating income that Marmaxx does it, you are look at 14% almost operating income, so what it does do is build traffic, it is bringing in new customers and it's doing exactly what we wanted to do and it's giving the convenience of shopping, which is why we are differentiating it. Number one, it's not the same as that product in the store, because it's enticing for people to continue shopping 24/7.", "And we believe that as that grows in the future, it brings customers into the store which we are seeing. So the combination of bringing in new customers and seeing a lifetime value of a customer that shops online and in brick-and-mortar, is really what is driving for. So we carefully invest and that's why we're not going dung-ho and investing a billion dollars online that really wouldn't be smart. So when we say we're investing carefully and methodically that's what we mean.", "Mike Baker", "Okay that makes sense. One more, quick one, [indiscernible] me and everyone else how you guys characterize your pack away, I think you said in the past not more than 10% of cost of goods sold, is that still a right way to think about it?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Absolutely, well, yes, we haven't really increased the percentage or - as Ernie just said, the market is so loaded with curing good and that's what you really want. Yes, at the end of the season are they going to be a ton of coats in cold weather available, probably and we'll take full advantage of that but we really want to be the best brands and most of current and the right fashion.", "Mike Baker", "Great, I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is open.", "Gregory Baglione", "Hi everyone this is Greg Baglione for Kimberly. Just first off really a nice quarter, just going back on the merchandize margin question and obviously really strong results year-to-date, aside from the attractive buying environment, could you just talk on a few things that sustain that momentum as you move into 2016. And then just a quick follow-up on Canada, obviously really impressive double-digit comps year-to-date, just any update or thoughts on what's going on in that environment and how you are seeing that longer term? Thanks", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well I'll answer, in terms of Canada I just think the group has been, we\u2019ve built a foundation there Ernie put a team together and I think it\u2019s now they are many years into it and I just their mix is absolutely terrific and they are executing extremely well. I have to go back to your first question, I am not really - didn\u2019t quite understand, you said 2016 merchandise margins. Can you clarify?", "Gregory Baglione", "Just on the strong improvement year-to-date what kind of keeps the momentum going as against next year, I understand the buying environment is very attractive right now, but just any other leverage that really keep that moving forward?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "I think our liquidity position will really help us going forward. We are in a great position in terms of open to buy across the entire company and that really when you have a flush market like we said early on the script, I think really plays to us taking advantages of those opportunities and the margin to your question.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think the other piece is just our supply chain that we move quicker and we invest in that so that we can deliver more often to a store and closer. So the guys will be in the market, probably the week of the holiday or the week right before and that\u2019s what exciting about it. We can buy very close to need. Thank you. We have another question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Yes, the next question is from Stephen Grambling [Goldman Sachs]. Your line is open.", "Stephen Grambling", "Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a follow-up on the EBIT margin comment. Should we be rebasing Marmaxx's margin expectations lower longer term due to the supply chain costs from a lower ticket or e-commerce or can you recoup some of these pressures?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well as I said the average ticket will start to mitigate probably a little less in the first quarter and then will start to really flatten out. On the wage, Scott do you want to reiterate that?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, again we talked about the 4% impact to EPS. We really not at this time we are going to go into it by division, clearly, it effects the domestic divisions but there is going to be some pressure on the European divisions. In Europe, in the UK there is also some legislation passed in terms of higher minimum wage that\u2019s reflected in that 4% number we get, but again a 4% EPS impact next year will effect Marmaxx and the HomeGoods divisions a bit more than they have this year.", "Stephen Grambling", "I guess I was trying to ask another way, just I think historically you were guided to around call it low double-digit or 9% to 13% EPS growth incorporated some EBIT margin expansion and I am wondering has anything changed in that potential for EBIT margin expansion?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We will be going through - at the end of the year we will be talking going forward, but the wage impact will hit us next year. However, there is positive to that and we think that we keep people longer and we build our talent and we think that\u2019s all positive to the in-store experience. So long-term I think that\u2019s going to be positive for us.", "Stephen Grambling", "Great. And I'll seek one other one if I can which is just as you end the year it looks like you are going to be around adjusted an adjusted or adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio around 1.7 times maybe a little above, where as you used to operate in the mid two for a about a decade. Can you just talk to how you evaluate the right leverage ratio for the business?", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Sure. Some of the decrease is obviously by the strong operating performance, some of that is also on how the Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s have changed some of the valuation of the leases, so we\u2019ve had a bit of a benefit from that going from the low two range to the 1.7 that you\u2019ve talked about. But annually we go over the shareholder distribution policies with our Board in terms of what is the right mix of dividends and buyback and certainly we have kept our powder dry on the balance sheet. But at this point we have been trying to grow the dividend ahead of our earnings per growth and share growth and we have been consistently growing in around 20%. But really not going to go through what next year\u2019s plans are at this point other than we have been very consistent in that distribution of all of our excess cash through dividends and buyback and certainly we see no change to that policy.", "Stephen Grambling", "Great. Thanks. Best of luck for the holiday.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Roxanne Meyer [MKM Partners]. Your line is open.", "Roxanne Meyer", "Great. Thanks. Let me add my congratulations on a really solid quarter. Two questions for you. One, I was wondering if you could elaborate on a strength that you are seeing in Canada and Europe now for a couple of quarters and really what is behind that and driving that in each market? And then second, how should we think about the accretion of Trade Secret overtime, obviously it\u2019s small, but curious to know if you can share your expectations for the impact? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay, well Roxanne really the strength in Europe and Canada, I'm kind of repeating myself is really about execution. We really act as one and a global organization so we are able to advantage of the trends around the world and I just think that our team is getting stronger and stronger. So it just comes down to share execution. In terms of Trade Secret. Well we\u2019re hoping a little bit smaller, but we\u2019re hoping it\u2019s a mini Canada, so we\u2019re pretty excited about it. We\u2019ll invest in it appropriately, but we think it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity, there is really no great value retailers there, it\u2019s a very strong demographic average income, it\u2019s actually a little bit higher than Canada. So we\u2019re feeling great about it.", "Roxanne Meyer", "Great. Thanks and best of luck for holiday.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Lejuez [Citi]. Your line is open.", "Paul Lejuez", "Hey thanks guys. Just going back to Omar\u2019s question. Can you actually share with us the comp by region. Just kind of curious about the delta between some of your stronger regions and which ones those were as well as your weaker regions. And then just second tjmaxx.com or tkmaxx.com are either of those large enough and growing fast enough to move the comp isle if they were to be included in your overall comp? Thanks.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "So Paul, we were across the board strong, I\u2019m not going to divided up by region, but we just had strong comp across the board. And as far as T.J. Maxx, Scott you do want to comment on that, I mean it\u2019s small today, it\u2019s a good growth but\u2026", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, I would just say it\u2019s too small enough at this point, it will just be a rounding if you happen to be close enough to make it round up or down, so I would say it\u2019s just too small.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Even combined.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, because as we\u2019ve said before the total sales of the e-commerce businesses in an around the 1% range.", "Paul Lejuez", "Got you. And then just one follow-up. Can you talk inventory by division where you might be a little bit heavier or lighter going to 4Q?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "No, the real answer we\u2019re in great shape across the Board.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, I mean, we don\u2019t go by prior division, I think as Ernie said, we feel real comfortable as we try to point out, it\u2019s a timing of the inventory. So our inventories at the store level are exactly where we would want them to be and at the end of the third quarter.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Well on the DCs some of that\u2019s or flow for opportunities like in Marmaxx. Basically in ratio to the sales I would tell you that each division is right where we want them to be. So we do look at it that way Paul, we look at the similar trend with the open to buy, with the inventory level not just one aspect. And at the same time by the way globally there is so much availability across every market that applies to Canada, Europe, U.S. and other markets that we didn\u2019t even name. Again, we\u2019re feeling very good about the inventory level relative to the sales trend in each division.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And just to reiterate on the inventory. I mean although we are up 6% on a per store basis. As we\u2019ve said we would expect the end of the year inventory to be slightly up on a per store basis, again with stores where we were and obviously that means the DC inventory would be coming down accordingly. So we feel real good about that and again we have total sales plans with the comp and total close to 7% built in here.", "Paul Lejuez", "Great. Thank you guys, good luck.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question we have comes from Bob Drbul [Nomura]. Your line is open.", "Robert Drbul", "Hi. Just a couple of quick questions. On the wage investments are you seeing a tighter labor market or are you having any challenge with the growth getting to right people into the stores?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Not at all. If anything, we think we\u2019re attracting really traffic people. It\u2019s so important to understand our culture too and that\u2019s what really keeps our turnover pretty low and keeps people here year-after-year. We\u2019re actually going to be soon hitting a 40-year anniversary of our first off prior store.", "Robert Drbul", "Great. And then just couple of questions on the e-commerce side. In terms of the expansion of brands with be offering there. Are you having luck taking your current brands or in the stores and expanding them online, are you getting that opportunity. Can you just talk about like success that you\u2019re having with categories or success that you expect to have as you add new categories online?", "Scott Goldenberg", "So Bob we can talk about, yes we\u2019ve been opening up more and more of current brick-and-mortar vendors onto the website. We don\u2019t want to give specific names there, but that\u2019s kind of an open book, you can shop the website and you\u2019ll see them. Additionally, I would tell you without giving information specifically on how our category is doing. And I think we\u2019ve talked about it before we\u2019ve added new categories throughout the last six to nine months on the website and we are pleased with the way the new categories are performing. So that\u2019s something you will see us continuing to do, but nothing jumps up by the way, it\u2019s all kind of in proportion to the business, if you look at each category that\u2019s on there they are all performing relatively similar in terms of the total, but we do look to continuing to offer more brands there.", "Robert Drbul", "Great. And just like it sounds like the inventory buying environment is pretty good for you guys I don\u2019t know if you could just maybe give us the last time you saw environment like this in terms of your availability and the deals that you\u2019re able to buy and seeing?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. I\u2019m going to tell first of all, there isn\u2019t a year that Ernie is not like making the guide stay home. So it\u2019s very plentiful now but every single year, we never have a shortage of finding merchandise that we love. So it just a matter of the magnitude of it, its plentiful today. But again it\u2019s not - we\u2019ve always had to manage our open to buy globally, it\u2019s an ongoing process.", "Robert Drbul", "Okay. Thank you very much. Carol congratulations and Ernie best of luck, congratulations to you.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question we have comes from Brian Tunick [RBC Capital]. Your line is open.", "Brian Tunick", "Thanks I'll add my congrats as well. I guess we\u2019ve talked about that secular shift away from the department stores, I guess now it\u2019s resulting in I guess new off-price competition for you. How, I guess do you guys or your buyers maybe think about the new off-price entrance and have the vendors are going to deal with that? And then secondly what are you seeing on the real estate availability side or on the rent side as you look to sign these leases for 2016? Thanks very much.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Okay. First of all, there is always competition in the world. We were just talking the other day and Ernie said, you remember [Low Men's] (Ph) and how many off-price stores there were out there. Our job is to be innovative, to be ahead of it. We've built a machine with the number of stores we have I mean 3,600 stores the vendor relationships, the cloud, the global leveraging, is all what makes TJX what it is, we\u2019ve been doing this for almost 40-years.", "So there is always competition and our job is to be outrageous value every day and have a very unique eclectic mix and that\u2019s what we strive for. We don\u2019t harp on we move forward, we don\u2019t harp on the competition, we like competition, we like when we are next two, I won\u2019t name certain stores, but we\u2019re fine with it, it brings traffic and our job is to do a better job.", "In terms of real estate, we\u2019re excited, because we\u2019ve opened more countries and Ernie is always balancing how much to do in Europe, how much to do in the United States, but we\u2019ll update you on a store count next year, but today its business as usual.", "Operator", "Next question, ma\u2019am?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes. Do we have another question?", "Operator", "Yes. So next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Your line is open.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the questions around Europe. How is the home penetration in Europe and how is that business done? And I guess following on that are there any updated thoughts on potentially open in a new concept in there to focus on that?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "You mean expand our concept?", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Right. Sorry expand your existing\u2026", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes [indiscernible] Ernie.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes. So Lorraine the home business has been very strong there and what Carol is just joking about is you know we have HomeSense there, which has been expanding sporadically I would say or cautiously we\u2019ve been expanding. But now we\u2019re going on really a pretty long stretch here, strong home business and I would tell you it has grown in percent for the total there. We can\u2019t give you that number, but we can tell you it has grown and we are looking to continue to expand that business and that banner and its healthy in TK as well. So our home business is very healthy in Europe and we look at that further as an opportunity.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "And sorry I was referring to new market specifically, are there plans to open the HomeSense into some of the new countries that you\u2019ve entered?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "We will eventually, yes. Lorraine I think the thing - what Ernie is doing right now is building the buying group and the team to get a strong foundation, but certainly that\u2019s not in our store count, but we certainly see it is.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "We see that as an opportunity for sure.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Binetti [UBS]. Your line is open.", "Michael Binetti", "Hey guys good morning and congrats on a nice quarter. I know we asked this, there is a few questions on AUR and strategy here and you\u2019ve mentioned that it starts to flatten as we get into it the early in the year. But given that its sluggish industry backdrop and sales loaded inventory levels we\u2019re seeing across the space. Would you guys thinking other strategic decision to lower AURs again in 2016 to maintain that relative price gap as the soft line competitors. Do you say more promotional or is your view late in the year that it flattens out, is that an expression of your opinion that this is temporary for area like the department stores and that they will be back to normally AURs and will be relative value next year?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I think it\u2019s a combination of mix and also the level of brands. I mean we are getting outrageous deals from a lot of better brands. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable with going into the second quarter. We will always keep the right distance between us and everyone it may be, yes we will be at the right value, but I think we're pretty clear in what we see going forward.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Yes, and because of the open to buy position we're in, whatever happens around us and I think Carol is saying the same things as we can adapt, our buyers will really decide closer in, because we have so much open to buy that we buy so close to me, which is part of our model on flexibility we've talked about that we'll be able to adapt to whatever is going on retail around us. There is a little bit of a lag, but for the most part we will adjust based on that.", "Michael Binetti", "And then your traffic trends in this backdrop suggests that you're gaining share and accelerating pace, and you pointed to some solid trends with new customer acquisition. Could you talk a little bit about what difference you're seeing in the mix of demographics and new customers, compared to the newly recruited customers a few years ago. A few years ago there was a lot of commentary on being more relevant with budget strap millennials coming out of recession, I'm curious what kind of customers are entering the franchise today.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Yes, we're getting the younger customers. We absolutely are, even in our HomeGoods is even getting younger customer, and they're targeting it, we want to get them young and we want to keep them, but we're keeping our -- again we've such a wide demographic of all the customers and younger, but our newer customers are tending to be younger.", "Michael Binetti", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from Marni Shapiro [The Retail Tracker]. Your line is open.", "Marni Shapiro", "Hey guys congratulations and congratulations Ernie and Carol, so, when you retire [indiscernible] I think you would much better than that currently we have out there?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I don't want to be President but [indiscernible].", "Marni Shapiro", "On wages, I just wanted to follow-up on the wages, along with raising the wages, first of all are you doing this globally, are you doing this also at the manager, assistant manager and regional manager level. And at the same time are you shifting to more full-time employment versus part-time employment, if you could just give a little more insight there?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "I mean basically we're raising the average pay, we look at it across the board, everything that Scott gave you in terms of the number is inclusive and it's inclusive of what we've done globally. So, A, we've buy the by the laws, but B, we felt it was the right thing to do and our goal is to retain people and to build to our culture. We look at everything in the long-term and we want people to come into work here and be happy everyday and work harder at TJX. So, I think we're building the right environment and I think we're doing all the right things for the future.", "Marni Shapiro", "Are you shifting to have more full-time people - employers or that's not part of the strategy?", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well, pretty much the way we're today, we haven't really changed this.", "Scott Goldenberg", "In the last couple of years, it's been pretty steady.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Right.", "Marni Shapiro", "That\u2019s fantastic. Great guys, best of luck for the holidays.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Thank you.", "Ernie L. Herrman", "Thank you.", "Carol Meyrowitz", "Well I want to thank everyone and have a great holiday and we look forward to reporting our fourth quarter and have a great one and thank you Melissa.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Thanks, Gabby. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.", "Debra McConnell - Senior Vice President, Global Communications", "Good morning.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we'll discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today's press release or otherwise posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you. And now, I'll turn it back over to Ernie.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call are Carol Meyrowitz and Scott Goldenberg. Before I begin, I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of myself, our entire management team and our organization to express our sincerest gratitude to Carol. For nine years as CEO and over a long tenure with the company, Carol has led TJX to great success with achievements too numerous to cover on this call. I am delighted that, in her new role as Executive Chairman, Carol and I will continue our 20-plus years of working together. Thank you, Carol.", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Executive Chairman", "Thank you.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "I'd like to start by saying that 2015 was another terrific year for TJX. We surpassed $30 billion in sales, and consolidated comp sales increased a strong 5%, which is well above our plan. We are extremely pleased that the comp was driven entirely by customer traffic. Consumers are loving our stores and shopping as even more frequently. We are convinced we are gaining market share profitably around the world.", "On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 5%, also above our expectations and over a strong 12% increase the prior year. 2015 marks the 20th consecutive year of comp and EPS gains for TJX. In our 39-year history, we have seen only one comp store sales decline. We're also very pleased that we drove merchandise margin increases while offering even more amazing values to our customers. It's important to note that we achieved these results despite significant foreign currency headwinds, as well as reinvesting in the business.", "Further, we were thrilled that our momentum continued into the fourth quarter. We ended the year with fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our plans. It's also great to see such consistency in our business with comps hitting 5% to 6% every quarter of the year. Our 2015 performance once again demonstrates the power of our differentiated flexible business model to succeed across many different geographic, economic and retail environments. We were thrilled to expand our global footprint into Austria, the Netherlands and Australia in 2015. So, now, we operate in nine countries across three continents.", "Looking ahead, I am very excited about the future of TJX. We entered 2016 with terrific momentum, and the year is off to a strong start. We are convinced that we can continue growing our customer base around the world and are pursuing various opportunities to capture market share. To support our goals for growth, we are continuing to make strategic investments in the business. I am also confident that we are making the right investments today that will help us grow to $40 billion and beyond. As always, we have a management team that is passionate about achieving its plans and, more importantly, passionate about striving to surpass them.", "Before I continue, I'll now turn the call over to Scott to recap our fourth quarter and full year numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with some more details on our full year fiscal 2016 results. Again, we are thrilled that our 5% consolidated comp increase was entirely driven by customer traffic. It was also great to see that customer traffic was the primary driver of the comp increase at each of our divisions. We believe we are gaining share profitably across all geographies. As a reminder, our comp sales exclude e-Commerce.", "Diluted earnings per share were $3.33, a 5% increase over last year's adjusted $3.16, and exceeded our most recent guidance. It's important to note that our full year EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 4% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 4% due to our wage initiative, as well as incremental investments and pension costs.", "For the full year, consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 11.8%, down 50 basis points versus last year's adjusted 12.3%. Gross profit margin was 28.8%, up 30 basis points versus last year; and merchandise margins were also up. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.8%, up 70 basis points versus last year's ratio.", "Now, to our fourth quarter results. Consolidated comps increased 6% over a 4% increase last year and well above our plan. This marks our 28th consecutive quarter of consolidated comp store sales growth. We were very pleased that our fourth quarter comp was also entirely driven by customer traffic. As with the year, traffic was also the primary driver of each division's quarterly comp increase.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.99, a 6% increase over \u2013 versus last year and also well above our plan. It's important to note that our fourth quarter EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 4% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 5% due to our wage initiative as well as incremental investments and pension costs.", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margins was 11.9%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 28.7%, up 50 basis points versus last year. This was due to an increase in merchandise margin and strong buying and occupancy leverage on the 6% comp. We are very pleased with our gross margin and merchandise margin increases, despite the significant negative impact from transactional foreign exchange at TJX Canada and TJX International and increased costs associated with moving more units through our supply chain.", "SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.7%, up 100 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to our wage initiative, as we had anticipated, as well as contribution to TJX's charitable foundations, higher incentive compensation accruals due to the company's above planned performance and increased supply chain costs. At the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories, on a per store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding inventories -- but excluding in transit and e-commerce inventories, were up 6% on a constant currency basis. We took advantage of some amazing pack-away opportunities during the fourth quarter and ended the year in an excellent inventory position.", "Now, to recap our fourth quarter performance by division. Marmaxx finished 2016 with its best quarter of the year. Comps grew by a very strong 6% on top of a very solid 3% increase last year. Once again, it was terrific to see that the comp increase was entirely driven by customer traffic. As we had planned, with our merchandising and value strategies, we saw significant increase in transactions and units sold as well as a decrease in average ticket.", "Apparel, including accessories and home, both had excellent performance, which is nice to see in today's retail environment. Segment profit margin was flat, as Marmaxx's significant merchant margin increased and buying and occupancy leverage offset the expected impact of our wage initiative, higher supply chain cost and investments in e-commerce. We began the new year with great momentum at our largest division.", "HomeGoods delivered another outstanding quarter. Comps increased 7% over last year's strong 11% growth, and segment profit margin was up 60 basis points. We are very pleased with HomeGoods' strong increase in merchandise margins. The customers clearly love HomeGoods, as we keep growing this premium brand.", "At TJX Canada, comps grew a phenomenal 14% over a strong 7% increase last year. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, decreased 140 basis points, primarily due to transactional foreign exchange, as well as higher incentive compensation accruals, due to TJX Canada's above-planned performance.", "I want to point out that the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar had a significant negative impact on this division's merchandise margins. Once again, the efforts that our Canadian organization made to mitigate this currency impact were terrific and highly effective. We are very pleased that all three chains delivered great performance.", "Now, to our businesses beyond North America. These include our European business and Trade Secret in Australia, which together now comprise TJX International. TJX International's comp growth was 1%. And adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, decreased 170 basis points. This was primarily due to investments in new countries and transactional foreign exchange, as well as some deleverage on the 1% comp.", "While the fourth quarter was softer than we would have liked, we are pleased with the improving comp trends we are seeing in this business. Further, TJX International delivered an excellent year. On our e-commerce sites in the U.S. and UK, we also offered customers a constant flow of gift-giving selections at amazing values throughout the holiday season. We have added thousands of new brands to tjmaxx.com since we launched and plan to continue adding new categories and brands to all of our sites.", "Now, to our financial strength and shareholder distributions; our business continues to generate excellent cash flows and strong financial returns. In fiscal 2016, free cash flow was $2 billion and ROIC was a strong 22%, one of the highest we have seen in retail, thanks, in large part, due to our disciplined approach to capital allocation. As always, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs, while simultaneously reinvesting in the business for the near and long term.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our first quarter and full year fiscal 2017 guidance at the end of the call.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Thanks, Scott. First, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights from the fourth quarter. Again, we were thrilled to end 2015 with such a strong finish. Customer response to our exciting assortments and great values was terrific this holiday selling season, as well as during the post-holiday period. Every year, we work to improve over the year before. I believe that our marketing, in-store initiatives, gift-giving and constant freshness were even better than last year and truly set us apart from other retailers. We believe this drove new shoppers to our stores and encouraged more frequent shopping trips. Also, we liked how we transitioned our stores after the holidays with our stores looking extremely fresh.", "Now, I'd like to talk about the major strengths that differentiate TJX from so many other retailers. We're convinced that the same elements of our business that differentiate us from other retailers are also key to our continued successful global growth. Further, we believe these elements would be extremely difficult for others to replicate.", "First, we have a world-class global buying organization that I believe is the best in retail. There are over 1,000 people in our buying organization. And our total merchandising organization, which includes our planning and allocation group, (14:38) is nearly double that size. Our buyers are located in 11 countries across four continents, and we source from a universe that now numbers more than 18,000 vendors in over 100 countries. This is why we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine.", "Many in our merchandising organization have been with us for multiple decades, and we have dedicated nearly 40 years to cultivating the talent and off-price expertise of our teams as well as improving on our buying processes. Further, we take enormous pride in our strong corporate culture, which I am convinced is a key factor in our recruiting and retaining top talent.", "Second, our global supply chain and distribution network have been developed and refined over nearly 40 years to support our highly integrated international business and opportunistic buying. There is no off-the-shelf, off-price inventory management software to support a global business model like ours, which is why our proprietary IT systems are designed specifically to handle our off-price buying. Our distribution network can process buys as small as 100 units to over 1 million units from any one of our thousands of vendors in a timely and efficient manner and then allocate that merchandise to the right stores at the right time. We continue to invest in our supply chain ahead of our store growth to ensure that we have sufficient capacity to support new stores, new chains and new countries.", "Third, we are capitalizing on our global presence. TJX is the only major international off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the world. We are one of the few major U.S. retailers to have expanded successfully internationally. We are the largest off-price retailer in the U.S. and Canada and remain the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer in Europe and Australia. We operate highly-integrated and synergistic businesses across many geographies and have built global teams and international infrastructures over many decades. We see our international depth and expertise as a major advantage, as we continue to expand our value concept around the world.", "These key strengths allow TJX to be one of the most flexible retailers in the world. Our best-in-class buying organization, combined with our vast vendor universe, allow us to be nimble in the marketplace and capitalize on the best opportunities. The flexibility of our stores and distribution network allow us to respond quickly to changing customer preferences and trends across many different retail and consumer environments around the world. Further, while we offer consumers many different chains and merchandise categories, each of our four major divisions operate on the same off-price business model.", "We function as one TJX and leverage talent, infrastructure, ideas and expertise across the chains. This is an important advantage when opening new stores, launching new chains, entering new markets or testing new seeds. All of these factors give us great confidence that we can continue our successful, profitable global growth. Further, I believe that it is often underestimated how difficult it would be for other retailers to try and replicate these strengths. These key advantages also underscore our confidence in our ability to gain market share profitably and achieve our long-term goals for growth.", "Let me take a moment to review our major growth drivers, and there are really three. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We were very pleased with our traffic gains at all divisions in 2015, yet we are convinced that significant opportunity remains to gain market share. We reach an extremely wide demographic, and we like the growth in our customer base across all ages, particularly millennials, across all of our divisions.", "To attract more new customers, we will continue to leverage our global marketing capabilities. During the holiday season, we again leveraged our tri-branded campaigns across the U.S. and Canada and believe that they helped drive more customers to our stores. In 2016, we are strategically shifting our marketing dollars to spend more in certain markets and geographies to capitalize on our biggest opportunities. We are continuing our integrated marketing approach to engage with shoppers of all ages through television, radio, digital, mobile and social media. To encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping of our brands, we are growing our successful loyalty programs in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. We also continue to upgrade the shopping experience and plan to remodel about 240 stores across the company in 2016.", "We were pleased to see our overall customer satisfaction scores increase in 2015, but still see room to become even better on this front. We are confident our wage initiative will help us attract and retain talented store associates. I should note that, while we are always working on improving efficiencies in our business, we haven't taken any customer-facing actions that would diminish the pleasant shopping experience that we want to ensure for our consumers. Importantly, we see e-commerce as another great way to drive customer traffic both online and to our other stores \u2013 to our stores.", "Our second major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. As I just discussed, our ability to leverage our global teams' infrastructure and operational expertise are major reasons for our confidence and being able to continue to open stores profitably around the world. With over 3,600 stores today, we see the potential to grow by more than 50% to 5,600 stores long term. To be clear, this reflects the potential we see with our existing chains in our existing countries alone. But beyond this, we believe huge opportunity remains.", "In North America, we see the potential to add over 1,400 stores. In the U.S., we are far from finished growing our largest and most profitable division. Marmaxx is nearly a $20 billion business and T.J. Maxx and Marshalls each have more than 1,000 stores, yet we are confident meaningful opportunity remains to continue growing both chains. Long term, we see Marmaxx growing to approximately 3,000 stores. At HomeGoods, plenty of white space remains across the U.S. We see this chain expanding to at least 1,000 stores, almost double its existing base. And in Canada, our long-term target is about 500 stores. In Europe, we see the long-term potential to expand to 975 stores, almost double our current base. This reflects the potential we see for T.K. Maxx in our current geographies alone and HomeSense in the U.K., and this is before we consider the growth prospects that we see in other countries.", "We are pleased with our launches in Austria and in the Netherlands, which underscored our confidence entering into Australia. We see the potential to develop Trade Secret in Australia as similar to how we grew our Canadian business from a five-store chain to that country's leading off-price retailer. Australia has a population about 2/3 the size of Canada's with similar customer demographics. This underscores our confidence in our ability to grow Trade Secret to be at least a 124 \u2013 125-store chain. Clearly, this number could be conservative and it reflects just the potential we see in the early days of owning this business.", "Before I wrap up on store growth, I want to say that we are extremely pleased to have grown our store base by 185 stores for a strong 5% in fiscal 2016. In addition to being at the upper end of our 4% to 5% range for the last several years, we plan to continue at this pace in fiscal 2017. It also feels great to say that even in today's volatile retail environment, we closed only one store last year. That's on a store base of over 3600 stores. All of this speaks to the fundamental strength of our business, our disciplined approach to real estate and our decades of operating expertise in the U.S. and internationally. I should note that while we are opportunistic in our real estate strategies as well and see volatility in the marketplace as an advantage for our business.", "The third major growth driver is new seeds and innovation. We are constantly testing new seeds and ideas across the company that could reap tremendous benefits for the future. We are very happy with the early reads in our new Sierra Trading Post stores, and we would be thrilled for STP to eventually become a fourth major chain in the U.S. and Canada. Also, our successful expansion of T.K. Maxx into Austria and the Netherlands further demonstrates that our value proposition can work in many other European markets.", "Okay. I'll wrap with our outlook for 2016. We are delighted with the great momentum in the business and our healthy start to the year. Our business is very strong, and we have many initiatives underway to drive sales and traffic. Our plan for earnings per share growth this year reflects the expected negative impact due to foreign currency and our wage initiative. In addition, investing in initiatives to gain market share and to strengthen our leadership positions around the world remains a top priority. We are committed to carefully balancing our growth and investments, and we remain disciplined in our approach.", "In 2016, we plan to continue investing in our stores, talent, supply chain, IT and new seeds. Our strategy is to invest ahead of our growth, and we are confident that we are making the right investments today that will give us a strong foundation for the future. Importantly, we are investing in initiatives in which we have decades of knowledge and expertise. All of this gives us great confidence that our investment strategies will be successful. We see many exciting opportunities to expand TJX, both domestically and internationally. We are confident that these investments we are making today will strongly position us to reach the next level of growth. As always, we are laser-focused on beating our plans. I could not be more excited about the future of TJX. This is a great company, and I am confident we will continue to deliver successful growth for many years to come.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then, we'll open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Ernie. Now, to fiscal 2017 guidance, beginning with the full year. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.29 to $3.38, which would be down 1% to up 2% versus $3.33 in fiscal 2016. As Ernie mentioned, similar to last year, in fiscal 2017, we are planning our earnings per share to reflect the negative impact from a couple of factors.", "First, similar to last year, we expect foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange to negatively impact fiscal 2017 EPS growth by approximately 4%. Again, this year, it's primarily the result of the dramatic decline in the Canadian dollar and British pound rates versus the prior year. Of course, it's important to remember that FX could moderate or benefit us in the future.", "Secondly, as we detailed in our third quarter earnings call, we are assuming that our wage initiative will have a negative impact of about 4% to fiscal 2017 EPS growth. As always, we are extremely focused on controlling cost and striving to succeed with our plans. Our EPS guidance assumes consolidated sales in the $32.2 to $32.5 billion range, a 4% to 5% increase over the prior year. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. We are assuming a 1% to 2% comp increase on a consolidated basis.", "We expect pre-tax profit margin to be in the range of 10.9% to 11.1% versus 11.8% in fiscal 2016. We are planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.3% to 28.5% versus 28.8% last year. In terms of the pressure we see currency having on our mark-on and merchandise margins at TJX Canada and TJX International, we expect the negative impact to be even larger than last year. Excluding the currency headwind, we would expect the consolidated underlying merchandise margin to be flat to slightly up this year versus last year.", "We're planning SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 17.2% to 17.3% versus 16.8% last year, primarily due to our wage initiative. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.2%, net interest expense of about $54 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 662 million.", "Now, to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are planning a comp growth of 1% to 2% on sales of $20.5 billion to $20.7 billion and segment profit margin in the range of 13.6% to 13.8%. As a reminder, in fiscal 2017, we are planning Marmaxx's average ticket lower in the first half of the year and essentially flat for the second half.", "At HomeGoods, we expect comp increases \u2013 comps to increase 3% to 4% on sales of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion and segment profit margin to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.1%.", "For TJX Canada, we are planning a comp increase of 3% to 4% on sales of $2.9 billion and adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency to be in the range of 12.1% to 12.3%.", "At TJX International, we're expecting a comp increase of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.6 billion and adjusted pre-tax margin excluding foreign currency to be in the range of 5.6% to 5.8%.", "Now, to Q1 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.70 versus last year's $0.69 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of approximately 2% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 3% due to our wage initiative.", "We're modeling first quarter consolidated sales in the $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion range. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx.", "First quarter pre-tax profit margin is planned in the 10.2% to 10.4% range versus 11.1% the prior year. We're anticipating first quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.2% to 28.3%, flat to down 10 basis points versus the prior year. We're expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the 17.8% to 17.9% range versus 17.0% last year.", "For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4%, net interest expense of about $13 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 669 million. It's important to remember that our guidance for the first quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the first quarter.", "Moving to our store growth plans for fiscal 2017. We plan to add approximately 195 new stores, which would bring our year-end total to about 3,809 stores. This represents store growth of approximately 5% and is at the upper end of our range for the last several years. I want to point out that our plans this year assume no store closings across our entire global store base. Beginning with the U.S., our plans call for us to open about 60 additional stores at Marmaxx and 50 more stores at HomeGoods. We also plan to open about five additional Sierra Trading Post stores this year.", "In Canada, we plan to add about 30 new stores. This reflects the opportunities we see to further expand winners into rural markets as well as our nationwide opportunities for Marshalls. In Europe, we plan to continue our significant pace of store growth, opening approximately 50 stores this year. This includes our plans to continue expanding into Austria and the Netherlands.", "I'll wrap up with our financial strength and stability, which clearly gives us tremendous confidence. In fiscal 2017, we plan to continue our balanced approach to the use of cash. With our increased investments to gain share and support our growth initiatives, we're planning for capital spending to increase to approximately $1.1 billion. In fiscal 2017, we expect that the Board of Directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 24% on top of our 20% increase last year. This would mark our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. We're planning to buy back $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion of TJX stock. Even with this level of shareholder distributions, we still plan to end fiscal 2017 with $1.7 billion to $2 billion in cash and short-term investments, which points to our significant financial flexibility.", "Now, we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we're going to continue to ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. Thanks. And now, we will open it up to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line Omar Saad. Sir, your line is open.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Yes. It's Omar Saad at Evercore ISI. Thanks for taking my questions. Great quarter, guys. Wanted to dive in on the gross margin line a little bit deeper. Ernie and Scott, the transactional piece sounds a little bit bigger than perhaps we were thinking about it. I had been under the impression, in the European market, you buy in pounds and euros, but maybe Canada is different. And help me think about the potential to perhaps use price increase or mix as a way to offset the transactional impact, something that some other companies in the apparel space are using.", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, first, I'll just give you a bit of the breakdown there. The components of the 4%, Omar, that we're talking about next year are largely split between translational, which is just taking the current British pound and the Canadian dollar with what averages we actually incurred last year. The rest of that is just, again, the drop-off of the currency that we've seen in both the British pound and Canadian dollar. And unfortunately, or fortunately for us, most of our purchases have not been made, so they're going to be subject now to this lower Canadian dollar. If we had bought out, like other chains, you would probably have less of an impact. But with a big drop-off, you're still going to have a drop-off that at this point is a bit more than last year.", "I'll now turn it over to Ernie.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Yeah, Omar, a good question. What happens on that front \u2013 by the way, maybe adjusting retails would make sense if we saw others doing that. We haven't experienced that to that degree. And our number one strategy, as you can see, overall, has been to gain market share. So, we're on this mission to continue to offer the outrageous value and not being the first one to try to up the retail. So, we've been successful of recent by ensuring our value is the sharpest out there. So, we do not want to mess with that. And even though we're getting hit on the buying of the goods in U.S. dollars with the Canadian dollar translation, we still haven't moved our values. And I believe, if you'll look at our Canadian comps, it's helping us gain significant market share actually in that market. So, right now, that's the strategy that we're focused on.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. That makes a lot of sense, but just, Scott, to be clear, the Canadian market \u2013 you're buying in Canadian dollars for the Canadian market. But in the U.K., are you buying in British pounds, the cost of goods?", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "So, Omar, what it is \u2013 actually, in both markets we buy certain percentage of the mix. And so, in Canada, and I think we've been public on this, we buy about half the mix in U.S. dollars and the other half is not. It's Canadian bought. So, that's still a big chunk, as you can imagine.", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "And then, in Europe, we buy...", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Smaller, smaller...", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, we \u2013 right. About half of our goods are bought, let's just say, between U.S. dollars and euro and then...", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Right.", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "That's about half-split between \u2013 of that 50% between the U.S. dollar and the euro.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Right.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thank you. That's really helpful. Good luck, guys.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe. Sir, your line is open.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks very much, guys, and really, congratulations on a very strong quarter. I guess, a two-part question; one is, the traffic strength has been remarkable. I'm wondering, what are the levers you're pulling or what is the source of the success there, marketing, direct mail, the e-commerce, the effort we've seen in the U.S. And then, if you could just comment briefly on the decrease in ticket at Marmaxx and if it's the same at each division.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Okay, Richard. So, let's start at the top there. In terms of the traffic, first of all, there are a lot of levers being pulled, just as you mentioned. Marketing \u2013 it's never one thing. Obviously, we won't give any specific breakdowns on it, but marketing is a play. We've been very happy, as you can see, and you witnessed some of it. I'm sure, some of the creative we've had out there like our tri-brand campaign at holiday and we like what we're hitting out there with \u2013 for this first quarter coming up. Our loyalty programs have been strong, so also very happy with that.", "I would tell you one of the key drivers, though, still, especially in a business like ours, which has so much traffic and frequency of shopping, is that we've been executing the model, which is to deliver great goods at exciting values. And we've been going after, clearly, these brands and quality and fashion at retails that, in some cases, are obviously lower. That's a piece of why the average ticket had dropped, so to your question there.", "By the way, your other part of your question, with the average ticket drop, we've had a little bit of it in the other divisions, but Marmaxx has really been more or so the division that has experienced more of it. It's not as big a swing in other places in the corporation. But the traffic, we've been happy with it because we feel like we're working on all fronts. And even at this point in time, the amount of branded pack-away opportunities that have existed out there has really allowed us to position ourselves going into the new year, we think, to continue to help with the traffic pull.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "How much is that pack-away?", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "We cannot give you that number. That is a good question. If you'd like to, maybe you'd like to ask Carol to see if she'd...", "Carol M. Meyrowitz - Executive Chairman", "Yeah, you'll get that out of me.", "Unknown Speaker", "Thanks, Carol.", "Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger. Ma'am, your line is open.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks so much. I was wondering \u2013 Scott, you talked about rising supply chain costs. Is there -- can you just put some numbers around that? Are supply chain costs simply increasing because TJX volumes continue to grow quarter after quarter and year after year? Or is there some deleveraging happening within the supply chain? And I'm wondering if you have any initiative in 2016 or 2017 on the supply chain side. Thanks so much.", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. The biggest piece of the supply chain cost than last year and will be more in first half-oriented this year relate to the lower average retail at Marmaxx and the cost \u2013 moving more units through \u2013 moving through our networks. So, we would expect that piece of that to moderate substantially in the back half at the moment.", "The other piece, frankly, relates to \u2013 we did not plan, going back a few years ago, the 7% to 8% comps that we've experienced at HomeGoods, the double-digit comp increase that we've had at Canada, thereby necessitating really more of a timing moving forward some of the needs for our supply chain infrastructure. And even a little bit of that at Marmaxx, given the lower average retail. So, this is more of a timing over the next year or two years, where we continue to have those incremental costs and we would see that moderate over time.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "And at the same time, adding into that, we have, as you've seen in the plans, we've upped the amount of HomeGoods new store openings, which is also in addition to our \u2013 obviously, our comps, is adding to additional capacity needs because we're very bullish on the future of our store openings with HomeGoods.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "All high-class problems. Thanks so much, and congratulations on a great year.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss. Sir, your line is open.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Hey, congrats on a great quarter, guys.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Thank you.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So, as we think about SG&A, if you excluded the wage investment this year, would the comp leverage point in 2016 still be around that 2% hurdle? And then, just as we think about the investment opportunities, how would you rank them this year and next between international, systems, e-commerce? Clearly, a lot of different ways you guys can take the investments. And then, finally just any color on your current business post holiday, I think, would be really helpful, just given all the disruption from some of your competitors.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Matthew, I will \u2013 let me just start with some of the color. We'll let Scott speak to the SG&A. That's in his wheelhouse, so to speak. On the investing, first of all, we do what we think makes sense in each area. Clearly, we look at each independently. Like, international, we look at there versus systems versus e-commerce. We look at a strategy independently of each and decide what we think is the right long-term and the appropriate amount.", "So, I'd tell you on our e-commerce business, we've discussed this before, it's a relatively small piece of our business and we are taking an approach there of investing in a very methodical way and a careful way. Having said that, we're very happy with the business where it is today. We just will \u2013 we will keep that in ratio to the benefit and where we think we are headed with that.", "In systems, there's certainly a maintenance side to that and a part of running the business that we are cognizant of. And in international, clearly, you can tell from what we talked about in the script, that is a key focus for us and we have shown to make our model work whenever we replicate our model. Wherever we go, in fact, as I believe I mentioned, in Australia, we are pretty happy with our early indicators there going in fairly recently and already experiencing, I think, some pretty good success. So, I think, we can't give you specifics by the different investments. We would tell you they're all long-term oriented and they're all doing what makes sense for the business.", "In terms of color post holiday, also, as we mentioned, we're feeling very bullish, I would say, starting the new year off strong and that's across many categories. Yes, there are plentiful opportunities in the market, as we talked about, going back at the last two quarter calls. I think Carol and I both discussed that with you in the last two quarters, but nothing has really changed in the environment out there. In fact, there just continues to be a lot of opportunities.", "If anything, we're at one of those high points of taking advantage of pack-aways, but still having to control our merchants to make sure that we don't buy too much actually because there's so much to choose from. So, we're feeling really, really strong about the positioning post holiday. The liquidity is in a good position. That is feeling healthy. And I guess, that's that.", "And I will ask Scott to jump in on the SG&A.", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I'll just for \u2013 won't give much more color on the investment. But our capital budget increase over last year is pretty similar when you talk about the new stores, renovations, as Ernie talked about earlier. And the biggest incremental piece of our increase over last year, frankly, relates to timing of some spend between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. And then, as we talked about, just the cost related to the new distribution centers.", "Moving to the SG&A, the comp breakeven is closer to \u2013 is a solid 3%. It used to be a bit lower, but more having to do with the \u2013 by the way, this is going back several years, with the significant opportunities that were at that point in terms of cost efficiencies and merchandise \u2013 lower-lying fruit on merchandise inventories as we were bringing down substantially our inventories.", "The past \u2013 last year, and I would say still, certainly, with the wage piece and a little bit with the average ticket, the incremental costs obviously are weighing on you because of the wage increases and what the average retail do are mitigating a bit of what that would be on your flow-through. So, a solid 3%, excluding what would be the \u2013 I would just say the wage increase.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Best of luck, guys.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Matt, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez. Sir, your line is open.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey. Thanks, guys. On the Trade Secret business, is that currently losing money? If it is, could you share with us how much in 2015 and maybe how much in 2016? And just thinking about now that you have the Australian business, does that change your pack-away strategy at all? Just given seasons are opposite, might you use less pack-away in the North American business, maybe ship some of the goods down there? I'm just wondering, obviously, related to that, does it maybe change your open-to-buy here in North America? Thanks.", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "So, Paul, I'm not going to give a lot of color, But clearly, in the fourth quarter and the early part of this year, the Trade Secret acquisition will be a large portion of the decrease in the TJX International and a relatively \u2013 an impact but a relatively small impact over the course of the year for TJX in total.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Paul, on the \u2013 on your merchandise, really, mix and opportunity question there, it's \u2013 which by the way is a great question because we \u2013 one of the benefits we've liked about it is we have been able to bob and weave, so to speak, the way you have just described it. So, we're able to take things that are a little out of season here and go there with it.", "Now, you have to keep in mind, we're dealing with 35 stores versus billions right? So, it's not a major swing impact for, like, the Marmaxx guys or the home businesses here. But there is a strong benefit for the new Australian business for Trade Secret because they're able to take advantage, to your point, of the off-season goods. It becomes not a pack-away, it becomes an in-season use there.", "And there's going to be some benefit additionally in terms of reading some trends on a certain fashion item that we'll be able to go ahead of it there, like we're able to do with our down stores (49:02) here as well. But even there, a little earlier, that will give us some reads actually on some fashion items ahead of the curve, so we can maybe take advantage of that back here. So, a great question, yeah.", "And we're happy \u2013 again, as I said before, very happy with we have \u2013 what we've already done with that and we have some great people working there. We have one senior executive that, and I think we talked about this before, from our Canada division that has relocated there as well as a handful of other TJX associates. So, we are really TJX-sizing that business rather quickly. And already \u2013 and you guys are familiar with how we pride ourselves on turning fast to create the treasure hunt. That division is already turning significantly faster than it did last year with a huge reduction in inventory. So, all good signs and I think the subject you brought up about the way we'll buy it will just help that. That will be another benefit in the future.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks and good luck.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling. Sir, your line is open.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, good morning. I have a bit of a big picture question and one follow-up, if I can. We often hear pushback from investors on how big off-price can be and if it really needs full price, and this quarter seems to alleviate those concerns. But can you give us any thoughts you have on that relationship between the full-price and the off-price, how that might be changing any quantification of how big the off-price market should be or can be?", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "So, Stephen, obviously, I guess, you would say \u2013 in a big, big picture, you'd say you're asking a group of people that are maybe not totally objective on this because we would say off-price can continue to get bigger and bigger and bigger, and we are not as high on the full-price business for a reason. I think, in the environment that we're in right now, by the way, I think the value of off-price business still plays better and some of the results that come out there, I think that will validate that.", "The reason we \u2013 if you look \u2013 actually, if you look at our store growth that we've laid out, that tells you how bullish we are and then if you look at, I think some of the other reports that have been out recently over the last couple of months on other types of retail that do not have store growth going the other way, so to speak, I think that would tell you that we believe the off-price is the big opportunity.", "And we just never \u2013 sometimes there's a concern, there's going to be a lack of goods as we continue to growing out all these stores. It just, as you know \u2013 I think I said it like 20 minutes ago. We actually have to hold the merchants back still. There's so much merchandise out there. We've never not had it be that way. It goes in waves, sometimes a little more than others. Yes, right now, it's a little bit more of that mode, but even when it cuts back a little, there's still more goods than we can take in. So, we're just bullish on this model. We can't speak to, really, nor can the team speak to really any other retail model as well as we can this one, but we're very comfortable and confident where the potential lies in TJX and growth here.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Fair enough. And as a follow-up, you had outlined, I believe, it was a 10% to 13% EPS growth algorithm at the Analyst Day back in 2013. Is that still the right way to think about the long-term growth ex-FX and maybe once wage hikes normalize?", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Well, Paul (sic) [Steve], we aren't really providing today our long-term EPS model because there are just a few factors impacting our growth. The first one is clearly the foreign exchange issue has been in flux, by the way. Some day that could go the other way and actually benefit us. But right now, that's been in flux, as we just talked about.", "Secondly, there's a negative impact from our wage initiative, which Scott referred to. And it's bigger in FY 2017 that we're entering. We expect it, by the way, in FY 2018 to go back to 2016 levels, but it's still significant. And the other, again, unknown there or a bit in flux is that we could be further impacted if additional cities, states or countries increase their minimum wage. So, that, again, hits us there potentially, but we don't know by how much.", "And then, lastly, we have our investments to fuel our future growth. And these investments, by the way, as I said before, these are the right things to do. And two of the key components there are building our supply chain earlier, because we've had this high-class problem of growing faster than we planned on, and our systems investments.", "And having said all that, we are so confident at TJX in our long-term vision for growth. Yeah, we're not giving you that long-term model today, but our business is so fundamentally healthy. Our traffic gains in FY 2016 and our momentum entering into FY 2017 are so strong. We're just building. Talent for the future is another thing we're after, and we are making long term investments where we think they make sense. So, hopefully that helps you.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's helpful, thanks. Best of luck this year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson. Ma'am, your line is open.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the guidance for flat ticket in the second half. Is this just a matter of lapping last year's initiatives? And is there an opportunity to continue to sharpen the value proposition for customers as we move through the year?", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Lorraine, it's funny. We talk about this quite a bit internally here. And so, we would say we expect it to moderate second quarter of next year. You're exactly accurate. Part of that was a mix component, if you remember. There were really two facets. One, buying, because of the nature of the environment right now, buying the same goods for less.", "But, then you have the other half of the component, which was really just we juggled some of the mixes, and the penetrations of certain mixes with lower ticket went up. So, it created a mix content issue. To your question, we would think that's going to happen. The only thing I would tell you is we have bought so little of that time period at this point because we're so opportunistic that we have so much open-to-buy for the second quarter that we could end up, yes, we could end up slightly down in ticket again. I doubt it would be to the degree that we have had it last year over the year before, but it could be down a few points. It's possible because we don't want to predict.", "One of the best parts of this business is when we have significant open-to-buy, we don't feel a need to have to call it today on where we could end up then. We want to go with the best values that are out there.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And then, can you talk about any trends at HomeGoods in terms of ticket? Have those been up or down over the past couple of years?", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "We don't really talk about that. It's been kind of uneventful, I would say. And ticket has not been a component of that business. They are just doing so many other things that are driving the business clearly. And we're just happy with the business because of all the execution on the other fronts.", "If you walk in there, as you know, it's one of our \u2013 I would say our most impulsive mix store \u2013 it's difficult if you're a customer to walk in and not spend $200. I guess that's the way we like to describe it. Because there's so much exciting impulse merchandise there. So, it's really less of, like, a ticket issue there and more about the ever-changing \u2013 and I think you guys are aware, Lorraine, I'm sure you heard from us about how fast we turn HomeGoods, right? It is our fastest turning business. So, I think we're getting a customer there that not only is it impulsive to begin with, she could go back a week and a half later and it's different again. So, we're excited about it.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Well, thank you.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Mike Baker. Sir, your line is open.", "Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. I'll finish up by asking about the competitive environment relative to department stores and promotions. We know that they were pretty heavy in the inventory and pretty promotional because of the warm weather earlier in the winter. So, did you see that? How did you work against that? But more importantly, are you seeing any change in the promotional environment? Presumably, department stores have started to work through some of that inventory, and the weather has gotten a little bit more seasonal in some areas. So, are you seeing less promotional competitive pressures out there?", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Mike, we haven't. I have to tell you, I have seen no (58:23) major shift of recent. Yeah, I mean, right now, you see less relative to fourth quarter because that's the nature of the time period when you're transitioning into the new season. So, yes, there's less right now than there was before. However, if you ask me how does it compare this year to last year for department stores, I could not answer that. We try to kind of focus on what we're feeling here.", "What we feel in general is an environment of, again, a lot of availability of merchandise. And so, we don't know where that \u2013 some of it's department stores, some of it's specialty stores, some of it's other types of stores. So, that's really our only barometer. In terms of their promotional activity, again, not sure. We do see their ticket actually declining is our perception. We see \u2013 I would say not declining, but we see their ticket kind of staying into the zone than it's been to last year. Kind of very similar, like, we don't see any major shifts, I guess, in what they're carrying.", "Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, understood. One more, if I could. If \u2013 I think I have these numbers right. When you jump out the wage in the currency, your earnings growth last year at this time, you talked about 9% to 12%. This year, if you add back the 8% points from those things, it's more like 7% to 11%. So, is the lower expected growth excluding all those two one-time things? Is it because of the investments you're making or is there something else in there?", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, the primary difference \u2013 or one of the biggest difference is the wage versus last year. But also, we don't have as high a level of merchandise margin increase also compared to last year. So, we \u2013 as we talked about, we still have a merchandise margin that's planned up excluding the currency. So \u2013 but we do \u2013 it's not planned at the levels that \u2013 higher levels that we had on the plan last year.", "Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay...", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Again, comparable 1% to 2% comp that we had last year.", "Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Right, right, of course.", "Scott Goldenberg - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Those would be the two of the bigger components.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "And, Mike, I would like to reiterate, and I think we say this often, that we always plan conservatively. And as you know, our intention is always to beat these plans. So, we are clearly putting together what we believe is the right plan to put together. But we \u2013 our intention is to certainly surpass the plan.", "Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Understood. Appreciate that. Thank you.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "Thank you.", "Ernie L. Herrman - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director", "I think that was our last question.

And now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.", "Ernie Herrman ", "Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. Let me first begin by saying that I am very pleased to start the year off with such a strong first quarter. Our momentum continued with consolidated comp sales up a strong 7% which was well above our plan and over our 5% increase last year. ", "All four of our major divisions delivered strong comps and again this quarter, customer traffic was the driver of our comp increases. We were particularly pleased with the strong performance of apparel including accessories and our home category. Our eclectic merchandize mix, great brands and amazing values clearly continue to resonate with consumers across all of our geographies. ", "We believe our ability to deliver the right fashions at the right values at the right time is key to our success. ", "Our first quarter results continue our long track record of achieving comp sales increases in many types of retail environments, economies and geographies. We are convinced that we are growing our customer base and gaining market share. ", "Earnings per share increased a strong 10%, also well above our expectations and over an 8% increase last year. Importantly, we achieved these results while simultaneously investing to support our growth and despite significant headwinds from foreign exchange and wage increases. ", "Looking ahead, the second quarter is off to a solid start. We see many near and long-term growth opportunities in the US and internationally to capture market share. As always, our management team is extremely driven to achieve our plans and we will strive to surpass them. ", "Further, we are making strategic investments today to support our growth plans around the world and grow TJX to a $40 billion plus company. ", "Before I continue, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott to recap our first quarter numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg ", "Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. As Ernie mentioned, our first quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 7% which was well above our plan and marks our 29th consecutive quarter of comp growth. I want to note that this reflects the comp growth in our brick and mortar stores and excludes our ecommerce businesses. ", "We were very pleased that customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division. We also saw a strong increase in our units sold again this quarter. As we anticipated, overall average tickets decreased. ", "Diluted earnings per share was $0.76, a 10% increase over last year\u2019s $0.69 and well above our plan. Our EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 2% due to wage increases. ", "Consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 10.9%, down 20 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 28.8%, up 50 basis points versus last year. This was primarily due to buying and occupancy leverage on the 7% comp, partially offset by the mark-to-market adjustments on our inventory hedges. ", "Despite the negative impact from transactional foreign exchange at TJX Canada and TJX International, merchandize margins remains strong. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.7%, up 70 basis points versus last year\u2019s ratio. This was better than we expected due to expense leverage on the above planned 7% comp.", "Wage increases continued to be a significant headwind to SG&A and investments to support our growth also had an unfavorable impact. At the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in transit and ecommerce inventories were up 7% on a constant currency basis. ", "During the quarter, we took advantage of some great pack-away deals. We feel very comfortable with our inventory liquidity as we enter the second quarter. We are well positioned to capitalize on buying opportunities in a marketplace with a quality, branded merchandize. ", "Now to recap our first quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comps increased a very strong 6% again this quarter on top of last year\u2019s 3% increase. We are very pleased that our comp sales increases was entirely driven by customer traffic and we saw significant gains in units sold. Further the expected decrease in average tickets was less than we planned. ", "Segment profit margin increased 10 basis points with strong buying and occupancy leverage and increased merchandize margins. As a reminder, wage increases continue to have a significant negative impact to margins. We are very pleased with the continued excellent performance of our largest division. ", "HomeGoods comps increased a very strong 9% over last year\u2019s 9% growth. Segment profit margin was down 10 basis points. We were pleased with our strong buying and occupancy leverage and increased merchandize margins. As we anticipated, wage increases also had a significant negative impact to HomeGoods margin. ", "Again, we are very happy with the traffic and comp increases we continue to see at HomeGoods. The enthusiasm of our HomeGoods customers is hard to beat. At TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 14% again this quarter, over last year\u2019s 11% increase. Adjusted segment margin, excluding foreign currency was up 190 basis points due to strong buying and occupancy leverage. ", "The year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar continued to have a significant negative impact on this division\u2019s merchandize margins. Our Canadian organization did an excellent job of mitigating some of this currency impact. We are very pleased with the performance across all three of our Canadian chains.", "TJX International\u2019s comps were up 4% over a 3% increase last year. We are pleased with the improvement in our comp growth since the fourth quarter. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was down 60 basis points. The decline was due to integrating Trade Secret in Australia into our business.", "During the quarter, we opened up our 500th store in Europe, a proud milestone for our business. I\u2019ll finish with our shareholder distribution. During the first quarter, we bought back 375 million of TJX stock retiring 5 million shares. We continue to anticipate buying back 1.5 billion to 2 billion of TJX stock this year.

", "Ernie Herrman ", "Thanks, Scott. Now, I\u2019d like to review our major strengths which differentiates TJX from many other large retailers, both brick and mortar and online. These elements of our business give us confidence that we will continue gaining market share and growing our business successfully for many years to come. We also believe these will be extremely difficult for others to replicate. ", "For us, our value proposition always comes first. Since day one of our company, value has been our mission. We define value with a combination of brands, fashion, price and quality, which has resonated with consumers for many years and many types of retail and economic environments across different geographies. ", "We are confident that our focus on the right fashions and brands add compelling off-price values will continue to differentiate TJX. ", "Second, we see TJX as a global sourcing machine. We have a world-class global buying organization with over 1000 associates located in 11 countries across four continents. We are proud of our strong corporate culture and remain dedicated to training and developing our buyers and next generation of leaders. ", "Our vendor universe numbers more than 18,000 vendors in 100 plus countries. We take pride in our vendor relationships which we believe are some of the best in retail. With a store base of more than 3600 stores in nine countries, we believe, we are an attractive and increasingly important outlet for vendors. ", "We buy in many different ways and offer vendors a great deal of flexibility. We are typically willing to purchase less than full assortments of items, styles and sizes and quantities ranging from small to very large. Further, we are straight-forward in our dealings and build mutually beneficial relationships for the long-term. ", "All of this allows us to offer consumers an extremely eclectic merchandize mix of well-known and emerging brands from all around the world. I am convinced this helps set us apart from most major retailers both brick and mortar and online. ", "Next, we have a global supply chain and distribution network developed and refined over many decades to specifically support our international off-price model. The flexibility of our network allows us to adjust the merchandize flow to our stores to react the changing market dynamics and capitalize on hot product categories and changing consumer tastes. ", "We operate distribution centers in six countries and we constantly work to improve our ability to flow the right goods to the right stores at the right time. As we continue to grow our store base and plan to enter new countries, we are expanding our supply chain to ramp up our capacity ahead of our growth. ", "Finally, we are leveraging our global presence. We have decades of experience operating internationally and run highly synergistic and integrated retail chains all centered around our value mission. We share initiatives, best practices, and talent across our global organization. ", "The depth of our international expertise, teams, and infrastructure underscores our confidence and our ability to strengthen our leadership positions around the world and expand successfully into new international markets. ", "Now, I\u2019d like to recap our growth drivers which give us confidence in our ability to gain market share for many years to come. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. ", "We were very pleased with our comp sales increases and traffic gains at all divisions in the first quarter. We are even more excited about the potential to see \u2013 we see to grow our customer base both in the US and in internationally. Our research indicates that our traffic increases are being driven both by new customers and existing customers shopping us more frequently. ", "I believe we become better at leveraging our global marketing capabilities every year. We take an integrated marketing approach to engage with shoppers across all age brackets through television, radio, digital, mobile, and social media. This year, we are strategically targeting some of our marketing dollars to certain geographies and markets where we see the biggest opportunities.", "We are very happy with our creative marketing campaigns at every division this spring. To encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping of our chains, we are growing our loyalty programs. In an every competitive retail environment, we want to make sure that customers have a great experience every time they shop our stores. ", "We are working to upgrade our stores everyday and are on track to remodel about 240 stores across TJX this year. Further, while our customer satisfaction scores increased again this quarter, we still see room to become even better. ", "As to ecommerce, while it\u2019s a small part of our business, we see it as highly complementary to our physical stores. We are being methodical in how we grow this business. We view ecommerce as another great avenue for driving traffic both online and to our stores and growing our retail brands. ", "Most importantly, across our businesses, we remain laser-focused on offering shoppers and always changing mix of exciting merchandize and values. We are constantly opening new vendors and offering consumers new brands. ", "Our second major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. We are confident that we can continue to open stores around the world and capitalize on first mover advantages. We have decades of operating expertise in the US and internationally, a disciplined approach to real estate and a highly integrated global supply chain and distribution network. ", "Long-term, we see the potential for grow to 5600 stores with just our current chains and just our current markets alone. This represents more than 50% store growth or almost 2000 additional stores on top of our current base. ", "Further, we believe significant opportunity exists beyond this. To reiterate, our estimates do not contemplate the potential to expand into additional countries or open new chains in existing markets. ", "As a reminder, in 2016, we plan to add approximately 195 new stores, an increase of 5%. We also have no store closings planned across our entire company this year. We believe this speaks to the strength of our business, our global operating expertise and our real estate discipline.", "In this smaller retail environment, our real estate teams have plenty of open to buy and will be opportunistic in seeking the most advantageous deals in the marketplace. ", "Our third major growth driver is new seeds in innovation. We are convinced that our drive to keep innovating and developing new seeds is a major success factor for our company. We are constantly testing new ideas and planting seeds across the company that could be very meaningful to our future growth. ", "This includes entering new countries and testing new concepts. We are pleased with our European expansion into Austria, and The Netherlands, as well as the potential we see for our business in Australia, our third continent. We continue to test our Sierra Trading Post stores and we would be very pleased if we could eventually roll this out as a fourth major US chain.

We have many initiatives underway and many more planned to bring TJX to the next level of growth. We take a disciplined approach and are balancing our growth with investments to strengthen our foundation to support our future plans.", "As we discussed, when we announced our earnings at year end, we are making significant investments in our business. This includes new stores and remodels, our supply chain and infrastructure, new seeds for growth and developing talents as well as our previously announced wage increases. We see investing in our associates and preserving our strong corporate culture as imperative to our continued success. ", "Further, we are investing in initiatives that can benefit from our decades of knowledge and expertise in growing a global off-price business. While these investments impact our EPS growth, we are confident that investing ahead of our growth will strongly position TJX to continue expanding around the world. ", "In closing, I am very pleased with our strong start to the year. It is great to see our momentum and traffic in comp sales continue. Across the company, our teams delivered sharp execution on our off-price fundamentals of disciplined inventory management, opportunistic buying and effective merchandize flow. ", "We see a marketplace loaded with quality branded merchandize and have the liquidity to take advantage of the opportunities. With our strong first quarter, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance. At the same time, we continue to expect headwinds to our fiscal 2017 pretax margins and earnings per share including wage increases, investments to support our growth and foreign exchange as we detailed on our last call.", "We are confident in our plans and again, we have a management team dedicated to achieving our goals and striving to surpass them. I see an exciting future ahead for TJX. We have a clear long-term vision for growth and I believe we are making the right investments today to support our future plans. I am confident that we will execute on our growth goals and become a $40 billion plus company.

To keep the call on schedule, we're going to ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. Thanks. And now, we will open it up to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Paul Lejuez. Your line is now open.", "Paul Lejuez ", "Hey, thanks. Can you guys talk a little bit about new store productivity at each of concepts both that you are opening in the US and abroad? Maybe, just touch on where you are meeting versus exceeding your goals on new store productivity and if there any places you are falling short, I am curious to hear what you are seeing there. Thanks. ", "Scott Goldenberg", "I\u2019ll start out, Paul, in terms of new store performance, it\u2019s really similar to what we\u2019ve been saying over the past couple of years. We have been beating our performance at all of our divisions. ", "Again, the \u2013 or probably the only thing I would nuance there is that the volume of the stores as we said over the last few years are not at the same or less than the average volume of our chain averages at the division, little more pronounced at Marmaxx and HomeGoods. And other than that, again, beating performance and there is not really nothing new to talk about there. ", "Paul Lejuez ", "Can I just follow-up\u2026", "Scott Goldenberg", "I think that the only thing is, our ability to get our 5% growth targets are almost 200 stores this year, as Ernie said, given the retail environment is probably as good as it\u2019s been in the last few years. ", "Paul Lejuez ", "Gotcha, got a follow-up, you see a slow down in Europe in the fourth quarter, it seems like that business has picked up a bit in 1Q. Can you just talk about how you are looking at the trajectory of that business and maybe help us understand what changed, how business picked back up? Thanks. ", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, Paul, on Europe, so if you look, actually Europe last year had a pretty strong year. We were up about four comps for the year in Europe last year and which is really first the first \u2013 fourth quarter where we kind of fell-off to the one comp. So, first of all, funky dynamics going on in the environment over there as you know, which we do believe that was a piece of what affected us in the fourth quarter, as well as we had some missed opportunity categories, I would call it that we have now when you ask what have we fixed, or what have we changed. ", "I would say the team over there is very focused on capitalizing on any categories that they feel are business opportunities and as a result, throughout the quarter, the first quarter, that business is just being continuing to get better and better. So, really I would say, fourth quarter was a bit of a mishap or not on trend and we are now back to more of the trajectory that we expect there. ", "Paul Lejuez ", "Gotcha. Thanks good luck guys. ", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kimberly Greenberger, you may now ask your question. ", "Kimberly Greenberger ", "Great, thank you so much. It was a really excellent quarter, obviously across the board and I wanted to dive in a little bit more on what\u2019s happening with average ticket. You, I think, had sort of re-strategized your average ticket, I think starting in the second quarter last year. Just, correct me if I am wrong on that and as we sort of lapse those decreases, I am wondering, Ernie, if you can just talk to us about how the buyers are thinking about average tickets over the upcoming year? ", "And it seems like the strategy to fortify the opening price points which obviously caused a decline in the average off-the-door ticket price has been fixed at full because I think that your traffic numbers have significantly accelerated with this strategy, but also if I talk a wrong in the question there maybe you could correct that as well. Thanks so much. ", "Ernie Herrman", "Sure, Kimberly. Let\u2019s start with the first part of your question. So, when you go back to the second quarter of last year on the strategy, it actually wasn\u2019t \u2013 I hate to say it this way, it wasn\u2019t as strategic as an top down driven is what people might think and we\u2019ve talked about this actually at some of our meetings when we\u2019ve been out there over the last few months. ", "Half of that \u2013 what happened with the lower ticket beginning in the second quarter last year, was really a bottom-up driven strategy from down at the buyer and merchandize manager level and now it goes to what you had talked about where we were trying to balance off the mix, so there were some pockets where we actually had too many better or fashion goods and we wanted to implement more moderate goods. ", "And those were in a few specific categories in the store, but when we did that, as well as overall wanted to buy in the environment we are in buy better we had a lot of liquidity, the market has been very full with merchandize. We wanted to buy certain items better. So that was probably half the strategy. So the combination of balancing the mix better, with like a good, better, best, which is again driven by the merchandize managers and buyers and the merchant teams in general wanting to sharper on the values. ", "Those two things intersected drove our average ticket down and yes, has driven incremental traffic in transactions. Now we\u2019ve talked many times how that has continued all the way from then all the way through really the fourth quarter and then into the first quarter and we have discussed actually what do we think is going to happen as we think it\u2019s going to moderate in the second quarter as we start to come up against all of those shift that we made last year. ", "What has actually happened is, in the first quarter we have started to moderate already, even a little bit more so than we thought we were going to do and as you cans see from the results, we are probably hitting the sweet spot and that hasn\u2019t been an issue with us our average ticket is now not bound as much as it was back then. And the where do we think it will be in the second quarter, we think it will continue to moderate. ", "However, we have a lot of goods still to buy and a lot of open to buy. So, well, I think I\u2019ve answered both your questions. I think, we feel like we are in a balanced \u2013 very balanced state right now based on the order of liquidity we don\u2019t want to be too firm on what we tell you on where we think the second quarter average ticket is going to be, because we are a lot of open to buy. ", "Scott Goldenberg", "Then, Kimberly, the only thing I would add to what Ernie said is that, again to reiterate, similar to last year, we are able to lower the average retail, get the comp, but, merchandize margins were up\u2026 ", "Ernie Herrman", "Great point.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Given the average ticket decrease. ", "Kimberly Greenberger ", "Can you share the level of insight at the buyer level and then sort of quality starts there and move on up. Thanks so much. ", "Ernie Herrman", "Okay, well, Kimberly, let me just jump on it before we go away from that and it absolutely does, and it shows you that we are \u2013 and we talk about it from various aspects how we are very rich in our merchant team with a 1000 plus players there and they really \u2013 and their bosses are very strategic and that\u2019s part of the cultural advantage and by the way that comes with some of the experience in the low turnover that we\u2019ve had which has really allows us to do some of those things which would be difficult if we didn\u2019t have seasoned buying teams. ", "Kimberly Greenberger ", "Fantastic. Thanks so much. ", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Binetti. Your line is now open.", "Michael Binetti", "Hey, good morning guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Just a couple questions for the model, I guess. I am trying to figure out the guidance for the year on gross margins and why it will be down year-over-year, if I think about the 50 basis points in the first quarter, it seems like FX becomes less of a headwind and the DC costs should roll-off, maybe we assume less buying and occupancy leverage. But is there anything else on merchandize margins that gets harder versus just wanting to be conservative given where the marketplace is today?", "Ernie Herrman", "Well the backfill, again, we have obviously flowed through the first quarter margins. But we still have the impact of mark on our currency in the back half of the year and the full year guidance implies a 1 to 2 comp in the back half comp and on a 1 to 2 comp there is some deleverage in your buying and occupancy cost as well. So it's a combination of those two items which are - and we said some \u2013 and we still have the pressure of some of the investments in our store growth which would be on the logistics side in the back half as well.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. And then here we are about a year-and-a-half into you guys guiding us through some of the wage pressures and push and pull-on on SG&A. But can you help us just think a little bit ahead to when you think we get back to a more normal SG&A versus comp relationship for the business?", "Ernie Herrman", "But we don\u2019t, the wage situation is a little ambiguous out there I would say, so that\u2019s part of the challenge as we\u2019ve just recently had a couple of states, right, come out with new strategies on their wage over the next handful of years in terms of staggering, growing to $15. So the unknown, Michael, as to how many other states could start to implement that as well, so.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. ", "Ernie Herrman", "That creates a bit of an unknown.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, so, if anything, as Ernie stated, we still probably have a bit more than what we had said in the prior guidance on the impact next year. ", "Michael Binetti", "Right.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And I think as Ernie indicated earlier, we - it's a balance here, we certainly have absorbed the wage pressure because we have not been you cutting back on our payroll. We think it is a key ingredient to \u2013 one of the key ingredients to our customer service scores going up, customers\u2019 satisfaction scores. So, I think we're going to be very - hands off at this point in terms of trying to\u2026 ", "Ernie Herrman", "Absolutely.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Play with that.", "Michael Binetti", "Understood. ", "Ernie Herrman", "We have a focus, Michael, right now on continuing to do everything we can to gain market share. So to Scott's point, we want to ensure that our shopping environment in the stores and with our associates and that aspect of it is all on a full throttle, so to speak. And doing everything we can to gain market share, simply.", "Michael Binetti", "Appreciate it, guys. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Matthew Boss. Your line is now open.", "Matthew Boss", "Hey, congrats on a great quarter.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you.", "Matthew Boss", "What's the best way to think about barriers to entry in the off-price industry? A lot's made of this, but what makes your buying organization tick? Any category opportunities do you see to source more from overseas? And what prevents increasing competition from stealing any of your thunder?", "Ernie Herrman", "Boy, we have \u2013 that's a great question, Matt. We have so many things we can talk about there. One of the barriers to entry is, which I think I mentioned on a couple \u2013 on an answer a couple questions ago is the tenure we have, we have low turnover in our buying organization. We've grown it to over 1000 buyers, which as we mentioned is a sourcing machine, but they are now a trained sourcing machine, because we have low turnover, it's not the quantity it's also the quality of the merchants we have. ", "They are very well-trained on off-price. I think the other barrier to entry with that respect is that we are only off-price in our business. So we are not trying to do different types of businesses. We are only trying to do the off-price business which I think creates another barrier to entry versus if we were a retailer trying to do a few different types of business. ", "I think, in terms of how we stack up as a business with relative to even online in general, we have a treasure hunt format, which is very different than anybody else does. We have different brands. We are unique that way. We offer a touch and feel environment, treasure hunt environment, different than any other brick and mortar or online retailer. ", "So that's all extremely \u2013 those create strong barriers to entry. We have a global supply chain, which is really specifically designed it's been built over 40 years to deal with off-price goods and the flow of those goods is - again, we talked about that in the script. ", "We have teams \u2013 we have a university that trains our merchants, because we want to ensure that even from the young age that we bring in some of our kids into planning and through that they are getting appropriate training, not just from management but from an actual university group that has a wealth of knowledge. ", "And I would say, lastly, we have the ability to act invisibly which makes a lot of vendors really like the relationship they have with us, versus an online business or another retail business, our goods can be \u2013 first of all, we can buy small quantity or large quantity and we can be invisible, the goods aren't in people's faces, so to speak. So, the fast turnover obviously allows us to be more invisible and you've heard us talk about that for every division. So, hope that answers your question.", "Matthew Boss", "Yes, it does. That's great. Thanks, Ernie.", "Ernie Herrman", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Baker. Your line is now open. ", "Mike Baker", "Thanks. I just wanted to ask about your changing customer demographic. You said that you're seeing traffic growth in both new and existing customers, but, if you look at the demographics or the age of customer or what you're seeing with millennial customers and maybe how the brands are sort of performing or guiding you in that direction?", "Ernie Herrman", "Scott, do you want to?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Well, it\u2019s - during the year we don't get as much specific information in terms of the age. So, we update that on a bi-annual basis. So, nothing new to report in terms of the year-end. I think it's really the \u2013 we are - at the year end we were seeing the larger proportion of our new customers were going to the young \u2013 the younger group and I would say young means in the 18 to 30 age. But again, we still \u2013 we trade both wide in terms of we believe both the demographics and - of our customers, but nothing really new to report that\u2019s\u2026.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, we have that, Mike, and to Scott's point, it was at the year end, which isn\u2019t the information is not that old. It's only three months ago. So for last year, also in answer to your question, every division pretty much had on the new customer grew in that age bracket Scott is talking about which is like the 18 to 34 year old. So\u2026", "Mike Baker", "Well, so maybe to follow-up on the second half. Sorry, I was to say, maybe just to follow-up on the second half of the question, I think the important point is how does that impact the way you deal with your vendors, now that they see that you are becoming more popular with a younger customer?", "Ernie Herrman", "Well, the vendors \u2013 they\u2019ve known this for a few years and they certainly like that we are cautiously doing that and effectively doing that, so for the future. So, they, I guess, they were just view it as another reason that we should continue to be a strong performer and they want to have a good relationship with us. ", "Mike Baker", "Right, understood. So, presumably, it\u2019s making \u2013 it\u2019s giving you an even bigger range of vendors that are doing business with you?", "Scott Goldenberg", "You could say that, I would tell you it\u2019s not the driver of it, I would say, in most cases, again, we are always opening new vendors. I guess, it depends on who the vendor is. In some cases, it would automatically happen because we are selling some merchandize geared more toward a younger customer. So, with those vendors, yes. ", "But I think in the vendor community on whole, that\u2019s unnecessarily one of the key reasons I think they look at just the way we do business. We are very straight-forward. They like that our buyers are very courteous and know their business. They focus on the goods and the value and I think, that\u2019s still the driver of why a lot of vendors want to deal with us. ", "Mike Baker", "Okay, makes sense. Thank you for the color.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson. Your line is now open. ", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the open to buy for summer goods this year and just see what you are seeing in the market and then how you feel you are positioned for the back half after last year\u2019s very warm winter? ", "Ernie Herrman", "Great question, Lorraine. We are \u2013 well, we are in one of those modes right now where one of our most difficult challenge is controlling how much we buy right now, because the markets are plentiful and they are plentiful with spring summer goods coming up. Based on the environment going on that\u2019s probably no surprise. ", "The good news is we have done a pretty diligent job of controlling the open to buy and we are very liquid across the board in all the divisions. Our inventory was up a shade right now, little bit more than normally is, but that\u2019s because there has been some really strong pack-away deals that we\u2019ve been able to do which I think of getting at the other part of your question. ", "Some pack-away deals that we think were going to help us for \u2013 going forward into the third quarter and in the back half. So we took advantage of those, like you said, coming off the winter we just had and we feel really good about those. ", "The merchants have controlled the open to buy amidst of that liquidity you are talking about knowing that it feels like the environment is going to continue this way for a while. So it\u2019s not just a short-term, we are not thinking that this will stop in the next 30 days. So, hope that answers your question. ", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Omar Saad. Your line is now open. ", "Omar Saad ", "Yes thanks, great quarter guys. I wanted to ask my question about the private-label credit program and the loyalty program. It seems like it\u2019s been a bigger emphasis in the stores and with your partner on the financial services side, the last year or so. What you are learning from that? Maybe a little bit more insight into how you can use the data you got from that as well as how that customer kind of behavior might change as you convert from a regular customer to either a loyalty customer or a credit customer, actually to learn more. Thanks. ", "Ernie Herrman", "So, Omar, the credit card, we are certainly very pleased with our loyalty programs in North America. The credit card program in the United States that has HomeGoods Marmaxx and Sierra Trading Post as a portion of it. We continue to add a lot of new customers every year as we have for the last couple. ", "Those customers - the one finding that we have are certainly the most loyal, they tend to cross-shop the most as they earn rewards when they purchase in all of the different banners. And again, we still think we have room to grow that and it\u2019s certainly been a portion of the success we\u2019ve had. So, again, opportunity is still there to grow that market share of that spend. ", "There is no \u2013 as we\u2019ve aid before, we don\u2019t want to mislead anyone, it\u2019s not anywhere near the market share that you would see at the department stores with your credit card programs.", "Omar Saad ", "Appreciate it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Drbul. Your line is now open. ", "Robert Drbul", "Hi, good morning. I just had a couple questions on \u2013 throughout the quarter, was there any difference between the monthly trend of sales and I think you mentioned in the press release May continued strong as one or if you could just comment on that a little further?", "Ernie Herrman", "Bob, really nothing significant, right. We are looking right now \u2013 now it was pretty steady all the way through. I mean, I would say that, within the quarter because \u2013 we don\u2019t call this out, but weather helped us a little. So there were spots during the quarter where they\u2019d be a few days here or there where all of a sudden, we would outperform what we would think, because we are up against some bad weather. ", "So, in the quarter, we \u2013 this year to last year, we would say, overall, we had a little bit more favorable weather. So that did help what will you see not by month, but you\u2019d see an actual individual clusters of the few days we are up against that you\u2019ll probably remember some of those crazy storms in February, March last year. ", "Robert Drbul", "Yes, definitely. And the other question that I have is, can you just talk about what you\u2019ve learned so far on ecommerce and how that\u2019s been versus the stores and any of the categories that are performing well, and new categories that you are thinking about at this point?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, we can\u2019t \u2013 well, we won\u2019t give you specifics by category. At this point, what we can tell you is, that our ecom businesses are performing as we have them planned, they are tracking right where our expectations would be and that\u2019s both in terms of our sales and our margins. We are learning really some of the logistics from an e-com business that are very different in terms of fulfilling orders and the shipping and doing some analyzation of the metrics that are involved and the data that\u2019s involved and really being effective on marketing to customers using that data. ", "So that\u2019s still and we talked about it before that\u2019s still a bit of a focus for us as well as getting more efficient on the way we fulfill orders. But, so far again the way we are proceeding into this year, we like that we are tracking on the plans that we have put in place back six months ago. ", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, Bob, the only other thing I\u2019d add to that is, from a pure metrics point of view, we are pleased with the conversion rates year-over-year going up. The awareness is getting better of our site particularly, the tjmaxx.com. The satisfaction, as Ernie said, our customer satisfaction scores have gotten better. So, all of those \u2013 all of these metrics that we would monthly visit, everything has gone up. So we feel pretty good about that as well. ", "Robert Drbul", "Great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Howard Tubin. Your line is now open. ", "Howard Tubin", "Thanks guys. Can you maybe just talk generally about your marketing plans for this year versus last year maybe in terms of spend and whether you are doing anything different this year than you\u2019ve done in the past?", "Ernie Herrman", "So, Howard on marketing? Did you say marketing?", "Howard Tubin", "Oh, yes, sorry, yes. ", "Ernie Herrman", "Our marketing spend is slightly elevated from last year and we \u2013 I have to tell you, it\u2019s been one of the more exciting years in terms of the campaigns which I hope you\u2019ve seen a couple of them. We like the creative this year, that we\u2019ve been delivering and as a result, we are continuing to look at \u2013 obviously we are trying to put a little bit more into digital and we are \u2013 I did not mention it probably as much as I should. ", "We believe that\u2019s part of our traffic gain, is our marketing across all the divisions. Each division really has gone into new campaigns. We like them all, the TJ Maxx, Marshalls, the new campaign in Europe, in Canada. So as a result, we feel like we are getting more out of it. So that\u2019s why our spend is a little elevated from last year in answer to your question. ", "Scott Goldenberg", "In addition to what Ernie said, not only that, but we feel really good with what advertising we have embarked on this year, such that we have already added a bit more dollars to the back half, to the rest of the year than we had originally planned based on how we see things are working right now. ", "Howard Tubin", "That\u2019s great. Thanks very much. ", "Ernie Herrman", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Daniel Hofkin. Your line is now open. ", "Daniel Hofkin", "Good morning. If you could just comment on the merchandize margin, would you say, the bigger driver is the flood of products out there, or you are kind of continuously growing scale? What is helping your merchandize margins more and to the degree that it\u2019s continued inventory management, what\u2019s the opportunity for further improvement going forward? Thank you.", "Scott Goldenberg", "So, I\u2019ll talk just from a statistical point of view. The \u2013 in the first quarter, clearly, the above planned comps helped us to improve our markdowns better than what we would have thought. So, one of the things that you not always but tend to have as a good flow through on markdowns, especially at the comp levels, that we saw. ", "Our Canadian division has done an exceptional job of \u2013 we still have that significant increase in the first quarter. Having said that, we still had a large impact to the merchandize margin in Canada, but they mitigated a significant amount. ", "So I think that has been a story for the last couple quarters. But it does get harder and harder as every year you go when the dollar is, the Canadian dollar is down. So I think those are two things we are certainly very pleased about. ", "Ernie Herrman", "I would say also, Daniel that, as I talked before about the way we balance the mix with more good, better, best, that\u2019s been very effective at helping us make improvements on markdowns as well. It helps the turns and it helps our profitability because we are not \u2013 we are more eclectic which is what our business is healthier when we do that. ", "So that\u2019s a positive in the flow certainly, all divisions have really done an excellent job on maintaining the open to buys we said on earlier question amidst this environment and that\u2019s always, when you are asking is there anything related to the buying helping the margins, I think that\u2019s certainly a positive, the way we are positioned going forward. ", "Scott Goldenberg", "And to be clear, the biggest overplan flow through is just in the total gross margin line, similar to the fourth quarter where we are up 50 basis points in gross margin as we were in the first quarter has been flowing through on the above planned comps, on the buying and occupancy leverage we get. So it\u2019s a combination.", "Daniel Hofkin", "Understood, understood. Thanks very much. Best of luck.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Roxanne Meyer. Your line is now open. ", "Roxanne Meyer ", "Great, thanks and congratulations on a terrific quarter. My question is on Sierra. I am just wondering what do you think you need to see there in order to forge ahead with it as a growth vehicle. And then more generally tied to the sporting goods category, do you think you could be a beneficiary of either a product or real estate for Sierra as a result of what's going on with Sports Authority? Thanks a lot.", "Ernie Herrman", "Sure, good question, Roxanne. First of all, for Sierra, we \u2013 so what we are doing now is obviously opening stores and the more bullish we get, I think I mentioned this in some of the script, we feel like that could be some upside for this to be a more of a major player in the outdoor space. ", "What do we need? We just need some more, I guess, TJX sizing of the business, which we are continuing to do. We are really getting more involved there with how we are educating that team and we are making some moves to really just take it to the next level. I think the beneficiary in terms of the merchandize from things like your businesses that are going out isn\u2019t just also \u2013 yes, there is a benefit on real estate, yes, there is a benefit on merchandize, yes, probably, but that won\u2019t be just for Sierra Trading Post, that will actually be also for potentially Marmaxx sites or HomeGoods sites, because you never know based on some of those markets. ", "So our real estate team is very flexible in assessing each situation, no matter what store as may the store situation is creating opportunities real estate-wise, but clearly, you could see how the sports authority and Sierra could relate, I get that. But now, we are pretty bullish on the Sierra Trading Post business longer-term. We just want to get it into more of our philosophy of business to be less promotional. ", "So I think we\u2019ve talked about that before. We are trying to get out of the wild promotional up and down swings, because that is not the way we like to retail goods. We\u2019ve been focused on buying off-price behind the scenes, buying it an off-price methodology, but the retail and the goods right now we would say it\u2019s half way on the journey, because it\u2019s still a little promotional on the website. ", "The stores are less promotional by the way if you went to the stores. So, our key there is really, we are going to be strengthening the merchandizing team in Sierra Trading Post further and as well as the planning team to keep up with these siege of the potential store growth that we are hoping to have there. ", "Roxanne Meyer ", "Great, thanks. That was really helpful color. And best of luck, generally.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question is coming from the line of Richard Jaffe. Your line is now open. ", "Richard Jaffe ", "Thanks very much, guys, and a question about Australia. First, Trade Secret and then also the possibility of HomeGoods going in there. Where Trade Secret stands in terms of its integration into the TJX way, and then, the thoughts about bringing it here, which was something I was surprised to hear, wondering what's the difference between the two or how do you anticipate those, the Marmaxx business and Trade Secret being unique or different?", "Ernie Herrman", "So Richard, okay, well, let\u2019s deal with the first one, the second one I think, Scott and I had a question on the \u2013 your second part of your question. But on the first part, the Trade, we are very pleased with how Trade Secret is beginning the TJX sizing process, I guess, you would describe it as, which is, I think what you are asking about. ", "We are putting in a lot of processes and systems, talent from here, from back here. Again, we\u2019ve had a handful of people move over there and our head merchants relocated from Canada back a while ago. So, she is making terrific progress. The division and she reports to Michael McMillan who travels over there frequently and make sure that we are trying to do the core execution priorities in the business that are important to them. ", "So we are dealing with stores. We are dealing with distribution, supply chain. We are dealing with merchants. We are dealing with marketing. We are dealing with HR organizational structure issues to get it set. Again, not a big business yet it is, I would tell you one of the most exciting environments. ", "We find Australia to be extremely tailor-made for a TJX prototype and the customers really will gravitate. When we have the right goods, they, our turns there are much, much improved. We just right now are trying to get to the point where we can flow the right goods consistently, because that\u2019s what they are still on the learning curve. ", "We start to look at remodels and we will be opening a logistics center in the near future, because they used to believe or not drop ship their merchandize. So, all things we knew going in. And we are excited about it. The second part of your question is on the integrate \u2013 did you believe that you heard something about Trade Secret or the home business coming here?", "Richard Jaffe ", "I may have misunderstood, but, yes, I thought you mentioned Trade Secret.", "Ernie Herrman", "Oh, no, that might have been just the way we said something in the script, ", "Richard Jaffe ", "Okay.", "Ernie Herrman", "Because there is no plan for it. No, there is no plan for that. ", "Richard Jaffe ", "And then the reverse, HomeGoods going there, is that a possibility?", "Ernie Herrman", "So, that is something that we are looking at as a potential home business only there. So that\u2019s something that we are actually coming with as we speak.", "Richard Jaffe ", "Excellent, I am sure it will be as successful there as here. Thanks very much for the color.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, it\u2019s to your point, Richard, it\u2019s a \u2013 also natural for there.", "Richard Jaffe ", "Yes. Great, thank you very much.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you. Okay, I think, we have answered all our questions. We thank you all for your time today and thank you all for joining us on the call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, August 16, 2016.", "And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ernie Hermann, Chief Executive Officer and President of TJX Companies, Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you, Jim. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.", "Debra McConnell", "Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the Company\u2019s results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the Company\u2019s plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the Company\u2019s SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 29, 2016.", "Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies Inc.

Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results in our international divisions in today\u2019s press release and the Investor Information section of our website, tjx.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ernie.", "Ernie Herrman", "Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. Let me begin by saying that I\u2019m very pleased with our second quarter results. Consolidated comp-store sales grew a strong 4% over a 6% increase last year and above our plan. This marks the 30th consecutive quarter of comp growth for TJX. We are thrilled that the comp was once again driven almost entirely by customer traffic. This is also the seventh consecutive quarter that traffic was the primary driver of our comp increase.", "In addition, it was great to see the traffic was the primary driver of the comp increases at all four major divisions as our great brands, amazing values and eclectic merchandise mix keep resonating with consumers. We are convinced that we are attracting new customers, driving more frequent visits to our stores and gaining market share. Further, we are pleased with the strong performance across our apparel areas, including accessories and home businesses.", "Earnings per share increased 5%, well above our expectations and over a strong increase last year. We achieved these results despite significant headwinds from wage increases and investments to support our growth. Further, we were extremely pleased with our strong merchandise margin increase despite a significant impact from transactional foreign exchange.", "Our results once again demonstrate the power of our flexible business model and our ability to execute across many different retail environments. With our strong second quarter performance, we are raising our full-year comp and EPS guidance.", "Looking ahead, the third quarter is off to a solid start, and we have many initiatives planned for the back half of the year to keep driving traffic and sales. We are confident we will achieve our goals and as always, our management team will strive to surpass them. We see many near and long-term opportunities for growth and are well on our way to growing TJX to a $40 billion-plus company.", "Before I continue, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott to recap our second quarter numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. As Ernie mentioned, our second quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 4% over last year\u2019s 6% growth, which was above our plan. I want to note that this reflects the comp growth in our brick-and-mortar stores and excludes our e-commerce businesses.", "We were very pleased that customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division again this quarter. It was also great to see an increase in our units sold for another consecutive quarter. Average ticket decreased slightly more than planned.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.84, a 5% increase over last year\u2019s $0.80 and well above our plan. As expected, our EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 3% due to wage increases. The impact of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange had a neutral impact to EPS growth versus our expectation of a 2% negative impact.", "Consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.6%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.4%, up 30 basis points versus last year and significantly better than we planned. This was primarily due to a strong increase in merchandise margins and gains on our inventory hedges.", "SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year\u2019s ratio. This increase was primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth, as we had planned.", "At the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were flat on a constant currency basis. We are very pleased with our lean inventory position entering the third quarter as we are set up extremely well to flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the back half of the year.", "Now to recap our second quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comps increased a strong 4% this quarter on top of last year\u2019s 4% increase. Once again, it was terrific to see customer traffic as the primary driver of the comp increase. We continue to see a decrease in average ticket and significant increase in units sold. We are pleased that our merchandise mix and values remain a great draw for customers, which tells us that our strategies to balance the mix and offer even better values are working.", "Segment profit margin decreased 30 basis points as our very strong merchandise margin increase was more than offset by wage increases and costs associated with a lower average ticket. We are very pleased with the comp and traffic momentum at our largest division and have many initiatives planned to keep gaining market share.", "HomeGoods delivered another great quarter, with comps increasing 5% over last year\u2019s 9% growth. Segment profit margin was up 50 basis points due to an extremely strong increase in merchandise margins. As we anticipated, wage increases continue to have a significant negative impact in HomeGoods margin. Separately, to support the long-term growth potential of this chain, we opened a new distribution center in Tucson, Arizona in the second quarter. As a reminder, we see the potential to expand HomeGoods to be a 1,000-store chain, nearly double its current size.", "At TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 9% this quarter, over last year\u2019s 12% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency was down 150 basis points. This decrease was primarily due to the negative impact at the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar had on merchandise margins.", "That said, we are very pleased with the sharp execution of our Canadian organization, which mitigated some of this pressure. TJX\u2019s Canada\u2019s margins were also impacted by increased supply chain cost as we opened a new distribution center to support this country\u2019s future growth. We continue to be thrilled with the strength we have seen across all three of our Canadian chains.", "TJX International\u2019s comps were up 2%, over a 5% increase last year. While sales in the UK were slightly lower than we planned, our trends leading up to the Brexit vote were very strong. In addition, we were pleased to perform much better than many major retailers in the UK as the Brexit vote weighed on consumers there. We believe we are gaining significant market share in this environment. This speaks to our resiliency and ability to drive sales even in challenging times.", "As a whole, TJX International comps were in line with our plans due to the strong performance of our other European regions. It was also nice to see the benefit of our diversified European store base this quarter. Further, as we began the third quarter, comps in the UK have been positive.", "Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency was down 260 basis points. This decline was primarily due to a combination of integrating Trade Secret in Australia into our business, investments to support growth and wage increases. We feel great about our international growth potential and our opportunity to maximize our first-mover advantages in many geographies.", "I\u2019ll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the second quarter, we bought back $400 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.2 million shares. For the first half of the year, we have retired 10.2 million shares, buying back $775 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I\u2019ll recap our third quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 guidance at the end of the call.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thanks, Scott. I\u2019ll begin by reiterating our key strengths, which give us great confidence. We believe these strengths not only differentiate TJX from most other major retailers, but also position us for continued success, particularly in today\u2019s retail environment.", "First, we are a global sourcing machine, a world-class buying organization, has more than 1,000 associates seeking the best merchandise from the universe of more than 18,000 vendors in over 100 countries. We are extremely proud of the depth, experience, and longevity of our buying teams, which we are convinced, is a major TJX advantage.", "Second, our global supply chain distribution network and proprietary systems have been built and refined to support our global off-price business model. The flexibility of our global infrastructure allows us to adjust the merchandise flow to our stores and respond rapidly to changing consumer and market trends. We believe this is a key advantage in any retail environment.", "Next, we are leveraging our global presence and expertise. Our four major divisions operate as one TJX across nine countries and three continents and are highly integrated and synergistic. We have a culture where associates are encouraged to share ideas, initiatives, and best practices that can be leveraged across our businesses.", "All of these factors that differentiate TJX enable us to deliver amazing value to consumers. Value has been the mission of our Company since day one. We are confident that offering consumers quality, branded merchandise at great values will continue to attract more U.S. and international shoppers to our stores.", "Now, I will briefly recap our three major growth drivers. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. Our results tell us that our strategies and initiatives are working. We are even more excited about the opportunity we see to capture additional market share in the U.S. and internationally. While e-commerce represents a very small percentage of our overall sales, we see it as a complement to our physical location and another way to drive incremental sales and traffic.", "Next, is our enormous global store growth potential. With nearly 3,700 stores today, we see the opportunity to grow by more than 50% to 5,600 stores long-term. This includes nearly 1,400 more stores in North America and over 500 additional stores in Europe and Australia. This reflects the opportunity we see with just our current chains in just our current markets alone, and that\u2019s before contemplating the potential to expand into new countries or open new chains in existing markets.", "Our third major growth driver is new seeds and innovation. We are always testing new ideas and initiatives across the Company that could lead to new categories or meaningful drivers of future growth. I am convinced that our constant focus on innovation will keep us differentiated from the rest of the retail world.", "To support our goals for growth, we continue to make significant investments in the business. We are investing where we believe we can capitalize on our first-mover advantages and build upon our leadership positions around the world. While we expect our investments in new seeds, IT systems, supply chain, including distribution centers and talent to impact our EPS growth in the short-term, we are confident that they will allow us to gain additional market share in the long-term.", "Now, I\u2019ll spend a moment on our opportunities for the back half of the year. First, we have many exciting gift-giving initiatives planned for the holiday season. Every year, our goal is to be even better than the year before. We will be offering amazing gift selections from around the world, all at exciting values and shipping them throughout the holiday season.", "I believe all these factors will be a major differentiator for all of our retail brands this holiday season.", "Second, I\u2019m very excited about our marketing strategy for the back half. We feel very good about our fall creative campaigns, and during the holiday season, we will be rolling out our tri-branding campaigns in the U.S. and Canada again this year. We\u2019ll also continue our integrated marketing approach to TV, digital, mobile and social media to engage a wide shopper demographic.", "Third, to encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping our brands, we\u2019re growing our loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada. We also continue to be pleased with our pilot program in the UK.", "Next, every day, we work to upgrade the shopping experience in our stores. Our customer satisfaction scores increased at every division in the second quarter and we have a number of plans for the back half. We believe our in-store initiatives will make the shopping experience exciting, convenient and extremely positive for consumers during this busy time of year.", "Lastly, we see a marketplace that is loaded with quality-branded goods. We are extremely pleased with the abundance of merchandise available to us for the fall and winter seasons. In closing, I am so proud of our organization\u2019s excellent performance in the second quarter.", "Marmaxx, TJX Canada and HomeGoods significantly outperformed their plans, and TJX International proved, once again, the resiliency of our off-price model in challenging times. In today\u2019s uncertain environment, both in the U.S. and internationally, the power and flexibility of our off-price model gives me and our entire management team tremendous confidence.", "TJX is a Company that has achieved sales and profit growth through many kinds of retail, economic and political climates. Throughout our history, we have seen time and time again that when we stay focused on execution and we deliver compelling brands, fashion and values to consumers, we succeed.", "I am convinced we are gaining market share, and I am excited about our opportunities for the second half of the year. We remain laser-focused on driving traffic and sales across all divisions. Our management team is committed to achieving our plans, and we\u2019re passionate about surpassing them. I\u2019m very confident that we have the people and strategy in place to successfully achieve our goals for the future.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Ernie. Before I begin, I want to briefly talk to the implication of Brexit for us going forward. We continue to monitor the situation very closely, including how we may need to adapt to comply with potential changes such as new regulations or requirements. We remain as confident as ever in the strength and growth prospects of our European business.", "Further, we are convinced that the flexibility of our business model will continue to serve us well and allow us to gain market share and capitalize on the off-price buying opportunities that disruptions in the marketplace tend to create.", "Now to fiscal 2017 guidance, beginning with the full-year. As we stated in our press release this morning, we recently offered eligible former TJX associates who have not yet commenced their pension benefit an opportunity to receive a lump-sum payout of their vested pension benefit.", "We anticipate that the impact of this pension payout, primarily a non-cash settlement charge, could negatively impact fiscal 2017 EPS by approximately $0.03 to $0.05, but could be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors. To be clear, all of the guidance we are providing today excludes the potential impact of this pension payout offer. Further, we plan to present adjusted results in the third quarter that will exclude its potential impact.", "Moving on as Ernie mentioned, we are raising our full-year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect our above-plan second quarter. We now expect fiscal 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.43, which would be up 2% to 3% versus $3.33 in fiscal 2016.", "As a reminder, our plans assume a negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We are also raising our full-year comp sales guidance given our above-plan sales in the second quarter. We now expect a comp increase of 3% to 4% on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2017.", "For the year, pretax profit margin is planned to be in the 11.2% to 11.3% range versus 11.8% last year. We\u2019re looking for gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.6% to 28.7% versus 28.8% last year.", "We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be approximately 17.3% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% and net interest expense of about $48 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately $665 million.", "Now to our full-year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are planning a comp growth of 3% on sales of $20.9 billion to $21 billion. Additionally, we now expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.0%. For the second half of fiscal 2017, we are now planning Marmaxx\u2019s average ticket to decrease slightly versus last year. The balance of our merchandise mix and our values are clearly resonating with customers and consumers, and we plan to continue with our strategies. As always, we are all about great product and our value gap with traditional retailers.", "Importantly, despite the expected decrease in average ticket, we are still looking for merchandise margins to increase. At HomeGoods, we continue to expect comps to increase 4% to 5% on sales of $4.3 billion. We now expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.1% to 13.3%.", "At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 7% to 8% on sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. We now expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency to be in the range of 13.5% to 13.6%.", "At TJX International, we are expecting comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency to be in the range of 5.5% to 5.6%.", "Now to Q3 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85 versus last year\u2019s $0.86 per share. The guidance assumes an expected negative impact EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We are modeling third quarter consolidated sales of $8.1 billion to $8.2 billion. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX.", "For comp store sales, we are assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Third quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.9% to 11.1% range versus 12.1% last year. We are anticipating third quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.9% to 29.0% versus 29.0% last year. This assumes an increase in merchandise margins offset by continued transactional foreign exchange pressure and costs associated with opening new distribution centers to support our growth.", "We are expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the 17.7% to 17.8% range versus 16.7% last year. This is primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% and net interest expense of about $11 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately $663 million.", "Our third quarter and full-year guidance implies a fourth quarter comp increase of 1% to 2% and EPS of $0.98 to $1. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call. It is important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the third quarter.", "Before we start Q&A, I want to remind you of some of the potential headwinds we are facing in fiscal 2018 based on what we know today. We plan to provide detailed fiscal 2018 guidance on our year end call, but we wanted to review these few points, as we have heard a lot of questions on them.", "First, we expect that wage increases will have a similar negative impact to EPS growth next year as we are planning this year, so about 3%. Further, we anticipate that wage pressures will continue beyond fiscal 2018. Second, while foreign exchange is an unknown today, at current rates, we would expect foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange to continue to have a negative impact to margins and EPS growth next year.", "Finally, in fiscal 2018, we plan to continue our investments in our IT system, supply chain and new seeds to support our growth goals. Again, we\u2019ll provide detailed fiscal 2018 guidance on our year end call.", "Wrapping up, to reiterate what Ernie said, we feel great about our business and our opportunities for the back half of the year. We believe our increases in traffic, sales, and merchandise margins are all indicators of the fundamental strength of our business. We continue to make important investments in the business and fund new seeds that we are convinced would help us gain market share in the short and long-term. We are extremely excited about the future of TJX.", "Now, we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we are going to ask that you please limit your questions to one per person. Thanks, and now we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Kimberly Greenberger. You may ask your question.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Good morning and congratulations on the really solid second quarter. Ernie, my question is on the AUR. I may not be remembering correctly, but I thought last year, we\u2019ve started to see the AUR declined in the second quarter. And it sounds like from your comments today anniversarying that, there are some incremental AUR declines.", "In May, when we talked about this, you indicated that the buyers are seeing really nice opportunities to actually fortify the assortment at the opening price point across categories, and that\u2019s really been the driver. So is that still the driver here going into year two, if I\u2019m remembering that correctly? And are there some incremental opportunities that the buyers are seeing out there across categories? Thanks.", "Ernie Herrman", "Kimberly, good memory. Yes, we discussed that really over the last year. There\u2019s been a lot of dynamics going on there. I would say that the average ticket situation has really been a combination and continues to be a combination. It isn\u2019t just the buying better value. It\u2019s also a tweaking of the mix across some departments.", "So some categories have been emphasized while others deemphasized and some departments and so happens that in some of those areas, the average ticket is lower. And since we have brought them up driven, and I think we did talk about that before as well with you guys, we don\u2019t top-down manage that process. The buyers really drive the bus on that.", "And so what happens is some of our other businesses and that are trending happened to have lower average ticket and as we chase them, that lowers the total average ticket in the store down. Having said that, it has moderated from where we were a year ago, and we actually thought at this point, we\u2019d be a little bit more moderated, but it is still leveling off from where it was six months ago. So we\u2019re pretty happy with that.", "To your second question about the opportunities out there, and I guess, you\u2019re getting out just in general, right? Is that you\u2019re not just referring to certain opportunities at certain average tickets, right?", "Kimberly Greenberger", "In general.", "Ernie Herrman", "In general. Well and we kind of put this in the script, and it\u2019s something we don\u2019t like too many specifics on, but the markets have an exceptional amount of goods. The markets always have a lot of goods. So we just right now, I would say have had to be very diligent on holding back our buyers and not buying too soon.", "We always have to do that. I would say that we probably had a ramp that effort up a little more strongly than we have in the past only because of the environment out there is yielding a little bit more than we typically would see, especially at this time period. Right now, it\u2019s not exactly the time period you would see so much, but there is quite a bit out there.", "So yes, a lot of opportunities in it not one area, not one price zone, not like moderate or better, a little bit across the board. And so one thing we\u2019ve strategically done is we leaned up our inventories to more of a flat level so that we could take advantage of this marketplace. Because the marketplace is so flushed with goods, we thought it was a good time to actually lean up our inventories a little bit more than we had been running. So that\u2019s one reason you saw a little shift there where even a little bit more liquid than we were three months or six months ago.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Fantastic good luck for the second half.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you, Kimberly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow. You may ask your question.", "Ike Boruchow", "Hi, good morning, everyone. Let me add my congratulations on the quarter.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you.", "Ike Boruchow", "I guess, my question is you clearly have some big investments you talked about in the call today around new DCs and supply chain that continue to take shape. And there is ongoing headwinds around wages that you\u2019ll need to plan for as well. So when you look at some - maybe some of the money losing areas of the business today, and I\u2019m assuming online falls in that bucket, do you internally discuss what strategies may not be as compelling as they may have looked several years ago or maybe you didn\u2019t understand what kind of expense pressures loomed here in 2016, 2017, 2018?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, Ike, let me jump in, and I think Scott will probably jump in right after. You make a great \u2013 it\u2019s interesting what you\u2019re asking is somewhat of a question, somewhat of a statement. When you think about how we handle e-com and to your point, e-com, and I think we said it many, many times, it\u2019s a relatively small portion of our business. And we specifically, under the heading of what you\u2019re really kind of talking about is looking at it in the total.", "We look at the opportunity, we weigh out the effort involved and certainly, the expense or profitability involved. And we say we want to take it step-by-step. And that is what we have done with our e-com business really to your question/statement. And Scott, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add there, but that\u2019s really strategically how we look at that piece of the business and it would fall under the heading, I think you were talking about is something that you don\u2019t feel too heavily. Although we\u2019re happy with the way it\u2019s going.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, as Ernie, I think, has said before that primary driver with us opening up almost 200 stores this year and hopefully more than that in the future, that\u2019s going to be the primary driver of our incremental sales growth and the comp growth on our existing base.", "Having said that, as Ernie said, we\u2019re pleased with a lot of the metrics and the sales growth we see at tkmaxx.com and tjmaxx.com we like our conversion, our average order value, a lot of what we see the adding of categories, vendors, et cetera.", "So I think we\u2019ve said that before and we\u2019re investing proportionately on our $1 billion plus capital. We\u2019re spending money, but it\u2019s proportionate to the size of the business. So I think that\u2019s all I have to add.", "Ike Boruchow", "Great. Thanks.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez. You may ask you question.", "Paul Lejuez", "Hey, thanks guys. Hey Macy\u2019s closing 100 stores at the end of this year. Just curious what that means to you guys - clearing through inventory as those stores do close down versus the market share opportunity potential for you guys next year. How are you thinking about it? And what have you seen in the last class of Macy\u2019s stores that have closed. And I\u2019m just curious if you do anything from a marketing perspective in those markets? Thanks.", "Ernie Herrman", "Paul, good question, clearly, an indicator of the times that we\u2019re in and the environment that\u2019s out there, we don\u2019t like to comment specifically on another retailer or what\u2019s going on there. Under our big heading, you heard us talk about gaining market share numerous times throughout our call. That is still our focus. We believe any of the uneasiness that\u2019s happening or any of the store closures not just Macy\u2019s, anywhere across the board in this market. And there\u2019s been a fair amount announced this year in FY 2017, let alone in FY 2016.", "And I think it\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at. We believe there\u2019s market share \u2013 additional market share opportunities for us. We don\u2019t really watch the actual closing effects as much and what that does in the nearby locations because it\u2019s temporary, so we tend to be more long-term oriented. But clearly, there\u2019s some uneasiness and some changing dynamics with all the store closures that are going on domestically and internationally, by the way. So we look at what\u2019s happening domestically. And there\u2019s far beyond just Macy\u2019s. Scott?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, I think a couple of points, as Ernie \u2013 I mean, in addition to Macy\u2019s, I mean, it\u2019s been between all - the close to 2,000 stores that are going to be closing Macy\u2019s. The Macy stores that they announced last year, the 35 to 40, as Ernie said, just to put this in context when we were asked over previous years with other retailers. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re getting our fair share from other retailers, but when other retailers comps have gone up and down, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the primary driver of the comp increase that we\u2019re getting.", "But I do think, as Ernie said, it does pertain well for us, not necessarily per se Macy\u2019s, but the real estate environment as other retailers both \u2013 as Ernie indicated both in Europe and the U.S. too, feel confident in our store openings that we\u2019ve talked about and hopefully even more in the future.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. To that point, by the way, it\u2019s a little bit of a tangent, but when we look at the Europe environment, and Scott was just touching on it, we feel like there are real estate opportunities for acquiring real estate sites as well as merchandising and sales, market share opportunity. So that\u2019s another interesting dynamic that will take place.", "Paul Lejuez", "Thanks, guys. Good luck.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Baker. You may ask your question.", "Michael Baker", "Thanks, guys. I want to ask about the trend of the business through the quarter. Can you talk about how that played out? And one thing if you look at is the gap between your comps and department stores and while you guys are clearly taking market share still that gap did narrow. I\u2019m wondering did you see them being a little bit more promotional, just try to win back some share or anything specific to point out there? Thanks.", "Ernie Herrman", "So Mike, on the gap narrowing, are you looking at that relatively like first quarter or...", "Michael Baker", "Yes, exactly. If you just simply do your comps minus an average for some of the discount department stores and compare that gap to what it was in the first quarter, it did narrow. So I was just wondering if you could provide why you think that may have happened, were they more promotional or any other thoughts? Thanks.", "Ernie Herrman", "I don\u2019t know. We have a few dynamics going on. I don\u2019t know if this is the total answer, but one thing is we were up against a six comp in the second quarter, that\u2019s one thing. Number two, when we talked about we\u2019ve been open about this in our first quarter, we have when we ran a seven, we had a benefit of weather, which we \u2013 that helped us by a little bit and certainly we still had a very healthy comp.", "And then secondly, in our second quarter, because Europe is a piece of our business, we probably would have been a point higher in comp if Europe was more normalized. So if you take into account the pre-Brexit trend we had versus post, we would have been \u2013 and Scott has to run the numbers, we would have been a five. But I don\u2019t know if that answers you. I don\u2019t know what numbers you\u2019re looking at. I guess, we look at it and we still say we ran up \u2013 at the end of the day, we ran a four comp on a six comp at the 10% two-year stack, and we feel pretty good about it.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. I mean, not much different than Ernie assuming, as if you somewhat normalize in the first quarter we\u2019ve been running for the last three quarters in the \u2013 that 10% two-year stack, which we started to accelerate too, in the fourth quarter so feel good. And again, as Ernie said, in terms of the UK business, they were trending quite strongly before Brexit, extremely strongly in the regions outside of the UK. And I think as we just indicated a few minutes ago, pleased with our trends going in as we start the first quarter in our European businesses \u2013 third quarter.", "Michael Baker", "Okay, thanks. And trend through the quarter by month? Can you guys give us some color there?", "Ernie Herrman", "We don\u2019t give that.", "Scott Goldenberg", "No, we don\u2019t give the color on that Michael.", "Michael Baker", "Okay. Thanks for the [outlook].", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti. You may ask your question.", "Michael Binetti", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the detail today.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Good morning.", "Michael Binetti", "So it sounds like just listening to some of the people reporting over the last few weeks, the industry is looking at the strategy is inventories cleaner into the back half. It seems like some of your competitors are pivoting towards a lower levels of promotionality in the second half of the year. How do you see a pivot like that impacting you into the back half? And maybe what kind of traffic are you baking into the second half comp guidance?", "Ernie Herrman", "So Michael, I mean, if we\u2019ve seen some articles, lower levels of promotions, which fairly could to be tied to leaner inventories I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at that\u2019s what some of the articles that talk to. If the retailers in general promote less, there\u2019s for us that widens the gap. So what\u2019s interesting is as we look at that as still market share opportunity. And probably a little bit of margin opportunity and that there\u2019s still availability out there.", "It doesn\u2019t mean we will raise retails on like-for-like items because we say it\u2019s an opportunity so we\u2019ve been better at value and passing on to the consumer. So I guess, bottom line, we don\u2019t get that caught up in that as to what happens with those type of forecast or in reality. Over a longer-term, I guess, you would see us adjust some things if it happened over a six-month, nine-month period, but probably does not shift us much in the shorter-term.", "Michael Binetti", "If I could follow-up, you gave a lot of good detail, obviously you are very confident in your traffic that you\u2019ve seen fairly consistently and on the store count opportunity so we can kind of built some thinking around how you guys are looking at your topline. But for a while, the earnings algorithm seem to pretty steady low double-digit algorithm has been some costs that have come up, but we\u2019re now almost two years into the wages and the FX volatility.", "As you look ahead since you gave us some preliminary comments on next year, does this ramp urgency to you to try and find others and the supply chain drive out cost to try and pull their earnings algorithm back up to low doubles? Or do you think we\u2019re in extended period where you say, look we want to continue gaining the share even if that means mid single-digit algorithm for a couple of years?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, I think you just summed it up well. Our focus would be \u2013 we think long-term, what we\u2019re very, very happy about is long-term continuing to gain market share and do everything we talked about the store execution and the merchandise mix, driving that is our best form of marketing and long-term customer retention. And that\u2019s for our long-term growth.", "So I guess, yes, we haven\u2019t commented what the long-term model is, but we really are driven to beat the topline, that\u2019s been our focus and drive traffic because we think long-term, over the next three to five years, that\u2019s the best thing we can do, especially in this environment where consumers are fairly open to where they shop. So it\u2019s a good time to keep acquiring new customers and increase frequency of our existing customers.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Stein. You may ask your question.", "Jeffrey Stein", "Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going out in Canada? You\u2019ve seen outside comps now for quite a few quarters and wondering what the dynamic is that\u2019s driving topline there. Thank you.", "Scott Goldenberg", "I think with Canada, again, we had a nine comp versus our 14 comp, so we\u2019ve \u2013 obviously, the foreign exchange has kept us some of the Canadians who would tend to shop cross-border in Canada shopping there. We would attribute some of that, but certainly, it\u2019s not the most significant we think of why we\u2019re getting nine in 10 comps. So there have been store closings. So I think we\u2019ve \u2013 and I\u2019ll let Ernie talk about the mix, the merchandise I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving it. But there\u2019s a bit of the cross-border shopping or people just helping out, our people staying and not traveling as much.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. Jeff, the other thing \u2013 as you can imagine, when you have comps like we\u2019ve been having up here, there\u2019s not one answer because the comps are so significant. So a few things we believe playing into it. One is like as Scott said you have the cross-border purchasing retention whether not leaving the country as much and that can apply to also not spending out online right, so they could\u2019ve spent more online before U.S. dollars so that stays there.", "But one of the important things that has happened is we talk a lot about our talent and how we\u2019ve had such a push throughout our Company on building talent and merchant talent and our buying organization even in the script today we talked about competitive advantage.", "We have a team up there who now is really executing, I think, at a high level, and a lot of that is because about three years ago, we started putting a full-court press on developing that team and stretching them and putting in the type of training programs and seniority and tenure that we really wanted that we - at the time did not actually have up there as much as we have in some of our other businesses.", "So when you have a strong merchant team, which we do up there, merchandising and planning, and its more seasoned now, you start to reap some of the benefits, and I think that\u2019s what we were also reaping last year as well as this year. Probably one of the biggest reasons I think is that merchant team up there.", "Jeffery Stein", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thanks Jeff.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Marni Shapiro. You may ask your question.", "Marni Shapiro", "Hey, guys, congratulations.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you, Marni.", "Marni Shapiro", "Ernie, I\u2019m thinking your buyers are having a very relaxing summer.", "Ernie Herrman", "I am not sure.", "Marni Shapiro", "So I\u2019m curious, you\u2019ve talked a lot about the trends here in the United States about strong traffic, adjusting the AURs down a little bit, the abundance of goods. Can you talk to those three trends even specifically globally? Is traffic up globally? Have you changed the AURs globally? Is there an abundance of inventory globally?", "Ernie Herrman", "So let me just, without giving you too much detail, say yes, the availability is global, and it has been global \u2013 it\u2019s not just recent I would say it\u2019s been that way for a year or two now. And so some, by the way, some of what we have been buying in Marmaxx and in HomeGoods is abundance of merchandise located internationally that we brought over here as well as our Europe division has clearly taken advantage of goods in Europe and in other places. I mean, there are goods everywhere, Far East. There\u2019s no more than \u2013 it\u2019s not just a domestic trend, I guess, which is I think what you\u2019re asking Marni, right?", "Marni Shapiro", "Yes, exactly.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And then the traffic increase has been across all divisions for several quarters now.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, so that implies overseas as well.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes.", "Marni Shapiro", "And then the ticket price, have you adjusted that globally as well or is that something you\u2019re just doing at Marmaxx?", "Ernie Herrman", "It\u2019s primarily Marmaxx, but again, when you ask that question, adjusted, we bottom-up the ticket, so each division, it would tell you [worked out] to be Marmaxx to the largest degree, but it will \u2013 when we say it\u2019s Marmaxx, it could change in a few months where we have the other divisions come down in ticket based on the dynamics where merchandise managers and buyers see an unknown area where they have an opportunity in a category or in buying something better.", "Again, we\u2019ve had half of this fee from the mix not just from a buying the same item better. So that has spanned out, and it\u2019s bottom-up though. So it\u2019s not something we drive from here, so not only is it driven as divisions it\u2019s driven down at the like middle management buyer level in a division.", "Marni Shapiro", "That\u2019s great. If I just one last follow-up on that. Are you also seeing I know the HomeGoods has been very strong and home in general has been strong here. You had a nice lift from it sounds like women\u2019s. Are you seeing those kinds of trends is home strong globally? And are you seeing category trend similar globally that you\u2019re seeing in the U.S.?", "Ernie Herrman", "So our home trend obviously, as we\u2019ve reported, is very healthy. And as we talk \u2013 as we talked many times, our merchants share best practices and share a lot of ideas and information as well as category performance. So those guys, like any of our teams, do share that information globally.", "Marni Shapiro", "Excellent. Best of luck for the fall season.", "Ernie Herrman", "Okay. Thank you, Marni.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Oliver Chen. You may ask your question.", "Oliver Chen", "Thanks a lot. Ernie, regarding your earlier comments, what would you isolate as in the gift-giving department that the biggest year-over-year changes in terms of what you might be doing differently this year versus last year? And also, as you guys think about your in-store execution and customer satisfaction levels as well as strength, what are the big opportunities that you see with in-store execution that we should think about over the near and longer-term? Thank you.", "Ernie Herrman", "Well, Oliver, let me say two good questions, both of which we really can\u2019t give you the information on. Gift-giving is like we often say, we are poised strategically, and this is something we\u2019ve looked at in all of the four major divisions. We\u2019re poised to do a better job from \u2013 I can\u2019t give you any specifics, but what I could say is from a how about this, from a merchandise mix perspective, on a marketing front as well as store execution.", "Because we have worked at all three of those factors and try to become more of a gift-giving destination. So years ago, as you would probably guess, T.J. Maxx maybe was not the coolest gift from. We are now today very cool place to buy a holiday gift from. And our marketing programs have really helped with that. The merchandise mix. The other thing we\u2019ve done is because our supply chain is a better executed supply chain, we can turn goods around faster.", "So for holiday we have a lot of last-minute buys that now we can sprinkle in and get in pre-Christmas that we weren\u2019t able to do before. So that\u2019s something we talked about to you, but I think sometimes we forget to mention it again.", "So in addition to the strategic gift-giving marketing and store setup that we do and merchandise mix that this year we have some more, I would say fashion oriented categories that I think are going to be great impulse buys I think for the consumers. We\u2019re going to also have the quick turnaround from the market closer in unpredictable buys. I think it will create just a more exciting fourth quarter business. And what I just said to you it applies to all four divisions.", "And so I think I touched when I was saying that. I think I touched a little on the in-store execution, but we look at that is clearly and that\u2019s why it was in my script. We look at that the \u2013 first of all, we talk a lot about the merchants. Our store operators are fantastic, and we have some extremely talented associates in our store operating divisions across all of our companies. And that has become a place, and I think it helped with the cool factor and people shopping us is the way we execute our stores, and it\u2019s brought in younger customers and more excitement. Yes, merchandise is certainly a high priority, but that has been right there within in terms if I think driving topline and increasing market share.", "Oliver Chen", "Okay. And Scott, merch margins were impressive. Was the main driver here lower markdowns and faster inventory turns? Was there anything we should know about how you\u2019ve been able to do that so well?", "Scott Goldenberg", "The merchandise margins were extremely strong as we indicated at both Marmaxx and HomeGoods. And it was a combination obviously due to the above-plan sales, but it was combination of both mark-on and markdowns in both the combination of HomeGoods and Marmaxx. Offset those, still had some FX impact on currency in both Canada and Europe, more weighted toward Canada in the quarter. But no extremely strong margins, both in HomeGoods and Marmaxx.", "Oliver Chen", "Perfect. Thanks for the details and on next year too. Thanks for those details. Best regards.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann. You may ask your question.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask Ernie about a comment you made in your \u2013 I guess, as part of your script or Q&A just about the availability of goods right now relative to what you normally see just a whole lot of opportunity in the market. And I was hoping maybe you could put a little more context around that and also discuss if there\u2019s any \u2013 what you attribute that to and whether it\u2019s in a specific category or classification? Thanks.", "Ernie Herrman", "So Lindsay, also a good question. We really don\u2019t like to comment on specific areas of where the availability is high or low, categories, et cetera. What I would tell you is it\u2019s across all \u2013 most families of business and it is most price ranges. And it\u2019s not really a \u2013 it\u2019s not like [indiscernible] one area or another it seems to be fairly widespread. And then also, I\u2019d like to keep in mind, there\u2019s never not goods right, so when I say it\u2019s up a level from where it\u2019s been, it\u2019s not that there weren\u2019t goods before clearly because there\u2019s always goods and that\u2019s why we\u2019re always holding the merchants back. So I don\u2019t know if that answers your question.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "What do you attribute the change to?", "Ernie Herrman", "I\u2019d tell you one thing that has happened. So let me give you the internal versus the \u2013 so the external, we all know, the retail environment is holding up, but there\u2019s always new vendors opening. So the thing you have to keep in mind that I think it\u2019s easy to forget is we actually are up to about 18,000 vendors now that we deal with. So when we continue to expand our vendor portfolio and as you do that, you\u2019re going to find more goods. So that is one of the things we would attributed to is our desire to always open new vendors, which that\u2019s a little contrary to other models of retail.", "And the other models of retail, by the way are doing the right thing for their model of retail. Our model function is on a treasure hunt approach and a very shallow, a sorted, eclectic mix. And with that comes a desire to open thousands of vendors. And when you do that, there\u2019s tends to be even more availability of goods.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Ernie Herrman", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Jaffe. You may ask your question.", "Richard Jaffe", "Thanks very much guys and very impressive quarter. Ernie, could you spend a little time on marketing, particularly the loyalty program and how you see that working will it be across all brands or by division across all markets or just domestically? And how you expected to reach the consumer, will it be an outreach through e-mail, through texting, points, gift certificates. Could you give us some more details that would be very helpful? Thank you.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. Let me give you what I can, Richard. So the loyalty program domestically, I think you\u2019re aware we run \u2013 and I think when you ask about the loyalty program, you\u2019re also asking about the credit card, which...", "Richard Jaffe", "That\u2019s part of it, right.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. That credit card part of it has been very successful. We talked many times, I think Scott has actually given you some information on that a few times in the past. We also run what\u2019s called an access program, which is a \u2013 I guess, you call it not a hard reward. It\u2019s a soft reward loyalty program. It\u2019s not tied in with the credit card, but they get access to certain events. And there\u2019s a constant flow of information to \u2013 it hooks you up more within the T.J. Maxx or HomeGoods or Marshalls customer.", "Both have been growing and we are very, very happy with the growing of our credit card program, which we are adding significantly more active members. We can\u2019t give you the number, but significantly more every year. And obviously, we get additional spending from those consumers.", "When you go to Canada, they do not have a credit card loyalty program, but they do have a non-credit card loyalty program, which is also doing very, very well. And in the UK, we are testing a loyalty program as we speak. So that\u2019s kind of very early in the process. And when you ask what is our \u2013 our vision is to continue to do this in the model of our business because we don\u2019t want to do anything that gets how would I put it? ", "Gimmicky or promotional out of the loyalty program, which some retailers use it every now and then, do coupons, et cetera. So that is not we will take. But the way we do it, we feel like has brought tremendous communication between us and the consumer and loyalty and additional spending from those customers. Scott, you want to add anything?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. Again, I think we\u2019re talking we have millions of customers in our credit base program and we don\u2019t give the facts, but close to adding a seven-figure number almost every year. These are most loyal, as Ernie said, most loyal customers how they cross-shop more than our other customers. I think Ernie said it right. We will add \u2013 we would love to add things to our other countries, but we have to do it within the confines of our business model and our partners what\u2019s available for both \u2013 works from both us and them.", "One of the things I think we just mentioned earlier when Ernie was talking about stores and our sales is that our customer satisfactions scores have been going up in all of our divisions. I think some of it obviously absence to do with \u2013 pleased with what they found with a shopping \u2013 their overall shopping experience in finding the goods. But part of that has to do with the store presentation folks and doing a better job in our store standards, the friendliness of our store associates, hiring better folks, training better.", "And I think that certainly highly correlated to our \u2013 or having positive sales. And I think, again, our customer satisfaction scores have been going up at all of our divisions. One other thing failed to note going and talking about loyalty, in Canada, we have a non-credit based loyalty program that is extremely.", "Ernie Herrman", "Very successful.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Very successful in terms of the penetration more or so there than in the U.S. the total penetration and again I think they\u2019re just highly engaged and obviously, as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re very well known in Canada, so I think that is a piece of our business and why we\u2019re doing as well better there in terms of our comp sales.", "Richard Jaffe", "Thank you.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you, Richard.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Boss. You may ask your question.", "Matthew Boss", "Thanks. So on gross margin, what\u2019s the type of comp, what level of comp do you need to leverage buying and occupancy? What\u2019s the best way to think about merchandise margins in the back half of the year? And then just largely, I guess, the question is excluding foreign exchange and wages, I mean, has anything changed with your 10% to 13% bottom line model here?", "Scott Goldenberg", "I\u2019ll start addressing a few of those points. Again, we haven\u2019t been giving out the 10% to 13% because both last year and this year, there are three things we\u2019ve been talking about still exist, and that\u2019s why we did portend some of them. We\u2019re not going to say they are going to be at the same level, but the three major pieces being \u2013 wage being the biggest one, which is similar, we\u2019re not saying it\u2019s not going to go down in future years which if nothing happens it might moderate going past next year. But at the moment, we just called it out because it\u2019s approximately at the same rate at this year.", "The second is being foreign exchange, that\u2019s why we called it out, again at the moment it would not be at the impact of \u2013 this year\u2019s impact of 3%. But it\u2019s still would be low single-digits so we just wanted to call that out. So again, hopefully that will moderate and at some point will be a tailwind. Right now, it\u2019s a headwind.", "The third piece is the investment to support our growth, again primarily the distribution centers, and which has been a bit lumpy as I think we try to explained before because we did not planned the high level of comps we\u2019ve experienced in some of our businesses forcing us to move forward, make sure we can continue to gain all the market share we\u2019ve gained.", "So it will \u2013 those will still impact us going forward, but we think we\u2019ll moderate those systems and our distribution spend as we move forward in future years, but still going to impact us at least going forward for next year at a similar rate. And so those are three big components, so I don\u2019t think anything has changed. Hopefully, they\u2019ll start to moderate going forward.", "Matthew Boss", "Great. And then just the comp to leverage the buying and occupancy?", "Scott Goldenberg", "It\u2019s in and around 3%.", "Matthew Boss", "Okay. Great. Best of luck.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thank you.", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "Sir, we show no question in queue.", "Ernie Herrman", "Okay. I would like to thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our third quarter earnings call in November.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.", "Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ernie.", "Ernie Herrman", "Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. Let me begin by saying that I am extremely pleased that our momentum continued in the third quarter. Consolidated comp-store sales were strong 5% over a 5% increase last year and well above our plan. We are thrilled that customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of our comp again this quarter, which tells us that our merchandise mix and amazing values are resonating with consumers. We have convenience that we are gaining market share across all of our divisions. We also saw excellent performance in both our apparel and home businesses. Further merchandise margins were up significantly again this quarter, highlighting the strength of our model.", "Adjusted earnings per share went $0.91 also well above our expectations. Importantly, we believe that we achieve these results despite significant wage and foreign currency headwinds and while simultaneously investing to support our growth. With our strong third quarter performance we are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS growth. We are in at excellent position for the holiday selling season with many initiatives plan to drive traffic in sales throughout the quarter. As always, our management team has passionate about achieving its plans and striving to surpassed them. We are very confident and our ability to continue our successful growth and that is both in the U.S. and around the world.", "Before I continue, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott to recap our third quarter numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. As Ernie mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased a strong 5% exceeding our plan. As a remainder, this growth excludes our ecommerce businesses. It was great to see a momentum in customer traffic continue. Once again, traffic was the primary driver of our consolidated comp increase as we offered shoppers the merchandize they wanted at excellent values.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.83 versus last year's $0.86. As we detailed in today's press release, third quarter earnings per share included a debt extinguishment charge and pension settlement charge which combined reduce EPS by $.08, excluding these charges adjusted earnings per share were $0.91, a 6% increase over the same period last year and well above our plan. As expect EPS growth was negatively impacted by 3% due to wage increases. Foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS growth by 1% versus our plan for a 3% negative impact.", "Consolidated pretax profit margin was 10.7%, as we detailed in today's press release the combination of the debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges reduced consolidated pretax profit margin by 100 basis points, excluding these charges adjusted pretax profit margin was 11.7% down 40 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.5%, up 50 basis points versus last year and also significantly better than we planned. This was primarily due to our strong merchandise margins increase and gains on our inventory hedges.", "SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.6%, up 90 basis points versus last year\u2019s ratio. This increase was primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth, as we had anticipated.", "At the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were down 2% on a constant currency basis. We are very comfortable with a great liquidity in our inventory position entering the first quarter. We are in excellent position to buy and flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the holiday season.", "Now to recap our third quarter performance by division, Marmaxx's strong momentum continued with comps up 5% on comp of last year's 3% increase, again this quarter customer traffic was the primary driver of the comp and unit sales were up both of which or nice indication of the strength of our largest division. Average ticket was down slightly more than plan, the merchandise margins were up significantly. We continued our strategies of chasing hard categories and flexing within departments to offer the right merchandise mix in our stores. Our traffic sales and merchandise margin increases tell us our strategies are working.", "Segment profit margin decrease 40 basis points are very strong merchandise margin increased was more than offset by wage increases and costs associated with the lower average ticket. Marmaxx keeps delivering sales increases year-after-year, which underscores our confidence in the major growth potential that still remain at our largest division.", "HomeGoods delivered another excellent quarter, with comps increasing 6% over last year\u2019s 6% growth. We were very pleased that the traffic was the primary driver of the comp increase. Segment profit margin was down 10 basis points, as expected wage increases continue to have a significant negative impact on the margin. Further, we continue to incur cost related to the opening of our new distribution center last quarter to support the long-term growth potential of a thousand customers.", "Our customers love HomeGoods and we couldn\u2019t be happy with dispositions in traffic and growth prospects. At TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 8% this quarter, over last year\u2019s 10% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency was down 100 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to the merchandise margin pressure from transactional foreign exchange as well as additional supply chain costs including the opening of our new distribution center in Vancouver last quarter, the first new DC for Canada and about a decade.", "We continue to be very pleased with the excellent execution of our Canadian organization. TJX International\u2019s comps were flat versus last year strong 7% increase while sales were not as strong as we would have liked. We held up better than most major European retailers in the phase of the challenging retail environment and unseasonably warm fall weather. We are convinced, we are gaining market share in Europe and are focused on keeping new customers were attracting for the long-term.", "Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was down 170 basis points. The decline was primarily due to the integrating Trade Secret in Australia in our business, and some expense deleverage on the flat comp. That said, the team in Europe remained extremely disciplined and inventory management, which help mitigate some of the margin pressure. As we enter the fourth quarter, we see opportunities to approve upon last year\u2019s performance.", "I\u2019ll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the quarter, we paid out 170 million in shareholder dividends and bought back 400 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.2 million shares. For the first nine months of the year, we have paid out 482 million in shareholder dividends and retired 15.4 million shares, buying back 1.2 billion million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back 1.5 billion to 2 billion of TJX stock this year.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I\u2019ll recap our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017 guidance at the end of the call.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thanks, Scott. I\u2019d like to begin by highlighting our fundamental strengths, which we believe differentiate TJX from the marketplace and our key to continuing to gain market share.", "First, we have a world class buying organization with over 1,000 associates worldwide today. We have more than double the size of our buying team over the last 10 years. During this time we have added hundreds of new people to our buying team, and we also have many buyers who have been with us for multiple decades. We believe we are one of the widest demographics in retail and that the depth of our buying organization is helping us to attract customers of all ages. This includes millennial shoppers as we have offering fashions in brands relevant to them. Further our season buyers play a big role in teaching and training our new buyers and enhancing our off price buying methodology. I truly believe that the collective knowledge and expertise of TJX's buying organization is the best in retail.", "Second, we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine. Today, we source from universe of over 18,000 vendors and more than 100 countries. This is thousands more vendors and dozens more countries in a decade ago. We believe we are an increasingly attractive outlet for vendors, we operate almost 3,800 stores in nine countries, our opening new stores year after year and are selling a next to branded merchandise. We are flexible and straight forward in our dealings and offer vendors many ways to grow their business.", "Third, our global supply chain distribution network and IT systems have been developed and refines specifically to support our highly integrated international business and opportunistic buying. Our global distribution network can process thousands of buys from thousands of different vendors every week. Using our proprietary IP systems, our experienced planning and allocation team can precisely allocate that merchandise to the right store at the right time. Our flexibility allows us to react rapidly for changing market dynamics and consumer take to capitalize on hot product categories and the latest fashion trends. We see our global infrastructure as a major advantage of TJX.", "Next, we are capitalizing on our global presence. We have decades of operating experience in the U.S., Canada and Europe that we can leverage across the Company. We have successfully open in new country and retail brands by utilizing the expertise and operating knowledge across our organization. Our four major divisions are highly synergistic and share ideas, talent, initiatives and best practices. I believe that depth of our global off-price experiences unmatched and a key advantage as we continue our domestic and international growth. All of these course strings allow us to offer consumers an ever changing, eclectic mix of branded merchandize at amazing values every day. In addition, these elements of our business have taken us multiple decades to develop which is why they would be extremely difficult for any retailer to replicate.", "Now, let's talk about our growth initiatives which we are confident will lead to further market share gains. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We have grown our top line year after year and are convinced that huge opportunities remain to continue growing our customer base. We are very pleased that our latest research once again shows that millennial shoppers make up the biggest percentage of our new customers in the U.S. Further, our customer satisfactions score increase that every division. Innovation continues to be a major focus to keep our storage exciting and responsive to customer takes. And we are confidently testing new ideas in each of our retail brands.", "Our next major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. Long-term we see the potential to grow to 5,600 stores with just our current change in just our current markets alone. This represents more than 1,800 additional stores on top of our current base before contemplating the potential of new change or new countries. Further we see e-commerce as a complement to our physical locations and as a way to offer consumers the ability and convenience of shopping with us 24x7.", "To support our growth, we are making significant investments in our business which we have discussed on prior calls. I am very confident that we are making the right investments in our global infrastructure and new seeds to build on our leadership positions to and capitalize on our first mover advantages. We believe that all of this positions us very well for the future.", "Now, onto our opportunities for the fourth quarter which are numerous. First, we have great gift giving initiative underway. We are offering exciting selections from around the globe and plan to shift to our stores multiple times each and every week. Shoppers can expect to see something new and surprising every time they visit a strategy that has worked well for us in recent years and I believe differentiates us from most major retailers. We are also confident that our efforts to upgrade our storage and customer service will make the shopping experience an exciting and positive one to our customers this holiday season when their time is so very valuable.", "Second, we feel great about our marketing campaign, which all speak to who we are as a company. We are utilizing tried branded campaigns in the U.S. and Canada again this year. Our TV commercials have just launched and will be running every week throughout the holiday season. In addition, we are leveraging components of these campaigns across radio, digital and social media. In Europe, we\u2019ll be leveraging our holiday campaign across multiple geographies.", "Third, our loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada are an important vehicle for encouraging customers to shop us more frequently and across more of our retail brands. Next, we believe we continue to get better at transitioning our stores every year and are very focused on our post holiday plans. Most importantly, we\u2019ll be offering consumers compelling values on fantastic merchandize. The market place is loaded with quality branded merchandize across all of our geographies. We plan to take advantage of the numerous opportunities and by throughout December.", "In closing, I am very proud of our continued momentum of above planned the results and the sharp execution of our teams across the Company. It was great to see another quarter of such strong sales in traffic increases. The entire organization is laser focused on brining more shoppers into our stores this holiday season and throughout the year. We have a clear long-term vision for TJX and I am convinced that we will continue to drive market share gains and achieve our plans for global growth.", "I am proud of our ability to simultaneously invest in our growth drivers as well as infrastructure and organization to support our growth while returning cash to shareholders through our substantial share buyback program and dividends. I want to reiterate that our management team is passionate about achieving and surpassing our goals. We are very well on our way to becoming a $40 billion plus company.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Ernie. Now, the fiscal '17 guidance beginning with the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.96 to $0.98 versus last year's $0.99 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 6% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We are modeling fourth quarter consolidated sales of 9.3 billion to 9.4 billion. This guidance assumes 2% negative impact revenue due to translational FX.", "For comp store sales, we are assuming growth in the 1% to 2% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. This compares to a strong 6% comp increase for both TJX and Marmaxx in the fourth quarter last year. Fourth quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 11.0% to 11.1% range versus 11.9% last year. We are anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 27.9 to 28.0 versus 28.7 last year. We are expecting SG&A as a percent of sales in a range of 16.8% to 16.9% versus 16.7% last year. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 38.3% and net interest expense of about $10 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately $657 million.", "Moving on to full year guidance, on a GAAP basis we expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.41. As we noted in our press release today, we are raising our adjusted full year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect above plan third quarter results excluding the combined impact from the third quarter debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges, we are now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.46 to $3.48 this would be up 4% to 5% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. Our plan assumes a negative impact EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign current and transactional foreign exchange.", "As a remainder, we expect that wage increases will have the similar negative impact of approximately 3% to fiscal '18 EPS growth. On a consolidated basis we are expecting a comp increase of 4% in fiscal '17. For the year, we expect pretax profit margin to be approximately 11.2% excluding the negative impact from the third quarter debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges of approximately 20 basis points. We expect adjust pretax profit margins to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.4% range versus 11.8% last year.", "We are looking for gross profit margin to be approximately 28.9% versus 28.8% last year. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 17.4% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we are anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense of about $44 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately $664 million.", "Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are now planning comp growth of 4% on sales of $21.1 billion. Additionally, we expect segment profit margin to be about 14%. For the fourth quarter, we are assuming Marmaxx\u2019s average ticket to be down versus last year. At HomeGoods, we now expect comps to increase 5% to 6% on sales of $4.4 billion. We now expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.5%.", "At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 8% to 9% on sales of $3.2 billion. We now expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency to be in the range of 13.6% to 13.7%.", "At TJX International, we are expecting comp growth of about 2% on sales of $4.4 billion and adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency to be about 5.8%. It\u2019s important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter.", "Now, we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we are going to ask that you please limit your questions to one per person. Thanks, and now we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Lorraine Hutchinson. Your line is now open.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the commentary around Marmaxx\u2019s average ticket being down slightly more than planned? Was that due to mix or you continuing to see pressure from some of the department stores or other competitors on pricing? And then what\u2019s the outlook, I know you said ticket down versus last year. Do you think that gets worse in the fourth quarter or do you think you can hold this current level?", "Scott Goldenberg", "So, I\u2019ll just start and Ernie will chime in. First on average ticket, as we said earlier it\u2019s -- the majority of it in the third quarter has to do with chasing categories. So, it was more mix related based on consumer preferences that we were just -- that we\u2019re working on and we are following their taste. I\u2019d also like to just point out that we are buying better and passing some of those values onto the customers as our merchandise margin approved the both based on certainly markdown improvement based on the strong sales, but also an improvement in our mark-on so.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, Lorraine, also I think another thing I guess it speaks to mix a little bit -- is we had some seasonal -- the weather was fairly warm and we consciously went into third quarter knowing we\u2019re going to push back some of the seasonal categories, which tend to the higher ticket as well. So, as Scott said, we went after the touch for any category, but we also affected the ticket by consciously pushing off things like outwear a little bit later and heavy on its sweaters that tend to be higher ticket. So hopefully that makes sense and hopes answer that question. I think we\u2019ll continue to moderate as best we think. The only unknown is the market is loaded with goods and that piece that Scott referred to as the second piece could still be applicable as the environment stage rather difficult. We want to continue to take advantage of those opportunities. So tough to say, we still have plenty of open to buy as we look out into the spring first quarter, but hopefully that answered it.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, the only other thing to add is that on our last call, we didn\u2019t make a call on the average ticket. So, we have now average retail down in Marmaxx in the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s a change from our prior guidance. So, we provided for some of those cost in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Boss. Your line is now open.", "Matthew Boss", "Thanks. On the gross margins, can you just breakdown the 50 basis point expansion this quarter between the merchandise margin improvement in the FX gain? And then just the headwinds embedded in the fourth quarter guide, any commentary there? And then finally on FX as we think to next year, if rates held exactly where they are at today, how do we think about the headwinds from FX next year versus the 3% bottom line that you outlined this year?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Well, I\u2019ll try to get all three questions there Matt. The first in terms of the gross margin being up 50 basis points, so the majority of that was due to strong merchandise margin led by Marmaxx. We also had hedge benefit, so we would have been up more than the 50 with the combination of those two. But they are offset as we had cost related supply chain cost including our DC investments that offset actually some of the buying and occupancy leverage we had with our rent tax in camp. So a strong merchandise margin and some gain on the hedges offset by the supply chain cost. In terms of -- I\u2019ll go the third question on next year, too early to make a call on the FX. We will certainly talk about it next quarter, but as we talked about last quarter with the continuing drop of the pound, there clearly could be some pressure for FX next year primarily with the British pound impact on our Europe business.", "Matthew Boss", "And then fourth quarter headwinds?", "Scott Goldenberg", "The fourth quarter headwinds a significant part of that in the gross -- I assume you're calling at the gross margin is the two things, one is the reversal of the gain we had on the hedge which make up little less than half of our 70 basis point drop in gross profit margin of fourth quarter and then the continued supply chain cost, but also some deleveraged on the two comp at the high end that we have that\u2019s in the buying and occupancy line. So those would be the three major headwinds in the fourth quarter to the gross margin.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Binetti. Your line is now open.", "Michael Binetti", "Can I just continue on our last question, what level of comp do you think would help you mitigate that deleverage you talked about on some of the supply chain cost on the fourth quarter?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, typically it's a strong three that you need to leverage your buying and occupancy cost.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. Thanks. And then we have seen the department store is all coming and sort of lowering their inventories and you guys are saying AURs have been lower and part of it is mix? But so the -- it's seems like the gap should be widening for your pricing umbrella relative to the department store, is that historically can be as room to that guys move up more? Or do you look at that in sale, it looks an opportunity for us we always preferred to gather share? How do you look at kind of some of the high level changes we are seeing across the industry right now as far as your outlook for AUR?", "Ernie Herrman", "So, Michael, you\u2019re hitting on the two grade points. First of all, we look at it as market share opportunities. We\u2019re very reluctant to raise prices unless we see them raised. So we don\u2019t lead that process, we let those retailers as you\u2019re talking about even though that the lean inventories. They still have unfortunately rights in many cases decreasing sales based. So they are not necessarily going to raise that we haven\u2019t seen any way. And we let that process happen more bottom up from our buyers and merchandise managers that are always looking at what the other retailers are retailing actually.", "So, I tell you yes represent two opportunities, we do a little bit above, we might be able to go up and we tell as we see it happening, we just don\u2019t call that about our level, we really let that. Just like when by the way when you have average tickets were going down, that was driven by strategy from the buyer and merchandising manager level. This happens surgically, very surgically by item, by vendor down at the department level, when we surgically take them up at that time. So, hopefully that answers your question. It\u2019s really too -- you're hitting on both appropriately both aspects.", "Michael Binetti", "And can I just ask you, you referenced the comments you made last quarter about looking ahead to your fiscal 18 to next year a little bit and some of the headwinds for us to be thinking about as we do some longer range modeling? Would you mind truing us up, another quarter has gone by at this point, FX has moved a little bit. Minimum wages, you guys have done a good job of offsetting a lot of the wages. You also mentioned some investments to leave a little bit of flexibility. I think it all rounded out to 500 to 600 basis points of headwind in the model for next year, similar to this year. Is that still the right range to be thinking about? Any kind of updates to the way you've been thinking about that over the last three months? Thanks.", "Scott Goldenberg", "This is Scott. I think nothing, no new store report in terms of whether it\u2019s wages investments or as I talked earlier in terms of answering the question Matt asked on FX. So, we\u2019ll be giving long-term -- we\u2019ll be giving guidance and updating it on the next call as in that really no news store report. All, Michael, as we will plan to get into more debt FY18.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann. Your line is now open.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Hi. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could add any color on performance by region or by store type.", "Ernie Herrman", "The only thing that we talked about in terms of region and in terms of our largest division Marmaxx, the sales were strong across all of our regions in the U.S. I\u2019m not sure, if you\u2019re asking about the divisions or you\u2019re asking about Marmaxx, but sales were strong across all divisions and we are pleased that both parallel sales we\u2019re getting strong for the year third quarter in a row at Marmaxx as well.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Okay. Great. And just a follow-on. Inventory per store, excluding currency down, versus your comp, and has slowed or has been slowing for a few successive quarters. I was hoping maybe you could give a little more color as to what's going on, if there's any shift in your approach to buying and any sort of change in the availability of goods out there for you to buy? Thanks.", "Ernie Herrman", "Lindsay, when you\u2019re saying slower, you mean, you seen the inventory levels coming down.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Yes, exactly.", "Ernie Herrman", "Overtime here recently, so there is a -- how would I put it -- there is always a lot of goods, but as you saw or heard in the script and we talked about that last time as well. The market is ramped up a little bit in terms of more loaded market place across more categories than we have seen in the past. So as much as you will read that we tell you timed up an inventory, we are not running into that situation in terms of market availability in terms of what's in the wholesale market. So that presents an opportunity for us to where possible run with linear inventories to take advantage closer in on the buying. So hopefully you understand, we are going to try to buy I guess simplifying it more hand to mouth closer in than we were a year ago because of the availability.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "And that\u2019s a primary driver of your change in inventories being down now?", "Ernie Herrman", "It's a piece, yes, while we have an iteration sometimes when you look at this year versus last year, you can -- when you're off-price and opportunistic, you can have gyrations that hit point in time that aren't pure as that. But we did feel like at this time period, it would be nice to have more liquidity based on what's going on in the market. So it was -- I would say I don\u2019t know half of that was a strategy.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, I mean we just to echo on what Ernie, we ended the second quarter with our inventories on a constant currency flat, and we delivered a flat comp. And I think going back over many periods whether our inventories have been low or slightly higher than that it's really has an impacted our ability to procure the inventory and fit whatever sales are out there for us to get. Having said that, as Ernie said, also we are very conformable in our per-store inventories at the store across all our divisions are pretty much where we want them to be.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, I would say right now this is textbook where we would like to be. We couldn't ask for to be in a better position going into this quarter than where we are right in the inventories and the open a buy.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez. Your line is now open.", "Paul Lejuez", "Curious about your future investment in e-com? What are those investments going to look like relative to what you spent in the past? Are you thinking about kicking them up? Pulling them back? And also curious as relates to e-com, if you included the e-com business in your US Marmaxx business comp, and your UK e-com business and the international comp, just wondering if it would move the dial?", "Ernie Herrman", "So Paul very good questions, I would say the first one is on the investments, we are very methodical about it. So we don\u2019t as others have we aren\u2019t going in investing at the high service peak. So we are -- I guess you would call leveling off on our investments there actually, because we are couple of years in on the tjmax.com business. So again very comfortable, we like the traffic we are getting. We like to sales the way it's doing and on the flip side as you know what be coming up, be careful on your cost structure. So, in terms of the domestic e-com businesses which are really tjmax.com and STP, we have taken a hard look at the cost structures and making sure that we will keep our investment at a very appropriate level and in fact a leveling off level, I guess would be the best way to describe it.", "Also in Europe, similar approach and we are actually running that very efficiently and same idea with the investments we are looking hard and fast and all of that links into your second quarter why do we do all that. While our e-com business in total is only little over 1% of our total business so when you ask that question first of all what the e-com increase has helped our comp ES but what it register I would say not mathematically not that strong because it\u2019s such a small percentage of the total today. Having said that, it's growing at a faster clip than the brick-and-mortar just a very small base of over 1%.", "Scott Goldenberg", "It's growing so fast that it would actually kick the comp up a bit not the region. If I, Paul, it's Scott, as Ernie said, it's 1% of our total sales growth by 1% by our total sales growth by definition the most you can round it would be to round it potentially a 1% in total, on TJX basis.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, ironically, Paul, in Europe it would actually move the comp there a little bit because we\u2019re little bigger in New York as a percent to our business. And I was just in Europe last week coincidently, and we spent quite a bit of time talking strategically about where we\u2019re going with e-commerce as well as looking at the metrics and what it's doing for the total in terms of traffic et cetera. And it would actually move the comp in Europe, but not a full point, but a little bit just under that actually.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick. Your line is now open.", "Brian Tunick", "Hi, wanted to stick with that Europe theme? Just curious, your margins there used to be 7%, 8%, I think you had somewhat more aspirational goals than that. So just curious what kind of comp do you need in Europe to get the margins close to that high single digits? When does Trade Secret become more neutral to the earnings? And then the second question, hypothetically at a 15% tax rate, you guys would be throwing off an additional $1 billion of free cash next year. So curious -- I know you have a mix of international as well as many domestic taxes, but is there really a thought internally that this is what could play out next year? And would you use that additional $1 billion for share repurchase versus dividends? Any thoughts along those lines would be helpful. Thanks very much.", "Scott Goldenberg", "I\u2019ll jump in before Ernie talks about Europe in more detail, Brian. But it's just too early to speculate on potential impact of new policies or legislation until it's passed and then we\u2019d only comment obviously if it's relevant to our business, so just too early at this point to speculate. And in terms of Europe, I\u2019ll just start off for a second, then Ernie. Some of the biggest impact has been FX over the -- certainly couple of. This year, it has been with Canada. We\u2019ve had opening up the new businesses, not new businesses, new countries in the last year or two. We\u2019ve also been ramping up the number of stores. So with the 50 plus stores we\u2019ve opened up both this year, I mean almost hit that level the last year, new stores since it takes several years to get majority to put a big of an impact on your earnings that in combination with the systems.", "And the infrastructure needed to support that score of store and certainly put it down. So, it\u2019s really less about the comp, the same level of comp when you hit that three plus rang at all divisions. All things being equal as usually the break point, but with wage systems and opening up the number of stores in the countries put a bit of pressure. The only thing before Ernie talks about Trade Secret and Europe in general as we move to the fourth quarter, we purchased Trade Secret at the end of October a year ago. So, in terms of the deleverage, we would expect that to moderate and that'd be a meaningful impact as we enter actually the quarter that we\u2019re currently in the fourth.", "Ernie Herrman", "That\u2019s what I was going on that. So, Brian, in terms of Europe, it\u2019s the good timing for your question. I was there all the last week coincidently and we went hit a lot of floor walks with the merchants as well as our field store personnel and we are well poised for the fourth quarter. I have to tell you that I am extremely bullish on what I saw over there last week for where we are heading into mid-November in terms of mix in the stores and how we\u2019re presenting and how we\u2019re staff for servicing the customers, so feeling very good about that. The other things keep in mind there and this I think starts to answer your question at least in terms of yes comp would help.", "Why do I think the comp will get better is they're positioned well, but the sales that we have the flat quarter, we were dealing with unseasonably warm, unseasonably warm weather there. And you look at the environment as it is and we are clearly gaining market share. If you look at some of those results that come out and we don\u2019t like to get specifics on that, but you can see that we are making very major in-roads, not to similar than we are see here. It\u2019s just all of the numbers are lower there. There are bigger decreases, some store closings we just announced from a couple of the retailers over there, which you can figure out who they were.", "And so we\u2019re very bullish on our market share gain there. The FX is really put a bit of damper on the margin rate starting now often and talking about how they have to come back to us at one point. And the medium-and short-term here that I am looking for us to continue to gain more customers and that team over there, I wish sometime you could see the team over there, they are extremely diligent and saying execution when times get tough. So one of the things I get them credit for, I think you notice the profit over there was slightly above our segment profit plan and that was due to how diligently, they control their liquidity and managed expenses on the quarter, when the sales are only flat. So I give that a lot of credit for same liquid watching expenses and get employees for availability of which you can imagine, they have enormous availability over there for the fourth quarter, so again feeling very good about that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Omar Saad. Your line is now open.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter, guys. I still wanted to ask about the comp guide for the fourth quarter? I know you initially gave that guidance last quarter, I think at the time you said you'd give more insight around it. You've been giving 2% to 3% comp guides I think for the last six or seven quarters until now, is there something different you're seeing in the fourth quarter this year? Is it just a more difficult compare? Are there other dynamic underlying that we should think about? Trying not to read too much into it. ", "Ernie Herrman", "So Omar, I would say that what you said right very end about, not reading too much into product with right attitude, we are -- this is a classic case of wanting to stay as we always have conservative in our planning and our intension here is to beat those numbers. It just we have a long way to go in the quarter and so we have planned to stock at the beginning of the year, up against one of our healthier quarters. When you look at couple of years' stock, we just thought it was on our end to be judicious and conservative. And it's really no dip in the math. So, again the last thing you said, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. We are feeling good about it, but that\u2019s the best way we thought to plan that quarter relative to the other quarters we plan to two to three.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger. Your line is now open.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Great. Thank you. Good morning. Scott, I just wanted to go through the 2017 growth investments? It seems like at least some of these will be rolling off in either the first or the second quarter of -- rather, let's go through the 2016 growth investments and I think some of them will roll off throughout calendar year 2017. You talked about the HomeGoods distribution center, the Canadian distribution center opened in the second quarter of this year, obviously once we get past Q1 you will basically have anniversaried those. But I'm wondering if you can just go through the list of 2016 investments and just talk about where you are in terms of the timing of how those investments are flowing into the expense structure? Including an update on your systems, upgrades that you're working on? And looking out to 2017, we understand you're not providing guidance today, obviously, but are there some expense pressures or investments that we should keep in mind looking out into calendar 2017? Thanks so much.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Hi, Kimberly. So just to cover, again as I said earlier really no new news here, so the biggest thing we call out we reiterated again on in this script today was that there is the 3% wage increase. So that we still have in the 3% impact next year in terms of EPS growth. In terms of other items, too early to make call on the FX rather than at this point it would be -- I mean it's clearly we sold out a 3% overall impact this year too early to make a call as in with the continued drop of the pound over the last two quarters. It would be some impact, but that\u2019s about all. We are going to say at this point in time, there is too much buying that hasn\u2019t taken place and all too really get specific in terms of what the impact on currency will be on our mark on.", "And as we all know there has been a lot of movement from the last two years at the end of currency, so too early to call on the mark-to-market, other than what we have in our guidance for the fourth quarter. In terms of the investment for both systems and supply chain, you are correct, we have the two DCs of Canada and HomeGoods that happen this year, but we really haven't been specific other than what we said in the last two quarters that we expected our supply -- overall supply chain in IT cost to be about the same impact next year. But again that\u2019s not our -- that\u2019s what we have been saying we will give further clarification on that on our year end call. So unfortunately no new news in terms of the specific timing of how it's going to impact the quarters in the next year.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Understood. Thank you for that Scott. I am wondering if you can just remind us what were the supply chain and IT headwinds that you articulated for a calendar year 2016 and your fiscal 2017?", "Scott Goldenberg", "We never actually broke out the specific other than in terms of an EPS growth we were really just calling out the FX and the wage increases. So other than and that\u2019s really it.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Understood. Okay, thanks so much.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And the only other thing I would add is the thing that\u2019s been bit of as Ernie talked about earlier and I think Ernie would say out, is the average ticket impact to next year, so too early.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, really forecast exactly where that\u2019s going to be.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Bob Drbul. Your line is now open.", "Bob Drbul", "Hi. Good morning. Just a couple questions. Can you talk a little about the month to month progression throughout the quarter? And the second question that I have is, can you talk about the performance of the home business, really both within HomeGoods and also within the home business at Marmaxx and how that's been trending? ", "Ernie Herrman", "Sure, Bob. We\u2019ll talk a little bit about the progressions and Scott will get that a little bit together. On the home business I think we talked about it and one thing by the way I would like everyone to know is, our apparel business has been strong throughout the year and the last quarter. So, it has been healthy all the way across board, but our home business in particular as you guys can see from HomeGoods results has continued to take major market share and accelerate. That would apply to Marmaxx's home business is healthy. We don\u2019t give the numbers obviously and I would just say domestically home continues to present an opportunity for us, and we will continue to expand their and execute. And again we like our model there, it's quite the treasure hunt and quite the impulsive model that has resonated extremely well with consumers, all year long and we don\u2019t see that changing, so a great question.", "Scott Goldenberg", "And Bob in terms of the cadence and unfortunately to disappoint you, that\u2019s been several years and that we don\u2019t comment on the enter quarter sales trends.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Baker. Your line is now open.", "Q \u2013 Michael Baker", "Thanks. So you're very liquid in terms of your open to buy? How quickly can you react to that and get product into the stores? What kind of lead time do you need to get things into the stores before Christmas?", "Ernie Herrman", "Great question, Mike. This is we\u2019ve talked about in some of the supply chain advantages that we\u2019ve created over the last few years while we have enabled the merchants to do is by a little closer and we\u2019ve probably saved and we can\u2019t really give you an exact amount of time but it's really down to how about this, it's down there more like a few weeks.", "And it used to be double that not so long ago. So what that has allowed our merchants to do is continue to buy later into the season with more knowledge and take advantage of more inventory close out lists that sometime show up at a time when before, it would have become a pack away. And now we can become in season sales driver that is going for the vendor because they don\u2019t have to deal with us on a pack away.", "And at the same time straight for our customers more importantly because they get to see this fresh goods hitting just before Christmas or just before Thanksgiving that are very fresh and just recently in other stores. So, great question, again it\u2019s been one of the big needle movers I think in our buying approach over the last five or seven years.", "Mike Baker", "Okay, great, thanks for the color. I don't know if other people stuck to the one question, I can't remember. So I'll try one more. SG&A, the expected deleverage is a lot less in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, which by the way is opposite what you're saying about the gross margins? I'm wondering why that might be in the fourth quarter?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, Mike. So we have the same amount of wage and I\u2019ll call supply, the investments that we have and except last year, we\u2019re in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re against the contribution we made to our foundation and some incentive accruals that due to the great fourth quarter we had last year that were more booked, we\u2019re a higher percentage we booked in the fourth quarter. So recycling that, so we have a benefit and that\u2019s why we have the significantly lower SG&A rate in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Roxanne Meyer. Your line is now open.", "Roxanne Meyer", "Great. Thanks and good afternoon. My question is on the increase globalization of your product. I\u2019m just wondering, if you can update us on your buying strategy, particularly from Marmaxx. As you take a more global approach to your product and merchandise? Thank you.", "Ernie Herrman", "Okay. Roxanne, when you say global I just want to make sure answering the question correctly. When you say a global approach in terms of Marmaxx, are you referring to goods you see in the stores or?", "Roxanne Meyer", "Yes, and even in your prepared remarks, you talked about getting more eclectic goods from around the world in your stores. And I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re buying your merchandise?", "Ernie Herrman", "Well, so we have few different ways. One is our divisions or more links up. So we have a division in Europe, which as many buyers in Europe division in Canada that travels to Europe and internationally, as well as satellite buying offices, we have buyers in Europe and satellite office to represents HomeGoods and Marmaxx. We have California buying office, they travel to other countries. Our buying offices do a lot more exploratory trips. All the different buying offices will try going in the new places where we think that our new categories of goods that will be exciting. Examples are like leather goods out of Italy.", "So or something that is out of Africa that would be great in the home deck area. Those are type of things you\u2019re talking that we hit Marmaxx that a more global type buys. There\u2019s clearly if you look, we even had like outdoor type items that are bought HomeGoods and is going to brought certainly obviously internationally purchase buy or so. We\u2019ve added to like, I think I talked about the buying staff has doubled over the last 10 years and part of that buying structure is buying global merchandise, buying from other areas. So that has been a huge, huge advantage. That\u2019s why we have the 1,000 buyers now.", "And when you see that, I think I mentioned that we have 18,000 vendors and that has growing up a significant amount really just the five years. A lot of those vendors are international vendors and are giving us that different flavor. So, it's a great question because what we get out of it we think is a differentiating piece in our mix that other retailers really can't show. And it's because as I said in my script that\u2019s where I think where our sourcing machine and really we just have a very talented buying team that gets a lot of ground cover in a lot of parts of world. Hopefully that answers your question.", "Operator", "Thank you, speakers. So our final question for today comes from Richard Jaffe. Your line is now open.", "Richard Jaffe", "Thanks very much, guys. And just a digression to Sierra Trading? It was an interesting acquisition several years ago, wondering how that's playing out, how accretive it's become and perhaps more importantly, could you talk about some of your learnings from that business? Thank you.", "Ernie Herrman", "Sure Richard, so Sierra Trading Post when we acquired it we have -- and I think we have talked about this before, we have been going through some learnings in terms of remodeling the business, because the business, the website was much more promotional than as you can imagine we would wanted to be being an aggregate value our price retailer. So interesting timing I you would ask this question because we have recently taken a good chunk of that and gone to everyday value that when I say recently that was about a month ago. And we were not happy with our results prior to that as we were kind of wining ourselves off that situation, but since that we are feeling a much better about the day and day out traffic and purchases.", "We still are not all in all happy with the website business. It's a little early to tell. So we have really done after the store initiative, which I think we have talked about. We want -- we have got plenty of room now to find out a bulk of way of business because of this value pricing. We have done some reorg with merchants that are in place, and we are feeling really good about going forward there. And we will actually -- we have somewhat to can't talk about some interesting marketing plans for the website going forward that I think are going to pay this dividend along with the value pricing that we have started there.", "We're putting some new merchants there to help with the website business. And the store end of the STP business, we have actually been very with that one been a longer term success rate for us. It's just early and it's really early in the whole curve of building that business. So, we are going to have some sites that at yearend call will talk in more that depth. We won't go into that today. We will talk about at yearend call, some of the stores that we are going to open there and we will give more color I think on the total business at that point in time.", "Ernie Herrman", "So, I believe that is the end of our call. Thank you all for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you at our yearend earnings call in February. Thank you everybody.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Franco. Before we begin, I'd like to congratulate Deb McConnell on the recent birth of her son. As Deb is on maternity leave, Jeff Botte will start us off with some opening comments.", "Jeff Botte - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you, Ernie, and good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially.

Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release in the Investor section of our website, TJX.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are posted on our website, TJX.com, in the Investor section.", "Thank you and now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Good morning. Joining me and Jeff on the call is Scott Goldenberg. I'd like to begin by saying that 2016 was another terrific year for TJX. Net sales increased 7% over last year's 6% increase. Consolidated comp store sales were up a strong 5%, above our plan and over a 5% increase last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.53, also above our expectations. We are convinced that we are gaining market share around the globe, as customer traffic was the primary driver of comp sales at every major division for the year.", "Clearly, our differentiated mix of great fashions and brands at amazing values continues to resonate with consumers. We were also very pleased with the excellent performance across our apparel, accessories and home businesses in 2016.", "We celebrated 40 years as a company in 2016. We are proud of our long, consistent history of sales and profit growth and successful expansion of our off-price concept across the U.S. and around the world. Over four decades, we have had an annual comparable store sales decline in only one year. Further, 2016 marked our 21st consecutive year of comp sales increases.", "We believe our long track record of consistency and growth is a testament to the people in our organization and our ability to leverage the power of our flexible business model through many types of economic and retail environments, and in many different geographies.", "We are pleased to finish 2016 with above-plan results in the fourth quarter. Net sales increased 6% and comp sales grew 3%, over a very strong 6% increase last year. Once again, customer traffic drove the comp increase and our merchandise margin was up. Earnings per share were $1.03, significantly above our expectations. We believe our continued sales, traffic and merchandise margin growth speaks to the fundamental strength of our business.", "Looking ahead, we feel great about our prospects for growth in the near and long-term in building on our market share. We have many initiatives underway to drive sales and customer traffic. We are confident we will achieve our goals, and as always, we will strive to exceed them. In 2016, we surpassed $33 billion in sales, which gives us great confidence as we continue to grow TJX as the only major international off-price retailer in the world.", "Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our fourth quarter and our full-year numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to share on this call and want to leave enough time for your questions, so in the interest of time, I am not going to repeat many of the numbers in the press release and will instead focus on the financial highlights.", "We are very pleased that our sales and traffic momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Again, our 3% comp was over a 6% last year and above our plan. Further, our comp was driven by traffic again this quarter. As a reminder, this comp excludes our e-commerce businesses.", "Diluted earnings per share were $1.03 versus last year's $0.99, well above our expectations. It was great to see strong EPS flow through on the above-plan sales. EPS growth was negatively impacted by 3% due to wage increases and 5% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange.", "Merchandise margin was up significantly again in the fourth quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were down 4% on a constant-currency basis. We begin a new year with excellent liquidity and are well-positioned to flow fresh spring fashions and selections to our stores.", "Now to recap our fourth quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comp increased a strong 3% over a 6% increase last year. Once again, customer traffic was the primary driver of the comp increase. We saw significant growth in units sold and a decrease in average ticket as we planned. Apparel, accessories and home all performed well, which is great to see in today's retail environment.", "Segment profit margin decreased 30 basis points. Merchandise margin was up significantly, but was more than offset due to the negative impact from wage increases as expected and additional supply-chain costs. Marmaxx is now a $20 billion plus business and we still see plenty of room to grow our largest division.", "HomeGoods delivered another great quarter with comps increasing a very strong 5% over last year's 7% increase. Segment profit margin was down 50 basis points. As we anticipated, wage increases and supply chain costs associated with the opening of our new distribution center had a significant negative impact on HomeGoods' margin. HomeGoods had another outstanding year as it surpassed the $4 billion sales milestone.", "TJX Canada's fourth quarter comps grew a strong 4% over a 14% increase last year. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was up 40 basis points and merchandise margin was up significantly. TJX Canada had an excellent year, opening up its 400th store, achieving US$3 billion sales and delivering strong performance across all three chains.", "TJX International comps were up 2% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 50 basis points, due to integrating Trade Secret, wage increases and some expense deleverage. We were pleased with our performance and believe we held up better than most European retailers despite the challenging retail environment. We are convinced that we are gaining market share in Europe and feel great about this division's long-term growth plans.", "Now to our full year consolidated fiscal 2017 results. Again, we are thrilled that our 5% comp increase over last year's 5% increase was above our plan and driven by customer traffic. Further, the traffic was the primary driver of the comp increase at each of our four major divisions.", "Diluted earnings per share were $3.46 versus last year's $3.33. Excluding a third quarter debt extinguishment charge and pension settlement charge totaling $0.07, adjusted earnings per share were $3.53, a 6% increase over last year and above our most recent plan. Full-year EPS growth was negatively impacted by 3% due to wage increases and 2% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. Merchandise margin was up significantly for the year on top of a solid increase last year.", "I'll finish with our financial strength and shareholder distributions. Our business continues to generate excellent cash flows and strong financial returns. In fiscal 2017, free cash flow was $2.6 billion and our ROIC remains one of the highest we have seen in retail as we maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation.", "As we said before, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs, while simultaneously reinvesting in the business for the near and long-term. In fiscal 2017, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through these programs.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Ernie and I'll recap our first quarter and full year fiscal 2018 guidance at the end of the call.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you, Scott. First, I'll cover some fourth quarter highlights. Again, we were pleased to end the year with another quarter of strong sales and customer traffic on top of an excellent fourth quarter last year. I believe our exciting gift-giving assortments and in-store initiatives during the holiday selling season were the best we have had yet. We are confident that our marketing helped attract new and existing customers and our constantly-changing selections and freshness encouraged more frequent shopping visits.", "Now, I'd like to briefly highlight our key strengths that we believe will continue to differentiate TJX and make our business so difficult to replicate. First, we have a world-class buying organization, which includes over 1,000 associates around the world. I truly believe they are the best in retail.", "Secondly, we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine, buying from a universe of over 18,000 vendors in more than 100 countries. Third, off-price is all that we do. Over four decades, we have built and continued to refine a global supply chain, distribution network and IT systems that support our highly-integrated international off-price business model.", "Fourth, we have decades of off-price operating experience in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and are capitalizing on our global presence. Next, our flexibility allows us to react to changing market trends and consumer tastes to give shoppers what they want and when they want it. These core strengths have allowed us to successfully grow our business across all of our geographies, while delivering consumers a rapidly-changing mix of merchandise at amazing values.", "Now, to our growth initiatives, which give us confidence in our ability to gain market share for many years to come. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We were very pleased with our traffic gains in 2016 and the growth in new customers that we saw across all our divisions, particularly with Millennial shoppers. At the same time, we believe there was enormous opportunity to keep growing our U.S. and international market share, and we will continue to target a very wide range of shoppers.", "To attract more shoppers, we take an integrated marketing approach, engaging with consumers through television, digital, mobile and social media campaigns to ensure our retail brands are visible wherever they are looking. We incorporate learnings to further leverage our marketing dollars and to increase awareness of our brands in an ever-changing media world. We also continue to grow our loyalty programs to drive more frequent visits and cross shopping of our brands.", "We continue to upgrade the shopping experience. In 2017, we expect to remodel approximately 260 stores across the company. Our customer satisfaction scores increased at every division in 2016, which is great, but meanwhile, we see room to do even better. Most importantly, we continue to add new brands and offer consumers tremendous values.", "With e-commerce, we continue to differentiate our mix to encourage consumers to shop both online and in our stores. While still a small piece of our overall business, we view e-commerce as complementary to our stores and as another way to drive incremental sales and traffic.", "Next, innovation has been core to our DNA at TJX since the start. We are always testing new ideas and initiatives across the company that could drive future growth. For us, innovation could take on a number of different forms. Today, I am very pleased to share several developments with you, beginning with some exciting news about our U.S. home business.", "With many years of successful growth both at HomeGoods and our home businesses across the company, we are thrilled to announce that we are launching a second home concept. The first few stores are expected to open later this year. Our approach will be to differentiate these two U.S. home concepts to encourage customers to shop both stores, which has been key to our successful growth at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls in the U.S. and Winners and Marshalls in Canada.", "We plan to leverage our existing distribution centers, supply chain and buying organization, which is similar to what we did when we launched Marshalls in Canada. While we are proud to have grown HomeGoods' customer base for many years, we believe we remain significantly underpenetrated in the total U.S. home market and enormous opportunity remains for us to gain share in this space. Our customers are passionate about HomeGoods, and we are confident they will love our new home concept too.", "As to our HomeGoods chain, we plan to increase our openings this year. In another example of innovation and our flexibility, about 20 of these openings are planned within some of our larger existing Marmaxx stores. By flexing our existing locations, we believe we can drive additional productivity and increase the overall efficiency of the store. Further, it allows us to introduce HomeGoods to additional U.S. markets more quickly and efficiently.", "In Australia, we have made excellent progress integrating Trade Secret into our TJX model since our acquisition over a year ago. We are excited to announce that we will be converting our stores in Australia to T.K. Maxx this spring, which we believe will further benefit this business by leveraging one of our powerful global brands. We also have a handful of store openings planned for 2017 and plan to market the business in Australia for the first time. Our research shows that Australian consumers already know and love the T.K. Maxx brand.", "We are confident that this conversion, combined with the improvements we have already made in the business and our new marketing campaign, will help us attract a broader set of value-oriented customers. T.K. Maxx is known and loved across Europe, and we are confident that it will succeed in Australia as well.", "At Sierra Trading Post, we are testing our brick-and-mortar format and transitioning the online business to offering great off-price values every day. We have strengthened the buying organization and have additional store openings planned across the U.S. this year. Wrapping up on these initiatives, we see ourselves as leaders in innovation, and will never be complacent.", "Our next major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. In fiscal 2017, we grew our store base by 198 stores or almost 6%. I also want to point out that we did not close a single store last year, despite the volatile retail environment. We continue to see a favorable real estate environment and are taking advantage of many opportunities around the world. This year, we are planning to accelerate our pace of store growth and surpass the 4,000 store milestone.", "Underscoring our confidence is our disciplined approach to real estate, decades of operational experience, our eclectic mix of merchandise, and differentiated in-store shopping experiences. With just over 3,800 stores today, we see the potential to grow by almost 50% to 5,600 stores long term. This would be about 1,800 more stores over our current base with just our existing chains and just our existing countries alone. To reiterate, this does not contemplate the opportunities we see with additional countries or with new chains.", "In North America alone, we see the potential to open about 1,300 more stores. At Marmaxx, we see the long-term potential to grow to 3,000 stores, about 800 more than today. Again, we see enormous white space for our U.S. home business. Our 1,000 long-term store potential estimate for HomeGoods only and does include our new U.S. home concept. In Canada, our long-term store growth target of 500 stores includes growing Marshalls to at least a 100-store chain.", "Beyond North America, our long-term potential for TJX International of 1,100 stores reflects the opportunity we see in just our current European countries and Australia. In Europe, we remain the only brick-and-mortar off-price retailer of significant size. In Australia, we are very confident that we can grow T.K. Maxx to 125 stores long term.", "To support our growth, we are making important investments in new stores, store remodels, distribution centers, systems and our new seeds as well as talent. I am convinced that we are making the right investments today to strengthen our leadership positions around the world and support the near and long-term growth of our company.", "In closing, we are proud of our excellent performance in 2016. Looking ahead, we feel very good about our business model and see tremendous growth potential. We operate a highly flexible retail business with four decades of expertise and experience in building and refining our highly-integrated international teams and infrastructures. We are also very pleased that we have the financial flexibility to simultaneously reinvest in the growth of our business and return significant value to shareholders. We have a clear, long-term vision for growth and see an exciting future ahead for TJX, both in the U.S. and internationally.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions. Scott?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Ernie. Now for fiscal 2018 guidance beginning with the full year. This guidance includes a 53rd week in the fiscal 2018 calendar, which we expect will benefit full-year EPS growth by approximately 3% or $0.11 per share. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal 2018 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.80 to $3.89. Excluding the benefit from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.69 to $3.78. This would be up 5% to 7% versus the adjusted $3.53 in fiscal 2017.", "I want to take a moment to recap a few factors impacting our expected earnings per share growth in fiscal 2018. First, we are assuming that wage increases will have a negative impact to fiscal 2018 EPS growth of about 2%, which is less than last year. We continue to anticipate that wage increases will have an incremental negative impact beyond fiscal 2018. Based on current approved legislation, we expect the pressure to further moderate next year.", "Second, we anticipate that the recent change in accounting rules for share-based compensation will benefit fiscal 2018 EPS growth by approximately 2% or about $0.08. As always, we plan to continue to invest strategically to support our U.S. and international growth. As we've discussed on prior conference calls, the incremental investments we have planned for fiscal 2018 include costs associated with our distribution network to support our global store growth plans.", "As to FX, at current rates, we expect the net impact of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange to have a slightly negative impact on fiscal 2018 EPS growth. This year, the expected impact is primarily the result of the decline in the British pound versus the prior year. While it's too early to call \u2013 too early for us to make assumptions about the impact of foreign exchange beyond fiscal 2818, FX could have a neutral or positive effect in the out years. This EPS guidance assumes consolidated sales in the $35.2 billion to $35.6 billion range, a 6% to 7% increase over the prior year. This guidance assumes a positive impact to reported revenue of approximately 1.5% due to the 53rd week and a negative impact to reported revenue of about 1% due to translational FX.", "We're assuming a 1% to 2% comp increase on a consolidated basis, similar to our plans for prior years. The comps by definition exclude the 53rd week. Our assumptions for total sales and comp growth remain in line with how we have planned for prior years. We see many ways to drive continued sales traffic and market share as we are pursuing them aggressively. We expect pre-tax profit margin to be in the range of 11.1% to 11.3%. Excluding the benefit from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted pre-tax profit margin to be in the range of 10.9% to 11.1%. This would be down 40 basis points to 60 basis points versus the adjusted 11.5% in fiscal 2017. We're planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.9% to 29.0% compared with 29.0% last year. The 53rd week is expected to have a 20 basis point benefit to gross profit margin. Our plans assume we will maintain our strong merchandise margin.", "We're expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 17.6% to 17.7% versus 17.4% last year. We do not expect the 53rd week to have a significant impact on full-year SG&A expense. For modeling purposes, we're currently anticipating a tax rate of 36.9%, net interest expense of $37 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 649 million.", "Now to our full-year guidance by division. Sales and pre-tax margin guidance are on a 53-week basis. At Marmaxx, we are planning comp growth of 1% to 2% on sales of $22.2 billion to $22.4 billion and segment profit margin in the range of 13.7% to 13.9%. At HomeGoods, we expect comps to increase 2% to 3% on sales of $5.0 billion to $5.1 billion and segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.1% to 13.3%.", "For TJX Canada, we are planning a comp increase of 2% to 3% on sales of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.0%. At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of 1% to 2% on sales of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 4.3% to 4.5%.", "`", "Moving on to Q1 guidance; we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.78 versus last year's $0.76. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of approximately 3% due to wage increases. It also includes a 6% benefit to EPS growth due to the combination of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange, and an additional 1% benefit to EPS growth due to a change in accounting rules for share based compensation.", "We're modeling first quarter consolidated sales of approximately $7.8 billion. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. For comp sales, we are planning the first quarter more conservatively. We're assuming comp growth in the 0% to 1% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. This compares to a very strong 7% increase at TJX and a 6% increase at Marmaxx in the first quarter last year.", "As a reminder, these strong comp increases benefited from favorable weather as we discussed in last year's call. This year, we have experienced some unfavorable weather early on. Beyond that, it's far too early to draw any conclusions.", "First quarter pre-tax profit margin is planned in the 10.3% to 10.5% range versus 10.9% the prior year. We're anticipating first quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.7% to 28.8% versus 28.8% last year. We're expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the 18.2% to 18.3% range versus 17.7% last year.", "For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 37.7%, net interest expense of about $10 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 654 million. It's important to remember that our guidance for the first quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the first quarter.", "Moving to our store growth plans for fiscal 2018, we plan to add about 250 net new stores, which would bring our year-end total to approximately 4,062 stores. This represents a store growth of approximately 7%, above our store growth for the last several years.", "Beginning in the U.S., our plans call to open about 65 stores at Marmaxx. For HomeGoods, we expect to open approximately 85 stores, including four for our new U.S. home concept. Also, we plan to open 15 additional Sierra Trading Post stores.", "In Canada, we plan to add about 35 new stores. At TJX International, we plan to open approximately 45 stores in Europe and four stores in Australia.", "I'll wrap up with our cash distribution to our shareholders. As we outlined in this morning's press release, we expect that our board of directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 20% on top of the 24% increase last year. This would mark our 21st straight year of dividend increases.", "In fiscal 2018, we plan to buy back $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion of TJX stock. Even with our significant shareholder distributions, we still plan to end fiscal 2018 with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and short term investments, which underscores our financial flexibility.", "Now, we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we're going to ask that you please limit your questions to one per person.", "Thanks, and now we will open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from the line of Mr. Matthew Boss. Sir, your line is open. Go ahead.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So as we think about your underlying margin profile, from 11% to 12% operating margins today and putting the impact of the wages aside, are you still comfortable \u2013 I guess my question is, are you still comfortable with the 1% to 2% annual segment margin expansion or are there any offsets to consider as we think about that multiyear?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Matt, Scott Goldenberg. I'm not sure what you mean by the 1% to 2% margin expansion, or...", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So in the 10% to 13% annual earnings growth that you laid out in 2015, 6% to 7% top line, 1% to 2% segment profit margin expansion. I'm just trying to back into the bottom line earnings growth algorithm as it was last laid out, assuming the sales are the same, is there any difference in that profit margin expansion on an annual basis, if we were to back out wages, more trying to think beyond this year?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, it's been almost two full years now since we've given out the long-term model, and as we talked about I think almost every quarter for the last two years, we haven't been giving detail on our long-term model at this point.", "So the better way maybe to look at it this year is on the 1% to 2% comp that we are guiding to, we have the 53-week benefit, so we're going out with 12% at the high to $3.89. The 53rd week's worth 3%. We had the one time \u2013 last year, we had the debt extinguishment and settlement, which is worth 2%, getting to the 5% to 7%, which includes some of the share-based compensation that we called out (34:13). So a 5% on a 2% comp would be the best way to rec, if you were going to rec to what we've done the last year or two. Again, only on a 2% comp, this year 6% was on a higher comp.", "Compared to the plan that we went out last year where we went out at the high end of the range with a 2% EPS growth rate on the 1% to 2% comp, there's been some moderation in the FX and in the wage. All things, the model is relatively similar to it has been in the past. And at this point, we still have, as I called out earlier, some wage pressure that we think is going forward, some investments to support our growth. So we're not really commenting on it much than that, but Ernie is going to weigh in also on that.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, I think all I would say, Matt, is that for all of the things we talked about in the script, in terms of the fundamental strength, we have a high degree of confidence in all of the differentiators and the way we can take advantage of the environment we're in. And as much as we're not giving specifics on the long-term growth, we're really feeling that we would expect our earnings per share growth to slightly improve each year over the next couple of years. So we're seeing that like \u2013 we're feeling pretty comfortable, we'll see that ticking up. Barring everything stays apples-to-apples in terms of wage, state-by-state, all around us. So, hopefully, that adds some more color to you.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "No, it does. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Lindsay Drucker Mann. Ma'am your line is open. Go ahead, please.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. I was hoping you could give some color on in the markets where you're nearby to a closed Macy's, if you're seeing any impact on the performance in your stores from those liquidations or how you're sort of thinking about momentum in those stores in those shared markets?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So we really haven't seen anything dramatic there. What's happening is there's a lot of noise around, Lindsay, in terms of the market share gain because what's happening clearly is there's just a couple of sectors in the businesses, obviously, online is one of them and in off-price, ourselves and others is the other and clearly gaining market share. Some of that could be because of stores closing but some of the noise gets \u2013 it gets kind of tough to do all of these analyses because you also have some businesses, even if they're not closing they're down trending. So, obviously, there's market share that's being capitalized on from a few different ways. So we don't see really a specific pattern in that. Not to say that it wouldn't happen over time. Some of those closings are more recent, but over time it's possible. Hopefully that helps answer your question though.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And if I could just maybe sneak one more in. Ernie, maybe you could clarify or Scott on the comment about unfavorable weather early on and I think it was favorable weather in the prior year. Just a little more detail on what you're thinking about weather.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, we actually \u2013 we were quite specific last year at the end of \u2013 when we did the first quarter call, Scott and I were quite transparent about how favorable the weather was. We also didn't want people getting too used to the comps that we delivered in the first quarter last year because it was so strong given one of the most favorable weather patterns we had ever seen in our first quarter. So I would say that our weather pattern this year is a little bit more like a traditional first-quarter weather pattern which, as you know, unfortunately, isn't as favorable as last year's. So that's what really we're talking about. So that gives you a little bit of a fall-off, which is a little piece of our first quarter guidance there.", "Having said that, it's still early for us to be talking about the first quarter because we have a lot of the quarter to go and the important thing I think everyone needs to remember and I like to reiterate is that our business model really differentiates us by the flexibility that we have. So we are able to capitalize and react and read to the marketplace and move much quicker than most of the other major retailers. So getting away from the weather situation, which other retailers could feel as well, if you say, well that could happen to everyone, you would think that could create opportunities and that's where our business model really plays out. We're able to take advantage of those. So we're in a strong liquidity position and I would tell you we're in a wait-and-see mode.", "So we want to really, right now, not based on what's going on around us, we would just want to take that conservative approach for first quarter, and believe me, our teams are all driven to exceed the plans. As Scott has said many times, we want to have conservative plans though. Based a little bit on the weather thing you asked about, based a little bit on the environment, we just said let's be conservative. We have liquidity, we can flex, and again, our intention is to always exceed our plans.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Omar Saad. Sir, your line is open. Go ahead, please.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Good morning. Ernie, I actually really enjoyed some of your prepared remarks. I'd love to ask about the new home concept, but I think I'd rather use my one question to talk about the...", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "You know you're limited, Omar?", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "The news on the Trade Secret and kind of converting it to more of a T.K. Maxx. It's interesting because \u2013 I'd love to kind of have maybe a clear picture of how you got comfortable with the visibility of that nameplate and the recognition in the local marketplace in Australia because it may have implications for other new markets as you enter them. I don't know if tourists in the U.S. or Europe are really learning about the T.K. Maxx concept, and that's what drove that decision? Anything would be helpful there. Thanks.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, sure. Great question, Omar. A couple things we're playing into it. The first of all, ironically \u2013 this is anecdotal \u2013 on my first trip over there, I was with Michael MacMillan who obviously the business reports to, and we had a couple of customers while we were walking through the store, they must have known we were management, and said they were traveling from other places, and they asked us, is this a T.K. Maxx because they were confused. And clearly it wasn't. It was a Trade Secret.", "So right away \u2013 and then of course we did more studies. We knew that the brand was important. I would tell you we have been thinking on and off about doing this a lot earlier, but we did not want to do it till we had made the progress on the merchandising and distribution and supply chain lines to get the stores in the place where we felt it was okay to put the T.K. Maxx brand on it.", "So it's a great question, Omar, because we weren't ready. One reason, it's like now is we weren't confident enough, quite honestly, a few months ago, say, put the name on it. Now we have made tremendous progress. I could not be more excited about the business that we've been seeing of recent the last couple of months, and we have been doing these remodels. Some of our associates here that have recently been over there have talked about how great the remodels is. Look, it's just T.J. \u2013 you would feel like you're in a T.J. Maxx or a T.K. Maxx.", "And now the most important thing is the merchandise is reflecting the content that we are proud of where we say now we're comfortable rebranding it to T.K. Maxx, because you can imagine we did not want to do that if we didn't think the mix was up to what that brand is.", "So I hope that answers your question and all I can tell you is if you ever have a chance to be there you would find it to be a very exciting format. And the customer base there is \u2013 Scott has been there fairly recently, would tell you, the customer base is really in our sweet spot and they're very value driven. They just haven't had options much in the past.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, and as Ernie said, between the remodels we've been doing at the back half of this past year and the remodels we're doing this spring, we'll have most of the stores that we want remodeled by the time we launch the conversions and the marketing campaign in the spring this year.", "And it also helped that last year, we opened up a distribution center, so now we're able to ship the way we ship in our off-price model and the rest of our divisions and give those stores the multiple deliveries they get a week that keep the freshness. So we're excited.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "And you had mentioned 120-store potential opportunity there. Could you just remind us how many there are now and how many have been converted and then remodeled?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "We haven't given \u2013 there's 35 stores now and let's just say the majority will be converted \u2013 well, they will all be converted, but the remodels will be remodeled and there will be four openings this year.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Four new stores on top of that.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "But it's really the first-time marketing the business coming up here in the near future.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thank you, guys. Appreciate the color.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Michael Binetti. Sir, your line is open. Go ahead, please.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the detail on the call today. Very helpful. Just a quick one for the model, I think you said that the expectation for the next year is for the merch margins to be, I think, you said stable to last year's. Is there any reason why the merchandise margin improvement that you guys saw recently slows over the next year and then I had a quick follow up?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Well, we plan the model pretty similarly every year. We're planning the merchandise margin up on top of a fairly significant \u2013 almost \u2013 approximately 20 basis point increase this year, so we do still have some margin pressure, approximately 10 basis points relative to the drop in the British pound, as the drop in the spring after the Brexit announcement. So we have the pressures well, but we know it's \u2013 we've had \u2013 we feel pretty good. We continue to work on our planning and allocation and our inventory management and we've certainly had increases for each of the last five years, but it's, again, we still think there's room for improvement, but we're just planning it slightly up.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then if I just could quickly follow up, if we could just zero in, with so much of the calls taken up with your global business these days, on the supply chain spending in the long-term pretty consistent reinvestment you guys have talked about, but that's been a source of deleverage for a lot of quarters in a row. You guys keep investing ahead of the opportunity. Can we think about a global supply chain investment bucket and just think about whether there's a point somewhere on the horizon where that could flip over and be a source of leverage or you'd say, we've got sufficient supply chain in all the markets we're in at this point where we enter maybe the next couple of years where that's not a deleverage point.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yes. It's a great question. I think some of it has to do \u2013 some of this is short and medium term and then there's long term. I think HomeGoods is a great example of something that's the longer term where clearly we couldn't call it all out, but I think our investment there was highly correlated to what we saw as the opportunities to grow market share and our store. So we had to invest in DCs ahead of our increased growth in our both new stores and HomeGoods, the store conversions Ernie talked about in the new store concept, so there's a case where you need to build out ahead of the growth.", "In terms of talking \u2013 we've talked about this before, Marmaxx, some of this was unforeseen as the average retailer decreased a bit more but we, again, think that has been extremely positive both \u2013 obviously it's a combination of both mix and price, but to our overall growth, it could go other way if retails stabilize and go the other way where you could end up \u2013 some of the growth we have in DCs, the out years could be delayed and we would get some synergies and you're talking about a reverse average ticket.", "Other than that, just some of it's been a timing of replacing DCs that were older as we've had in both \u2013 what we're going to be doing in Europe this year and we may have in Marmaxx in a couple years. So I think it's going to be more lumpy, but we still see, given the growth trajectory that we called out in the new store growth, it's still going to be an impact at least for the next year or two. And then we would hope it moderate, but there are too many factors to be crystal clear at this point on what that deleverage or flattening will be or when it will be.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Lorraine Hutchinson. Ma'am, your line is open. Go ahead, please.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the comments you actually just made on average ticket. Been a couple of years, I know part of that is purposeful as you move into new categories, but where do you think we are in that move? And then also, what do you see in terms of pressure from the full price channel impacting the rest of your ability to increase that average ticket over the next couple of years?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yes, so let me get to the short-term piece of that before Ernie goes on, on the broader piece. Speaking at Marmaxx, both the fourth quarter of this past year and the first quarter of what we see this year was primarily almost entirely due to mix. So that really has little to do with the pricing dynamic or what the other \u2013 because we're maintaining our value equation with the other retailers. It's just that we \u2013 as we've always done, have tried to adjust the mix to we see what the customer preferences are. And that has just spurred to a slightly lower average retail.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, some of the \u2013 let me piggyback on that, some of the \u2013 Lorraine, some of the hot categories just by nature and it's just the nature of the beast we run into have been lower ticket categories. If you even think about the home business and some of the categories we've gone after there, you can see them in our store. They have been some lower ticket categories as has been some of our other businesses. And that's making, to Scott's point, the average ticket still to continue to come down.", "We have said numerous, numerous times our number one objective is to continue gaining market share. So, we don't feel comfortable managing that from the top and taking us off the mission to continue to drive top line sales. Although I heard your right \u2013 I think you had like a second part of your question about the regular price, do I have this right, about the pressure from regular price retailers?", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, so we've seen \u2013 it feels like out there that things are a little bit more promotional currently, but we don't know that for a fact, nor do we know how long that goes on. The good news is we operate very bottom-up from the buyer level up where we constantly shop all retails and ensure that our GAAP is below them. So I think what you're getting at is if they continue to get promotional, could that hold our ticket down. That's another factor that, yes, part of our model was to always never be undersold. So that could. That has not really been a driver of it because we've \u2013 as witnessed by our market share gains, we've been keeping quite the appropriate gap in retail between us and the other retailers. So I don't see that as being a big switch going forward, but in this environment, it's hard to look too far out because there's so much unknown still.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "And at the same time, for the last couple of quarters, at least, and we still think for the first quarter, we've been able to give the customer that value...", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Absolutely.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "...and have our merchandise margin go up...", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "And the margin hang in there, right.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "...over the last at least the recent times.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Oliver Chen. Sir, your line is open. Go ahead.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Congrats on really outstanding results. We had a question \u2013 in relation to the overall retail industry, there's been this trend of store closures, but you've had a real steadfast and demonstrate-able progress in opening stores. So as you think about North America, are you looking at expanding into new markets or is that adding depth into your existing markets? And have there been thoughts or tweaks or a framework, which has been altered? Or how do you think about that as we think about really justifying the long-term growth algorithm in the face of what we're seeing at malls and Amazon and others? Thank you.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Sure. So, Oliver, I think it's kind of a multi-pronged question because it's kind of a mix. We have so many brands now. So if you look the one thing we talked about is HomeGoods, for example, right, this year is going to open \u2013 we're going to open in our HomeGoods division like 85 stores, of which four are the new concept. But that still leaves a chunk of stores and many of those are hitting new markets. In fact, those conversion stores we talked about that are in some of the Marmaxx stores are actually hitting markets that HomeGoods would not have been in. So we are specifically, in that case quite specifically, hitting new markets with that brand.", "If you look at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, you're running into places where we are in so many places already. You're starting to get to different markets, but maybe B and C markets in a different trading area. So a little bit \u2013 not such a green empty market for us, but one where we can do more business with the appropriate population and demographics. So it's a bit of a mix. We have some Sierra Trading Post stores open. Those are clearly going into new markets because it's such a young business.", "If you think it down the road of the new concept in home that we just extended because we just believe home continues to present for us because of the way we do it in such a differentiated value manner, just continues to create this enormous opportunity for TJX in total. If you think about this new business, which is only starting with four stores later this year, that to us is a \u2013 you're talking about going to all the markets because it's a new business and we're going to be going after categories that aren't so penetrated in the HomeGoods store and are going to allow us to actually go after categories in other markets that we're not in at all with those type of product categories.", "And we've actually \u2013 just so, we've been testing \u2013 you guys would not realize this, but we've been testing many of those home categories for the last year and year-and-a-half. You guys wouldn't realize it by the way we've been testing it, but that's allowing us to plant the seeds and feel a high degree of confidence on what the store can do for business when it starts up later on this year. So good question, I think it various almost by each of our brands a little bit. Hopefully that helps.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "And, Ernie, you touched upon remodels. Maybe you could just articulate a little bit about what we should know and what we should prioritize in thinking about remodels? You've been very flexible already with how you move and groove the store experience. So I'm just curious about mentioning remodels and what it means for the long term of the company at large.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So that's pretty, Oliver, kind of what \u2013 it's just a basic strategy we have to ensure that our chain is up-to-date and that we don't lose \u2013 so in some cases, by the way, we have found and it's a little cloudy at this point. In some cases we actually got a little sales lift, and a lot of cases you're trying to ensure that you don't deteriorate and you keep yourself up to the current standards that allow us to continue to make the customer happy from a shopping environment. And that's really where we've been.", "So we look at the customer service feedback, which I think I referred to in my script. We are constantly looking at that in a very timely manner, more so than we have for years, and we can kind of zero in on what stores between that. And our real estate team does a fantastic job of knowing when and where we need to pull the trigger to remodel a store.", "Again, we're fortunate because our brick-and-mortar business is healthy, and so we have the cash to keep reinvesting. That's another place where Scott is always having to manage all of our investments that we do, but we think remodels are critical. And we do believe it is one of the reasons that we continue to have a healthy brick-and-mortar business as we don't allow our stores to get outdated.", "And when we do our remodels, we look at functional improvements as well. It isn't just an atmosphere. It's a functional improvement approach in addition to an atmosphere redesign. So, yes, we are bullish. We do flex with it, and you'll see our remodel number vary a little year-to-year based on a bottom-up approach, feedback.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Best regards.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ms. Dana Telsey. Ma'am, your line is open. Go ahead, please.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Hello?", "Operator", "Ms. Telsey?", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Hi. Yes. Good morning and congratulations on the terrific results.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you, Dana.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "As you think about the new concept opportunities with Sierra Trading Post, with what you're doing with the new home business, how do you think about the apparel category relative to these categories? Is there the opportunity for another new apparel business that would develop? And what the margin offsets are of these new potential businesses? Thank you.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Right. Good questions. So first of all, let me address the first part on the apparel question that you're getting at. So, as you know, we're pretty dominant in apparel right now with our Maxx and Marshalls businesses in the states. I would tell you that a lot of the Sierra Trading Post business is apparel that we'll be looking at.", "There's nothing on the plate right now in terms of another brand, in terms of apparel, but that's not to say never. We're always looking and innovating and testing lots of ideas around here, and I would tell you that it's not that that idea has not come up. I would say we have toyed with different versions, but as you know we're pretty methodical in that we don't want to do too many things at once.", "So if you're us, what we're looking at right now is we have a high degree of confidence in our Australia business, which is a full-line store, very much we do, apparel driven. We like the way our Maxx and Marshalls business is going, and we're looking at where we think we are most underpenetrated from opportunity potential is in our home arena in the U.S. And it just screams at us. Obviously, and you're aware of all the success.", "So we are bullish in terms of some of the apparel parts of the Sierra Trading Post expansion, and we're bullish about those stores specifically. And getting at that, we've put a new infrastructure in place, a planning organization in place, and we've actually put some systems in place that are going to allow us to handle those apparel and non-apparel areas in a much more TJX-way of shipping and selling the goods. So, I know, I don't think I'm totally answering your question about where do we see apparel going, but I think you were trying to get the lay of the land, so to speak.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Exactly.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Okay.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Yes. And what about cosmetics, there's been a lot of \u2013 beauty has been a bigger category or been a heightened-focus category, I just got eh email the other day. Is that an opportunity?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "I can't really comment specifically on a family business like that, but it's a good question. Very good question, Dana.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Thank you.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "I guess we have taken our last call, and we would say again, we've been very excited to have this time with you guys today. Thank you all for joining us.

And now, I will turn it back over to Ernie.", "Ernie Herrman", "Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our second quarter results. Consolidated comp store sales were up 3% over a 4% increase last year and above our plan. Once again, customer traffic was the primary driver of our consolidated comp increase. Earnings per share were up $0.85 also above our expectations and merchandise margin was up again this quarter. We believe our second quarter performance demonstrates once again the strength, consistency and flexibility of our off-price business model. We continue to deliver healthy sales and comp increases in a shifting retail landscape with volatility in traditional retail and growth of online in general.", "We are particularly pleased with the performance of both our apparel and home categories. Our outstanding values in the collective merchandise mix continue to resonate with consumers and drive shoppers to our stores. We remain convinced that we have been growing our customer base and gaining market share at each of our four major divisions. The customer is clearly telling us that brick-and-mortar retail continues to be an essential part of the shopping experience and certainly when it is executed right with the right values. All of this gives us confidence in our long-term global store growth potential. Across the company, we plan to open approximately 260 stores this year alone.", "With our strong second quarter performance, we are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS growth. Looking ahead, we have many growth initiatives planned for the back half of the year. The marketplace is loaded with quality branded merchandise across apparel and non-apparel categories. And as always, our management team is passionate about achieving its plans and we will strive to surpass them. We remain very confident that we can continue to successfully grow in both the U.S. and internationally.", "Before I continue, I will turn the call over to Scott to recap our second quarter numbers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Ernie and good morning everyone. To reiterate, we are very pleased with the strength and consistency of our comp increases and traffic gains. Again, consolidated comparable store sales increased 3% over a 4% increase last year and were above the high-end of our plan. Further, customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at each of our four major divisions. As a reminder, our comp growth excludes our e-commerce businesses.", "Diluted earnings per share were at $0.85 and also above the high end of our plan. The combination of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS growth by 8% versus our expectation of a 4% negative impact. Also wage increases negatively impacted EPS growth by 2% as anticipated. The change in accounting rules for share based compensation was slightly favorable to EPS. We were very pleased that our merchandise margin once again increased in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter consolidated inventories on a per store basis including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in transit and e-commerce inventories were down 6% on a constant currency basis. We are very pleased with our lean inventory position and our liquidity and are setup very well to flow fresh merchandise to our stores throughout the back half of the year.", "Now to recap our second quarter performance by division, Marmaxx comps were up 2% versus a 4% increase last year. Segment profit margin decreased 50 basis points and merchandise margins remained healthy. Segment profit margin decreased primarily due to additional supply chain costs as a result of flowing more units at a lower average ticket and a negative impact from wage increases as expected as well as expense de-leverage on the 2% comp. We remain confident in our full year outlook for Marmaxx and have many initiatives planned for the back half of the year to drive traffic and sales at our largest division.", "HomeGoods delivered another excellent quarter of comp growth with a 7% increase over last year\u2019s 5% increase. Segment profit margin was down 80 basis points primarily due to a decline in merchandise margin. This was driven by increased freight costs which were largely a result of our new distribution center. Importantly mark-down and mark-on in total were favorable. As we anticipated increased costs associated with opening more stores including our new HomeSense concept and wage increases also had a negative impact on HomeGoods margin. These headwinds were partially offset by expense leverage due to HomeGoods\u2019 strong comp sales. We are thrilled with our consistent comp increases and traffic gains at this division.", "TJX Canada comps increased a strong 7% over last year\u2019s 9% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was up 180 basis points. This was primarily due to strong merchandise margins which benefited significantly due to the year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar as expected. We are very pleased that all three of our Canadian chains delivered great results again this quarter. TJX International comps increased 1% in the second quarter. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was up 60 basis points. This was due to a very strong increase in merchandise margin despite significant headwinds from the year-over-year decline in the British pound. This is a testament to our off-price model, our opportunistic and disciplined buying and our flexibility to adjust to a challenging retail environment. TJX\u2019s international strong merchandise margin increase was partially offset by supply chain costs and wage increases as expected as well as expense de-leverage on the one comp.", "In Europe while sales were not as strong as we would have liked, we continue to believe we are performing better than most major European retailers. Further we are happy with the product availability we are seeing for brands in this environment. In Australia TK Maxx once again delivered very strong sales results as our values and brands continue to resonate with the Australian customer.", "I will finish with our shareholder distributions. During the second quarter we bought back $550 million of TJX stock retiring 7.5 million shares. We now anticipate in buying back 1.5 billion to 1.8 billion of TJX stock this year. Further through our dividend program, we returned $201 million to shareholders in the second quarter representing a 20% increase over last year\u2019s per share dividend.", "Now let me turn the call back to Ernie and I will recap our third quarter and full year fiscal \u201818 guidance at the end of the call.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thanks Scott. Again, I would like to reiterate that we believe our strong second quarter results underscore the strength consistency and flexibility of our off-price business model. Looking forward, we have great confidence in our continued successful growth around the world for many years to come. Our key pillars for growth remain driving comp sales and customer traffic and our global store expansion. Our consistent strong performance tells us that our strategies to drive customer traffic and comp sales are working. Further, we see enormous global store growth potential for TJX. We have plenty of white space or markets to fill in throughout our current countries. Long-term, we see the opportunity to open 5,600 stores with just our current banners and that\u2019s about 1,700 more stores than we have today. We continue to see store openings as an attractive investment and a very good use of capital. We are convinced that these growth drivers will allow us to continue to capture additional market share both in the U.S. and internationally.", "Now, I will review some of the key reasons for our confidence. In a retail landscape that is changing with volatility and traditional retail and the growth of e-commerce in general, we see TJX as very strongly positioned. I will cover why we believe consumers love to shop our stores, why we are so confident we will always have quality product available to us and how we will be driving growth through innovation. First and foremost, we offer shoppers outstanding values and merchandise. While so many retailers are chasing value today, value has been our mission since the beginning. I believe the growth of online retail overall has heightened the visibility of our off-price values for consumers. Our values continue to be a tremendous draw for shoppers to visit our retail banners, further for us, value was more than price. Our value proposition is a combination of brand, fashion, price and quality. Our world classifying team with decades of experience clearly understands true value.", "Next, we ask consumers in a collective merchandise mix that is ever-changing. This newness and freshness encourage consumers to shop our retail banners frequently. Again our world classifying organization sources from the universe of over 18,000 vendors globally to seek up the best deals on quality fashionable goods. This allows us to offer savvy shoppers, curated selections from around the world in both apparel and non-apparel all at amazing values. We see our treasure hunt shopping experience as an advantage. As today shopper spends more on personal experiences, particularly millennials they constructed dollars further in our stores in both our apparel and non-apparel categories. We are very pleased that across our major divisions we continue to capture a broad age demographic with new shoppers skewing towards younger customers. We see this as a great indicator for our future. We are convinced that our brand and fashion assortments give consumers compelling reasons to shop our stores.", "Further, we focus everyday on creating an entertaining in-store experience for consumers. We aim to surprise and delight our customers every time they shop with us. We are convinced that in an environment where e-commerce in general is growing, the ability to touch and feel the merchandise, shop for a wide variety of brands and items under one roof and take home that same day remains a tremendous draw. With our rapidly turning inventories there was always something fresh and exciting for our shoppers to discover. We continue to upgrade the shopping experience through store remodels and listening to customer feedback. We have made our stores easier to shop and believe we are presenting our merchandise better. We are proud of our customer satisfaction scores and remain focused on always improving them. In addition we know consumers value their time and we aim to locate our stores in convenient, easy to access locations. In the U.S. and Canada our stores are generally located in off-mall strip centers where consumers often visit weekly or even multiple times per week. We believe that with a number of convenient locations TJX has, we are top of mind for consumers.", "Next our flexible store formats allow us to respond quickly to changing consumer preferences. About half of our overall sales are in non-apparel categories. And we have had the ability to expand, contract and add new categories based on what consumers are seeking. Finally, while e-commerce represents a small portion of our overall business, we see it as complementary to our very successful brick-and-mortar business in another way to drive traffic. We are successfully differentiating our online offering from our physical stores, which gives us \u2013 gives customers a compelling reason to shop both channels.", "Now, I will move to our confidence and our ability to continue sourcing quality branded product. Over our 40 year plus history availability of merchandise has never been an issue for us. Our worldwide vendor universe affords us enormous flexibility. And there are many reasons we see ourselves as an attractive outlet for vendors. We believe we have some of the vendor relationships in the retail industry. We pride ourselves on building mutually beneficial long-term relationships. We are constantly working to make our current relationships even stronger and forge new ones. Opening new vendor relationship is a high priority for our buyers, so we can constantly introduce new and exciting brands in our stores. Additionally, we are leveraging many of our existing vendor relationships by offering more of their products across our retail banners. Our buyers are in the marketplace throughout the year and we are able to buy in many different ways. We can purchase less than full assortments of items, styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large. We believe the key reason vendors like doing business with us is because we pay promptly and our approach is not to ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising, promotional or return allowances.", "Next, with 3,900 plus stores today, we are growing successful business with a global presence in an uncertain retail environment. We saw branded merchandise and vendors know their product will hang next to other great brands in our stores. We also offer vendors ways to grow their business and access to new markets bringing U.S. brands internationally or vice versa. Further, we can help brands grow or penetrate more markets because our stores are located across many urban, suburban and rural areas. Lastly, we are flexible on our dealings with vendors. We don\u2019t advertise their brand names in our marketing, also with our wide and shallow merchandise assortments and rapidly turning inventories there is very little visibility of their brand names in our stores. At the same time selling just two units a day at each of our TJ Maxx and Marshall stores would allow a vendor to move over 1.5 million units a year.", "Okay. Now, I will move to driving growth through new seeds and innovation and update you on a few initiatives. First, we are very excited about the opening of our first U.S. HomeSense store in Framingham this week to encourage customers to shop both our U.S. home chains. We are highly focused on differentiating them as we have successfully done with TJ Maxx and Marshalls as well as Winners and Marshalls in Canada. HomeSense will look and feel very different from our HomeGoods chain. HomeSense has rooted in inspiration and discovery and will complement HomeGoods by offering expanding categories such as large scale furniture lighting and art. It will also include new departments like a general store which will offer organization and hardware items all with an element of fashion. We are extremely excited about some of the new categories and surprises for this concept and believe will be delighted. At the same time certain departments like kids and pet will be featured only at HomeGoods. We believe an enormous opportunity remains for us to gain additional share in the U.S. home market. We are confident that shoppers are going to love our new HomeSense stores.", "Next, we have successfully opened more than 20 HomeGoods stores with an existing larger Marmaxx stores. But it\u2019s still early. We are pleased with the above planned sales of this group of stores. We are now planning to convert an additional 10 Marmaxx stores to this format this year. This initiative will bring even more HomeGoods stores to new markets more quickly and efficiently and increase our overall HomeGoods openings to almost 100 this year. Again, we are seeing great opportunity for the future of our company within the U.S. home sector. In Australia shoppers are loving TK Maxx. The initial feedback tells us that our new marketing campaign and great values are resonating with Australian customers. As Scott mentioned sales continue to be very strong in Australia. We are just getting started in Australia and are confident that we have a significant opportunity to grow our market share in this region.", "In closing I would like to emphasize that the key advantages that I have discussed today are all built on our 40 years plus of experience in building, developing and refining our off-price retail model. While we were trying to keep our business simple and focused, the ability to operate and highly integrate international \u2013 to operate a highly integrated international off-price retail business doesn\u2019t happen overnight and we believe would be extremely difficult to replicate. We have decades of experience to build international teams and infrastructures that we see as key advantages. We believe our buying organization of more than 1,000 associates is best-in-class. We have great longevity among our buyers which we attribute to our very strong corporate culture. Our worldwide vendor universe also took us decades to build. We see ourselves as a global sourcing machine. Our processes, systems and logistics are all built to support our off-price opportunistic buying. Further, we have been operating internationally for well over two decades and are the only major international off-price apparel and home fashions retailer. Again, we are very pleased with our second quarter results and we are excited about our opportunities for the second half of the year. We believe our gift-giving offerings will be even fresher this year and we love our marketing campaigns across the divisions. As always, we are passionate about surpassing our goals.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance and then we will open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thanks, Ernie. I will begin with our full year fiscal \u201818 guidance. As a reminder, the guidance includes a 53rd week in the fiscal \u201818 calendar, which we expect will benefit full year EPS growth by approximately 3% or about $0.11 per share. On a GAAP basis, we now expect fiscal \u201818 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.89 to $3.93. Excluding the benefit from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.78 to $3.82. This would be up 7% to 8% versus the adjusted $3.53 in fiscal \u201817.", "As a reminder, we have a few factors impacting our expected earnings per share growth in fiscal \u201818. First, we continue to expect that wage increases will have a negative impact to fiscal \u201818 EPS growth of about 2%. Second, we now expect that the share-based compensation accounting rule change will benefit fiscal \u201818 EPS growth by about $0.06 or 2% versus our previous expectation of $0.08. After FX assuming current rates, we now expect the net impact of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange with a neutral impact on fiscal \u201818 EPS growth. This EPS guidance assumes consolidated sales in the $35.6 million to $35.8 billion range, a 7% to 8% increase over the prior year. This guidance assumes a positive impact to revenue of approximately 1.5% due to the 53rd week and a neutral impact to reported revenue due to translational FX.", "We are continuing to plan a 1% to 2% comp increase on a consolidated basis. The comps by definition exclude the 53rd week. We expect pre-tax profit margin to be in the range of 11.2% to 11.3%. This would be down 20 to 30 basis points versus the adjusted 11.5% in fiscal \u201817. The 53rd week is expected to benefit the high-end of pre-tax profit margin by approximately 20 basis points. We are planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.9% to 29.0% compared with 29% last year. The 53rd week is expected to have a 20 basis point benefit to gross profit margin.", "Our plans also assume we will maintain our strong merchandise margin. We are expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be approximately 17.6% versus 17.4% last year. We do not expect the 53rd week to have a significant impact on full year SG&A expense. For modeling purposes, we are currently anticipating a tax rate of 37%, net interest expense of about $39 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 647 million.", "Now to our full year guidance by division, sales and pre-tax margin guidance on a 53-week basis. At Marmaxx, we are expecting comp growth of 1% to 2% on sales of $22.3 billion to $22.4 billion and segment profit margin in the range of 13.8% to 13.9%. At HomeGoods, we now expect comps to increase 3% to 4% on sales of $5.1 billion and segment profit margin in the range of 13.5% to 13.6%. For TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 3% to 4% on sales of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion. We are raising our adjusted segment profit margin guidance excluding foreign currency to a range of 14.3% to 14.4%. At TJX international, we are expecting comp growth of 1% to 2% on sales of $4.8 billion. We are raising our adjusted segment profit margin guidance excluding foreign currency to a range of 4.6% to 4.7%.", "Moving to Q3 guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.98 to $1 versus last year\u2019s $0.83 per share. Excluding last year\u2019s debt extinguishment charge and pension settlement charge, Q3 EPS will be up 8% to 10% versus the prior year\u2019s adjusted $0.91. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of approximately 1% due to wages. It also includes a 3% benefit to EPS growth due to the combination of foreign currency and transactional FX and an additional 2% benefit to EPS growth due to a change in accounting rules for share-based compensation.", "We are modeling third quarter consolidated sales in the range of $8.8 billion to $8.9 billion. This guidance assumes about a 1% positive impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. For comp store sales, we are assuming growth in the 1% to 2% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Third quarter pre-tax profit margin is planned in the 11.3% to 11.4% range versus the prior year\u2019s adjusted 11.7%. We are anticipating third quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 29.2% to 29.3% versus 29.5% last year. We are expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be approximately 17.8% versus 17.6% last year.

Again, we expect the extra week in the fourth quarter to benefit fourth quarter EPS by about $0.11 per share. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call. It\u2019s important to remember that our guidance for the third quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the third quarter.", "Now, we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we are going to ask you that you please limit your questions to one per person. Thanks. And now, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Kimberly Greenberger. Your line now is open.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Great, thank you so much and thanks for all the detail. Ernie, I was very interested in your commentary of the availability of inventory and one of the questions we commonly get from investors is that there are some large publicly traded brands that seem to be cutting back on their inventory, but with 18,000 vendors obviously that makes it much easier for you to let\u2019s say maneuver your inventory purchases to where you see most appropriate. Is there any impact that your buyer \u2013 are your buyers seeing any impact from reduced inventory levels as some of the larger brands and maybe you could just help us understand how reliant or maybe not reliant TJX might be on your top 5 or 10 vendors? Thanks so much.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, good question, Kimberly. And obviously, we get this fair amount from different people asking similar variations of that question. First of all, we have not experienced the cutback with our major brands. It varies by brand, but overall in terms of the branded content and the ratios of all of our bigger programs throughout all the businesses, we if anything are having to manage our flow and our buying pattern there to not buy too much too soon, so we have not experienced that. I know \u2013 and we are aware of where it gets reported and in some specific cases, some of those brands are cutting back, but then other big brands oftentimes have more than what they are talking about or more than if they are staying quiet there can be more out there than you know about. And secondly you mentioned it in your question, we have a wide \u2013 we have a wide universe of brands, 18,000 is what we are saying publicly warrant admission to consistently open more brands. So, with all the different categories and I did have that in the script, actually in the prepared remarks that we not only are buying for more brands, but from the existing brands we are buying more categories and into new divisions. So, some of that brands get expanded to other divisions that weren\u2019t necessarily being put in the other divisions. So, I guess we are bit of an island on this front. We know what\u2019s going on in the environment, but we have no pattern of less availability that we see that we have any visibility to. Again, it varies by brand. We could have one brand down one year and another up, but in terms of major brands we probably have more flow today than we have ever had.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Great. Thanks, Ernie.", "Ernie Herrman", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Binetti. Your line is now open.", "Michael Binetti", "Hey, guys. Thanks for all the detail and thanks for taking my question. Obviously, you guys have been very happy for a long time with the contribution to your same-store sales from the traffic increases that you have been seeing. I guess, it\u2019s just natural to think about that as you guys get bigger and bigger within the marketplace. Is the traffic and the unit growth being such a big contributor, but obviously that\u2019s got a higher cost component. As you look forward through your business and you see the margin compression maybe on Marmaxx and the HomeGoods side over the last 1 year and 1.5 years. Do you see a point in the horizon we are driving your EPS aspirations mid single-digits underlying this year and I think you want to try and pick it up a little bit over the next few years? Do you see a few obvious levers of ways that you can stabilize the margin or maybe increase it if same-store sales, stays in about the range we have been seeing lately?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, this is Scott. In terms of the overall pressures, you are right among the ticking up. We did say that. And again just to be clear, no new news here. We said it would tick up at the beginning of the year and tick up when we gave our initial guidance based on the 5% EPS growth that was given at that time. So, no news there. In terms of the fundamentals of the business, I think that from the external factors, the major thing would be the wage moderation going in terms of that is moderating a bit, a little bit lumpiness in the supply chain. In terms of other factors, one of the biggest thing that\u2019s been weighing at least for the last couple of years is the average retail. And I think Ernie will address that in a moment. So, that has been a major factor. And other than that, no news to report, but we have alluded, we are always working on ways to increase efficiencies within the business, whether it\u2019s in the supply chain stores and generally, we will talk about that more at the year end, but certainly we are working on things, but nothing that we would at this point go through in anymore detail I will probably talk about that more at year end. So, I think the major things that are slowing down are the wage and the average retail, but I will let Ernie talk a bit more about that.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, Michael and we have been saying this for a bit and it has not moderated as much as we would have thought, but we see it as some of our hottest categories the way it\u2019s worked out have been in lower average ticket areas as well as the environment has certainly with the opportunities that we have gone after from both fronts. We have ended up with lower average ticket. And this by the way tends to be a Marmaxx discussion, but we see that as moderating as we move forward. We thought it would have moderated more quickly over the last half really and it hasn\u2019t. Having said that, we have talked about this many times, this is a bottom-up strategy, it is not a top-down strategy in the company and we drive it from our merchandise managers and buyers down at the family of business area, where they want to ensure the right value and excitement level and we believe it\u2019s directly tied into the market share and strong sales for example this past quarter that we are having. So a bit ambiguous on the average ticket thing. I know I think you were asking a bit about merchandise margin as well there. We are happy \u2013 certainly, our merchandise margin we are very happy with what\u2019s been going on there and we have had years and years of healthy merchandise margin improvements, but we were \u2013 Marmaxx especially and we were very happy with the way that came in, in this past quarter. So, in terms of going forward that\u2019s a place where yes, it\u2019s always challenging compare app, but we think over time we still can make inroads there. So, hopefully between Scott and I answered your question.", "Michael Binetti", "You do. I will let somebody else step on. Thank you very much.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you, Michael.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matthew Boss. Your line is now open.", "Matthew Boss", "Thanks and nice quarter. So, is the gross margin delta between the third and fourth quarter, should we think about that primarily the occupancy leverage just given the extra week in the fourth quarter? And then on the merchandise margins is this continued apparel disruption, does this present an opportunity for you guys to turn goods even faster and just any changes that you potentially made in the way you allocate in season versus pack away I think would be really interesting?", "Ernie Herrman", "I think Scott is getting\u2026", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes, I mean, in terms of the gross profit particularly the third quarter, we see merchandise margin continue. We have been outperforming our merchandise margin plans as we have moved through the first and second quarter compared to original plan right now. We have a flattish merchandise margin. So, the gross profit margin, the de-leverage there is essentially due to the same thing we have seen most of the year and that\u2019s just supply chain costs in the DC is a little benefit of hedge offsetting that. So in terms of we still see a strong merchandise margin in the back half with some de-leverage due to supply chain, nothing really changed there.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. Matt, in terms of the \u2013 I think you asked about turning faster potentially given I guess what you are getting out is the opportunities that could be in the marketplace right given the business around. And I would say that I am not sure it will turn significantly faster. In substance, we are turning so fast as it is, but there might be some margin opportunity in that situation where yes, certainly apparel across the markets is not healthy and so that could yield some unusually good opportunities, but that is one reason in the prepared comments we talked about the loaded markets that are out there, which isn\u2019t just apparel, but it is potentially yielding I think some margin opportunities that we are hoping will reap the benefits of. And that probably won\u2019t just be apparel. The interesting one place where it\u2019s very visible is if you look at our Europe business this past quarter, we had just a phenomenally healthy merchandise margin come through over there. On a one comp, we delivered, Scott, I don\u2019t know if you have that.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. Again, sometimes the big difference here between the reported margin and the ex-FX, we were up 60 basis points, we were up significantly in our merchandise margin despite actually being negatively hedged going into the quarter. And just as a reminder, the pound dropped significantly after Brexit last year. So, the hedge rates were unfavorable, but the buying opportunity which I think Ernie was alluded to was just really opened up for us.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. And I am so product of that team and when you have that environment in that situation the sales are just okay to be able to leverage that really speaks to the model of our business that they have held their powder dry, their commitments, their open buy was liquid and it\u2019s really classic off-price 101 where that team was able to execute and have such a healthy merchandise margin in an environment like that where everybody is struggling and managed to that and come out clean at the end of the season. So, I really took my hat to that team in Europe.", "Matthew Boss", "Great. And Scott, just in the fourth quarter, the extra week, am I thinking about this right, it\u2019s 80 to 90 basis point benefit, because I think you said 20 basis points to the year through gross margin. Is that right?", "Scott Goldenberg", "We didn\u2019t give it to the quarter, but it was 20 basis points to the year. So, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we didn\u2019t detail that out.", "Matthew Boss", "Okay, thanks. Good luck.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Drbul. Your line is now open.", "Bob Drbul", "Hi, good morning. On the supply chain costs, where are we in terms of the investment and how much longer do you see that pressuring the overall business? And when you look at the store opening plan that you have, are the economics improving on a lot of these new stores and how are you hitting through on the new store in a four-walled contribution with the openings?", "Ernie Herrman", "So, I will jump in at first on the supply chain. Supply chain, we don\u2019t have detailed plans rolled out yet for the go forward. I think that the only changes from the beginning of the year to now looking forward, it\u2019s a bit more lumpy, but primarily two things running Ernie had indirectly addressed. The first one is a lot will depend on how average retails move, but as ever retails have gone up, certainly puts a bit more pressure primarily on Marmaxx for us to do certain whether it\u2019s more things that cost us more money in terms of the supply chain on a go forward basis. Whether that\u2019s moving forward a DC earlier than we would have thought or using some outside third-parties to produce some goods for us. In terms of the other piece of that as we have ramped up the HomeGoods and the performance there, also making the sets that they are providing a bit earlier than we would have expected the distribution capacity for that chain. Those really are the two things, so a bit lumpy, lumpy going forward. And the only other thing is just this past week, actually Sunday, we opened up a new distribution center in the UK, in Wakefield, which will weigh a little on our margins for the next few months as we have some duplicate storage and other costs, but we think it provides a great environment for us on go forward and we don\u2019t see any need for distribution capacity in Europe at this point for the near future. In terms of store openings, we are opening as Ernie said 260. All of them meet the hurdle rates that we have 12% or better that we plan for our return on invested capital. We by and large have been hitting overall our sales plans, so whether it\u2019s this year or going back, I would say the one thing that we have talked about from time-to-time is from a overall we don\u2019t get the benefit \u2013 the same benefit for a new store they would have 5 years ago as there is a bit more cannibalization in some of the stores, built it\u2019s built into our models. And the second thing is the average size of the store at this point. The volumes of the stores are not at the chain average, so you don\u2019t get the same benefit on a per store basis that you would as with the chain average. Other than that, before well profits over time get to be similar for similar volume stores, the one caveat is you are paying obviously current market rents versus the benefit we get of the old rents. So \u2013 but the actual performance is similar in stores in terms of the ramp-up of the comp sales over the first 5 years. Again, the only difference would be the volume based differences.", "Bob Drbul", "Great. And then if I could just ask the question on the category, one of the categories where there is always a lot of commentary and discussion for the off-price channels handbags, I was wondering if you could talk about how that category is performing and any inventory availability that you are seeing in that specific area?", "Ernie Herrman", "So Bob unfortunately, we do not give specific category performance information out there publicly. So we like to keep that stuff in-house so to speak.", "Bob Drbul", "Understood. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson. Your line is now open.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask specifically about the HomeGoods margins, understanding there are some DC pressures there, but margin did get mostly worse versus the first quarter on a better comp, so I am just hoping if you could go through some of the moving pieces and how we should think about them going forward?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. Thank you, Lorraine. Good question, a bit nuance, obviously when you are looking at the first quarter performance, I am assuming you are referring to the \u2013 we had a three comp in the first quarter and we are down 10 basis points versus the down 80 basis points on the 7% comp this year. Both quarters were impacted by some of the supply chain and wage pressure, so no new difference in the base, but we did have more freight costs, significantly more freight costs this quarter in HomeGoods, primarily due to some additional West Coast sourcing and product mix differences that were significantly different than the first quarter. The other thing is with us opening up 20 more stores in the second quarter, 23 versus three last year and 50 stores in the third quarter. We had a bit more pressure for both on the margins and with the pre-opening costs in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Also with \u2013 as Ernie talked about HomeSense, we have the HomeSense opening and the related costs not just to the store, but obviously organizationally and otherwise that we had. And then there was some timing of expenses more to do what happened last year versus this year causing some just I would call timing of differences between the second quarter and third quarter. Going forward, most of the pressure we didn\u2019t go detail by division obviously. We gave the full year guidance on HomeGoods, but most of the pressure going forward is related to the supply chain and the wage pressures and always to be determined on what will happen with where the goods are sourced.", "Ernie Herrman", "So, Lorraine, I would just jump in also as we are talking about margins and Scott, I think would reiterate this that the merchandise margin, Scott, has been very healthy.", "Scott Goldenberg", "So, excluding the freight, which obviously is included a piece of that in, but excluding that the markdown and mark-on were actually favorable in total.", "Ernie Herrman", "Right. And so you combine that with obviously the sales, which we are absolutely thrilled with and the way our new stores are performing, we have already opened 40 stores so far this year. And as we mentioned on track to be close to 100 all-in, I think some of these expense issues are shorter term and we are excited about where we are headed with the profits with HomeGoods expansion here and the sales obviously being the number one driver.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen. Your line is now open.", "Oliver Chen", "Hi, thanks. Congrats on a great quarter. Our question was related to speed in your supply chain, are there any initiatives you can speak to in terms of what you are focused on whether it be the manufacturers of the buyers of the floor or the DCs and editing speed further you have done a really great job with that? And also a related question is the inventory management as you continue to make progress and enter new categories, what are your thoughts around your inventory management programs and where there could be opportunities? Thank you.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, Oliver, I guess I will start here and Scott can jump in. First of all, on speed, we have talked about this at actually some of our meetings. We have over the last I\u2019d say 5 to 10 years really made great progress literally all across the supply chain from the time the buyers writing the purchase order in our logistics era how quickly we move the freight to processing and our distribution centers to the outbound freight to the stores and then we turn the goods around even faster in our backrooms to get them on the selling floor and that applies to every single division that\u2019s from Europe to domestically in the U.S. Marmaxx, HomeGoods, Canada, our strong concerted effort, so that we have been able to really chop off, I would say, a couple of weeks of turnaround time from the time we write the orders with the vendors to the time it hits the stores. That has yielded \u2013 it has yielded in an off-price business the ability for our merchants to buy good later and more current with more knowledge, but even at the peak selling times where we would have had a window close on us and the ability to buy goods. So, at Christmas, for example, we are able to buy a couple of weeks later towards Christmas than we ever had before over the last handful of years. So that\u2019s something the teams are always looking at and we don\u2019t go public with what next iterations can allow us to tweak and improve it even further, but we are consistently on that mission.", "Again, it isn\u2019t always \u2013 it\u2019s not always the production of the goods, supply chain sometimes it\u2019s in the stores how we handle the goods and get them on the floor. The field has done a great job on that as well. Inventory management has obviously been a big push for us for a long time now, probably last 10 or 15 years in terms of how lean and how we like to turn, we have gotten on markdown rates in extremely healthy positions not sure actually how much level we want those to go, because you want to make sure you are always taking the markdowns aggressively and driving top line and driving market share, which has been a key focus of ours for numerous years now and continues to be as to what we have talked about with the average retail discussion earlier, we don\u2019t want to give up on gaining market share. So, our inventory management I think you will see us tweaking it by division. I think our planning and allocation systems and talent we have there gets the talent level that we bring in and that organization continues to improve and we are looking at always improving best practices there, but I don\u2019t see that as a substantial move over the next few years, I see it as a tweak in terms of improving on our inventory management.", "Oliver Chen", "So that\u2019s really helpful. The other the last question we had is on mobile, what are your thoughts on your customer in terms of what you may want to do with mobile and how that may interplay with bricks and clicks and then the obvious overlap with so many people shopping at Amazon, just curious on mobile given that it has such an important factor in relation to online traffic in general?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. Oliver we can \u2013 are you talking about \u2013 Oliver, you are talking about mobile payments or just mobile marketing?", "Oliver Chen", "Mobile marketing and customers using mobile phones as methodologies to look at pricing and\u2026?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. So we are continuing to intensify our investment there. If you look at we launched our HomeGoods app back a while ago and we are in the process now looking at additional apps within the business. If you look tjmaxx.com as well as SDP, we are doing more and more business off our mobile sites. But we are \u2013 we have a concerted effort to look at more and more marketing off of our mobile devices and digital. So our digital spend in marketing is by far the biggest increase over the last few years as we downplayed other media spend, probably because we are getting \u2013 we are trying to get to the younger costumers. And actually, it\u2019s not just an age group situation because a lot of us, myself included use your phones and use your laptops significantly more than ever in the past. But we aren\u2019t at the stage of some of the retails that obviously have their apps for purchasing in the store. We are not there yet, but I think we are making in roads.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you. Best of luck.", "Ernie Herrman", "Thank you, Oliver.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question Lindsay Drucker Mann. Your line is now open.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Scott, I think that you said that Marmaxx de-leveraged fixed costs excluding the I guess the wage and the supply chain stuff on their two comp and I was curious what the leverage point is for Marmaxx and if you think that you can get the leverage point down or if we should be thinking about Marmaxx shooting for a better than two comp ongoing in order to stay in margins there. And Ernie as a follow-up, you are talking about market share gains being a priority, could you talk about how your stores performed in areas that were near to a close Macy\u2019s or Penny or other close retailers and whether those outperformed or performed differently than the rest of the fleet and if you are gaining market share as a result of competitor closures?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. I think a bit in terms of this quarter being somewhat similar the major at Marmaxx you would \u2013 in a world where merchandise margins were flat you had no wage pressure or supply chain pressure, you need approximately a three comp to be flat. Clearly, we have had both wage pressure and some average retail pressure. The average wage pressure obviously going down so there will be a little less pressure on the P&L going forward, average retail, Ernie early talked about earlier, so you would clearly need a bit more than a three comp at this point to hold your margins flat given that we still have some wage and some supply chain pressure due to the average retail. But the plans have been put, so I think that answers your question.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "So there is no effort to bring the leverage point down?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Again, I think we will talk about more year end where there are certain things that we are going to trying to do, but nothing that we would talk about at this point in time.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Okay. Thanks. And on the market share and on the performance and market where you had close competitor stores?", "Scott Goldenberg", "Nothing noticeable as we have always talked about that in years past.", "Ernie Herrman", "So we have and Lindsay I think some of that is because of all of the dynamics. Even if you look at I think you are mentioning of a Macy\u2019s close or something, some of that has been we have had comps in a lot of those markets even before the closure. So we see some ups and downs even when \u2013 even when other off-pricers go in or off-pricers or other retailers go out, it\u2019s been really tough to see any noticeable trend.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Maybe another way as well, I mean certainly in terms of with the department store, the department stores share in both brick, their total sales are \u2013 they have certainly the brick-and-mortar sales have been going down for quite some time. So, there is some change with the store closings, but overall this is the bigger change is still in place. So, again, nothing that\u2019s noticeable to us when we are looking at the results.", "Ernie Herrman", "Some of it might have to do with the distances people travel etcetera. So, what happens is there is so many store closures like in the U.S. over the last 2 years that there is so much noise that\u2019s tough for our guys to analyze on a pickup. Obviously, our businesses have been good. So, we must be getting market share. We just don\u2019t know exactly is it coming from which specific retailer probably a little bit from everybody.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Got it. And if I could just sneak one more in, last quarter, Ernie, you called out weather as a potential drag that led to the disappointed comp sales, weather was tough around Memorial Day in some key markets did you notice that in your business as well, was weather an issue for you this quarter?", "Ernie Herrman", "So, what I would say is absolutely Lindsay first quarter it hurt us the weather at that time period, you can feel the iterations in the weather, but overall at least for us in the quarter, I think the weather ended up being pretty neutral.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. And moving for your final question of the day, we have Omar Saad. Your line is now open.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter. I wanted to ask a question about younger consumers in the growing fear of digital disintermediation competitive pressures from digital marketplaces. It feels like that younger consumers, the one that might be most exposed to shifting online, but I am curious if you guys are seeing that, your exposure to the younger consumer is less than it was 5, 10 years ago or are you seeing digitally enabled millennial embracing the channel? Any insight there might be helpful for us to figure out what\u2019s happening?", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes, Omar, we have been seeing more of our newer customers at younger ages. So, we have \u2013 by the way we have been consciously going there. Our media spend on digital media formats is way off as we have taken down other forms of marketing as well as if you look at the areas in our business that we have gone after, they are oriented towards younger demos. So, we have actually \u2013 we have not been experiencing that I think for some other brick-and-mortar formats without getting into it I could picture falling into more of a challenge there. But we strategically go after this discussion that you just brought up all the time. We are talking about all the time. I would tell you our person who is in charge of marketing is always on that mission to reach out to the younger demos, because for our future that\u2019s important. I think in my prepared remarks actually, I brought that up as how we were bring in more younger customers.", "Scott Goldenberg", "Yes. So at all of our major divisions, our percent of new customers has skewed towards the younger customers in the 18 to 34 age group. And in most cases, we are actually over-indexing in that group versus the actual age of the overall age of the population whether you are in U.S., Canada etcetera. That\u2019s been something that we have been tracking and doing it and has been happening for number of years.", "Ernie Herrman", "It\u2019s a great question, Omar, because we actually anecdotally we want to go after that customer base for the future. And one of the feedbacks that we get about our stores now was it\u2019s like an entertaining type of experience in the treasure hunt and it\u2019s become more of a cool place to shop is why I believe we are having success going for the younger customer and believe me, we are going to keep that as a focus going forward because we want to remain an entertaining treasure hunt type shopping experience to appeal to that customer, which by the way tends to like many of us have a shorter attention as we have all talked about whether you are watching multiple media formats, watching TV, watching your phone at the same time, that our format of shopping appeals to that person, because it allows them again entertainment form of shopping experience.", "Omar Saad", "It\u2019s an interesting data point that that digitally enabled millennial is choosing a channel that\u2019s predominantly physical. I appreciate the update. Thanks, guys.", "Ernie Herrman", "Yes. Just, Omar, the only other thing is that we are trying to integrate as much as we can. Our marketing message in terms of integrating to make sure they understand or multi-channel shopping opportunity they have particularly at TJ Maxx. So I think again and as Ernie said a lot of it goes back to the brands and fashions being more on point for the younger customers in the last few years. So that\u2019s it. Thank you very much.", "Omar Saad", "Got it. Thanks.", "Ernie Herrman", "Alright. Thank you all for joining us today. I look forward to updating you on our third quarter earnings call in November. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, November 14, 2017.", "I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Dory. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.", "Debra McConnell - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you, Ernie, and good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 28, 2017.", "Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies, Inc.

Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release in the Investors section of our website, TJX.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are posted on our website, TJX.com, in the Investors section.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. I want to begin our call today by saying that our hearts go out to all of our associates, their families and everyone who was affected by the recent hurricanes. The personal stories we have heard from our team in the field make it clear how devastating the situation has been to so many people.", "As an organization, we have extended our help and support to our associates and their families in Texas, Florida and in Puerto Rico, where we opened relief centers in some of our stores. We have made significant corporate contributions to the relief efforts of the American Red Cross and Save the Children and the response to our in-store fundraising campaigns has been tremendous, thanks to the generosity of our customers.", "We know the recovery is ongoing and will be long-lasting. As the CEO of this company, I could not be prouder of how our organization, our associates and our customers have responded to provide their care and support during such a difficult time.", "Moving now to our third quarter results. Third quarter consolidated comp sales were flat versus a strong 5% increase last year. Earnings per share were $1 and at the high end of our plan. During the quarter, the hurricanes negatively impacted our top- and bottom-line results.", "Additionally, we believe that warmer temperatures in the U.S. during the quarter dampened demand for apparel at Marmaxx. Beyond this, we believe we could have done a better job in certain apparel categories in Marmaxx and, therefore, left some business on the table.", "That said, our non-apparel sales were strong. Also, as the weather turned more seasonable in the second half of October, we saw sales trends improve at Marmaxx.", "Importantly, I am very pleased with our customer traffic, which was up strongly across all four major divisions, including up 2% at Marmaxx for the quarter. Further, merchandise margin was up again, similar to the strong increases we saw in the first and second quarters. This is a testament to the flexibility of our off-price business model. Our buyers capitalized on excellent opportunities in the marketplace, which helped drive mark-on.", "We remained extremely disciplined with our lean inventory levels and were very strategic in how we flowed merchandise to our stores. The fourth quarter is off to a strong start, and we see many opportunities. At Marmaxx, we started aggressively shipping more cold-weather apparel to start the quarter.", "We have many initiatives underway to drive sales and traffic this holiday selling season and are in a terrific inventory position. We have plenty of liquidity to take advantage of a marketplace that is loaded with quality branded merchandise. We are excited about the fourth quarter and we'll be offering great gift selections at compelling off-price values and emphasizing them in our marketing.", "The entire management team is laser-focused on achieving our fourth quarter plans and will strive to surpass them. We remain confident in our long-term growth strategy and that we can continue to grow successfully in both the U.S. and internationally.", "Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our third quarter numbers. Scott?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. Consolidated comparable store sales were flat versus a 5% increase last year. While sales were below our plan, we were very pleased that customer traffic was strong and up at all four major divisions. While overall traffic and the units sold were up, these increases were mostly offset by a lower average ticket.", "As a reminder, our comp store sales exclude the growth from e-commerce. Also, our comp store sales exclude 37 stores, mostly in Puerto Rico, that were significantly impacted by hurricanes during the quarter. I also want to mention that approximately 400 additional stores were impacted in Florida and Texas for a period of time due to the hurricanes and are still included in our comp store sales.", "Again, diluted earnings per share were $1 and at the high-end of our plan and over an adjusted $0.91 last year. We believe the combination of lost sales and other expenses due to the hurricanes in the third quarter negatively impacted EPS by about $0.03. The combination of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange benefited EPS growth by 5%, and the change in accounting rules for share-based compensation benefited EPS growth by an additional 2%.", "As we anticipated, wage increases negatively impacted EPS growth by about 1%. As Ernie mentioned, we were very pleased that our merchandise margin increased in the third quarter. Further, our overall pre-tax profit margin exceeded the high-end of our guidance despite the below planned sales. This was mostly due to better-than-expected merchandise margin and expense savings on the flat comp. Again, this speaks to the flexibility of our off-price model and our ability to adjust and react to current trends.", "At the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were down 4% on a constant currency basis. We are very comfortable with our liquidity and inventory position entering the fourth quarter and are set up very well to flow fresh merchandise to our stores throughout the holiday season.", "Now to recap our third quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comps were down 1% versus a 5% increase last year. Again, the hurricanes had a negative impact on third quarter sales. That said, we are very pleased that customer traffic increased at comp stores across all regions, except Florida. Segment profit margin decreased 80 basis points, primarily due to expense deleverage on the below planned comp.", "Merchandise margin was up significantly, which underscores our disciplined inventory \u2013 disciplined buying and inventory management. We were pleased to see sales trends improve toward the end of the quarter, and we may \u2013 and we have many exciting initiatives underway to drive traffic and sales in the fourth quarter and beyond.", "HomeGoods delivered another solid quarter. Comp sales increased 3% over last year's 6% increase and were also negatively impacted by the hurricanes. Segment profit margin was down 60 basis points. This was primarily due to increased supply chain and freight costs, largely a result of our new distribution center. We are very pleased with the comp increase and traffic gains we saw at this division.", "TJX Canada comps increased a strong 4% over last year's 8% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was up 240 basis points. This was primarily due to a benefit from transactional foreign exchange and a strong increase in merchandise margin, as well as lower supply chain costs versus last year. All three of our Canadian chains had great momentum and strong results for the third quarter.", "At TJX International, comps increased 1% in the third quarter. We are pleased that customer traffic was up and exceeded the comp sales growth. In Europe, we believe we continue to perform better than most major European retailers despite a very challenging retail environment.", "Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 220 basis points. This decrease was primarily due to costs related to opening our new distribution center in the UK, lower merchandise margin and expense deleverage on the 1% comp. In Australia, TK Maxx delivered another quarter of very strong sales.", "I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the third quarter, we bought back $350 million of TJX stock, retiring 4.9 million shares. We continue to expect to buy back $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of TJX stock this year. Further, through our dividend program, we've returned $197 million to shareholders in the third quarter, representing a 20% increase over last year's per-share dividend.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 guidance at the end of the call.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Scott. Now to some of our other business highlights in the third quarter. First, we opened our 4,000th store, a proud milestone for our company. This is a great reflection of our decades of operating expertise, both in the U.S. and internationally, and our disciplined approach to real estate.", "Second, we were thrilled with the openings of our first three HomeSense stores in the U.S. While still very early, initial customer response has been outstanding. Shoppers are loving the differentiated mix of home fashions at HomeSense, together with HomeGoods, we offer something for every room of the home.", "Next, we opened our first new TK Maxx stores in Australia. The response of Australian consumers to our great brands and values has been outstanding, and we like our long-term prospects in this region of the world.", "Lastly, we rolled out two major initiatives at TJX International. First, we are now offering our non-credit loyalty program, Treasure, in all of our stores in the UK and Ireland. Second, Click and Collect is now available at all of our TK Maxx locations in the UK. We are confident that both of these programs will help deepen customer engagement with TK Maxx.", "Now, I'll move to our fourth quarter opportunities. Most importantly, we are passionate about offering consumers tremendous off-price values on an eclectic mix of merchandise from around the world. We are in a great liquidity position to take advantage of the numerous opportunities we see and plan to buy seasonal product throughout December. We'll be flowing fresh merchandise to our stores and online multiple times a week, so shoppers can expect to see something new every time they visit. I am convinced that our stores will have the best gift-giving assortments out there this holiday season.", "Furthermore, every year, we work to improve how we transition our stores post holiday, which is another opportunity. Next, we feel great about our marketing campaigns, which recently launched. Once again, we're using our tri-branded campaign strategy in both the U.S. and Canada, which has been successful for us in prior years.", "In Europe, we are leveraging a unique holiday campaign across multiple geographies. All of our four major divisions will be actively marketing every week throughout the holiday season, with an integrated approach to engage shoppers through television, digital, social media and mobile. We also continue to grow and promote all of our loyalty programs. We believe they will encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping of our stores and online.", "Moving on, I'd like to recap why we believe consumers love shopping our retail banners. First and foremost, we offer excellent off-price values on a curated selection of merchandise from around the world in both apparel and non-apparel. Our assortments are constantly changing. This newness and freshness is an important part of the treasure hunt shopping experience and encourages more frequent visits.", "Further, we have been attracting more millennial customers, who are often on a tighter budget and looking to stretch their shopping dollars. Second, we are convinced that the touch-and-feel shopping experience is not going away. In our stores, consumers can choose from a wide variety of branded items across multiple categories in very little time. They can try the apparel on, select what they want and take their items home that same day. This all provides an enjoyable and efficient shopping experience.", "Next, our flexible store format and fast-turning inventory allows us to respond quickly to changing consumer trends. Our more than 1,000 buyers source from a universe of over 18,000 vendors globally to offer the best mix of fashion and brands for our customers.", "Lastly, we aim to locate our stores in convenient locations that are easy for consumers to access. In the U.S. and Canada, our stores are generally located in off-mall strip centers or on heavily trafficked popular commuting results, where shoppers may visit weekly or more.", "As to e-commerce, we view it as complementary to our very successful brick-and-mortar business and another way to drive incremental sales and traffic. Our key strategy is to differentiate our merchandise mix from our stores to encourage shopping across channels.", "Moving on to product availability. We see the marketplace loaded with quality, desirable brands. Our challenge is holding our buyers back so that we have liquidity to take advantage of opportunities that tend to become even better.

And now, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Paul Lejuez. Your line is open.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks guys. Any way you could quantify what you were seeing in the business overall, Marmaxx specifically prior to the unfavorable weather maybe having an impact and any quantification about how the fourth quarter has started? And just curious about regional differences throughout the quarter. Maybe help us understand how the weather impacted certain regions versus those that were not hurt by the less-than-seasonable weather out there? Thanks.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So, Paul, I'll just start. Overall, we believe that the hurricane and the weather impacts for the quarter, both from Marmaxx and TJX had approximately a 2% impact, or they would have been 2% higher had not been for both \u2013 those two factors.", "In terms of the weather, as the weather turned \u2013 and I'm speaking more toward Marmaxx at this point, as the weather turned, as we moved through October to the last part of it, we saw the comps increase at Marmaxx versus the trend we saw. September was a combination of both weather and hurricane and October, the first half of the month was a weather story. And then, I'll turn it over, we're not going to go into the comps by division at this point, but I'll let Ernie...", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, Paul. I would just say, I think, part of your question was prior to the hurricanes and the unseasonable weather, we were tracking better at the beginning of September, actually. So we had high hopes and then it got derailed with a lot of bad weather issue.", "I would say besides that, and we didn't talk about it as much in the script, we did have a couple of areas that was our own execution and I would say, it was really more because of a lack of the appropriate fashion content. And that really did not help us. So that is an opportunity that we have since dug into.", "We've certainly got the teams together to look at that and feel that those areas that hurt us in the third quarter are in better shape going into the fourth quarter. So that has been something certainly self-inflicted that we, in addition to the weather, have focused on.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Ernie, was it a fashion miss or was it more what you wanted to buy just wasn't available out there?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "No, it was absolutely a fashion miss, Paul. And it had nothing to do \u2013 this was really, on our own part, a selection issue, and it had nothing to do with availability out there. And that would apply to the three areas that I'm thinking about. All three were a fashion miss from our own execution.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "And is that already fixed? Or when do you expect it to be fixed?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "I would say it's expected to be fixed. They are not already fixed. They are kind of work-in-progress. But they have both \u2013 the underlying trends relative to the store, in both cases, have improved a little bit. So that's a good sign. And I would say two of them, I am feeling, will be well improved by the fourth quarter. The third one might take a little bit longer. But the....", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Good luck.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "The bulk of it will definitely be improved.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "All right, thanks. Good luck guys.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann. Your line is open.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to clarify on the Marmaxx merchandise margin, which you said was up \u2013 I think you said was up nicely at the same time that it sounds like AUR was down. And you called out some execution issues and a general shortfall for comp trends. So could you help square the favorable merchandise margin behavior with those headwinds to merchandise margin?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yes. I think that in terms, first is, I'll talk both on an absolute basis and versus guidance, Lindsay, in that throughout the \u2013 we ended up given that we're always we have a \u2013 always a considerable amount of open to buy in the quarter, like in the case, this case, the third quarter, for the third quarter, and we are able to buy, particularly in our mark-on, better than what we had guided to. So that was largely the uptick. In fact, the average ticket, although weighing on some of the overall costs for the business, was actually moderated a bit from what we originally guided to. So we had two pickups, the biggest, though, one, I would say, is in the mark-on that we bought better.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yes, Lindsay, I would also jump in. Here's the dynamic that happened a little in the third quarter. And as we talked about, we strategically flowed a little differently. One of the things we did is stay a little bit leaner in the third quarter on our cold-weather apparel, flowed it later in the quarter. With that, unfortunately, we might have given up a little bit of top-line sales.", "But when you give out the top-line sales there and flow it later into November, that oftentimes helps you with the margin, even though you've given up some sales. And that's one of the benefits of doing that. Having said that, I think we probably waited a little bit too long and gave up a little bit more sales than we like.", "Now the market environment that we're in, where a lot of the retail traffic is awful around us, it's going to probably create even more opportunities, which we certainly started taking advantage of in the third quarter, absolutely placed to our business model, that's why we're able to hold in the strong merchandise margin even when the sales flattened.", "And our expectation would be we'll continue to take advantage in the fourth quarter, especially in November here, in this loaded market, with retail traffic across the board being pretty slow, our guys are seeing a lot of tremendous (30:47). I think it's going to keep that mark-on going in a strong direction. So, just thought that's added color for you in terms of how that dynamic has taken place.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "And in terms of the Marmaxx overall margin, our entire miss from guidance was due to the hurricane and the deleverage on the low comp at Marmaxx which, again, was partially offset by the strong merchandise margin improvement we saw.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "And just to jump in on one last thing here. It's really the strength, we've talked about it many times over the years, it is the strength of our business model that allows us to be so nimble and react to situations where our sales have slowed down in a business like Marmaxx. So we're able to then improve on our liquidity, adjust and really make up some headway on the margin side of the business, which I don't think a lot of other retail concepts are able to do that as quickly as this concept is.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. Just a quick \u2013 thank you for that, a quick follow-up. The up 2% traffic you called out for Marmaxx, can you talk about how that compares with trends earlier this year?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Hi, Lindsay, this is Scott. We didn't really break out that detail. So not going to go into the comp transaction that we saw earlier in the year.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks anyway guys.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Lindsay, the only thing I would throw into that is our traffic was up in all regions, except for Florida, of the strong traffic increase. So that was encouraging as well.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Baker. Your line is open.", "Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. A couple questions. One, we understand, I think, (32:40) hurricanes and weather had an impact. But what about, in a competitive situation, the department stores hung in reasonably well this quarter and closed out the gap between TJX and an average fashion department store has narrowed and actually a little bit better than Marmaxx. So are you seeing the department stores be a little bit more promotional or a little more competitive?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Mike, I'll jump in on that. That, to us, has really been a nonissue. Again, if you look at the weather being half the puzzle here, I would say the other part would be our own execution internally. Again, some of it might have been the delay in our cold weather business and how we shipped those, but I really think the fashion component execution in a couple of our bigger areas is really more our own doing and more of what affected us than any external execution by any other retailer out there. We don't really see any indicators.", "And we look at metrics t try to find that and we see no sign of that. It's really more because we can kind of look at our \u2013 and dollar out and figure out where we've created our own issues and that seems to be the bulk of it, along with the weather being, certainly, a really significant part, obviously.", "Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. All right. And then if I could just sort of change directions and talk about the margins, a number of moving parts this year. Is it too early to think about next year or maybe just, more broadly, longer term margins? We've had a couple years of declines. At what point do you think the total company pre-tax margin starts to level off and even show some improvement on an annual basis?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Michael, I'll jump in. I think in \u2013 too early, we'll go in certainly more detail on the February call in terms of that, but we were not expecting margins at this point for next year to be flattening out. But I think we'll address what our expectations are longer term where, I think, we certainly would be more optimistic, as right now, the two major factors that are dragging on our business, well, there's three, we'll \u2013 I'll address two, and Ernie can address the third. One, is wages, although moderating as we move through the year, this year, the U.S. piece is still what we would have expected a slight moderation, a slight headwind next year. Up in Canada, in the last couple months, the Ontario Province has a very big increase of $11.60 up to about a 20% increase. So that will make our wage impact at this point slightly down, but close to the same level of a headwind as last year.", "The DC or supply chain costs, although moderating again in this fourth quarter, we're still going to see impact of that going forward. At least for next year, it's going to be up a bit lumpy as we're still building out to support the strong store growth that we have. One of the factors that has impacted us this year is the average retail and I'll let Ernie address that.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yes, we see that, Mike, moderating, as we go into the fourth quarter here. We've been talking about that before and, obviously, in the past, had hoped it would moderate a little bit sooner. This has \u2013 we also talked about is a bottom-up-driven dynamic, where our merchants really determine where the average ticket is going based on sales opportunities within their own areas.", "But as we look out, and we're getting visibility, obviously, as more of that's bought, fourth quarter specifically, the ticket is moderating. So we're feeling very good about that and that is, from an expense standpoint, and also from a ticket going out the door to help drive sales standpoint, it would be a healthy thing. So we're feeling good about that.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yes, going back to the overall guidance, we'll, again, go in the fourth quarter, we still expect it, we've used the word tick-up to be slightly higher than the plan we gave this year of the 5%. So no change on that at this moment, although there are always a lot of moving factors, I'd say, share-based compensation and tax rates, obviously, still up in the air. But overall, we do expect our plans to tick up from what this year's plans were.", "Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Yeah, that's very helpful color. Thank you. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Boss. Your line is open.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. On merchandise margins, so product availability, you talked about being plentiful from your comments. And it's interesting because department store inventories actually seem to be more balanced. I guess, can you talk about the margin opportunity if pricing is more rational going forward in the marketplace? And how much, if any, do you really actually rely on the department stores for product availability these days?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So Matthew, that's a great question and one \u2013 we talk about it strategically around here a lot. One of the dynamics that has created the department store relativity to lessen is because there was such a strong ecomm business in the world. That includes branded retailers vertically with their own sites, yes department stores with their own sites. And so what has happened in terms of availability, the brick-and-mortar got, rightfully so, they're all trying to lean up their brick-and-mortar. But now, there is more goods, as you can imagine, online.", "So in terms of availability, it's really, that's just been a shift for us. In terms of creating an umbrella of value, that shift is actually a little bit more visible online. So it creates an umbrella of what goods are being sold, that allows our consumers to really look into that more easily than ever before. So that whole dynamic, first of all, the amount of goods in the inventory, I believe, a lot of that is a reaction to Internet business because many manufacturers want to be able to supply an Internet business as well. But it's a little bit of left pocket, right pocket, which is probably one reason, as well as we're continually opening thousands of new vendors. We're up to 18,000 vendors today. And that clearly helps drive that. So a long-winded answer to your question, we will continue to think, yeah, there probably is some margin opportunity, given all of those dynamics.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Best of luck.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin. Your line is open.", "Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Good morning. Just a quick follow-up. If there's a way on the executional front, I don't know if you specifically quantified what impact do you think that had, you talked about weather, but on the execution front. And then I was just curious, you talked about the wage outlook. But given the announcement by one of the large discount retailers to bring their bottom of the scale up to $15 within three years, how does that affect what you'd think of as the wage trajectory the next few years?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So I'll start out on the wage. So we'll add no comment in terms of what other retailers are doing in terms of our adjustment. As I'd said, I think, at this point, we'll have a similar level of headwinds this year on wage next year, given the Canadian adjustment that I talked about on the earlier question. So that's about all, I think, we're going to talk about on the wage at this point.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "And quantifying on things, that's just not something we give out. We don't break down the misses like that or what the dollars or the percent of the business is.", "Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Other than, the only thing we think has been implied is that we had, the two points, and on top of that, what Ernie said, we gave up, we think we left additional business on the table.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Right.", "Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, I guess, maybe just regarding the recent pickup in the business. Is there any way to tell whether some of that is pent-up demand or early replenishment purchases following the impact of the storms?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "I would say on that, Daniel, the good news with the recent trend is it's widespread across the businesses. So it's not just the cold weather business, which I'd talked about before. That is not the only, by any means, businesses driving our increased trend that we're seeing. So we're seeing it across all the families of business, which is very encouraging. We start to go from here into our major gift-giving posture for holiday, which, obviously, we're excited about every year, we do, I think, a really good job as we get to fourth quarter in terms of going after gift-giving. It's a place that we, I think, have executed better year-after-year. And we've also done a better job in our marketing year-after-year.", "So our goal there is just get them in the store. And because we deliver a lot of impulse buying throughout the store, we don't go after any one category anymore disproportionally than we do the year before, unless it's a hot trending category. So I would say the trends that we're seeing over the last couple weeks would bode well for the Christmas holiday.", "Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Another way to talk on the sales is that, to address the pent-up demand is that the raw number is good. And it's also better than what we had planned, which we do take into consideration at the beginning of a month what our plans are going to be for the next month. So I can't go into any more level of detail.", "Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Understood. Okay. Thanks very much.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad. Your line is open.", "Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the marketplace with brands doing some of their own, doing clearance online through their own websites and retailers, how that affects your business. Feels like that something's been going on for a couple of years, but maybe now some of these brands are going to realize that you can't clear effectively an online channel and maintain your full-price umbrella. Is that something you're seeing? Are you seeing that affect your business in any way? How do you think about that dynamic in context of the role of T.J. Maxx in the broader kind of fashion apparel marketplace? Thanks.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Great question, Omar. We're seeing that it's really supplemental to what's available in the market. It's not a market pie taker from us. It actually creates additional opportunities and we actually believe that's one of the pockets of business because liquidating goods that way for some retailers online is just, it's way more tedious than it is for them to sell the goods to somebody like us where we can ship it and sell it invisibly across 2,200 stores.", "And they get to hang with other brands in a very, how would I call it, conducive atmosphere that's actually a benefit to them in terms of their image and their brand. So we have been finding, and I think that's the nature of some of the increased availability is that more and more of those guys are realizing, the brands are realizing that they'd be better off liquidating with us than trying to liquidate on their own off their websites. So does that make sense?", "Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC", "Yeah. That's helpful, Ernie. Thank you. And then I just also wanted to ask, you guys often display kind of the flexibility of the business model and the buying, keeping that open-to-buy open as late as possible. Was that an issue this quarter with the lack of the right fashion content? Was it somewhere where the kind of the flexible model broke down? Or is it just some decisions that were made that shouldn't have been?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. So I wish, believe me, I wish I could say yes to the first way you asked that, that it was a process breakdown and not available in the market. But in these couple of cases, it was absolutely a strategy and a fashion execution entirely under our control and had nothing really to do with the execution of the model. It was really a fashion misstep of our own doing. I wish I could answer you the other way. I would rather. Unfortunately, I can't. I would say this is just our own execution or lack thereof.", "Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC", "Understood. Thanks, guys.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Marni Shapiro. Your line is open.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Hey, everybody. Best of luck with the holiday season by the way.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you, Marni.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Thanks. Can you talk a little bit you focused a little bit on AUR. But is anything impacting AUR as far as mix shift in the stores for the third quarter and going into the fourth quarter? Or is this a markdown conversation? If you could just clarify that as well because I know it's been a conversation all year that you were trying to lower some of your prices. So I'm curious, just for the third quarter and the fourth quarter, what the story is.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. I think, Marni, it's a combination of a lot of things, but one of them being a mix issue, some of the departments that we are going after happen to be high-ticket. And it doesn't mean that we were forcing going after those. That's just the way it was working out, that those departments were high-ticket. Some of the departments themselves have their tickets going up. And what was \u2013 that was in a department last year.", "So in a couple departments, we evidently hit the bottom last year. And so we're seeing an improvement in like-for-like departments. But believe me, part of it is the mix of departments. We're going up in some departments that are a greater percentage that happen to be higher ticket.", "I do believe that the nature of the availability of goods and some better goods in the market is also creating our ticket going up. And that is happening in numerous families of business where we're finding some better branded goods to a greater degree than we would have had last year. And as that flows in, that also is, I think, contributing to our average ticket moderating for the fourth quarter. The good news is we've got visibility to it and we can see that it's heading that way over the next 30, 45 days. So...", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "And I think that's on the apparel side for the most part, correct?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "It is. It is in the apparel side for the most part. Yeah.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "And men's and women's?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Well, it varies by department in men's and women's. But mostly \u2013 I think we'll just leave it at mostly apparel.", "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker", "Excellent. Congratulations. Best of luck for the holidays.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you, Marni.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow. Your line is open.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. I guess, Scott, my question for you was going to be \u2013 sorry, Ernie, I'll start with you. The fashion miss, I understand and appreciate you probably don't want to get into too much detail, but could you help us with maybe what category it was in? Did you buy too shallow? Did you buy too deep? Just trying to understand the dynamic there.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So I can't tell you what category it's in. And by the way, it was \u2013 it's in a few categories. It's not just one. And it wasn't about deep. It was about \u2013 it's when fashion can be the wrong fashion, or it can be too much fashion, the look itself can be too much fashion. And then if you have too much of that, and that applied to a couple of areas. And so, I can't tell you the areas, but it was really about that. So the goods themselves were too much on the edge and too great a proportion of the areas. Do you know what it means, like too big a proportion of the departments?", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it, got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then, just Scott, a quick follow-up to a comment you made earlier about not really \u2013 you shouldn't really expect margins to flatten out next year. I assume you're talking about a 52-week to 52-week basis, (50:05) margin, is that correct?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Everything I was \u2013 everything I said was adjusting for the $0.11 out and then taking out and adjusting at the benefit we got \u2013 the 20 basis points benefit we got on 53-week versus 52-week.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger. Your line is open.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you so much. Scott, I wanted to ask about inventory. I'm wondering if you can help me close the gap between the 4% decline that you talked about in inventory, excluding in-transit, e-commerce. I think, you said that was on a per-store basis. That 4% decline versus what we're seeing on the balance sheet, it looks like about a 7.8% increase in total inventories. So, can you just help us sort of understand how to get from the plus 7.8% to the minus 4%?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yes. So, yes, you're exactly right. I'll just take a one minor step, is, on a constant currency basis, it would still be the same delta, 7% on the balance sheet versus the second quarter where we'd be on a constant currency minus one. So, that 8%, and that's why we did the excluding, when you did on a per-store basis, where the variance between the second and the third quarter is a bit less than \u2013 it's 2% or slightly less, where we're down 6% versus down 4% on a per store. It's entirely \u2013 virtually entirely due to the change just in in-transit.", "So, the in-transit was up significantly in the end of the third quarter versus being down in the second quarter. So \u2013 and the definition of the in-transit is, those are goods that are arriving, that are not booked in, but are arriving basically within the week into your DC. So, a lot of fresh goods coming into the DCs at the end of the third quarter, obviously, flowing out to the stores right now. So, entirely due to the in-transit inventory and that's why, I think, the better metric is looking at the all-in, excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, on a per-store basis.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks so much, Scott.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Oliver Chen. Your line is open.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I was curious about the nature of the opportunities in apparel. What's the framework for which ones will be easier and quicker to course correct versus longer-term in nature?", "And then, another topic was just the topic of customer engagement and loyalty. What's your vision for where the opportunities are here and how you want to pursue it in a way that's unique to you and the off-price business model? Just curious about where you see that going over time and what customers want and how you balance engagement versus value versus delivering what customers want with those programs? Thank you.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Okay, great. Oliver, on the apparel areas, in terms of course correcting, again, the other advantage to our business model is nothing takes very long, and the areas that are of the few areas we're talking about, two out of the three are fairly flexible and close order. We buy so much so soon and close in, in those areas. And then, even the third one, relatively speaking, might take an extra month or two. But nothing as long, like nothing will drag into pass the fourth quarter at all.", "I think, most of it gets corrected in over the next 30 days, actually. So, that's just the nature of the way we buy. It's another advantage when we stub our toe, we are able to fix things pretty quickly. And, as I said, there isn't even one of them, even the other one I'm thinking about could take an extra 30 days beyond that. But two out of the three are being fixed as we speak and where we will see improvements on them over the next few weeks. So, we're feeling really good about that.", "And that would apply, by the way, if it wasn't just apparel, even in our \u2013 some of our accessories or hardline business or home area, we can generally react and fix execution issues pretty close in. So, it's really not just an apparel thing.", "Loyalty has been, obviously, we had it in the script, that's been a very positive program, which we have been pushing in every division. And even in the divisions where we don't have the hard credit card, our soft rewards programs there have been growing aggressively.", "And our customer growth in the loyalty is actually up significantly this year. We'll continue to be pleased with the metrics, by the way, that \u2013 we look at the metrics associated with our U.S. credit card program. Loyalty will be going on our apps at varying times over the next year, which is going to be interesting, because many customers have been asking about that.", "We've been in the mobile space, really trying to institute a global mobile app roadmap. And we currently have mobile apps for Maxx, HomeGoods and STP, where, as you know, from all of those retailers around us, whether it's coffee shops or traditional retailers, the ability to interact and connect mobile marketing to reach consumers is continuing to become greater an importance as we move forward.", "So, we are putting a strong push on that in every one of our divisions. But we're really trying to get the loyalty program on our apps over the next year that we have in place because we think that will be our next surge that we can really look forward to in driving our loyalty programs.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, I'd just add a little, Oliver, that as Ernie said, the loyalty program or the credit card program in the United States is very healthy that we offer to Marmaxx, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post. We started in the third quarter a loyalty program in the UK, early days, but have added hundreds of thousands of people signing up for that. So, too early to talk about the results, but, I think, it's something that will benefit us as we go forward to the fourth quarter and beyond. And we feel good about the overall marketing campaigns, both for digital and TV on the broadcast and what we're doing in digital in the fourth quarter across-the-board.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "And Ernie and Scott, you've always done a great job at gifting, like, every year I've been very impressed. So, do you have any rough thoughts on what will be incremental this year versus last? That's our last question. I'm just curious about these catalysts, because I'm sure you're going to do a really good job as well, but I'm curious about what might be different.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "When you talk, Oliver, in terms of different gifting, are you talking about impact at the store level or...?", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yeah, in terms of what you're most encouraged about as you look to fourth quarter and what we should focus on as key catalysts in addition to what sounds like impactful marketing programs across social, the statement around gifting or other ideas, initiatives that are different versus last year?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. So, we \u2013 it's one of the areas I am most proud of our teams on, because they work at our holiday gift-giving in an extremely cohesive team approach. So, it's from our merchants, our supply chain and our marketing team and the field executives \u2013 our store guys are phenomenal about this.", "So, what happens is, the merchants, I would say, one of the big pushes on their end is to deliver freshness even later into December, which we do every year better so, and we've done it the last December, and it's very successful. That applies to Marmaxx, HomeGoods, Europe, Canada, every division has a mission to flow freshness later.", "Secondly, internal execution, signing packages, customer service, turning customers through the registers and is expedient a format as possible, also a big push for us. Thirdly, our logistics supply chain, we are all over and, I think, we've talked about this at various investor meetings; we have improved on our ability with our supply chain to process goods and get them from the vendor to the stores significantly faster than we ever had before.", "So, what that has allowed us to do is, when we keep some of the \u2013 keep some of our open buy for the holiday gift-giving open and there's great gift-giving buys in the marketplace, we can actually get them in pre-Christmas for that late shipping better than we have ever been able to do it before.", "And the marketing, what I'm pleased about, and this is also for holiday gift-giving, I guess, you would call this incremental like you call that, Oliver, is, we continue \u2013 we're going to obvious continue to emphasize our standout values. But we are \u2013 we stay the course. We stay the course on going after diverse customer base. We don't try to pigeonhole and go too narrow.", "Every format, we're going to try to talk about the many ways that we're going to provide value. We talk about our model in the marketing, which is to get away from a less chaotic shopping experience and have authentic value. And you know indirectly in all of our marketing will be basically explaining that we don't do a high-low in our business and that we're going to provide a true value to consumers. So, three out of the four big business, I know, have a campaign that will continue to educate consumers.", "And then, lastly, one thing I'm very happy about is, we're going to continue to, obviously, spend a lot more in digital, which are all, yes, the younger audiences, but more people in general are watching digital and there's more impact there. But we're pleased because a lot of our growth in new customers has been with younger customers under the age of 34. So, a lot of those things are in play for fourth quarter in the gift-giving time period, and we're thinking we have the guns loaded, so to speak.", "Operator", "And, thank you. At this time, I'd like to now turn it back to our hosts for closing remarks.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Okay. We would like to thank all of you for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our year-end earnings call in February.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, February 28, 2018.", "I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Brandon. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.", "Debra McConnell - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you, Ernie, and good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 28, 2017.", "Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies, Inc.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are posted on our website, TJX.com in the Investors section.", "Thank you. And now, I'll turn it back over to Ernie.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our strong finish to 2017. Consolidated comp store sales in the fourth quarter grew 4%, above our plan and over a 3% increase last year.", "In addition, each of our four major divisions posted comp growth of 3% or higher in the fourth quarter. We also saw strength in both our apparel and home businesses. Once again, customer traffic was up overall, and it was the primary driver of our comp sales increases at each of our four major divisions. Our great brands, differentiated merchandise mix and excellent values continue to resonate with consumers across all of our geographies.", "Adjusted earnings per share were also above our expectations. For the full year, net sales increased 8% to over $35 billion. As pleased as we are about achieving this important milestone for our company, we still see plenty of opportunities to continue our global growth.", "Consolidated comp store sales were up 2% over last year's strong 5% growth. The year 2017 marks the 22nd consecutive year of comp sales growth for TJX. We believe our long track record of consistent growth speaks to the power of our flexible business model, our decades of off-price experience and the collective knowledge across our highly-integrated global organization.", "We are convinced that we continued to grow our market share again in 2017 in an uncertain retail environment. Comp sales and customer traffic increased at each of our four major divisions. And for the full year, adjusted earnings per share were also above our plan.", "Looking ahead, 2018 is off to a solid start, and we see a long runway for continued successful growth ahead. We see plentiful opportunities in the marketplace for major brands and high-quality merchandise. In addition, we are pursuing numerous initiatives to keep driving sales and customer traffic. We are confident that we have the right strategies in place to grow TJX for today, and the future, around the globe.", "Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our fourth quarter and full year numbers. Scott?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. Again, fourth quarter consolidated comp store sales on a 13-week basis grew a strong 4%, which was over a 3% increase last year and above our plan. We are very pleased with our customer traffic increases across our four major divisions.", "As a reminder, our comp store sales exclude the growth from e-commerce. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.37. As we detailed in today's press release, fourth quarter EPS includes a $0.17 net benefit from tax reform, a benefit of approximately $0.11 from the extra week in the fourth quarter and a $0.10 Sierra Trading Post impairment charge. Ernie will talk more about STP in a moment.", "Excluding these items, adjusted earnings per share were $1.19, above our plan and a 16% increase over last year's $1.03. The combination of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange benefited EPS growth by 2% and the change in accounting rules for share-based compensation benefited EPS by another 1%. As expected, wage increases negatively impacted EPS growth by about 1%.", "At the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were up 4% on a constant currency basis versus a 4% decrease in the prior year. We begin fiscal 2019 well-positioned to flow fresh spring fashions to our stores.", "Now, to recap our fourth quarter performance by division, Marmaxx comps increased 3%, over a 3% increase last year and were driven by customer traffic. As we expected, average ticket decreased, but moderated versus the third quarter. Adjusted 13-week segment profit margin, excluding the Sierra Trading Post impairment charge, decreased 10 basis points. We are very pleased with Marmaxx's strong finish to the year.", "HomeGoods grew 3% over last year's 5% increase. Adjusted 13-week segment profit margin was down 190 basis points. This was primarily due to a decline in merchandise margin, as well as investments to support our growth. For the year, HomeGoods exceeded our plan on the top and bottom line, surpassed $5 billion in sales and delivered strong increases in comp sales and traffic. Further, we opened over 90 stores, including the launch of our new Homesense chain.", "TJX Canada delivered a terrific quarter, with comps increasing 7% over last year's 4% increase. Adjusted 13-week segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was up 90 basis points. This is primarily due to expense leverage on the 7% comp. We are thrilled that all three Canadian chains had outstanding years and I'm convinced that they increased their market share.", "At TJX International, comps increased 3% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted 13-week segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 50 basis points. This was primarily due to costs related to the opening of our new distribution center in the UK. We are very pleased that Europe ended 2017 with its strongest quarter of the year, exceeding our top and bottom-line plans for this division. Further, Australia continued its excellent performance. We are convinced that TJX International is gaining market share.", "Now, to our full-year consolidated fiscal 2018 results. On a 52-week basis, consolidated comp store sales grew 2% over last year's strong 5% increase. Similar to the fourth quarter, overall customer traffic was up and the primary driver of the comp increases at each of our four major divisions. Although still a relatively small part of our business, overall e-commerce sales grew significantly for the full year.", "Diluted earnings per share were $4.04 versus last years $3.46. Full year EPS includes the same adjustments as the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings per share were $3.85, above our plan and a 9% increase over last year's $3.53. Additionally, the change in accounting rules for share-based compensation benefited EPS growth by 2%, and the combination in foreign currency and transactional FX benefited EPS growth by another 1%. As we expected, wage increases negatively impacted EPS growth by about 2%. So full-year merchandise margin remained strong on top of a significant increase last year, which underscores the power of our flexible model.", "I'll finish with our financial strength and shareholder distributions. Our business continues to generate excellent cash flows and strong financial returns. In fiscal 2018, free cash flow was $2 billion. We take a disciplined approach to capital allocation and our ROIC remains one of the highest we have seen in retail. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs, while simultaneously reinvesting in the business for the near and long-term. In fiscal 2018, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through these programs.", "Now, let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our first quarter and full year fiscal 2019 guidance at the end of the call.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Scott. First, I'll cover some 2017 highlights. Again, we are very pleased with our strong holiday season and fourth quarter results. We surpassed $10 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, a company record. We are very happy with the consistency of comp sales across all divisions around the world. Again, customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp sales increases at all of our four major divisions. We attribute this to our great brands, global mix of merchandise and excellent values, combined with our effective marketing.", "I was particularly pleased with the sequential improvement we saw at Marmaxx from the third quarter. In terms of the execution issues in certain categories that we discussed on our last earnings call, I'm pleased with the improvements we made during the quarter. As we continue to work on these areas, we've seen even further improvement as we started the year. Further, we become better all the time at transitioning our stores after the holidays, shipping merchandise selections frequently and keeping our stores fresh and compelling for customers every time they shop.", "Now to our full year highlights. Again, we exceeded $35 billion in annual sales. We also are proud to open our 4,000th store in 2017. Further, in a year when many other retailers closed stores, we opened more than 250 stores. Once again, we saw growth in new customers across all of our divisions. We were especially pleased with the increases we continued to see among millennial shoppers, which is promising for our future.", "We successfully launched Homesense, our second home concept in the U.S. Customer response to Homesense has been terrific. In Australia, our business delivered outstanding top-line performance and the openings of our first new TK Maxx stores in that country were very, very strong. In Europe, while the retail environment was challenging in 2017, we held up better than most other large retailers and are convinced that we gained additional market share.", "Next, to support our future growth plans around the world, we continue to make strategic investments in our stores, supply chain and systems to support our future growth. I also want to emphasize that we are always examining ways to operate more efficiently. In 2017, we worked diligently to identify areas of the business where we believe we can reduce costs over the long-term. We are currently finalizing our plans to make investments in these initiatives this year that we believe will benefit us next year and beyond.", "Before I move on, I'll spend a moment on Sierra Trading Post. The impairment charge we announced today reflects lower projected revenue growth rates for this business. Over the past couple of years, we have made significant changes to support the long-term health of the business. We shifted from heavy promotions to everyday value, relocated the business to our home office in Framingham to infuse the organization with high potential talent and grew the store base to leverage our extensive brick-and-mortar expertise.", "We are confident these are the right changes for the long-term. And we saw improvement in the top-line both online and in stores in the back half of 2017. We are convinced that Sierra Trading Post is now well-positioned for successful growth going forward. Now, I want to spend a moment on product availability and our confidence in always having access to great-quality branded merchandise. Availability has never been an issue for TJX in over our 41-year history. Throughout 2017, overall availability of inventory from top vendors was as good as it has ever been.", "Further, we have more best friends on order than we did at this time last year. These are some of the key reasons for our confidence. First, over four decades, we have established some of the best mutually-beneficial vendor relationships in retail. Our buyers are in constant contact with vendors in order to strengthen existing relationships, find more way to do business with them and open more vendor doors. We have significantly expanded our vendor universe and now source from over 20,000 vendors in more than 100 countries.", "Next, we offer vendors an excellent way to grow their business, with over 4,000 stores around the world and growing. Our global presence provides vendors access to new markets that they would not have had with a U.S.-only retailer. Further, we can offers brands one of the most efficient and discrete avenues for clearing inventory. We do not advertise brand names in our marketing. Our in-store inventory turns rapidly. And individual brands can blend into our racks with tens of thousands of items in each store. Finally, we are very flexible in our vendor dealings and buy merchandise in many different ways. Our buyers can purchase an extremely wide assortment of items, styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large.", "Next, I'll recap our outlook for the continued successful growth of our four major divisions. First, at Marmaxx, we see plenty of opportunities to continue growing our customer base and capture additional market share. Giving us confidence is Marmaxx's continued comp sales and traffic increases in both strong and weak retail environments and despite the growth of e-commerce in general. Further, we are laser-focused on execution and offering the right mix of fashion and brands to our shoppers.", "To keep driving customer traffic, we have strategic marketing initiatives underway, including greater TV exposure. I am also excited about the long-term potential of our TJX Rewards loyalty program. As always, our merchandise and values are the most important factors. We offer an eclectic, ever-changing mix of compelling branded assortments at excellent values every day.", "Next, at HomeGoods and Homesense in the U.S, we see an enormous opportunity for growth. We believe we are significantly underpenetrated in the total U.S. home market and see plenty of white space across the country for both chains.", "Today, we are introducing a long-term store target for Homesense in the U.S. of 400 stores. We also see excellent long-term potential in the home fashion space across our other geographies.", "At TJX Canada, we are extremely proud to have built this division into the largest off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in Canada, by far. Going forward, we see additional opportunities for expansion into rural communities and locating stores closer to one another.", "We expect to exceed our most recent long-term target for store growth of 500 stores soon. Today, we are increasing our estimate for this division to grow to 600 stores over the long term. We are confident that our excellent merchandise and values will continue to resonate with Canadian shoppers.", "At TJX International, we are encouraged by the improvement we see in our European business and consumer environment in mainland Europe. We remain the only major off-price retailer in Europe and believe we are well-positioned to achieve our long-term growth plans.", "In Australia, shoppers are loving TK Maxx and we plan to bring TK Maxx to even more consumers in Australia this year. Long-term, we see the potential to develop TK Maxx in Australia similar to the way we grew TJX Canada. TJX International added a very exciting assortment of new brands last year and continues to offer consumers great values.", "Now to e-commerce, while it represents just a small piece of our overall sales, we see it as an important complement to our brick-and-mortar business. Our strategy is to differentiate our online merchandise mix to drive incremental sales, and that is what we have been seeing. It also allows us to work with vendors in more ways, further strengthening our relationships.", "Lastly, our customers love the convenience of making returns in-store. We also love that this prompts another shopping visit, and an additional way for online customers to discover our great brands and values.", "Underscoring our confidence in our growth are the key advantages that we believe differentiate us. We have built the global infrastructure and supply chain to specifically support our highly-integrated global business model. Our management teams have decades of off-price operating experience in the U.S. and internationally, which allows us to capitalize on our global presence. We have a world-class buying organization of more than 1,000 associates.", "Further, in an environment where e-commerce, in general, is growing, we are convinced that our amazing prices and exciting and an engaging in-store experience is a tremendous draw for shoppers. We offer consumers the ability to see, touch and feel the merchandise and in the case of apparel, try it on and then take it home that same day. With us, they can shop for a wide variety of brands and thousands of items under one roof in an easy-to-shop simple store layout and be inspired. Further, we have been building customers' trust for four decades.", "Lastly, we operate one of the most flexible retail models in the world. This allows us to target a wide variety of shoppers across different geographies and demographics and react rapidly to changing market trends. We believe all these elements make TJX's business extremely difficult to replicate.", "Now, before I wrap up, I want to take a moment to discuss tax reform and how we plan to utilize the cash benefit related to the tax changes. We are pleased to be making incremental investments in our associates, our communities and shareholder distributions. At every division worldwide, we are giving a one-time discretionary bonus to our eligible non-bonus plan associates. We are also making an incremental contribution to our defined contribution retirement plans around the world. Further, in the U.S., we are rolling out paid parental leave and enhancing vacation time for certain associates.", "Next, we plan to meaningfully increase our charitable giving through our contributions made to our foundations this year. In addition, we are planning a significant increase in our shareholder distributions in 2018, both through our dividend and share buyback programs.", "Lastly, we will continue to reinvest in the business, including store growth, technology, training our associates, and upgrades to the shopping experience for customers. The tax reform benefit will allow us to move forward some of the spending on investments we planned for our business anyway. We are pleased to be in a position of doing all of this while continuing to deliver great value to our customers.", "In closing, we feel great about our momentum and solid start to the year. We remain laser-focused on our major growth initiatives to drive customer traffic and comp sales and expand our store base globally, in order to gain even greater market share. In 2018, we are confident that we will achieve our plans for comp sales growth and earnings per share.", "As always, our entire management team will strive to surpass our goals. We are excited about the future of TJX and look forward to continuing our successful growth, both in the U.S. and internationally.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Ernie. Now to fiscal 2019 guidance, beginning with the full year, for modeling purposes, I'll remind you that fiscal 2019 is a 52-week year compared to fiscal 2018, which was a 53-week year. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal 2019 earnings per share to be in the range of $4.73 to $4.83 versus the prior year's $4.04. Excluding an expected benefit of $0.73 to $0.75 from items related to tax reform, we're planning adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4 to $4.08. This would be up 4% to 6% versus the adjusted $3.85 in fiscal 2018.", "Similar to recent years, there a couple of factors impacting our expected earnings per share growth in fiscal 2019. First, we anticipate that wage increases will have a negative impact to fiscal 2019 EPS growth of about 2%, similar to last year.

Thanks, and we will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session And our first question is from Omar Saad. Your line is open.", "Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC", "Thanks for taking my question. It's great to see you guys rebounded the way you have in the holiday quarter. I wanted to ask my one question on the interplay between inventory and comp. Obviously, the comp trends really rebounded, but maybe you could help us understand how you're feeling about inventory levels, especially given the fact that it seems like gross margins came in a little bit lighter than expectations, even with the extra week kind of helping spread out the occupancy expense. Maybe you could help us understand where you are in inventory and gross margin perspective and the relation to sales. Thanks.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "It's a multi-faceted question. So let me first just talk a bit about the merchandise margin. I assume, Omar, you're referring to the fourth quarter?", "Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC", "Yeah.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "On the gross profit.", "Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC", "Yeah.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Okay. So the fourth quarter, try not to be too long-winded on this one, but the merchandise margin was down in the fourth quarter and it was down primarily due to freight and markdowns, which were where HomeGoods, that we had some capacity constraints due to higher freight costs. And these constraints were unanticipated in the quarter and resulted in a larger impact on HomeGoods than our other divisions due to the size and nature of the product we carry at HomeGoods.", "This lack of capacity that we had in the freight arena, which resulted in some delays at the ports, causing our product to arrive at the stores a bit later than we had anticipated. And at HomeGoods, where we deliver the product on a just-in-time basis, probably more than at any other division, this delay impacted sales and required additional markdowns, especially in some of our gift-giving categories.", "At this point, we think the markdowns are largely behind us. They spilled a little over into the first quarter. But that's contemplated in our plans at this point in time. So we had some freight costs as well at Marmaxx. So, yeah, I think the key here would be that this was \u2013 and maybe Ernie can comment, that really not due to any executional issues.", "And before I just turn it over, I would say that we felt good \u2013 we're planning significant increases in our merchandise margin next year. And on a quarterly basis, it's the first time our merchandise margin was down in the last eight quarters. And, again, if I go back to 2003, we've had 15 of the last 16 years where our merchandise margin has been up and the only year it was down was fiscal 2012, I believe, and it was 8 basis points. And I'll let Ernie talk in terms of the mix and everything.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Omar, exactly, as Scott said, really got hit with the markdowns. And by the way, probably a little bit of a sales impact from these later deliveries, which were not really due to merchant execution. It was really more of the logistics-oriented situation with freight and trucking and movement of freight.", "I guess, looking forward, here's the good news, is we love the position. We're starting to get the flow back and the timeliness back to where we like it. And HomeGoods is in great liquidity position and open-to-buy position as we flow into the first quarter here.", "As Scott said, we did get hit with some as we began the first quarter with some markdowns still impacting us from some of those late deliveries, unfortunately. But for the most part, I'd say it's largely past us. So we're feeling good about going forward.", "Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson. Your line is open.", "Lorraine Corrine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrll Lynch", "Thank you. Scott, as you look at the cost structure, understanding that some of your competitors have raised their minimum wages, is this something that you're contemplating in the guidance, some incremental pressure, maybe on top of the minimum wage increase in Canada and some of the other states? And then also, as you look at your cost structure longer-term, are there areas of opportunity to reduce that leverage point, if you need to offset these higher costs?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So talk a bit about just the facts. So a couple months ago, we would have thought our wage increases were going to still increase, but we'd have less deleverage on us. And we had called out about a 1% decrease or about 10 basis points. Now it's still a 2% decrease, as I just talked about earlier in the prepared remarks. Again, the big change from a couple months ago was Canada has the large increases in Ontario and those increases were also added to, because we had just recently announcements that British Columbia is also increasing their wages.", "We have all the wage increases built in, in the United States and in Europe that we are aware of, in terms of pending or likely increases. In terms of the cost aspect of it, I would say in terms of the deleverage point, we are working on cost initiatives, I wouldn't say to lower our leverage point, but at least try to keep it where it is. But, again, that's a little hard to answer your question, since we don't know what the wage increases are going to be at this point.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, and, Lorraine, I would also jump in a few other pieces of color on this. We get constant feedback from our field, in terms of the retention and turnover rates out there. And we've been feeling like we're in a very good position of recent and we've touched base pretty frequently on that. You have a bunch of dynamic going on. We keep an eye on it, by the way. We will consistently monitor this, as it goes forward.", "We also have about a quarter of our stores where we are paying $11 already. So we did not want to or feel like, based on our lack of challenge hiring quality people, we did not want to overreact to what's going on out there, probably going to take it more market-by-market. And so again, we're feeling pretty comfortable about the position we're in. But we will monitor as we move forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Simeon Siegel. Your line is open.", "Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC", "Thanks, good morning, and congrats on the strong end to the year. Ernie, to your point about the vendor strengths, and I guess the supply breadth you had mentioned, has the concentration of your top vendors this year changed at all versus the prior years? And then, maybe, Scott, any view on just the long-term EBIT margin profile for Marmaxx and HomeGoods? Thanks.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, Simeon. No, effectively the concentration on our top vendors, and we looked at this in-depth every quarter, is effectively very similar to last year, nothing materially different. We have shifts. So some vendors one year, we will do more. You could have a vendor that was in the top, that was, say, our 20th biggest vendor, and he could move down to 40th, but somebody else then moves up to 20.", "We could have shifts within it, number eight goes to number 12, number 12 the year before becomes number six. But I would say the bulk of the big brands that were the big brands last year, that a lot of the big brands of the same big brands. We have the fortunate ability with all the availability in the market we've had the ability to broaden our brands. And, as you know, when we give you those dollar bonds, it's not just about comp sales. Of $1 billion to $2 billion a year, we're doing a lot of that is giving us additional vendors; may not be in the top 20, but it's allowing us more doors open that we can go to in certain categories throughout the year. So we love those dynamics, actually.", "Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC", "Okay, thanks. And then anything, just the right way to think about the way you're viewing the EBIT margin profiles for Marmaxx and HomeGoods, longer-term?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "No, I would say we are not, at this point, going to give guidance to past the fiscal 2019 at this point. So I would say, at this point, similar to this year.", "Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC", "Great, thanks. Best of luck for the year.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Lejuez. Your line is open.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey, thanks, guys. Just a little bit more color, if you can give it, on merch margin, maybe talk about merch margin by segment in the fourth quarter. Also curious as you think about the merch margin, your guidance for merch margin to be up. And F2018, are there any particular segments where you're looking for more strength versus others, if you can just touch on the merch margin issue? Thanks.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Again, I think it's what I said before. Going back to HomeGoods, again, the biggest miss in the fourth quarter versus LY and plan, which was really miss from plan, was with HomeGoods, on the merch margin.", "Again, it was the freight and related markdowns, so that was by far the related mix. We also did have some of those, again, same related costs in terms of the freight at Marmaxx and really not much to speak of on anything with Canada, International, in terms of from a TY, LY, again. And then next year, I think, we feel good about, as we said, across the board, merchandise margin at all the divisions.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Got it.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yes. Paul, we like the sit well, the dynamics of what's going on in the market, in terms of a lot of really strong brands and this includes Europe and Canada as well as the U.S., have had as good as an availability level as we've ever seen and our liquidity position is healthy.", "So we're feeling the opportunity on our merchandise margin should be pretty good this year to continue on the same path of doing this pretty good job. I don't want to overcommit to what there is, but there is certainly a healthy availability that should help us achieve our merchandise margin plans in FY 2019.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Got you. Are you seeing any pickup in product availability from online retailers, like online-only retailers? Has that channel become a significant source of merchandise and supply for you guys? And how do the merch margins tend to be in that channel versus your historical vendor base?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yes, that, actually, it's a great question. It has created more surplus out there. It's another avenue. So even though brick-and-mortar department store volume has come down and maybe that has subsided, the world of e-commerce has created more availability. And you're spot on. And the answer would be yes. Yeah.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "And how about the merch margin in that segment?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Very competitive. Yeah.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great, thanks, guys.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "It's fresh goods. The goods are typically boxed and fresh.", "Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thank you and good luck.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger. Your line is open.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you so much. Good morning. I wanted to just ask about the HomeGoods margin. I understand there were some things that happened in the fourth quarter that caused particular pressure, but looking back to the second quarter, I think the operating margin at HomeGoods was down about 80 basis points. In the third quarter, it was down about 60 basis points.", "So I'm wondering if there is just a sort of a natural settling of the HomeGoods margin at a slightly lower level, or if perhaps maybe there's just been an ongoing creep higher in freight and distribution costs that are weighing on the division. I'm just trying to understand when we might be able to see that level out and what your future expectation is for that division's margin.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So you actually nailed it on a few of the items. Freight, it's built into our plans, but I would say the freight cost for this year on the go-forward year, it's certainly a factor in next year's deleverage. Not that much different on the whole year, though, for fiscal 2019 as it is for 2018, but it is a continued deleverage point.", "The other points really relate to the investments, as we talked about, in the almost 200 stores that we've added between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. And the need to pull forward and bring supply chain in future DCs cost. That, in addition to just the pressure that you've heard us talk about, whether it's at Marmaxx and some of the other divisions of the sheer number of openings of new stores and with Homesense, had very productive return on investments, but at a lower return, will naturally add to the overall deleverage.", "So I would say the deleverage points that we have for new stores and supply chain, is similar to last year. And we're planning it within 10 basis points of how we planned fiscal 2018, we're planning fiscal 2019. So, yes, I think that's the case. And I think the deleverage, we're not giving guidance, but you will see continued pressure when you go past next year.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "But again, we feel great about the growth, the cash flow, the returns. It's a business that will have deleverage, but will still grow the operating income significantly for that division. I don't know, Ernie, if you'd add any, in terms of, again?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "I think you covered it.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Scott, could I just ask a clarification on the freight cost? It sounded like, in the fourth quarter, there were some specific capacity constraints. I'm wondering, do you contract out an estimated capacity or is it the nature of off-price that the capacity is perhaps unknowable and so you avail yourself of the spot market a little bit more? We're just wondering how you manage your aggregate freight costs between contracting versus the spot rates?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "I'd have to get back to you on the detail. I would say that most of the freight costs that we saw were pretty much unanticipated. So it's a combination of a lot of things, I think, are transpiring in the world of carrier consolidation, a bit on driver shortages that were...", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Driver shortages were a big part. Yeah.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "A little more, I think, pronounced in the fourth quarter, additional regulations that have been going into a place. So I think there's a number of factors that went into it. But I'm not sure of the specifics, certainly can get back to you, back after on more detail on that.", "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Awesome. Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Morris. Your line is open.", "John Dygert Morris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks. Hey, my congratulations on a really nice holiday season a well.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you, John.", "John Dygert Morris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yeah, I think, Scott, Ernie, I guess, for either one of you, it's a little bit of a philosophical question. Thinking behind your 1% to 2% comp forecast for next year, on the one hand we've got, I think we'd all agree, a better macro consumer out there. And you sort of acknowledged as much by building in some of the higher wage rates for next year as well, so some discretionary spending for them as well as the bonuses and whatnot. And yet, I'm wondering why, I guess, the delta or the philosophy behind only guiding to like a 1% to 2% comp for next year. So maybe some more thought process there, be helpful. Thanks.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So, John, this is really a classic case. First of all, that is, as you know, a very normal guidance range for us. And our objective is to always exceed our plans. So we like to plan conservatively. It does a lot of good things for the business. It controls inventories, expenses, which is really a huge deal. Expenses across all the operating divisions, whether it's store payroll, the distribution processing costs, costs within other functional areas, support areas. And so when we budget off the lower comp \u2013 our objective, by the way, clearly, is to surpass those goals. It's just a conservative way of planning. Scott, do you want to...?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "No, I think it's really the two points Ernie made. It's the discipline in the expenses and I think on the inventory management and it allows for better, hopefully, flow-through on the upside and mitigates on the markdowns, on the downside.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Your question, though, is certainly \u2013 your challenge is certainly what our mindset is.", "John Dygert Morris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yeah. No, that's helpful, maybe if you...", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "I think if you're getting at, yeah, we would not want to only achieve a 1% to a 2%.", "John Dygert Morris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yeah, and I'm wondering with what you mentioned in the prepared remarks about the initiatives that you all work so hard on to keep driving that traffic, are there any you want to highlight for us that might be new and different as your forward for next year, on those consumer-driving initiatives? That would be...", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "I'll tell you one thing. We can't give you specifics on it, but I am very happy with the marketing campaigns that we have coming up. Actually, a lot of it, I can't tell you about, because they don't come out until the second week in March.", "But I am very happy with the creative on all divisions, on the marketing front and also we've done some adjustments on the working media in terms of what vehicles we are pushing out there with. So, of course, digital is a key component. But we are utilizing TV, which, again, I can't give you specifics, in a different way. But as far as that traffic, that's one of the things I am most excited about, over the next six months.", "John Dygert Morris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Sounds great. Super helpful. Look forward to it. Thank you, guys.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dana Telsey. Your line is open.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Good morning and congratulations on the improvement. As you think about the comp, what comp do you need to leverage expenses going forward? Is there any change? And you mentioned marketing expense increase, which divisions? Is it TV? What do you plan to do? And how do you think it drive sales? And just lastly, with the changes for Sierra Trading Post, what opportunity do you see for the business as you make these changes? Thank you.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So I think, I'll just try to answer a few of those questions. On advertising, I think, maybe a little is, first, advertising dollars are slightly more, but there is a leverage on an A to S ratio. In terms of the leverage point, not trying to not answer the question, but when you have too many factors with wage and FX and other things to tell you the leverage point, 3% was always what we had stated when merchandise margin is roughly flat and your expenses were not growing.", "The leverage point would generally always be 3%. Certainly, when you plan out a quarter at a 2% and we have a 3%, we're certainly going to leverage off of that. And at usually 1% comp would be worth approximately 20 basis points in leverage when you're comparing it to a plan, whether it's for the year or for the quarter. And I'll just turn it back to Ernie in terms of...", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "STP.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "STP and things that we're doing.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So, Dana, on Sierra Trading Post, we're really excited about a handful of things here. It was a tale of two cities, when you look at the first half performance and the back half. So in the second half of the year, our top line was performing really well versus in the first half, where it was disappointing.", "The organization, we did some pretty major moves around, as well as at the end of last year, put a planning organization in that was really going to take care of a consistent flow to the stores and the website in a very balanced manner, which we have not had before. So that really took strong effect by the time we got to about August, September and we went on to have a very healthy sales top-line growth in the fourth quarter.", "So what we're feeling good about is we even go into this year is our flow has been much better to the stores and to the website. We have a merchant team that's now in place. I think I had talked to all of you before about doing a reorganization restructuring there, which we did that about a year ago, and we're finally getting the payback on that.", "So we're looking at a more experienced merchant group, which should yield us \u2013 between that and the flow of the merchandise, should lead to improving merchandise margins as well. So, pretty much all of those things are headed in the right direction. We had to go through all that pain of going for everyday value from early on. But, fortunately, we're, for the most part past that and like what we see for the year coming up.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Oliver Chen. Your line is open.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi, Ernie and Scott. Great quarter and congratulations. So regarding traffic and average unit retail, and as you think forward to your apparel versus non-apparel mix as well as the related supply chain investments, where do you think you are with respect to where you want the business to be with the mix or a framework for us thinking about that, because you've done a very good job being proactive about being in categories that aren't necessary apparel and strategically using private label, so would love your thoughts for the year ahead.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "I'll just give a little color on the number there. I think one of the things that we're certainly pleased with and we mentioned it briefly on the average retail moderating, particularly at Marmaxx, in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. We are planning, as we said, the average retail, still moderating as we move through the first half of this year and to be flattish for the back half of the year.", "So I think that's \u2013 we feel good about that and some of that is, I think Ernie will allude to it, is the mix and the branding and all that of the merchandise. So that's, I think, very important. And certainly, if we can achieve that, that will continue to put a little less pressure on some of our expense structure.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, Scott. Oliver, so, I guess, it's a good question. It's pretty broad and what I would get at some of the key pieces, I think what you're getting at is how we're approaching the apparel and the home business. Is it different? Or this is where the flexibility comes into play.", "One thing that you could see is that in Marmaxx, we had those few categories where we had some execution issues in the third quarter. And you could see that, even though we have work to do, we're very happy with the progress that we've had on those few categories. Or, obviously, Marmaxx would not have had a 3% comp in the fourth quarter.", "And also, we've seen some further improvement as we've been through the first few weeks of this year. I would tell you, because of the importance of apparel still in a Marmaxx or a TK Maxx or in a Winners we have some initiatives and strong feelings about certain apparel categories throughout the year that we are going to try to aggressively drive this year. That applies to those three divisions, specifically. Even though they have home businesses, we are specifically going to be going after apparel in those full-line stores.", "Having said that, strategically, when you look at our total TJX business, I love the way the complement of home is such a core steady, non-weather-related market share opportunity, as I said before, because we believe we have the most unpredictable impulse-driven home business in the country, at the best value that nobody competes with us on. So that's why you'll continue to see us open more home stores and drive the home business in the full-line stores as well.", "So I guess, this year, our mission, and your question was perfect timing, because in the full-line apparel stores, which is TJ Maxx, Marshalls, Winners, TK, we're going to try to aggressively go after certain key apparel categories, while we still go after home. I hope that answers the question.", "Operator", "The final question of the day comes from Matthew Boss. Your line is open.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Congrats on the improvement.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Ernie, I guess, can you speak to, maybe or at least give us some high-level thoughts, as to the monthly progression, what you saw from same-store sales in the fourth quarter?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yes.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And I know you don't normally provide it, but I ask, just given the improved execution, some of the issues that we saw in the third quarter, did things improve as the fourth quarter progressed? Sounds like you're speaking to continued momentum in February, maybe just touch on any drivers. And then finally, on the international front, nice improvement there as well, any trends you're seeing by regions or just initiatives that you're driving to capture additional share outside of the U.S.?", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "So, Matt, we can't give specifics. As you know, we can't give you numbers by month. What I can directionally say is that we did have improvement as the quarter went on. And by the way, that applies to Europe, specifically. Our business continued to get healthier as we got toward Christmas and post-Christmas. And it varied a little bit by division, so I can't broad-brush it like that for you.", "But, obviously, in total TJX, when we have a 4% comp, this is why I can only get so specific, but we clearly did not have any month that wasn't a good month or we wouldn't have ended up there. But it did seem to strengthen as we got closer to Christmas. I would leave it at that. Scott, do you have any...?", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, I think and, as Ernie said, with Europe, it certainly got better later.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Later.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "And I would say, in terms of Europe, there is still a bit more pressure, I think, too, as the hanging on effects of Brexit in terms of UK versus mainland Europe, so we have been stronger in mainland Europe than we have in the UK. And probably the only nuance there is also we run better in London versus outside of London. But those are the things that we've, I think, had mentioned before, but still, there is still some pressures in Europe on that.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "And, Matt, the thing that, again, we couldn't get everything into the script. But one of the highs of what Scott, myself and the team here was most excited about was the consistency across all of the divisions and all the geographies. We didn't have any one bottleneck in the business, so to speak, that would drag anything down, so that we felt good about. And so when you ask about the timing, even the timing, as much as it helped, it was pretty consistent for the quarter, which also was a sign of healthiness.", "Scott Goldenberg - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, and I think to reiterate, just to make sure on the geographies and like at Marmaxx, for example, we were pretty consistent within the U.S., so we always like when we don't see much a differentiation between the low and the high. So that's what we saw in the fourth quarter, which I think bodes well.", "Ernie L. Herrman - The TJX Cos., Inc.", "Okay.
