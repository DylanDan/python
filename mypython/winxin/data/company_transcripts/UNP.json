At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. You may begin.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Beth Whited, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017. This equates to a first quarter record $1.32 per share which is up 14% over last year. Total volume increased 2% in the quarter compared to 2016, carload volume increased in three of our six commodity groups, led by a 16% increase in coal. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.1% which is flat with the first quarter of 2016.", "This is a very solid start to the year, especially given the weather challenges we encountered on the Western part of our network earlier in the quarter. In keeping with our strategic value tracks, our engaged employees worked safely and productively under very difficult circumstances during the quarter. As a result, operations were restored quickly as we continued to focus on providing an excellent customer experience. Our team will give you more of the details on the quarter, starting with Beth...", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thank you, Lance, and good morning. In the first quarter, our volume was up 2% driven primarily by Coal, Agricultural Products and Industrial Products, offset by declines in Automotive and Chemicals. We generated positive net core pricing of 1% in the quarter, with continued energy related and Intermodal pricing pressure. The increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car drove a 6% increase in freight revenue.", "Let's take a closer look at the performance of each our six business groups. Ag Products revenue increased 7% on 6% volume growth and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloads increased 19% year-over-year driven by ample U.S. grain supply and global market competitiveness increasing demand for grain exports, primarily wheat and corn. Grain product carloads were flat, with strengths from DDG exports to Mexico and soybean meal shipments in the U.S. offset by a drop in canola meal and oils volume.", "Food and refrigerated carloads were down 3% driven by declines in canned goods. Refrigerated markets were also down due to Western region weather challenges and ample truck availability. Looking at the remainder of the year, the strong South American crop and continued abundance of grain stocks will create uncertainty in the grain markets. Weather and crop health will also continue to be factors. We expect food and refrigerated shipments will see strength as the year progresses.", "Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter on a 2% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 8% as a result of previously referenced contract changes which we have now largely lapped and lower production levels. These changes were partially offset by increased West Coast imports and new production in Mexico. The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 17.2 million vehicles in the first quarter, down 1% from first quarter 2016. On the parts side, over the road conversions and growth in light truck demand drove a 5% increase in volume. The U.S. light vehicle forecast for full year 2017 is 17.4 million units, down 1% from the 2016 record rate of 17.6 million. We remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to high inventory, dealer incentives and rising interest rates. On the parts side, however, over the road conversions will continue to present opportunities for growth.", "Chemicals revenue was up 1% for the quarter on a 4% decrease in volume and 5% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments declined 23% as we continued to see headwinds on crude oil shipments which were down 87% to about 2,000 carloads in the quarter due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume excluding crude oil was up 1% in the quarter.", "Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in plastics which was up 3% in the quarter due to increased polypropylene shipments. For the rest of 2017 our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable, strength is anticipated in plastics with new facilities and expansions beginning to come online as well as in industrial chemicals driven by improvement in industrial production. Both of these will continue to help offset the expected continued decline in crude oil shipments.", "Coal revenue increased 25% for the quarter on a 16% increase in volume and 8% improvement in average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin and other regions were up 21% and 5% respectively from higher natural gas prices and stronger West Coast exports which benefited from favorable global economics for Western U.S. coal. Overall, coal stockpiles were down in the quarter and they are nearing the five-year average. Looking forward, we expect Coal volumes will continue to benefit from favorable 2016 comps in the second quarter. For the second half the year we expect sustained volume, assuming natural gas prices remain in the $3 range. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.", "Industrial Products revenue was up 9% on a 1% increase in volume and a 7% increase in average revenue per car during the car. Minerals volume increased 32% in the quarter, driven by a 59% increase in frac sand shipments, through increased shale related drilling activity, and profit intensity per drilling well. Construction products volume was down 9% due to projects completed in 2016 that did not continue into 2017, largely in South Texas. This market was also impacted by Western region weather challenges. Specialized markets were impacted by reduced project-based waste shipments partially offset by strength in our wind and government markets. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued strength in frac sand shipments as rig counts in our served territory continue to increase. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacts a number of Industrial Products markets, especially metals, and creates some uncertainty in our outlook.", "Intermodal revenue was up 3% with flat volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic volume declined 1% in the quarter driven by a challenging competitive environment and abundant truck capacity. International volume was up 1% in the quarter from stronger westbound shipments, inventory restocking and volume pushes prior to the ocean carrier alliance changes effective April 1. Looking forward we expect international Intermodal volumes will continue to be impacted by ongoing ocean carrier financial stress, industry consolidation and potential trade policy changes. While trucking capacity is abundant currently making modal conversions challenging we expect a tightening of capacity late in the year with the implementation of electronic log books providing an opportunity to drive higher levels of over the road conversions.", "To wrap up, this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of 2017 mentioned in the previous slides. Favorable coal comps will continue into the second quarter. We also anticipate strength in other key markets including continued growth in frac sand. Our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth this year as the U.S. economy continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.", "Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thanks, Beth. And good morning. Starting with safety performance our reportable personal injury rate increased to 0.89 versus the first quarter record of 0.75 achieved in 2016. While disappointed with the results, the team remains fully committed to successfully addressing risk in the workplace and I am confident in our efforts as we push towards our goal of zero incidents. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate of 3.18 increased 11% versus the first quarter of last year.", "To make improvement going forward, we'll continue to focus on enhanced TE&Y training to eliminate human factor incidents and making investments that harden our infrastructure to reduce incidents. In addition, we're collecting millions of data points on the health of our track condition and are actively developing advanced analytical models to better identify and mitigate this risk.", "In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 7% versus 2016 to 2.21. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter call, our crossing assessment process or CAP couples our comprehensive safety culture with data analysis to help focus increased attention on the crossings where we can most substantially impact public safety.", "Moving on to network performance. Severe weather throughout much of our Western region caused multiple track outages and service interruptions during the first quarter. As a result, velocity declined 6% while terminal dwell increased 7% when compared to 2016. Despite the weather challenges, we were still able to generate efficiency gains within our terminals as cars switched per employee day increased 4% during the first quarter. I would like to take a moment to thank the team for their hard work and dedication as they did an excellent job of restoring the network quickly and safely in an effort to minimize delays so we could continue delivering an excellent customer experience.", "Moving on to resources. Throughout the quarter as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource levels to account for volume changes, weather disruptions and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y work force was down 1% in the first quarter when compared to the same period in 2016. And our engineering and mechanical work force was down a combined 1100 employees or 5%. At the end of the quarter we had approximately 1650 TE&Y furloughs. We do expect those numbers to decline throughout the year as we look to the furlough pool first to backfill attrition. The active locomotive fleet was up 3% for the first quarter of 2017, primarily to help minimize the impact of weather related challenges and we had approximately 1400 locomotives in storage at the end of the first quarter.", "As always, we will continue to adjust our work force levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictate. In addition to efficiently right-sizing our resource base, we continued realizing gains in other key productivity initiatives such as train size. Our persistent focus on productivity once again resulted in train size performance improvement as we achieved best ever quarterly results in our Automotive and manifest networks and first quarter records in our Intermodal and grain networks.", "To wrap up, despite some first quarter challenges, we expect to build positive momentum as we focus on critical initiatives that will drive improvement. First and foremost is safety where we expect our safety strategy will yield record results on our way to incident-free environment. And our balanced resource base puts us in tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line as we maintain our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.1 billion in the quarter, up 6% versus last year. Higher volumes, an increase in fuel surcharges and positive core price all contributed to the increase in revenue for the quarter. Operating expenses totaled $3.3 billion, up 6% from 2016. The increase in fuel cost represented a majority of the increased operating expense in the quarter.", "Operating income totaled almost $1.8 billion, a 6% increase from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $67 million, up from $46 million in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by a real estate pre-tax gain totaling $26 million or approximately $0.02 per share. Interest expense of $172 million was up 3% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense increased about 5% to $616 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1.1 billion, up 9% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities.", "These results combined to produce a record first quarter earnings per share of $1.32 per share. And as we discussed back in March, we encountered severe weather on the Western part of our network which negatively impacted earnings per share by about $0.03 in the quarter. A good portion of this was lost revenue. The operating ratio was flat with the first quarter last year even with the fuel headwind we faced during the quarter. Higher fuel prices negatively impacted the operating ratio by about 1.3 points.", "Now turning to the top line. Freight revenue of $4.8 billion was up over 6% versus last year, driven by a 2% increase in volume along with positive core pricing. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $212 million, up $99 million when compared to 2016 and up about $25 million from the fourth quarter of last year. All in, we estimate the net impact of higher fuel prices was a $0.02 headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the first quarter was a positive 1%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand shipments and grain carloadings along with a reduction in shorter haul rock volumes.", "Core price was about 1%. Pricing in our energy and Intermodal business continues to be under pressure given the competitiveness in those respective markets. We expect these challenges to continue throughout the first part of 2017 before beginning to strengthen later in the year, assuming market conditions improve. Excluding Coal and Intermodal, pricing in our other business lines was in the 2% to 3% range for the quarter. And for the full year, we are on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our inflation costs. Our strategy of pricing our service product based on the value proposition it represents in the competitive marketplace at levels that generate a reinvestable return remains intact.", "Turning now to the operating expense. Slide 20 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 4% versus 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a combination of higher wage and benefit inflation, higher volume, and weather-related costs. Labor inflation was about 5% in the quarter. Partially offsetting higher volumes were solid productivity gains and a smaller capital work force resulting in total work force levels declining 4% in the quarter versus last year or about 1,600 employees less. For the remainder of 2017, we do expect force levels to adjust with volume but will also reflect ongoing productivity initiatives.", "Fuel expense totaled $460 million, up 44% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 7% increase in gross ton miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 4% while our average fuel price increased 40% to $1.75 per gallon. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 1% to $566 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower joint facility expenses and locomotive material costs.", "Turning to slide 21. Depreciation expense was $520 million, up 4% compared to 2016, primarily driven by a higher depreciable base. For the full year 2017, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 4% to 5%. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $276 million which is down 4% when compared to 2016. Lower locomotive lease expense and a mix of traffic were the primary drivers for the reduction. Other expenses came in at $260 million, up 4% versus last year. For 2017, we would expect other expense to increase slightly excluding any unusual items.", "Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first quarter totaled about $1.9 billion, down $290 million when compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $17.8 billion at quarter end. This does not include the $1 billion of new debt which closed just after the quarter end. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times, and this keeps us close to our target ratio of just under two times. Dividend payments for the quarter totaled nearly $500 million, compared to $465 million last year. This includes a 10% dividend increase per share which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "In addition to dividends, we also bought back over 7.5 million shares totaling $800 million, an increase of around 12% over last year. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased nearly 30% of our outstanding shares. And between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, which represented just over 120% of first quarter net income.", "On the productivity side, our G55+0 initiatives yielded around $90 million of productivity in the quarter. A couple of examples of our productivity include effectively leveraging volume growth that we achieved in the quarter, reducing locomotive servicing and repair costs, turning back leased equipment no longer required, and furthering our efforts to be more efficient on our support functions. With these results, we continue to progress as expected and we are on track to meet our $350 million to $400 million productivity goal for the full year. Looking forward, we still expect full year volume growth to be up in the low single digit range. Second quarter volumes could be a little stronger driven primarily by the benefit of an easier comparison year-over-year.", "With positive volume, positive core price, and significant productivity benefits, we are still on track to have an improved full year operating ratio. Longer term, we are still focused on achieving our targeted 60% operating ratio, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019 and we remain committed to reaching our goal of a 55% operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continued the momentum of our volume, pricing and productivity initiatives.", "With that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thank you, Rob. With a solid first quarter performance behind us, we'll continue to press ahead with our volume, pricing, and productivity initiatives through the remainder of year. As Beth mentioned, we're seeing particular strength in a few markets such as frac sand. Coal seems to have stabilized and we're seeing some signs of gradual improvement in other areas of the economy. Our six-track value strategy will keep us intensely focused on effectively leveraging volume growth while providing our customers an excellent experience and our shareholders a solid return on their investment.", "With that, let's open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible.", "Our first question today comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.", "Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, this is Diane Huang on for Ravi. Thank you for taking my question. So, a question here is the average number of employees was down about 4% year-over-year despite volumes growing 2%. So, with your full-year volume outlook of up low-single digits for the year, do you expect to hold the first quarter head count level flat sequentially for the rest of the year? And then a second part to that question is in the past you guys talked about 50% incremental margins. So, with your G55 initiative and also positive volume growth, we can see higher levels of incremental margins for the rest of the year. Thank you.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thank you, Diane. We'll let Rob answer those questions.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, on the head count question, yeah, you're exactly right in what you pointed out in terms of the great productivity that we saw in the first quarter in the face of some of the challenges that we talked about. Full year, I mean, I'll just call you back to our guidance we've given, and that is head count will move with volume, but we obviously will achieve productivity along the way, so it won't be one-for-one, So, we stay away from giving a precise number, but rest assured, to achieve our objectives we're going to continue to drive productivity and it will be reflected in those numbers.", "In terms of the incremental margin, as we look out to achieve both our 60% OR guidance by 2019 and then, beyond that, our 55%, it's going to require incremental margins in the 50% to 60% range, and that's kind of how we think about it and that's what we're focused on.", "Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great, that's very helpful. And then a quick one here. Can you quantify how much of the $0.03 to $0.04 EPS headwind from weather was related to revenues versus expense?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "We didn't break that out, but I would just say a large portion of the $0.03 showed up on the revenue line.", "Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.", "Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the pricing pressure you mentioned and the competitive environment in Intermodal. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that a bit and talk about how the current level of competition compares to what you've seen historically and maybe how that's progressed throughout the quarter and into April and your expectations on that front?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "We are seeing ample truck capacity in the market as well as pretty significant pricing pressure in the Intermodal space. It has not abated as we've gone into April. As we think about the rest of the year, we certainly are expecting to see capacity tighten as electronic logbooks come into play, and so our expectation would be that you would start to see some rationalization of capacity and an opportunity for better pricing.", "Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right, appreciate that. And then maybe just on frac sand, can you just talk a little bit more about the fundamentals there? It looks like you're seeing some acceleration in 2Q. I guess where are you relative to the prior peak in that business and has there been any significant change in the mix of business? And I guess if you're able to quantify the positive mix impact that you mentioned earlier?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Okay. So, we are seeing substantial increases in demand in Texas, specifically in the Permian Basin. We'd mentioned that we were up 59% in the quarter. We were up almost 100% in the Permian Basin and we're up around 40% in Eagle Ford. We're seeing some spiking demand as well in the Niobrara, but not as substantial. I would say that that is sustaining and maybe even growing a little bit as we enter into the second quarter. And I don't see anything right now that changes that, so that's been a bright spot for us.", "You asked a question about mix. We are starting to see some local brown sand come into play, especially in the Permian. So, we're looking at something like 85% white sand, 15% brown sand. We expect the pie to continue to grow and it's possible over time brown sand will take up a larger piece of the pie, but still opportunity for us and we're participating in that market as much as we can.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Hey, Eric, just stepping back a couple of kind of high-level things that are going on in that shale energy market. One is many of these shale energy exploration plays are competitive at $50 oil and so it looks like it's potentially a sustained marketplace. And the second thing is the sand intensity per well has been increasing and that also looks like it's a favorable trend.", "Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah, good morning. So, I wanted to \u2013 I guess first I'll just ask about Coal. I think, Lance, you mentioned stabilization in Coal. I know there are a lot of factors that affect the business, and probably natural gas price is one of the most important. But how do you see the lay of the land maybe over the next year in terms of impact from facility closures, impact potentially from renewables capacity coming on. Do you think that from that perspective that you would have some stability and you're really kind of weather dependent? Or are there some other faculties like that, new capacity or shutdowns, that we should consider over the next year?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "We do view that as being pretty stable over the next year. You called out exactly the right factors that will impact it. Weather clearly will remain a factor and natural gas prices are really very key to keeping coal-generated electricity on the dispatch curve. So, with those couple of things in mind, we view it as being pretty stable over the horizon here.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, great. And one on the operating side. How would you characterize -- I mean, seems like your growth is coming in, aside from the Coal growth, you're getting a lot of growth in what might be in the manifest network, not so much in Intermodal, so I think you get good operating leverage and seems like you're doing a good job of expanding train length. How much capacity do you have to run longer trains in the manifest network? I know it's train by train, segment by segment, but overall, have you got another 10% you could add to train length in manifest or what's the right ballpark for that?", "Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.", "Tom, I won't give you an exact figure, but there is plenty of headroom inside our network, almost across the board between our three regions for more train size opportunities and we will, on a case by case, lane by lane basis, take advantage of that.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. So that leverage should continue in the near term?", "Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yes, sir, it should.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thank you, Tom.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.", "Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, thanks, everybody. Congrats on a good quarter. Just following up on the incremental question, the first question. I wanted to just ask the underlying \u2013 trying to understand what the underlying incrementals were in the quarter after adjusting for the weather impact. I don't have perfect information from the data you provided but it looks like it was in the mid 50% level and then if you can just confirm that or correct me if I'm wrong? And then if you look at the OR targets over the long-term, obviously this is an enormously capital intensive business. What I'm trying to understand as you look at bridging where you are today to where you want to be, how much of that trajectory is I guess fully kind of in your control via net cost savings and how much of it is volume growth that's kind of out of your control? I would imagine the vast majority of it would be volume growth, but please correct me if I'm wrong.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Rob, you want to handle that.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah. In the first quarter, our incremental margins as reported were about 35%. And if you adjust for the fuel, they were closer to like 65%. I didn't break out the impact of weather, but obviously that had a slight impact on that calculus. But those are the numbers as reported. And as I said earlier, to drive to our stated goals we need to be in the 50% to 60% range on an annualized basis to get from here to there and that's how we're focused.", "In terms of what will drive the incremental margins, what will drive the leverage, I would just say \u2013 you said volume's out of our control, somewhat that's true because we have to play the hand the economy deals us. But we also, as part of our G55+0 initiatives, are focused on developing business development opportunities where we can have some control over volume and obviously providing quality safe service to our customers is one of the key drivers to in fact encouraging volume growth on our railroad.", "So we view a lot of that as in our control and we're focused on driving quality volume, continuing to focus on providing quality service so we can price it right above inflation and continue our focus on productivity initiatives which we have been successfully delivering. You add all that up, that's what's going to get us from where we are to the 60% and ultimately to the 55%.", "Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.", "Amit, I thought I heard you ask a question on CapEx and as we look forward on CapEx that's driven, you mentioned growth that's driven part by about a $2 billion spend to maintain a robust network and then the rest is about finding investments that have a reasonable and attractive return. Positive train control of course is in its last couple of years of significant investment. So that will start trailing off and we'll see what the future brings.", "Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks and if I could just follow up one question on pricing. Rob, you've kind of talked over the last couple quarters ad nauseam about core pricing dynamics and how you guys calculate it. If you can just update us, some of the energy volumes are coming back online now and just if you could provide some color if the pricing pressure or the decelerating pricing environment has abated at all as some of those volumes have come back online and also the positive spread between price increases and cost inflation that you've talked about. Has that spread changed at all since the start of the year in a more positive direction in some of the export volumes of Coal and the energy volumes are a little bit better than expected? Thanks.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, I would just say you're right. We have attempted to explain how we calculate price and again I'm proud to announce, as you all have heard me say for many years, that we are very conservative in terms of how we accurately capture what we report on price. But nothing's changed from the guidance we gave. And that is that we're focused on driving dollars that we yield from our pricing initiatives higher than for the full year, higher than the dollars we expend on inflation and coming into this year we called out that that gap this year was clearly going to be tighter than last year, largely driven by some of the pressures that you're asking about in our energy and Intermodal businesses on the one hand and on the other hand a higher inflation rate, which for the full year we still see overall inflation in that 3% range which is obviously is higher than what we ended up with last year.", "So nothing has changed but I would just point out that, as Beth commented in her remarks, we are continuing to face competitive pressures in the energy and Intermodal businesses, so that has not abated. That continues.", "Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. That's very clear. All right, thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question's coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Just wanted to follow up there. So, if I look at the segments, Coal had the best yield growth of any of the segments, and I'm wondering is that a mix benefit or change or maybe do some of the contracts have something tied to higher natural gas prices? And if not, does the rising natural gas environment \u2013 we understand how it helps volumes but how do you think that impacts Coal pricing?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Rob, let's start with you and then we can have Beth...", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, Beth can talk about the pricing, but I would just say from a yield and depending on how you're calculating the yield, Scott, I would just say that a large part of what we saw in terms of the overall yields and we don't break it out by commodity group as you may like us to as finitely. But I would just say that the mix impact of the significant volume growth year-over-year in Coal really did impact the reported mix numbers on the yield that you're I think referring to. In terms of the pricing dynamics, Beth.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, the pricing dynamics remain, as Rob just said, it's really quite competitive but the length of haul helped us both coming out of the PRB and going into Texas as well as the export volumes which did grow a bit for us in the first quarter.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay and then just maybe a bigger picture question, Lance. Relative to a quarter ago the big change in the industry is that you've got Hunter now at CSX and given what he does and the way he talks, I'm wondering does that in any way change the way that you guys think about the longer term margin opportunity? Does it have any impact on the way you think about the business or manage the business or the pace in which you want to improve margins? Any kind of change in your thinking relative to a quarter ago?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "So, Scott, let's start by saying we have great respect for CSX, the management team there, their business. They run a good business. They've got a great business model, and I'm sure Hunter is bringing significant change to that business model and he's got a great track record in our industry. Setting that aside, we run our business with an eye towards being as efficient as we possibly can be and driving our six value tracks.", "Now we keep our eyes open, and we learn from anybody we can outside of our business, and we've done that historically, and we'll continue to do that. A great case in point is the 600-some-odd low horsepower locomotives we've taken out of our network over the past couple of years. That was a lesson we learned from a couple of other entities, and we figured out how to apply it to ourselves, and we've done that effectively.", "So our focus is get to that 60%, plus minus, by 2019 and then get to 55%. And we'll get there as quickly as we can, keeping in mind we've got a number of levers that we're moving in terms of growth on the top line, productivity and trying to drive core price. And again if somebody's got a great idea that looks like it can apply to our business model, we're going to use it, but it's not going to fundamentally change how we run our business or approach our strategy.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you for the thoughts, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.", "Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good morning, guys. So just wanted to start on the balance sheet. Obviously, you're getting closer to your level that you've set in terms of the target rate of two times debt to EBITDA but it seems like you're still able to access some very low cost debt. Has there been any internal discussion in terms of raising that cap and maybe increasing returns to shareholders?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Rob, you want to take a stab at that.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "We're comfortable with the guidance we've given of that two times, but rest assured we're very focused on driving cash flow and that with higher cash flow we'll support higher levels of debt and that then supports higher levels of continued share repurchases. That's our focus.", "Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So it sounds like, no, that two times cap is a pretty hard cap at the moment?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "We feel good with that as we look forward.", "Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. And then just turning quickly to crude by rail. The volumes are obviously down pretty dramatically this quarter. Is that an area that's just not a viable area going forward for Union Pacific? You go back a couple of years ago, and everybody thought this was going to be a growth area for the rails. It seems like pipeline has pretty much displaced that. Is there an opportunity that that growth could ever return? Just would love to hear your thoughts on that.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah. So Union Pacific really doesn't have a crude oil franchise like some of the other railroads. So we will continue, I think, to be spot players as opportunities open up for arbitrage. So you might see a little move to California out of Canada. You might see a little bit move to the Gulf. But in terms of our core franchise lanes, I don't think that it's a big market for Union Pacific going forward.", "Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.", "Thank you very much. Lot of focus on revenues and end markets. I wanted to come back to capital investment and just get an idea on an updated basis where the CapEx guidance is, I'm assuming unchanged. And talk a little bit about what opportunities there may be going forward to take some of that capital investment down where need be.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "I'll take a stab at that and then we'll let either Rob or Cam add some technicolor. So our $3.1 billion for the year remains $3.1 billion. Of course, there are moving parts in there, but that's what we're expecting for our full year. As we look forward, the moving parts again are about $2 billion of replacement capital annually. We don't see much that changes that dramatically over time in order to maintain a really robust network. Positive train control is coming towards the end of its significant capital spend as we finally implement in its entirety of the project by 2018 and then work through 2020 to get the bugs kicked out and get it operating properly.", "After that, it's all about growth and safety and productivity targeted investments. Rob's also talked about a ballpark of 15% of revenue, and I don't think there's much that we see that takes us off those numbers.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, I would just reiterate that, Jeff, that that 15% is probably the best. Again, that's not how we build our capital plan. That's the best way to kind of think about how we're thinking about it. But I would also just to Lance's comments that we are pleased with the disciplined approach we've brought to the capital planning process. And, in fact, our $3.1 billion is down about $1.2 billion on an annualized basis from the last couple of years.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.", "Looking at the 1,400 parked locomotives or locomotives in storage, I guess, I should think about, they're not all brand new locomotives. Some of them are older locomotives. How much can you grow volume without having to make any kind of incremental investment in locomotive fleet?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "So, I'll let Cam add some, but bottom line is when you think about those 1400 parked locomotives, those are all the tail end of the fleet from the standpoint of we want to operate the most efficient, most reliable units, so those are generally going to be our newer units. You know, with that in mind, they're all serviceable and we did bring a fair number of them back, call it 400, at some point during the first quarter to overcome the impacts of those weather issues that we had on the West Coast. So, we've got plenty of headroom for growth prior to really needing to acquire new locomotives. Cameron?", "Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.", "And, Lance, we've had a lot of practice over the past several years in bringing that locomotive fleet back to life. It's reliable. Doesn't require a lot of further investment and we've got a lot of headroom to bring on additional business without even thinking about new purchases.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, I'll remind you we do have an obligation that's part of a long-term contract that includes purchases this year but absent the fact that we had a long-term contract, we would not be in the market.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "If I can, Lance, just to remind everybody what those numbers are that we've said. There's approximately 60 new ones this year and then 40 in 2018 and that completes that long-term commitment.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.", "All right. Well, congratulations on a strong quarter and thanks, guys.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to touch on mix a little bit and, Rob, I think I ask this question a lot and I'm not sure if you're ever able to answer it, but wanted to get a sense when you think about sort of the mix of the business in the outlook that looks solid, things like frac sand, I think Coal's got a decent outlook for the rest of the year. When we think about that, just sort of directionally speaking, we should be expecting some of the positive mix tailwinds that you've had over the last couple quarters to persist. Is that fair way to look at it or is it a little bit too difficult to get into the weeds there?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, Chris, you could probably write down my answer. That well could play out that way. I mean, you're right, we had a positive mix this quarter of 1%, as you're pointing out, largely driven by growth in Coal and sand. But we stay away from giving guidance on the mix because there's a lot of moving parts. And because we have such a diverse book of business, there's mix within mix in our varied business. But you're not thinking about it wrong. I mean, if those are the commodities that continue to strengthen relative to the rest of the base throughout the year, then that's not crazy thinking.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just wanted to come back to sort of the competitive dynamic in the Western U.S. between rail carriers. We've heard some anecdotal stuff about your competitor in terms of service degradation, mostly on the Intermodal side, but just a little bit around the margin there. I know you guys compete very aggressively everyday against BN, but just wanted to get a sense of maybe how that dynamic, even if it has changed at all as we go forward here.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "I don't feel like anything about the competitive dynamic has significantly altered. We're competing every day with our direct competitor as well as all the other modes of transportation that are capable of handling the same sort of freight that we have. It feels a little more intense on the Intermodal side in the first quarter, perhaps, than what we had seen, but it's an ongoing competitive situation that we are engaged in playing.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time this morning, guys, appreciate it.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yes, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yeah, thank you. You just talked a little bit more about the competitive Intermodal environment with respect to pricing on the International side. I'm curious, are you looking for up-pricing on the domestic side with your partners there this year? And how does that compare to the 2% to 3% range, ex Coal, ex International that you threw out earlier?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Like we said before, if other things are up 2% to 3% then you're obviously having some pressure in other places to get to the 1% overall. So, we are very focused on what's going to happen with capacity as you move towards the end of the year and the electronic log books come into place, because we do think you'll see some rationalization at that time, providing an opportunity for pricing to improve in that truckload space. But that's not the only thing that we're focused on. We want to make sure that we have a great product that's very competitive, so that as more freight wants to move away from the highway and onto rail, we're standing there ready to deliver it to our customers in the manner that they expect.", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "And to follow up on that latter comment, specifically with your domestic partners, how do you balance your desire to improve your pricing and returns while still leaving them enough margin to continue to invest in growing in their business and grow their volumes on your lines?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "I would say certainly there's no percentage in it for us if we don't all win together. So, our goal is certainly to have a viable competitive product that enables all the people who are part of that supply chain to participate in a manner that makes sense to them from a business perspective.", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "All right. Thank you for the time.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you, operator, and good morning, all. Wanted to stick on the Intermodal pricing a bit. How should we expect it to start improving if, in fact, ELDs do, like most of us think, tighten up truck capacity? Is that pricing going to be a little bit of a lag? So, should we expect like a 2018 improvement and not an improvement in 2017 in price?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "No, the ELDs come into play in late 2017. The requirement gets hardened. I think you just have to see, depending on bid cycles and other things, where you start to see the impact of that. Hard to predict.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And I wanted to jump back to something on the cost side. Rob, you mentioned labor inflation, I think, was about 5% in the quarter. Is that something that we should think about going forward about that number 5% for labor inflation?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, I think it's a reasonable number to assume, Jason, both the 5% on labor and overall enterprise right around 3% for the full year.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Right. And so, head count, obviously will depend upon what's happening with the volume side.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "That's right. That's right.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, fantastic. I appreciate the time, as always, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Lance, I wanted to ask you a question about some of the incentives that you guys maybe have put in place or are talking about putting in place through the board around the drive towards a 55% OR. One of the pushbacks we get in sort of recommending your stock is that there's a perception out there maybe management is a little bit taking their time on the margin side. There isn't as much of a sense of urgency. I'm just wondering if you guys have had any discussions about trying to address that through some specific initiatives tied towards margin goals or margin achievement.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Sure. I assure you management is not taking its time on trying to improve our margins. If you look at our long-term incentive plan, our proxy lines out the fact that it's built around an improved ROIC, or encouraging us to improve our return on invested capital. And in that there's a kicker that's designed around improving our operating margin. But all of our incentives essentially line us up, whether it's our long-term incentive plan or the fact that we're all significant shareholders or our short-term incentive plan, they're essentially all lined up for us to improve our operating margin and our return on invested capital as quickly as we can. The payouts get better and grow the faster and better we make those improvements.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "And, David, I have to just jump in here. This is Rob. We're actually \u2013 while we have every incentive, as Lance just commented on, and proud of the fact that everybody in our organization has 55% sort of on their mind, we're driving towards that. We are also proud, as the largest U.S. railroad to have the lowest operating ratio of the U.S. rails. That is something that we've worked hard at and are very proud of and we're going to continue that line of thinking to drive us to the 55%.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yeah, and I just wanted to be clear that this is just a perception that I think some investors have in terms of maybe the radical change that's happening in the East and some of the targets that have been put out there, even for like Norfolk management around margin attainment. I was just wondering if you guys were going to be thinking about making that more front and center as far as trying to give the market a little bit of confidence that you guys are really pushing this target toward 55% and it's not just a target that's out there that you're going to drift towards, which is...", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "A couple of other reminders, right? We generated over $400 million in productivity last year. We talked about generating over $350 million in productivity this year. We are not just wandering around in the woods.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "I appreciate that and thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Good morning, thanks for fitting me in here. Could you remind us what percentage of your book of business is under multiyear contract? And with pricing flat versus Q4, first, do you think we're at a bottom here? And then second, could full-year core price be up versus 2016 on the increase in these inflation escalators alone?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Beth, can you handle those questions on multiyear and what expect out of pricing?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, so we have about 40% of the business that's in longer term deals with escalators of one sort or another on them. We also do expect to see, based on market conditions that we've been talking about this morning, some improvement as we get towards the end of the year. Obviously, volume helps us, improvements in our customers' ability to get price in their markets, an improving economy helps us and volume can be our friend as well.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. And just a quick one on frac sand. We've obviously seen some announcements from some of your customers for new facilities or expansions, so, with the significant increase that you've seen in the first quarter and thinking over the next few quarters, do you think that at some point during 2017, from a volume standpoint, that you could get back to a peak run rate that you saw back in 2014?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "I don't see us coming back to that sort of a peak in 2017. No. We do see good investments happening and we feel positive about what's happening in those markets, but I don't think we'll get back to peak levels soon.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "James Allen - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, guys, it's James Allen on for Brian. A question, my first question is on protectionism. We noticed the softwood lumber penalties that the U.S. is imposing on Canada and the Canadians have responded proposing a ban on U.S. thermal coal going into Canada, so, I guess we wondered if you had, first off, any direct exposure to the thermal coal? And then just what your view was on protectionism more broadly, if you thought there were any major risks or opportunities for your book of business as freight flows might change?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "I'll take the freight, the trade question and it's broader and you can talk about coal, Beth. So, in terms of trade overall, our perspective is the following: that the U.S. economy is tightly connected to our trading partners. We understand that open global trade and more markets available to U.S. manufacturers and producers is critical both for jobs in the United States as well as for the economic vibrancy of the United States.", "We believe that that's well understood also in our current administration and we believe that while there are opportunities to both enforce existing trade agreements, enhance them and negotiate new ones, that the long-term answer is more markets available to U.S. manufacturers and producers is better than fewer markets available. That's essentially the pathway towards economic prosperity and job creation. So, with that, I'll let Beth answer the thermal coal question.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "So, we do not access the export facility in Vancouver that's being referenced in the most recent discussions about access. The coal that we export off the West Coast is hitting locations in California.", "James Allen - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then a quick follow-up question would be on the STB. There's a slightly changing composition with a new chairperson and new board seats, so just wondering in your interactions with the STB, has there been any new flavor to your discussions? Or any changes that you'd expect as they progress with existing regulatory initiatives?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Following the reauthorization in I think it was late 2015, the STB got very active at clearing a docket of a number of different items that were in front of them. We've seen that activity slow down a touch, which makes sense given that the current administration has the opportunity to appoint board members of that organization. What we're encouraging the STB as they're thinking about their docket of work is to not simply just look at each individual item as a stand-alone item, but also bear in mind that they all work together as a quilt of overriding regulation on the industry, and to think about the kind of interactivity of all the regulation they are contemplating.", "We look at the STB historically and think the balance they've struck has been good for the industry, and mostly important is good for the customers, letting the market work where the market will work and in those unique circumstances that require it imposing regulations. So, we keep encouraging them to be a deft hand when they're looking at their docket.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.", "Unknown Speaker", "Good morning, this is [indiscernible (59:38) on for Walter Spracklin. Just want to come back to the competitiveness there in the market. Your growth in grain volumes has remained strong. Is this a factor of the bumper grain crop moving and the export grain you mentioned? Or are there other share factors that might be helping to maintain that growth rate?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, I wouldn't call that a share play. We saw really strong demand for wheat, stronger than we've seen in a while, for export largely to Mexico, as well as good corn movements in the world markets. So, not a share issue, I wouldn't say.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then just switching to your OR here. How should we be thinking about the cadence towards an OR improvement over the year? Are there going to be more impactful initiatives that could land in one quarter? Or do you expect it to be a more even pace over the year? Thank you.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, this is Rob. We don't give guidance by quarter on operating ratio but, as a reminder, we are giving guidance that we expect to improve our operating ratio for the full year. But it never is a straight line. Volumes will dictate largely exactly what that cadence ends up being, but we're very focused on continuing to drive productivity. We talked about the pricing, a component of this being challenged in the first part of the year and hopefully improving later in the year. So, I wouldn't give you any indication that it would be a straight line. It could be lumpy, but the focus is the full year number.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "This quarter is a great example, Rob, where, what'd we have, 1.3 percentage points impact by fuel lag.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, good point. Fuel can always be a factor in that.", "Unknown Speaker", "All right. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Thanks and good morning. So, just to follow up on Intermodal, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but from a directional standpoint do you think domestic Intermodal pricing will still be up this year? And you mentioned competitive pricing pressure in Intermodal, and really what I just want to get a sense for here is I want to understand how much of that is related to domestic Intermodal versus international Intermodal?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "The domestic and international Intermodal are both under pricing pressure. I would say we saw perhaps an acceleration of the pricing pressure in the domestic Intermodal space in the first quarter. Again, depending on what happens in those markets and what happens as we see the tightening capacity that we expect with electronic log books will really be the things that will determine what ends up happening overall with your pricing for the year.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful, but do you still think there's a possibility for your domestic Intermodal pricing to be up in 2017?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Justin, we don't guide on price specific to commodities.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And then, secondly, I was wondering if you could give some additional color on the assumption you're making for Coal volumes within the full year guidance. What are you assuming for growth in Coal volumes in the second quarter? And just to clarify some of the earlier commentary, were you suggesting that Coal volumes in the back half of the year are likely to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Justin, this is Rob. Let me take a stab at that. And, as you know, we don't give specific precise guidance by commodity for the year, but I would just \u2013 as it relates to Coal. I would just remind you of some of the comments that Beth made earlier, and that is it feels stable to us. The things to watch in Coal, as always, will largely be what's happening with gas prices and what's happening with weather. That will dictate from quarter to quarter what's actually happening with volume.", "The other thing we did point out is that we do have an easier comp as we head into the second quarter as it relates to our overall volumes, including Coal, and if you look at our last year numbers, that kind of flips later in the year, the third quarter gets a little more challenging. So, I think I would expect, all things being constant, that you'll see some changes from quarter-to-quarter as it relates to year-over-year volume growth in the Coal line. Again, comps are easier in the second quarter and get challenged in the third quarter, and it feels like a stable environment for us.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay, great, I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thank you, Justin.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.", "Zax Rosenberg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, this is actually Zax Rosenberg on for Ben. Thanks for taking the question so late here. Just wanted to \u2013 a couple for me. Just wanted to follow up first on the trade questions from before and see if you have any specific thoughts on the proposed lumber tariff from earlier this week and how that potentially impacts your guys business specifically. And then secondly, flipping back over to Intermodal, there was a comment earlier about a volume push ahead of the some of the ocean freight, the carrier lines changes, and just wondering the expected impact of those alliance shifts and maybe possible diversion of ships to Canadian ports or what your thoughts are generally there? Thank you.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Okay on the softwood lumber, we really feel like those tariffs were priced in, where you saw a very significant run-up in the lumber prices in the first quarter. So, that doesn't feel like that's going to be impactful in terms of volume to us. And then, on the Intermodal side in terms of the alliances, that is still shaking itself out in terms of port usage and who's calling where and what size of ship and those sorts of things. Right now, it seems to be going pretty well. We're not seeing any significant disruptions. Feels like the process is playing out well.", "As you know, there is more capacity coming online in Canada later in the year. I would expect that a large amount of that could be utilized for Canadian shipping needs. So, we're not really expecting to see significant shifts at this point, but we'll have to see how it plays out and it will be wedded with the alliances.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Hey, Zax, going back to your softwood lumber question, what's really critical to us is getting housing starts and construction up. We have a wonderful franchise that kind of regardless of where the wood's coming from, we just need it to be consumed.", "Zax Rosenberg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions.", "Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of ground has been covered already. Just curious on the performance on RTMs versus carloads. Obviously, very good performance in RTMs, and also the relative difference in the carloads, presumably like the haul. Just curious should we expect that there's going to be that type of divergence for the remainder of the year or might those kind of come together as we progress through the year?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, Brian, this is Rob. That measure, and I kind of made this reference earlier in the Q&A, that RTM impact that you're referring to was largely driven in the first quarter by the upswing in the Coal volumes, and we're not going to give guidance in terms of how that's going to play out for the year because what will drive that is what's the mix of the volume that we, in fact, see come across the book.", "Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Right, okay. And actually, this is more of a kind of theoretical-type question. I'm not sure how many specifics you can provide, but just given the discussion around tax and proposals on rates and previously there was discussion on the treatment of deduction on debt interest in the P&L. So, I don't know if you ran these scenarios through and have some thoughts around if they do not allow or they disallow interest tax deductions, might that change the capital allocation policies that you currently have in place?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Rob, you want to take that?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah. There's a lot of devil in the details on the tax proposals. We, like everyone, are staying in tuned and watching what happens on that. But, so, yeah, there could be some impact. I wouldn't envision that, depending on how the interest plays out, I wouldn't envision that would change our capital spending or our debt guidance that we've given. I wouldn't envision that that will be the result of any changes as it relates to the interest.", "Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Got it. All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Okay, thank you, Rob, and thank you for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We look forward to talking with all of you again in July.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the second quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.17 per share, which compares to $1.38 in the second quarter of 2015.", "Total volume decreased 11% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups, with coal, Intermodal and industrial products all down double-digits. Agricultural products was the only group to show positive year-over-year growth, with volumes up 2% this quarter, reflecting stronger grain shipments versus 2015.", "The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.2%, up 1.1 percentage points from the second quarter last year. As positive core price and continued productivity improvements helped to somewhat offset the double-digit increase -- decrease in total volumes.", "While the second quarter was again challenging from a volume perspective, we continued focusing on initiatives that are squarely in our control, such as being productive with our resources, providing our customers with excellent service, and improving our safety performance.", "Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric.", "Eric Butler", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was down 11% with gains in Ag products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. Our volume sequentially improved through the quarter, with volumes down 15% in April and 6% in June.", "While we generated core pricing gains of 2%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharges, average revenue per car declined 2% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 13% reduction in freight revenue.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 3% on a 2% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume increased 10%, primarily due to stronger than expected export volumes, driven by South American harvest delays and strong corn demand to Mexico.", "Wheat shipments also increased, driven by global and U.S. demand for higher quality Canadian wheat. Grain product shipments were down 6% in the quarter, primarily due to soft DDG exports and increased inclusion of DDGs in domestic markets. Soybean meal carloads were down 6%, driven by declining export demand following 2015 record levels.", "Ethanol volumes were flat year-over-year. Food in refrigerated carloads grew 2%, as strong demand for import beer was partially offset by volume declines in refrigerated markets, resulting from abundant truck supply.", "Automotive revenue was down 13% in the quarter, driven by 2% decrease in volume and 11% reduction in average revenue per car. Revenue in all were negatively impacted by mix of stronger parts growth, which has a lower average revenue per car then finished vehicles. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 10% driven by mix, production levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific plants and contract changes.", "The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the second quarter automotive sales were 17.1 million vehicles; however, June finished at 16.6 million, perhaps indicating softening consumer demand. Auto parts volume increased 9%, driven primarily by new over the road conversions.", "Chemicals revenue was down 5% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 2% decline in average revenue per car. Plastics volume was down 5%, driven by lower polyethylene shipments and softening exports as the U.S. dollar remained strong. Fertilizer was down 6% as a result of weak exports on potash shipments, resulting from depressed global demand and softness in domestic Ag markets.", "Strength in other areas including growth in industrial chemicals partially offset these declines. We continue to see significant headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 46% during the quarter due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Excluding crude oil shipments, chemicals volume was up 1% in the quarter.", "Coal revenue declined 27% for the quarter on a 21% decrease in volume and an 8% decline in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin and Colorado Utah rail shipments were down both 23% in the quarter, again driven by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. Export coal shipments were lower due to depressed international coal prices combined with a strong U.S. dollar.", "PRB coal inventory levels in June were 105 days, down six days from May, but still 35 days above the five year average. 32 million tons of PRB coal were burned in June, which was 47% higher than what was burned in May. Industrial products revenue was down 14% on an 11% decline in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter.", "Minerals volume was down 32% for the -- in the quarter. Frac sand shipments declined 43%, driven by weakened demand from low oil prices and market shifts to short-haul brown sand alternatives. Metal shipments declined 11% year-over-year as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity and strong import levels associated with the strength of the U.S. dollar.", "Construction products volume was down 4% as severe wetting and flooding in Texas delayed construction activity. Intermodal revenue was down 16% on a 14% decline in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car.", "Domestic volume declined 6% in the quarter, driven by sluggish demand for consumer goods and a tough prior year comp resulting from the discontinuation of the Triple Crown business late last year.", "Market dynamics due to excess ship capacity resulted in ocean carrier financial challenges and shipping industry consolidation. As a result, international shipments were down 22%, driven by slow trans-Pacific trade and a volume loss by UPMI containership carriers.", "To wrap-up, let's take a look at our outlook for the second half of the year. For the third quarter, we expect continued sequential volume improvement as we soar towards the end of the second quarter.", "In Ag products, we expect high grain inventory levels, strong domestic crop expectations, and weakness in South American crops to drive strength in second half grain shipments.", "Grain products will continue to face year-over-year comp headwinds and the global soybean meal market, as exports will not match the record levels set in 2015. Strength in import beer is expected throughout 2016.", "Moving to autos, recent economic forecasts suggest annual light vehicle sales for the full year 2016 will be 17.5 million vehicles, driving both finished autos and parts, including over the road conversions.", "We expect low gasoline prices will help sustain demand. However, we are carefully watching second half production and sales levels. We expect coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels, export demand, and weather.", "We remain optimistic about most of our chemicals markets despite the persistence of headwinds created by low crude oil prices. We expect continued growth in LPG and industrial chemicals volumes will be partially offset by softness in the fertilizer market.", "In industrial products, reduced drilling activity will continue to negatively impact our minerals and metals rock volumes for the remainder of the year. The improving construction and housing market should drive growth in our lumber and rock volumes.", "Finally in Intermodal, we expect international lines will continue to be negatively impacted by excess ship capacity, ocean carrier financial challenges, and the resulting ocean carrier industry consolidation.", "On the domestic side, we continue to be optimistic about growth opportunities from highway conversions. While there are a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise provides opportunities for growth in the slowly strengthening economy. We will continue to intently focus on strengthening our customer value proposition and developing new business opportunities.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.", "Cameron Scott", "Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 15% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.70. Included in this was a record low number of severe injuries which have the greatest human and financial impact. The team's commitment to successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace continues to generate positive results as we improve toward our goal of zero incidents.", "With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first half reportable rate of 3.43 decreased 1% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investments helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who did not meet the reportable threshold to a new record low.", "In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.40. While this was a step back from last year's solid performance, we're confident with our efforts and initiatives to successfully identify those crossings where incidents were more likely to occur.", "Combined with our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships, and public safety campaigns, we fully expect to drive improvements in the future.", "Moving to network performance, after experiencing relatively mild winter weather conditions to start off the year, flooding events in the southern region of our network did present some challenges during the second quarter. Weather events always generate variability in the network, but it's something that we are accustomed to dealing with.", "Utilizing the diverse strengths of our franchise, we rerouted traffic where possible; temporary utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews as our employees worked diligently to restore operations.", "These efforts kept the impact to a minimum including the delays of disruptions experienced by our customers. Overall velocity and terminal dwell improved 8% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of 2015.", "Moving on to resources. Coming into the quarter, our resource position was efficiently balanced for the volume levels we were experiencing at the time. Throughout the quarter, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource levels to continually account for volume changes and productivity gains.", "As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline.", "In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed to mitigate the impact from weather incidents and to handle the sequential volume uptick we experienced toward the tail end of the second quarter.", "We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business to lower demand. This includes our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,500 employees, or 7%, versus the second quarter of last year. In addition, our active locomotive fleet was down 14% from the second quarter of 2015.", "While adjusting our resource to demand will always be a key focus area, overall productivity for us goes well beyond this effort. One primary area we continue to make progress is train length. While we're unable to overcome the volume decline within the scheduled Intermodal network, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories.", "The fluidity and productivity our network has also reflected in the second quarter lower re-crew rate. A failure cost incurred when the first crew has inefficient time to complete the trip and the second crew is needed.", "In summary, we made solid progress on several fronts in the second quarter. As we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy to continue yielding record results while we make further operational improvements by leveraging the strengths of our diverse franchise to enhance the customer experience.", "And we will continue to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network to reduce costs. As a result of these efforts, our network is in a solid position to leverage volume growth to the bottom-line to increase utilization of existing assets.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert Knight", "Good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 12% versus last year, significantly lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter.", "Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 11% improvement compared to last year. Partially offsetting some of the productivity was the impact of weather on our southern region operations as well as the unfortunate Oregon derailment in June.", "The total operating expense impact from these two events was approximately $16 million or about $0.01 per share. In addition to the impact on earnings, we also incurred about $15 million in capital expenditures as a result of these disruptions. Operating income totaled $1.7 billion, a 15% decrease from last year.", "Below the line, other income totaled $77 million, down $65 million versus 2015. The $113 million California real estate sale gain recorded last year was partially offset by a $50 million real estate sale gain in the second quarter of this year.", "Interest expense of $173 million was up 13% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, partially offset by lower effective interest rates. Income tax expense decreased 20% to $585 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings.", "Net income totaled nearly $1 billion; down 19% versus 2015 while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combined to produce a quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share.", "Now turning to our topline, freight revenue of $4.4 billion was down 13% versus last year. Volume declined 11% and fuel surcharge revenue totaled $87 million, down $240 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.06 headwind earnings in the second quarter versus last year.", "Remember, we have about 60 different fuel surcharge recovery programs in place with our customers and coming into the second quarter, diesel fuel prices were below entry thresholds for many of these programs. By the end of the quarter, this situation was starting to reverse as fuel prices have edged up.", "Assuming fuel prices remain where they are today, we will collect fuel surcharge revenue at some level on most of our programs going forward once we get past the two-month lag. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was about flat, moderating from the last couple of quarters as we expected.", "The primary drivers of mix this quarter were significant declines in frac sand and finished vehicles, offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 2%.", "Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Although a smaller increase than the first quarter, pricing continued to be a positive and above inflation. For the full year, we estimate inflation to be about 1.5%.", "Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies, and fewer people in the training pipeline.", "Labor inflation was about 1.5% in the second quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which is partially offset by some favorable pension expense. We expect full year labor inflation to be around 2%.", "Looking at our total workforce levels for the quarter, our employee counts declined 12%, or almost 6,000, as a result of lower volumes and our G55 + 0 productivity initiatives. Sequentially, total work force levels were down a little more than 1% from the first quarter of 2016.", "And excluding employees associated with our capital projects, workforce levels were down almost 3% from the first quarter and down about 6% from the fourth quarter of last year.", "For the remainder of the year, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volumes, as we have experienced thus far, but we also expect to continue generating G55-related labor productivity as well.", "Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $346 million, down 36% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with an 11% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% while our average fuel price declined 27% to $1.45 per gallon.", "Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense decreased 5% to $570 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and freight car fleets.", "Depreciation expense was $504 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.", "Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $286 million, which is down 8% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes and reduced locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of this decline.", "Other expenses came in at $244 million, up 8% versus last year. Higher personal injury expense was the primary driver for the increase due to unfavorable results in a few prior year claims. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% or so, excluding any large unusual items.", "Turning to our operating ratio, the second quarter operating ratio came in at 65.2%, 1.1 points unfavorable when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by two points in the quarter.", "Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the first half totaled more than $3.5 billion, down about $250 million when compared to the first half of 2015. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $760 million for the first half.", "Taking a look at the balance sheet, our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.2 billion at quarter end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9, up from 1.7 at year end, as we continue to target a ratio of less than two times. For the first six months of the year, we have brought back about 16.3 million shares, totaling over $1.3 billion.", "Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased more than 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year.", "So, that's a recap of the second quarter results. Looking out to the rest of the year, we expect volume will continue to be a challenge, even though year-over-year volume comparisons do get easier in the second half. We would expect total third quarter volumes to be down around 6% or so. And coal could still be down about 20% or so when compared to the third quarter of last year.", "We now expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range, depending primarily on how the demand for consumer goods plays out in the second half. While it is unlikely we would be able to improve the operating ratio this year with volume reduction in this range, we will of course continue to focus on achieving positive core pricing and strong productivity to drive the best margins possible. Longer-term, however, we still expect to achieve our 60% operating ratio guidance, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019.", "On the capital front, we're still targeting $3.675 billion for this year, which is down over $600 million from 2015. As for next year and beyond, we are taking a hard look at our future capital spending requirements and it is likely that we will need less than the 16% to 17% of revenue that we have been targeting. In fact, it could be closer to 15% or so, but we are still working through the details.", "We are diligently continuing to drive productivity improvement throughout the company. Our entire organization is energized and intensely focused on finding more efficient ways to run our operations and safely serve our customers. Many of our productivity initiatives are well underway and several others are scheduled to ramp up in the coming months.", "We're confident that our new G55 mindset will provide our customers with an excellent service experience and will drive financial performance for our shareholders well into the future.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you, Rob. As you've heard from everyone here this morning, we continued to experience a challenging business environment in the second quarter, resulting in weak demand across many of our commodity groups.", "A soft global economy, the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports, and relatively weak demand for consumer goods will continue to pressure volumes through the second half of the year.", "That said, we see potential bright spots in certain segments of our business if key economic drivers continue to strengthen, as they have in recent weeks. For example, energy prices, especially natural gas, have been recovering somewhat from previous lows, which is positive for our coal and shale-related business.", "We're also cautiously optimistic that the overall grain market will strengthen in the second half, of course, depending on the outcome of this year's crop harvest and global agricultural economic conditions.", "Beyond the impact of the current macro environment, we are implementing a strategy that will make us a stronger company for the future. This strategy comprises six primary value tracks and you've heard these themes woven throughout our comments today.", "These tracks include our unrelenting focus on achieving world-class safety while delivering an excellent customer experience. They include striving for innovation and resource productivity, both designed to improve our work processes so we can make the most out of what we have.", "Finally, the tracks are about maximizing the franchise with an engaged team, empowering our employees to effectively utilize our assets, our service products, our market reach, and our proprietary technology. And, of course, our G55 and Zero initiatives cut across all six of these tracks.", "In the months and years ahead, we will continue our intense focus on these value tracks to create competitive advantages for our customers, enhanced safety and satisfaction for our employees, strength in the communities that we serve, and solid returns for our shareholders.", "With that, let's open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Hey good morning, and thanks for taking my call.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning Brian.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "I just had a couple of quick questions, one on coal and Chris the weather and natural gas inventories are affecting demand there. Can you see anything from -- pressure from renewable energy specifically from wind, is that continuing to take a little bit of share here and we've seen the production tax credits -- investment tax credits were extended at the end of last year. So, I'll be curious to see if you're seeing the impact your utility customers?", "Eric Butler", "Yeah, Brian, this is Eric. So, you're correct, there is continued expansion of wind capability kind of in the energy space throughout the country. Most of wind has to be backed up by some other source of power because you can't depend on it completely as you know. It is not a material year-over-year impact for us in terms of our coal burned or coal space.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Okay. And then just one quick one on Intermodal and clearly you've outlined some of the challenges on the international side. Just wondering if the safety [Indiscernible] mandate hit constant volatility maybe on the volume side as we heard some shippers were moving volumes ahead of the July 1st mandate. So curious to see if you have seen any of that which would perhaps be weighing on volumes now and if you had to make any adjustments for the on duck rail to satisfy that weight certification requirements when that rolled out earlier this month?", "Eric Butler", "Yeah, Brian the sole-less [ph] thing as you said was effective July 1. As you know the shippers are responsible for certifying all of those weights. As far as we can tell that has not been impact on the supply chain, so it is not been an impact on us and we can't tell yet any significant impact on the full supply chain.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Okay. Thanks Eric. Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions/", "Scott Group", "Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.", "Lance Fritz", "Morning Scott.", "Scott Group", "So, Rob, why don't you just follow-up on your comments about the operating ratio that you don't necessarily expect improvement this year. I get that as a full year comment maybe can you talk about the second half of the year as the volume declines or moderating, do you think that margin improvement in the second half of the year is possible? And then just with that I don't think I heard a guidance for headcount sequentially in 3Q if you have any color there.", "Robert Knight", "Yeah, Scott, a couple of comments. One, yes my commentary on the operating ratio was a full year comment because as you know we have previously said our expectation earlier in the year was call it mid-single-digit volume decline for the full year and with that assumption improvement year-over-year on the operating ratio and with the revised volume guidance for the full year what we're saying there or signaling there is that we are very focused on continuing to improve our margins, but the year-over-year improvement looks less likely at this stage of the game.", "But having said that, that does imply -- our guidance on volume does imply and our guidance on our commitment to improving our margins does imply that we expect to making continued improvement from here on our operating ratio and not only this year but as we strive to continue to meet that full year 2019 60 plus or minus.", "On the headcount question, yeah, we had very good performance as it relates to headcount in the second quarter. Volumes, obviously, play a role in that, but as you know, Scott, depending on what volumes actually are combined with of our focus on G55 productivity initiatives, our headcount will move up or down with volume and our expectations from this going forward backed up by our volume guidance is that sequentially we do expect our volumes to improve from where we are today that would suggest that headcounts will move up, but not one for one.", "And by the time we finish the full year, I would expect that you'll see us clearly down year-over-year, but it will all depend upon exactly how the volumes play out.", "Scott Group", "Okay. And Rob, so you\u2019re not making comments about third or fourth quarter operating ratio year-over-year?", "Robert Knight", "I am not. Other than we're very focused and expect particularly with improving volume that we'll continue to improve where we are today.", "Scott Group", "Okay. And then just quickly on the CapEx side, I think maybe if you could get to 15% of revenue or so next year is that something that we can expect for not just 2017, but for kind of a few years just given the excess locomotives and the lack of the need to buy locomotives for probably two, three, four years or something?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, Scott, this is Lance. The basis for that guidance is as we look out into out years, call it the planning horizon, we think demand on our part for new locomotives is going to be pretty muted and we think PTC drops off to a very low level if any.", "And you just account for those two line items in this year's capital plan and it\u2019s a significant chunk of capital. So, that's the underlying thought process behind moving more towards 15% as opposed to 16% to 17%.", "Scott Group", "It sounds like it should be more than 17, it should be more ongoing.", "Lance Fritz", "Yeah. It's our planning horizon. So, I would say you're right, it's beyond 17.", "Scott Group", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.", "Allison Landry", "Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sequential downtick in the core pricing number and whether that was driven at all by contract renewals or changes in the inflation indices. And then do you think we're at a cyclical low point there?", "Eric Butler", "Yeah. So, Allison, this is Eric. There was some minus sequential softening in [Indiscernible]. We think the 2% price that we turned in is positive and it continues to be above inflation, but it also is reflective in of market that we have there is surplus capacity in the market on all modes of traffic.", "We continue with our strategy. We continue to price to the value that we bring and we think we're bringing a substantial value and we're improving our value and we continue to take as you said in the past a targeted market-based approach on pricing. If you look in the future, you do see capacity tightening across all modes of traffic and we continue to be positive about our ability to price our value the future.", "Allison Landry", "Okay. Rob I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that your expectations for full year inflation was about one and a half. Is that the right way to think about inflation in the second quarter, in other words spreads about 50 bps which is similar to Q1?", "Robert Knight", "Allison, that's directionally correct, but I would just kind of remind everyone while inflation is low against historical levels, we aren\u2019t really -- it's not mechanically terms of how we price, but, yes, I think directionally those are probably not bad numbers.", "Allison Landry", "Okay. And then just maybe a question on coal, you mentioned the higher burn rates in June with obviously pretty hot summer. When we think about that versus the elevated inventory levels, do you think sort of the normal sequential increase in the 2H versus 1H for coal carloads similar to historical levels which I think is somewhere in the high single-digit range?", "Lance Fritz", "Allison, I don't think we can give an outlook on kind of what sequential changes we'll see going forward. We do expect the inventory levels to go down the burn rate is increased as you have hot weather. You are seeing volumes grow and I think we'll see those trends continuing. I don't think we could be any more precise than that.", "Allison Landry", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay, thanks. I wanted to ask a question about mix. So, I think mix was flat in the quarter and has been improving the last couple of quarters. I guess just wanted to get a sense, I think the outlook for the full year a quarter or so ago was -- I think continue to state relatively negative, but maybe eases as the year goes on.", "Can you give us any thoughts Rob maybe how to think about that as we go into the third and fourth quarter coal getting all better, maybe grain getting a little bit better? Is it possible to see a positive?", "Robert Knight", "Chris, I mean as you know we don't give guidance on mix because of the moving parts and I would just say as you've heard me say many times, I think that's basically true for our franchise because we have such a diverse set of business mixes that we in fact are playing in not only at a macro level, but mix within mix at the commodity level. So, as a result we can't and don't give specific guidance.", "But we did say we knew certainly the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year were unusually high given some of the mix and we thought it would start to moderate throughout the year and it has.", "So, I would expect that I wouldn't give guidance that will be plus or minus, but I think it was reasonable to assume that look sort of more normal if you will could be plus, could be minus as the year plays out depending on actually what volumes move.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay. But generally speaking some of those heavier bulk commodities generally are positive to the mix dynamic?", "Robert Knight", "Generally, but again, Chris, as I think you know and others perhaps as well, you can have mix within mix. So, using our example of coal you can have a mix of positive or negative even just within the coal line.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Of course, that's helpful, that definitely makes sense. I wanted to ask you about the competitive dynamic particularly on the Intermodal side but generally competitive pricing in the West. I know you guys compete every day for the business that you win, but over the course of the last couple of quarters, just wanted to get a sense of sort of where that -- how that competition has been sort of shaking out, particularly on the domestic Intermodal side which I think was down again this quarter. I just want to see how that's kind of playing out?", "Has it gotten any more difficult to win business from a rail perspective as opposed to trucks, we obviously know what's going on with the truck pricing, but just want to get a sense of how that's playing out?", "Robert Knight", "Yeah, Chris I think you said it right, we compete vigorously every day for business we have strong real competitor, strong truck competitors. We have strong water barge shipping competitors and you're exactly right we compete vigorously.", "We do think we have a strong value proposition and we think that with that strong value proposition we can compete effectively on that value proposition and price for the value that we're providing to the marketplace.", "As I said earlier you're seeing capacity tighten and many of those modes and we think that's positive for the competitive environment, but, yes, we compete vigorously every day.", "Chris Wetherbee", "And that tightening is that a current event or something you would expect maybe in 2017, just want to make sure I'm clear about that?", "Robert Knight", "So, as you go forward you certainly know what's happening in terms of the trucking regulations that are out there like electronic logs and the impact that, that's going to have. I think you have seen in the last couple of months a number of large trucking companies as part of their public pronouncements discuss what they see with capacity trends and their predictions about tightening.", "You see kind of in the ship space some of the consolidations that are going on. So, I think it is kind of across all volumes. Of course you see rail volumes picking up. So, I think across all modes, you see that tightening.", "Chris Wetherbee", "That's helpful. Thanks for the color guys. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Thanks very much and good morning. The first question I wanted to ask was on your optimism for the second half in grain. Up to now you've been a little bit cautious about being optimistic in that segment. Just given your view on storage in the U.S., I just wondered if you could update is there in your thoughts.", "Eric Butler", "Hopefully -- this is Eric, hopefully, I was sounding more balanced than optimistic, but if you look at storage right now, there is -- storage is about 30% higher, storage of all types, grain, beans et cetera than what the five year average has been.", "And then if you look at the crop there was something like 6 million more acres of corn planted this year and it's still dependent upon kind of the weather and the harvest, but right now it looks like it's going to be pretty decent yields from the current crop.", "And so if you look at the pretty decent yields from the current crop if you look at the high storage levels on a historical basis, if you look at some of the challenges -- in particular South American crops that have had, it suggests that there's going to be opportunity to move grain in the second half of the year at a higher run rate than what we saw in the first half.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Right. And in terms of thinking about how much of your Ag products segment is really sensitive to the size of the crop. Should we be thinking about that grain sub-segment or are grain products movements also very sensitive to their size of the crop?", "Eric Butler", "Grains clearly -- our grain products are from the standpoint. The driver in grain products is ethanol is a large portion of that and then next kind of the soybean meals. And so those are also very sensitive to the crops and basically the crop pricing and whether or not ethanol will be in the money.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Great. That's all for me. Thank you.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Ravi Shanker", "Thanks, morning everyone. You said earlier that you don't necessarily price -- set your price to be 50 basis points above inflation. Can you just talk about what might be any structure drivers that kind of keeps that margin and prevents pricing from closing the gap further to inflation?", "Lance Fritz", "Ravi, this is Lance. When you think about pricing for us you start at the highest level which is we try to provide excellent customer service and excellent experience which generates value for our customers when we price for that.", "In that context, we're constantly looking to make a reasonable return, so that it's a re-investable piece of business. And then we have the reality of the dynamics of other competitive modes or competition.", "You put that altogether and that's what informs our ability to price. So, when you think about it going forward, you know markets that have less modal capacity, markets that are robust and growing strongly those are better markets to price in than not. But that generally informs our pricing scheme.", "Ravi Shanker", "Okay. And I had a follow-up on coal as well. You touched upon this in response to pervious question. But the 3Q coal outlook looked somewhat soft given the step up in the burn; I'm wondering if you think that that's not sustainable or why that would not -- why inventories will not be drawn down further.", "And also when you look out into 2017, there's some folks talking about a potential coal book where you see a V-shape recovery in 2017, just given drawdowns, how would you dimension that or what kind of probability would you assigned to case like that?", "Lance Fritz", "Ravi, I think you're right if you look at kind of the burn, the burn has stepped up, but the inventory still are high on a relative basis. They are still 35 days higher than a five year average. So, you have to burn off those inventories even as the burn has stepped up. And so that is a headwind to growing coal volumes in the third quarter.", "As you look at the outlook for next year as we say always it depends on weather, it depends on natural gas pricing, it depends on energy consumption. So, that's what's going to drive in the future.", "Ravi Shanker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.", "Thomas Wadewitz", "Yeah. Good morning. Quick one first on inventories, I don't think you've commented on inventories in the effect on Intermodal, does that situation seem to be getting any better or is that still an issue that makes it hard to see a lot of improvement in Intermodal volumes?", "Eric Butler", "Tom, inventories have gotten better -- have retreated from the seven year highs that we saw last month. They are still high in a relative basis, but they are coming down.", "Lance Fritz", "Tom, to add a little technicolor to that in that domestic Intermodal space something that Eric continually reminds us is that there's a lot of opportunity out there from a truck competitive perspective. And that really informs a pretty good portion of our ability to grow. That overall consumer demand and demand for goods is what is informed that retail to sales inventory ratio and inventory in general.", "Thomas Wadewitz", "Okay. Thank you. And then the second question how would you -- I was just wondering if you kind of frame the way we would think about operating leverage as volumes get less worse and then hopefully in 2017 they actually grow.", "Given current train length and ability to expand that given the initiatives Lance that you mentioned, how would we think about the operating leverage and kind of how long you can go with handling volume without adding a whole lot of incremental cost?", "Lance Fritz", "Cameron?", "Cameron Scott", "With the amount of locomotives we have in storage, the locomotive productivity leverage is fantastic. On the employee side, depending on where growth shows up, we will continue to bring furloughed employees back and potentially transfer employees to the part of the network where growth is residing.", "So, we continue to see our employee pipeline staying very, very lean and there is great opportunity in every category with train size. Our coal network is truly the only network that is optimized to a very large extent every other network we have has plenty of headroom to train size.", "Thomas Wadewitz", "Okay. Can you size that, is that 10% room or 20% or is there a way to kind of frame that train size opportunity?", "Cameron Scott", "I think you see as quarter-to-quarter making continued improvement and we feel very confident you'll continue to see that.", "Lance Fritz", "Hey Tom, this is Lance, again. We've done a nice job staying ahead of demand in terms of overall capacity whether it's fungible capacity or track capacity. Clearly at this point, given how we've built out the network and we're supporting hundred and 180,000 or 190,000 seven-day carloads a couple of years ago, we've ample capacity for growth at this point.", "Robert Knight", "We won't do this, I promise on to many questions, Tom. This is Rob and I have to pile on. All of that leverage that we're confident in that Cam and Lance just talked through are all embedded in that drive to that 60 plus or minus operating ratio and of course, as you know we're striving to even set our sights beyond that at 55. So, it's that confidence that we are well-positioned with positive volume growth to be in a great position of leveraging that.", "Thomas Wadewitz", "Great. Okay. Thanks for all the perspective. Appreciate it.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions", "Kenneth Hoexter", "Hey, Great. Good morning. Just want to follow-up on the international side of Intermodal. Eric you talked a bit about carrier consolidation, I wouldn't think that has much to do with the demand side that's been filling their slots or the oversupply in the market.", "Would -- what you're thoughts on the state of global trade? Seems like we're starting to see some of the port volumes pick up a bit, just wanted to see if that's something you're seeing as well as any or is that a shift from the Panama Canal change or Suez Canal any thoughts on the state of global trade?", "Eric Butler", "Yeah, so I think if you look at the absolute volumes in the TT [ph] trait, they are not strong. There are some period-to-period kind of shifts going on and you do see some of the business that shifted to the canal because of the strike just gradually coming back there. So, that's kind of coloring some of the trend, but the TT trade volumes are relatively weak from a historical standpoint.", "If you look at the carrier consolidation issues, there's huge volatility going on in there. As I mentioned at the last earnings release significant volatility in terms of mergers, acquisitions and that volatility does have impact to the supply chain depending on which carriers have what book of business that you're aligned with. So, that volatility is impacting what we see in the supply chain.", "Kenneth Hoexter", "Great. Rob any thoughts on the balance sheet, obviously, pretty strong situation here. Thoughts on increasing the buyback accelerating given the volatility in the stock just kind of your thoughts on cash flow?", "Robert Knight", "I mean Ken, as you know, it all starts with driving a stronger cash flow as we can and we're obviously committed on returning cash to shareholders and we'll continue to be opportunistic in terms of at what price and when and how much we actually buyback. So, same philosophy, focus on generating as much cash as we can, so that we're in a high class challenge of deciding what to do with that cash and I would expect it will continue to be opportunistic as we move forward on the share buybacks.", "Kenneth Hoexter", "Great. Thanks for the thoughts.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.", "Eric Morgan", "Good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on some of your grain comments. Sounds like the set-up from harvest perspective is pretty constructive, I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more color specifically with corn prices coming down so much recently and the dollar still strong. If there is enough storage capacity could we be in a similar environment as last year where farmers just don't want to move the crops?", "Eric Butler", "Eric, I think you have piped all of the dynamics exactly correct quarter prices are coming down. They are projected to come down even more because of the strong harvest that is projected to come, but there is an issue where it will have to move, so that is exactly the dynamic that's going on.", "There is probably some headwinds to farmers wanting to move it, but there's probably some physical logistics where they have to move it and that's some of I think what we're seeing in the outlook.", "Eric Morgan", "Okay, I appreciate it. And just a quick one is there kind of good way to think about land sales going forward?", "Lance Fritz", "I'm sorry, Brandon, could you repeat that?", "Eric Morgan", "Just on the other income line is there a good run rate to think about with respect to land sales.", "Lance Fritz", "I'm sorry.", "Eric Butler", "Eric, no, I mean other income plus or minus 150 is kind of a number, but no, those tend to be as you've seen lumpy and there's no straight-line way of thinking about that.", "Eric Morgan", "Okay. Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hoffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeffrey Hoffman", "Thank you. Hey Eric, I just wanted to ask you a question about in the money which I think something came up a few questions ago. If we look at Powder River Basin coal, say relative to Western markets, relative to some of the Midwest markets, just where prices are now, where prices may or may not be and if I look at ethanol with corn prices down and diesel fuel prices up how close are we to be in the money on these products in terms of the forward outlook?", "Eric Butler", "So, I assume you're asking a coal question and ethanol question separately? So, on the coal question I would say it depends on what energy region you're in, what ISO, what RT you're in; it depends on the utility that's within that region. So, it depends on a lot of different things.", "I think it's instructive to look at the fact of the reference increase in burn month-over-month to indicate that clearly there are a lot more utilities and -- that are in the money just if you look at that increase burn. So, that would be my coal comment.", "In terms of ethanol, I think ethanol from a use standpoint is \"always in the money\" because it is needed as a necessary oxygen and a replacement for the MBTEs for gasoline and so as gasoline volumes go, ethanol blending with that will go the question is how much margin the ethanol manufacturers are making. But ethanol is more driven by gasoline sales and then need to get the oxygenate and the replacement for the MBTEs.", "LanceFritz", "Hey, Jeff just one piece on that PRB answer and that is while natural gas where it is right now 270-ish plus or minus has put some additional units \"in the money\" I think in the context you're asking are weather in the central part of the country and in the Southeast is helping tremendously with increased electricity demand and that's putting more units online just from a raw demand perspective.", "Jeffrey Hoffman", "That's where I was going with this is to the extent you have incremental burn demand, are you more in the money and more likely to be moving coal. Just one last follow-up Eric on the brown sand comment that you made on the frac sand, are we getting to the point where we're seeing increased demand for the white frac sand or not yet?", "Eric Butler", "Yeah, so if you look at the number of drilling rigs they're up modestly -- I think the number is -- you're going from like 400 rigs to 430 rigs or something like that, that's close to probably what the number is compared to 1,000 rigs last year.", "So, it's increased modestly because the price of fuel has increased and there is slightly more drilling activity. I think the amount of white sand we'll see will be a direct correlation to as drilling activity comes on you'll see white sand demand go up.", "Jeffrey Hoffman", "All right. Hey congratulations in a tough quarter and thank you.", "Eric Butler", "Thank you.", "LanceFritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.", "Justin Long", "Thanks, and good morning.", "LanceFritz", "Good morning.", "Justin Long", "So, I wanted to ask about the volume guidance for a 6% to 8% decline for the full year. So, that's worse than your guidance last quarter for a mid-single-digit decline, but if we look at 2Q volumes, they finished fairly close to your initial expectation for a 10% decline. And it sounds like you're a little more incrementally positive on coal and grain. So, can you just help us understand what drove this guidance reduction in terms of the volumes seems like in the back half of the year?", "Robert Knight", "Yeah, Justin this is Rob, I would say the biggest piece and I totally understand your question because you're exactly right in the terms of the way you map through that is centers around the consumer. I mean it centers around the Intermodal product as much as anything else in the cautiousness that we're expressing today.", "You're right, we did come in a little bit stronger in the second quarter, largely driven that pick up in coal. If you look at the difference in the second quarter where we finish what we had guided to, but the full year number simply said is largely driven by that consumer cautiousness that we're seeing in the Intermodal space.", "Justin Long", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And secondly I wanted to get your thoughts around how your core price increases in general merchandise are trending relative to your core price increases in Intermodal. I know you don't break that out specifically, but are you seeing general merchandise in Intermodal pricing trending up at similar levels or is the Intermodal increase something like 100 basis points less because of the excess capacity in truckload?", "Robert Knight", "Justin, you nailed it when you said you know we don't give that break out because we endeavor to price to market and drive value in every one of our commodity groups, but we don't break out by commodity as you're striving for.", "Justin Long", "But just from a high level can you say that general merchandise prices decreases are above what you're seeing in Intermodal?", "Robert Knight", "No, and I would say number one, it varies each sort of negotiation is separate, but I wouldn't even go so far as to say that.", "Justin Long", "Okay. Fair enough I appreciate the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.", "David Vernon", "Great. Thanks for taking the question. Cameron maybe a question for you. It looks like the volatility of ocean carrier alliances and some of the changing of vessel causes is bringing down that international Intermodal, and you still have like 5% reduction in train length. How long do you think it will be before you can get that back up or should we be expecting you to kind of have to deal with that lower train length because of the headwind?", "Cameron Scott", "We adjust our Intermodal program on a weekly basis looking at inbound volumes that Eric does his best to forecast. And so balancing customer requirements and productivity is always a tight rope. Our first priority is to take care of our customers. And so we will continue to make those adjustments on week-by-week basis.", "David Vernon", "Would you expect that train length to back up?", "Cameron Scott", "As we step into the second half of the year depending as Rob outlined on what the consumer does driving Intermodal, we absolutely can bring that train size metric right back in line.", "David Vernon", "Okay. And then maybe Rob as a quick follow-up. Could you comment a little bit about the cadence of the operating results through the quarter, it would seem like you have been aggressively kind of pushing down on the headcount and then saw that sequential improvement into the volume growth I guess did results, was there any kind of a certain infection forward in result and the trajectory result as we move through the quarter?", "Robert Knight", "I'm following your question David, I would say no, I mean it was a continuation of our focus on being as efficient and as productive as we can which I think our results reflect lined up well given the unfortunate downturn in 11% volume. So, I would say there's nothing unique about that other than it was a good hard work across the entire organization to make the right decisions.", "David Vernon", "So, the run rate profitability was kind of the same at the beginning of the month as at the end of the month or end of quarter?", "Robert Knight", "Yeah, yet fuel was a big -- I would say there's nothing to call it there other than the fuel which rose late in the quarter.", "David Vernon", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Rob Solomon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.", "Rob Solomon", "Hey, thanks. Cameron, actually just to dig in a little bit more of with regard to the Intermodal train sizes, can you describe kind of what was going on with the domestic Intermodal train size versus the international and kind of the factors that was driving relative weakness that we saw with regard to train lengths?", "Cameron Scott", "On the domestic front, we will pay attention to what is being indicated on a weekly basis. We have extreme sensitivity to UPS and some of our LTL customers that we will always preference for any of those trains as long as the volumes are adequate.", "And as I said on the international side, we really depend on Eric's forecast on what is hitting our ports and we'll make the appropriate decisions on a week-to-week basis.", "The good news on the Intermodal front, despite the decline, is that there is plenty of opportunity to increase train size as we see volumes coming back into that space.", "Eric Butler", "Yeah. Rob, this is Eric. I wouldn\u2019t had a lot of focus on kind of the train size in Intermodal. We're always adding different products and services as part of our growth and value proposition as part of our conversion strategy. And so you could be adding a product or service in the line and it will start small because it adds the potential to grow and that's part of the mix in train size that you'll always see.", "Rob Solomon", "Right. That makes sense. I guess Eric to kind of follow-up with regard to just kind of market dynamics, can you give us a sense if we take about automotive kind of on a very holistic basis including kind of inbound parts to the manufacturers of the automotive as well as the automotive part producers how big that represents and then maybe which networks that's running on between unit train and manifest?", "Eric Butler", "Okay. So, trying to make sure I understand your question so auto parts network is a growing network, it grew about 9%, 10% in the quarter. It's smaller than our multilevel network, but it is growing. Probably two-thirds, three quarters of it does run as part of our premium Intermodal network running container shipments and that's a necessity because it is a premium product.", "Rob Solomon", "Yeah. And if I think about just how big it is as a percentage of total volumes just look at the automotive line segments, it's little over 10%. But if I could kind of the metals that are going to the factories as well as parts in Intermodal that would be going to the automotive parts producers, how much additional volume would that represent for your network? Good rule of thumb, not really.", "Eric Butler", "I don't know if there's a good rule of thumb there.", "Robert Knight", "Rob, this is Rob, I would say you're using the auto's examples which is a good one and there are other examples where we enjoy to your point. We enjoy the sort of multiple move and in fact, I would just -- using your example I would say we also supply coal to the utilities providing the electricity to make the car. So, there's a lot of moving parts there, specifically what percent autos, we don't have that.", "Rob Solomon", "Okay. Thanks for the time guys.", "Lance Fritz", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jason Seidl", "Thanks operator. Hey guys, apologize if this was covered, but our phone dropped you for a little bit here. Eric you mentioned that there was a sequential increase in the burn from June to May, I think you said from May to June, I think you said 47%, what's the historical increase in burn?", "Eric Butler", "I don't have the historical number right at my fingertips. That is larger than it typically historical norm. As you know you do have the shelf month there and the second quarter because you are not heating or cooling and then you have the pickup cyclically, but that is higher than what you typically see.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay. That's good color. Also, I'm looking at your stock obviously under a little bit of pressure today, I think based on some of the incoming calls, I received there is a little bit of worry of your core pricing falling down a little bit. If you had the bucket the pressure on core pricing between loose truck capacity and increased competition from other rail carriers, how would you do it on a percentage basis?", "Eric Butler", "As a said before you know they are all low competitive factors that are going on. I mentioned earlier there might've been while you dropped off the call that there was surplus capacity in all loads truck capacity, shipping capacity, rail capacity, and you do see that capacity tightening across all modes as you look into the future.", "Jason Seidl", "But there wasn't one that was more prominent than the other as you look at 2Q?", "Eric Butler", "All of those factors are factors that go into our pricing and we price to our value and those are all factor.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay. Guys, thanks for the time as always I appreciate it.", "Eric Butler", "Thank you.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.", "John Barnes", "Hey good morning. I wanted to go back to your comment around maybe some of the logistics on the grain business. So, we had a couple of decent harvest over the last couple years and for whatever reason we keep hearing about storage is tight and yet the crop never seems to get moved.", "Have we finally get that inflection point where you know the storage is tight enough there is too much you know the prior harvest still in storage, this one just absolutely you it has to get moved this year.", "Eric Butler", "I don't know if I'm an expert on kind of the inflection point of total storage, I do think if you look at the trends and you're seeing some of the trends materialize even now storage is tight, farm income is under stress given the lower pricing. And so there is a cash flow dynamic for farmers in terms of holding versus selling that comes into play here.", "There is a demand that is picking up because of the weakness in some international markets like South American markets and then there is a big crop coming in. So, if you look at all of those things they do indicate that there is a high probability you are going to see strong moves.", "John Barnes", "Okay. And then you mentioned the difficulties in South America, strong U.S. dollar continues to plague the export activity. Is the domestic demand this year in domestic moves of grain going to be more important than they have been in years past? We see there may be less of this moving for export purposes?", "Eric Butler", "We do have a strong domestic franchise. As you know exports are picking up and they are all interrelated because to the extent you have strong export markets that takes the demand and we also participate in the export markets whether it's moving into the Gulf, moving into the River, moving into the West Coast particularly the P&W. So we have a strong domestic franchise, but the export markets also benefited us.", "Lance Fritz", "And Eric, recall John that Mexico is also an export market for us.", "John Barnes", "Okay, but you are saying that the export you actually are seeing some movement in the export side of the business.", "Eric Butler", "Export markets are picking up.", "John Barnes", "Okay. Very good. Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.", "Ben Hartford", "Good morning guys. Curious how you feel about service today relative to let's say the high water marks pre-2014 some of the metrics trends being one of them are back to those measures. Obviously, there is some mix and other elements of play but how do you feel about the \"service across the network today\" relative to prior to the issues that you in the industry experienced in early 2014?", "Lance Fritz", "Ben, this is Lance, when you think about our overall network in the service we are providing, absent the impacts of things like the flooding that we've experienced in Texas there's some just epic weather events, we're performing essentially at a 2013 or 2012 type level.", "So, our service performance level on average in aggregate is about as good as it's been for this kind of volume level. Our intent and what Cameron and team are constantly working on is ways to improve that, right. So 2012 and 2013 are a benchmark, they are not the only benchmark. We think we can do better than that over time and his team is constantly working with the commercial team and other functions of the railroad to try to find ways to improve that service product.", "Ben Hartford", "That's helpful. Are there any specific elements or areas of service where you don't believe that you are back to those 2012, 2013 benchmarks for still have some room to go?", "Lance Fritz", "Yeah, I would tell you we have room for improvement virtually everywhere and that's not a statement of not as good as 2012 or 2013 that's the statement of -- we are never perfect. There is always an opportunity to run the network more on time from original terminal to making sure we don't leave any cars behind to running the premium domestic Intermodal product at greater speeds or at more significant -- significantly reduced span. All of those things are within our visuals and we're working on all of them.", "Ben Hartford", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Mark Levin with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Mark Levin", "Hey guys, thanks for the time. Most of my questions have been asking and answered. I just wanted to see if there was any potential impact from the Mexican Excise Tax Credit benefit the one that KSU alluded to yesterday?", "Robert night", "No.", "Mark Levin", "No benefit whatsoever.", "Robert night", "Right. ", "Mark Levin", "Okay, great. And then with regard to auto yield and the mix headwind that you mentioned this quarter, when you look forward is that something as we model RPU in the auto segment we should be mindful of what type of expectations should we have as that looking forward there?", "Eric Butler", "Our auto part businesses growing faster than our finished vehicle's business because that is the growth area as you saw that in the second quarter auto-parts business as a lower RPUs than the finished vehicle's business.", "Mark Levin", "And will the decrease moderate or is that sort of a way to think about that going forward this quarter?", "Eric Butler", "There aren't decreases, the auto-parts business is growing.", "Mark Levin", "Great. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Lance Fritz", "All right Mark.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead with your question.", "Donald Broughton", "Good morning gentlemen.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning Don.", "Donald Broughton", "Help me understand better core pricing, obviously it's a very challenging environment as you reported your core pricing essentially cut in half over the last four or five quarters. Does your reported 2% core pricing represent the pricing achieved on all new contracts settled in that quarter -- for instance the 2% being just those settled in the second quarter or does that represent the amount of year-over-year gains made in your overall book of business?", "Robert Knight", "Yeah, Don, this is Rob. The way we calculate that core price number is what do we actually yield in the quarter from our pricing actions and as you think note when we calculations that I'm proud to say is ultraconservative and that is we take it across our entire book of revenue even as a work contracts that are being repriced in that particular timeframe it is what do we yield overall.", "And would also just want to of course as you know given that calculation when we don't have the benefit of positive growth in commodities like coal, we obviously no longer have any of the legacy renewals, I mean that's part of the change if you look at where we are today versus where we were a year plus ago.", "Donald Broughton", "What a second Rob, I'm a little confused. So, it's the contracts reset in the quarter and their effect in the overall book is that what you mean?", "Robert Knight", "No, it's not necessarily what was reset in the quarter but what dollars. The calculus is simply what dollars to be a from price increases during the quarter. So, if perhaps was something that was reset prior to the quarter, but that's -- and again what did we yield against our entire book of revenue.", "Donald Broughton", "So, the denominator in the equation is the overall book of business?", "Robert Knight", "That's right", "Donald Broughton", "So, that means the core pricing to deteriorate from 4% to 3.5% to 3% to 2.5% to 2%, it means the pricing you are cheating on all new contracts is actually less than 2%.", "Eric Butler", "Don, there's a number of moving parts and Rob just walked you through them. One thing that's happening is we might've achieved incremental price on a piece of business that isn\u2019t moving or isn\u2019t moving at the same volume. So, we don't get the benefit of that price. It doesn't affect the topline. It could be that ALF is changing period-to-period there is a number of moving parts there you can't just presume the calculus is lower yields period-to-period.", "Donald Broughton", "Right. But if the -- for the overall -- if the denominator is the overall book of business in the rate increase has to be less than what the core is that you are stating no matter how perverse the mix gets?", "Robert Knight", "We're agreeing that the yield from the pricing this quarter for lots of different reasons was lower", "Donald Broughton", "Okay. So, then let me ask another question is there a floor -- is there a rate of core pricing at which you're going to simply draw the line and say no, we will not accept less pricing than that, we'll lose the volume if we have to, but we're not going to accept a lower level of pricing than say 1% or 1.5% or 2%.", "Eric Butler", "Don, we've stated even earlier in this call there is a floor and a floor is it re-investable and does it reflect the value that we are delivering to that particular customer market. So, we don't think of floors in terms of percent yield or percent price, with think of floors in terms of if that piece of business or book of business does not re-investable, it becomes much less attractive to us and we have demonstrated over a long period of time that we will choose not to pursue business that does not generate an attractive financial return over a long period of time.", "Donald Broughton", "That's absolute to. Fair enough. Thank you, gentlemen.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the lien of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your questions.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Thank you. I'd like to ask a bit more about the automotive franchise, but with a long-term focus. First, what portion of the automotive portfolio consist of moves to or from Mexico? And could you describe the positive and negative impact to your franchise from production shift in New Mexico compared to prior production locations?", "Eric Butler", "Yeah. So, about half of our franchises to or from Mexico that's all unfinished vehicles and parts. We -- the Mexico volume is growing as you know. Historically, it was like 2 million vehicles, I think they are probably up to about 3.7 million vehicles produced in Mexico. The forecasts is they are going to get close to about 5 million vehicles produced in Mexico.", "We think we have a great Mexico franchise. We're the only railroad that has real connectivity to all six rail border crossings. We have great interline business relationships with every railroad in Mexico. We also have multimodal relationships that we are working with and Mexico. So, we think we have eight great franchise and will partake in that uptake over time.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "And so the shift in general [Indiscernible] production in Mexico as opposed to in U.S. or Canada is a positive from revenue gains or is it negative due to other factors like length of hall?", "Eric Butler", "So, there's a lot of factors that go I would say generally we think the net shift is a positive for our franchise.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions/", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks very much. Any industrial production in the industrial product segment, you called out the severe weather in Texas in the quarter but otherwise, very strong construction activity. Could you just speak to kind of the 2Q to 3Q dynamic there and the trend in the back half assuming that we don't have bad weather events coming forward. Thanks.", "Eric Butler", "We see a normal cyclical pick up as you go through the 2Q to the 3Q just because the summer construction season that we see across most of our serving territory. Don't have as much construction in the winter as you do in the summer as we do expect to see sequential pick up.", "You also are seeing some strengthening in housing starts not as much as you would expect waste on the demographic trends. We think that's a positive for the long-term for our business because the demographic trends are suggesting there has to be a stronger pick up than what we've seen. So you are still seeing that along with the cyclical trends so we think sequentially that will be positive for us.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks. And then just on this the new potential minimum crew size rule as being considered, could you just discussed the company perspective and perceived timing on if shop should happen if you would approach that?", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you, Scott. Regarding the FRA's proposed rule on minimum crew size, historically that has been a topic for collective bargaining over the past number of decades and we believe that's where it belongs.", "There is no evidence that criticize is related to safety. The FRA stated that in the preamble to their own rule. The NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board has also stated that they see no empirical evidence between crew size and safety.", "Having said that, we do not have any plan right now to reduce crew size in our locomotives. What we think should happen is we should allow technology to take its course and determine when it's appropriate for some of the work to be removed from the cab and to be placed somewhere else.", "There is an amount of work that gets done for every train and that work needs to be done. It's just a matter of where it will be done. So, that's our perspective on that.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing remarks.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific this morning. We look forward to talking with you again in October.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."]}

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Koraleski, you may begin.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here in Omaha today are Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Union Pacific achieved an all time record quarter, generating an earnings milestone of $2.19 per share, an increase of 18% compared to the third quarter of 2011.", "Despite a 12% decline in coal volumes and significantly weaker steel and scrap metal markets, we generated best-ever financial results this quarter across the board.", "We achieved solid core pricing gains, we managed our network efficiently and we delivered on the benefits of our diverse franchise with growth in many of our other markets.", "In addition, our focus on providing safe, efficient, high-quality service is reflected in the substantial achievements made this quarter in both employees' safety and customer satisfaction.", "Putting it all together, we're creating value for our customers and we're driving increased financial returns for our shareholders.", "So with that, we're going to get started this morning. We'll start off with Eric Butler. Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 94 for the quarter. It's up 3 points from third quarter last year, and it sets a new best-ever mark, topping the 93 received in the first 2 quarters earlier this year. We appreciate customer recognition of the strength of our value proposition, and we're working to make it even stronger.", "In the third quarter, volume came in at about flat versus last year as the diversity of our franchise provided enough opportunities for growth to offset volume declines in 3 of the groups. Chemicals and Automotive continued to lead the way with very strong growth, and Intermodal was also up. Offsetting that good news was continued weakness in Coal and Ag and the first down quarter this year for Industrial Products as the global steel markets softened. The Coal decline continues to have a significant impact on overall volume. Setting Coal aside, the other 5 groups were up 3%.", "Core price improved 5%, but with the lower fuel surcharge offsetting expanded fuel surcharge coverage, average revenue per car grew 4%. The combination of flat revenue and improved average revenue per car pushed freight revenue to the $5 billion mark for the first time.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 groups. Ag Products revenue was down 4% as the 2% drop in volume combined with the mix driven 2% decline in average revenue per car. Third quarter saw a record low UP grain shipments, with the decline driven by weak corn volume. Corn shipments were off due to reductions in livestock feeding, increased feeding from local crops that were less likely to move rail and a decline in ethanol production that impacted volume to forward ethanol plants. Record soybean shipments in September, a result of strong world demand, only partially offset the weakness in corn.", "Grain products shipments also declined, down 7%, largely driven by ethanol and DDGs. Ethanol volume was down 12%, with producer's margins under pressure due to reduced demand for gasoline, lower exports and higher corn costs. DDGS fell 28% with an increased consumption by feeders close to the point of production, favoring movement by truck.", "Food & Refrigerated shipments again provided some good news, growing 9%, with import beer, barley and canned goods leading the way.", "Automotive volume grew 13%, which combined with the 2% improvement in average revenue per car produced the 15% increase in revenue. Growth rates in auto production and sales remained strong in the third quarter, driven by pent-up demand and improved credit availability. The average age of cars on the road remains high by historic standards, and consumers are replacing them with new, more fuel efficient and technologically equipped models. For the quarter, UP finished vehicles shipments increased 13% and parts volume grew 12%.", "Chemicals volume grew 18%, which combined with the slight mix driven decline in average revenue per car to produce a 17% increase in revenue. Petroleum carloads were up 95%, with continued robust growth in crude oil where volume increased 300%. Plastics shipments grew 8%, supported by increased market demand and new business.", "Industrial Chemicals and LPG again posted solid gains. And fertilizer shipments were up 1%, the first quarterly growth that we've seen this year.", "Now turning to Coal. You could see from the chart of weekly loadings that volumes picked up from the second quarter levels as expected, but continued to tracked below last year. Low natural gas prices and high stockpiles continue to challenge the coal market, and as a result, our volume was down 12%. That comparison was made a little tougher by the boost last year as volume got from the makeup of flood impacted shipments. Revenue declined 5% as the 9% improvement in average revenue per car only partially offset the drop in volume.", "Southern Powder River Basin coal shipments reflected a soft demand, with tonnage down 13%. Also contributing to the decline was the continued impact of 2 contract losses last year, which more than offset business wins.", "While Colorado/Utah coal faces the same challenges in the U.S. market, demand for this high BTU coal in the international market led to increased shipments to Europe and Mexico, driving tonnage up 2%.", "Industrial Products revenue grew 2% as the 4% improvement in average revenue per car overcame a 2% decline in volume. Although overall drilling activity has slowed, growth to new sands facility and continued expansion of horizontal drilling, which requires more sand per well for frac-ing, drove an 11% increase in our nonmetallic minerals shipments. Our rock shipments were up 6%, with strong demand into the Eagle Ford Shale play and construction activity in the Houston area. The housing market also continued to show some signs of life, boosting lumber shipments to 12%. Unfortunately, the strong shelling in those markets was offset by declines in steel and scrap, export ore and hazardous waste.", "Export scrap steel shipments to the Pacific Rim have declined as global steel demand has softened, and the slowdown in drilling activity has slowed the rapid growth in shipments by drillers that we saw earlier this year. As a result, steel and scrap shipments declined 11%.", "Production issues at the mine led to a significant drop in our export iron ore move, driving a 31% decrease in metallic minerals shipments. The iron ore shipments recently resumed, and we expect a slow return over the coming months.", "Finally, as in prior quarters this year, a ramp down in government funding impacted our uranium tailings move, leading to a 35% decline in hazardous waste shipment.", "Intermodal revenue grew 8% as a 7% improvement in average revenue per unit combined with the 1% increase in volume.", "With the economic recovery continuing its slow pace, retail has proceeded cautiously in the third quarter. As expected, that produced a muted peak season, with our third quarter international volume up 1%. Continued success converting highway business to rail, both in containers and trailers, puts domestic Intermodal volume up 1%.", "Let me close with the look at what we see for the fourth quarter. While you can probably find support for a wide range of economic scenarios, we expect the economy to at best hold steady, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see some slight weakening as we move toward year's end. Given that, here's what we see for each of our businesses over the next few months, both the good news and the challenges.", "As we've seen with strong September loadings, world demand for soybean and soybean meals should give Ag and export opportunity in our refrigerated and beer business should continue to grow. Unfortunately, the diminished corn crop is expected to impact opportunity in both export and domestic markets, and we expect to see third quarter challenges that dampened ethanol and DDGS to continue. As a result, Ag will likely be down in the low single-digit range.", "Seasonally adjusted auto sales in September hit 14.9 million, the highest level since March 2008 despite lower incentives offered to purchasers compared to last year and the previous month. We take that as an encouraging sign that the auto industry momentum will carry through the fourth quarter.", "Crude oil should continue to drive Chemicals growth, and most other chemicals markets are expected to continue the solid performance we've seen throughout the year.", "Export demand is a bright spot for Coal, but low natural gas prices and high stockpile levels should keep overall Coal volume tracking below last year, with the decline expected to be in the low- to mid-teens.", "Although the pace has slowed, shale energy-related growth should continue in Industrial Products, with the softening in the global steel market expected to continue to be a challenge.", "International Intermodal should stay ahead of last year, and we expect continued success converting Highway business to rail in domestic Intermodal.", "Put it all together, and the fourth quarter will look likely much like the third. While the diversity of our franchise will help offset the challenges, we will again look to expected price gains to drive revenue growth.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let's start with safety. Year-to-date, we've achieved an all-time record low reportable personal injury rate, 10% better than last year through 3 quarters. The improvement accelerated in the third quarter, which was 23% better than last year's third quarter.", "Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments. Our year-to-date reportable rate improved 1% compared with 2011. While not visible in this number, we have made progress in our focus area of yard and industry track derailments.", "In public safety, the grade-crossing incident rate increased 15% year-to-date. The combined effects of higher rail traffic in the South, which has more great crossing density than our overall network, and our growth in highway commercial traffic has increased our grade-crossing incident exposure.", "On the positive side, we've made progress in isolating high-risk areas and have taken steps to improve or remove crossings of concern. And we continue to focus on community support and driver behavior to address this increased risk.", "Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient, and as a result, our network remains fluid and continues to operate efficiently.", "During the quarter, Hurricane Isaac disrupted operations in the eastern portion of our network. We were well-prepared and sustained little damage, and quickly restored operations. In comparison to last year's drought, the weather impact this quarter was minor.", "In addition to milder weather, the operating team adapted the TE [ph] plan, locomotives and crews to manage shifts in mix including growth in manifest and premium volumes in the South. In Texas and Louisiana, we are effectively utilizing the existing infrastructure and building new capacity. As a result, velocity improved 6% to 26.1 miles per hour.", "Our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. The local operating teams continue to provide great service as reflected by Industry Spot & Pull, which tied the second quarter record of 95%. The third quarter Service Delivery Index, a measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, also improved from 2011 levels.", "While the UP team is successfully managing the carload surge in the South, we have growth capacity in other parts of the system with about 500 employees furloughed and around 870 locomotives in storage.", "Moving on to network productivity. Record low third quarter slow order miles were down 35% from last year. Our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investment in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures.", "Moving to the upper right, car utilization improved 6% year-over-year and reflects the improvement in network velocity and fluidity.", "In the lower left, Intermodal train lengths grew to an all-time quarterly record of 176 boxes per train, improving 2% on a 1% increase in Intermodal volumes compared to 2011. And holding our own in manifest train lengths is noteworthy given that much of the manifest growth occurred in the South, which is the most train size constrained area of our network.", "The chart in the lower right demonstrates our team is effectively leveraging volumes through UP's extensive manifest terminal infrastructure to generate a 2% improvement in the number of cars switched per employee day compared to last year. We've used the UP way to reduce variability on our operation while increasing the role every employee place on their work teams. Employee engagement is an important part of our operating strategy and has had a significant impact. Our employees are bringing their expertise to bear on standardizing their work and removing variability.", "To expand a bit more on growth in the South, third quarter volumes in the South were up 5% versus last year and up 6% year-to-date. In fact, traffic in the South is back to pre-recession volumes. We've met the challenge with agility, repositioning horsepower and manpower to adapt to shifting demand. We've adjusted car routings to leverage available terminal capacity and modified train starts to maintain fluid operations and to increase local service frequency.", "In addition, the capital investments we continue to make in the South are generating an excellent return and are having a positive impact. They support our diverse book of business, including increased shale related volumes, growing Mexico and Intermodal business and export grain shipments to the Gulf.", "So with that, we remain positive on our operating outlook for 2012 and our ability to achieve network improvements on various fronts. A more mature total safety culture, stronger relationships with local communities and improved infrastructure position us well to achieve our goal of another record safety year. We will provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth, with high levels of service. And we are well-positioned to react to dynamic shifts in volume while generating productivity, and to invest a record amount of capital that generates attractive returns.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start by summarizing our third quarter results. Operating revenue grew 5% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.3 billion, primarily driven by core pricing gain. Operating expense totaled $3.6 billion, increasing 1%. Operating income totaled $1.8 billion, a 13% increase and a best-ever quarterly performance.", "Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, up $11 million compared to 2011. Interest expense of $137 million was down 4% versus last year, driven by lower average interest rates. Income tax expense increased to $635 million, mostly driven by higher pretax earnings. Net income was up 15% versus 2011, setting an all-time best for any quarter. The outstanding share balance declined 3%, reflecting our share repurchase activity. These results drove a best-ever quarterly earnings record of $2.19 per share, an 18% increase versus last year.", "Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 4%, topping the $5 billion mark this quarter. Volumes were down slightly, about 0.5 point. The revenue mix impact was flat-ish year-over-year. Growth in higher ARC shale related moves was offset by lower steel and scrap shipments, in addition to shorter length of haul moves including stone.", "In addition, rising fuel prices throughout the quarter resulted in a negative lag impact on our fuel recovery, creating a headwind of roughly 1% in freight revenue. As you may recall, we benefited from a tailwind on fuel recovery in the third quarter last year.", "Similar to the first half, we saw the benefit from renegotiated legacy contracts, with a meaningful step up in fuel surcharge coverage, offsetting the 1% fuel recovery headwind and contributing roughly $0.05 in earnings per share compared to 2011.", "In addition, we achieved solid core pricing gains of 5%, which was a key contributor to record profitability this quarter. The 0.5 point improvement from the second quarter pricing gains resulted from the sequential uptick in our coal volumes.", "Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was about flat with last year. Lower volume, reduced new hire training costs and solid operations mostly offset labor inflation. And you'll recall that last year in the third quarter, we incurred about $18 million of drought-related labor expenses, making for an easier comp this year.", "Workforce levels increased 1.5% in the quarter compared to 2011, driven primarily by increased capital and positive train control activity.", "Slide 23 shows fuel expense, which totaled $880 million, decreasing $36 million versus last year. Lower volumes and a lower consumption rate drove the reduction in fuel expense.", "The average diesel fuel price of $3.19 per gallon was basically flat with last year. However, we saw fuel prices rise substantially throughout the quarter.", "Charting out fuel prices on a monthly basis, this graph illustrates the negative lag impact that we discussed on the fuel surcharge side.", "Purchased Services & Materials expense increased 7% to $542 million due to the higher contract expenses incurred by our logistic subsidiaries. The revenue generated from these expenses is reflected on our Other Revenue line.", "Locomotive and freight car repair expense also increased this quarter, driven by increased contract expenses, material usage and inflation costs.", "Depreciation expense increased 10% to $447 million, mainly driven by increased capital spending. Looking at the full year 2012, we expect depreciation expense to be up around 9% compared to 2011.", "Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $300 million, up 2% from 2011. Growth in Automotive and Chemical volumes drove an increase in short-term freight car rental expense, which was partially offset by lower locomotive and freight car lease expense.", "Other expenses came in at $200 million, down $7 million compared to 2011. It was a bit better than what we had projected back in July, in part due to lower than expected volumes. Lower equipment and freight damage expense, as well as other cost control measures, also contributed to the decrease. These reductions more than offset the higher property tax and personal injury expenses. And as Lance just showed you, we continued to see improvements in our safety performance. But remember, our comp was more difficult this quarter due to a more favorable prior year adjustment in the third quarter of 2011. For the fourth quarter, we expect the other expense line to be similar to the third quarter results, barring any unusual item.", "Now let's turn to our operating ratio performance. We achieved an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 66.6%, improving 2.5 points compared to last year and nearly 0.5 point better than our previous record set last quarter. Our performance highlights the positive impact of core pricing gains, growth in attractive new business and continued focus on productivity initiatives, which more than offset the 0.5 point headwind on fuel recovery versus last year.", "Union Pacific's record earnings drove solid free cash flow of $640 million year-to-date, which reflects $625 million more in capital spending and a 42% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2011.", "In addition, cash from operations of $4.4 billion dollars includes more than $450 million in higher cash tax payments driven by the catch-up of prior year's bonus depreciation programs and a lower bonus depreciation rate in 2012 versus 2011.", "Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment grade credit rating. At quarter end, our adjusted debt to cap ratio was 40.2%.", "We continue to make opportunistic share repurchases, which play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. In the third quarter, we bought back 3.1 million shares at an average purchase price of around $122 per share. Year-to-date, we've repurchased almost 11 million shares averaging around $114 per share.", "Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we've returned over $2 billion to our shareholders year-to-date, up more than 27% compared to last year. Looking ahead, we have about 17.1 million shares remaining under our current authorization program which expires March 31, 2014. That's a recap of our third quarter results.", "Closing out the year, we're all mindful of the potential financial cliff, consumer sentiment and global economy driving uncertainty in the marketplace. That said, we'll play the hand that the economy deals us. We'll continue to be nimble and agile, aligning resources with demand.", "With respect to the fourth quarter, we're facing by far the toughest comparison for any quarter that we've seen this year on a number of fronts. With the additional challenges of coal down in the low- to mid-teens, lower Ag shipments and weakness in steel and scrap moves, overall volume in the fourth quarter will likely be flat to modestly negative compared to last year. Yield could also create a headwind again if prices remain at their current high levels.", "Although our fourth quarter operating ratio will likely be challenged by higher fuel prices and potentially lower volumes, we're confident that solid core pricing gains and our ability to leverage our diverse franchise will drive at least a sub-70 operating ratio again this quarter. Combine that with our 68% operating ratio year-to-date which was achieved with flat volume, it's safe to say that we're well on our way to outpace a full year sub-70 operating ratio for the first time in our history and to achieve record earnings again this year.", "Going forward, we remain positive on the longer-term prospects and our ability to generate increased shareholder returns. We look forward to discussing these opportunities with you at our Investor Day conference in Dallas later this month.", "So with that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, thanks, Rob. And as Rob said, as we look out over the next several months, the political and financial challenges in the United States and abroad have increased the economic uncertainty. In this environment, we're going to continue to be agile, just like we were in the third quarter; we'll adapt to changing market conditions; and we'll leverage our diverse franchise. But longer term, we are very positive about future prospects for the Union Pacific.", "We continue to make strategic investments that strengthen and enhance the franchise, supporting future business opportunities. Going forward, we remain confident in our ability to provide excellent service, increase customer value and generate strong returns for our shareholders.", "So with that, let's open it up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "So one for, I'm not sure, Jack or Eric, on the coal side, so can you give us just a sense on where stockpiles are with your customers? And as you think about coal volumes next year, I understand another big decline on fourth quarter, but when you look out to next year with gas prices where they're at, what are you hearing from customers and about maybe switching back to coal with gas at $3.50? Directionally, what are you thinking for coal volumes next year? And if there's any color also you can give with respect to pricing and the legacy contracts next year if there is less upside given kind of the structural issues with coal that you see out there.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay, Scott, we'll let Eric take a shot at that. Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Let me talk about stockpiles first. I think the industry stockpile number is somewhere around 20 days above normal. If you dissect the eastern versus the western utility, I think you'll see a significant difference. We think, in our serving area, most of our customers are seeing stockpiles about 5 to 10 days above normal, that's significantly lower than what the likely stockpiles are in the east. There's a lot of uncertainty in the market in terms of coal market share versus natural gas and other sources. Certainly, as the price of natural gas increases, that makes it more favorable for coal, and so the futures market for the price of natural gas is going up, and logically, that should make it more favorable for coal. A lot of uncertainties out there, a lot of uncertainties in terms of the current utilities have put in, agreements to use natural gas for a period of time. So over the long-term, if natural gas goes up, coal improves its competitiveness against natural gas.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes. And I think Scott, as you think about it, your question about pricing, we're not going to get into the details of it. But I can tell you right now, we are not straying away from our strategy which is to price to reinvestable levels. And if we can't get to reinvestable levels, we'll walk away from the business. And we've stayed strong with that. It's paid a great -- a bit benefit for us overall. And we're still -- that's where our head is. We'll win some, we'll lose some. We feel very good about our capability to take legacy contracts, bring it up to market levels, and that's where we're going to stay.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to ask you a bit about the trend you see in crude oil. I think through the year, you've had some capacity, I think some receiving terminal capacity that's come on that has given you step ups in your crude oil activity. What do you think the near term view would be on crude oil? Do you see a further step up in fourth quarter or would you see kind of stability the next couple of quarters relative to what you had in the third quarter?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "We're not giving volume guidance for crude oil, but we are seeing -- we have seen a ramp-up throughout the year, as you mentioned, and there are investments that are continuing to be made, particularly at St. James. We think as the investments come online, that provides the capacity for growth. And we will see ourselves being able to continue to take advantage of the growth opportunity.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess as a second question or a follow-up. Rob, you've seen some, I think, favorable effects this year, probably productivity, but also I think maybe contract-related in terms of some of the benefit expenses on the employee costs, sort of, per worker. And I wonder if you could get some commentary looking maybe to 2013, would you expect some of those effects to continue or do you think the inflation on a per worker basis is likely to step up a bit?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Tom, I think, generally speaking, that the trends you're seeing right now should continue. And just to kind of elaborate a little bit, our labor line inflations, we'll call around 3%, but we challenge ourselves every year to offset 100% of inflation with productivity. We don't always get 100%, but we strive to get at least half -- offset half of the inflation with productivity initiatives. So that mindset will not change as we head into 2013.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Rob, in your remarks in the first and second quarters, you noted the negative impact on pricing from the loss of coal because, if I remember correctly, you repriced a fair amount. I realized there was a sequential improvement, but was it still a negative hit in the third quarter given how much coal was down?", "Robert M. Knight", "It depends on what you're comparing it to, Bill. What I pointed out is that -- and you're exactly right, in the second quarter -- just to remind everybody what we said, in the second quarter, we reported 4.5% core price, and of course, the way we measure price, frankly, the most conservative way I can think of measuring it, is an all-in yield calculation against our entire book of business. And we said that, that second quarter 4.5% core price was negatively impacted by the falloff in coal volumes to the tune of about 0.5 point. What we then saw in the third quarter was as coal volumes still below last year, but coal volumes sequentially improved from the second quarter, that picked up about 0.5 point. So if you looked at the difference between the 4.5% in the second quarter and the 5% that we just reported in the third quarter, that variation is driven largely by that increase in coal. So to your point, we're still not running the same levels of volumes that we ran last year but I didn't put a number around that, but it clearly was a negative impact versus had we run 36 trains per day out of the Powder River Basin, for example.", "John J. Koraleski", "The interesting thing about that, Bill, is in the tough coal environment, as Rob said, we're conservative in terms of our outlook on or how we calculate the price. What happens when the calendar flips is we now go year-over-year and we won't see the full potential of that pricing show up as core price, but where you'll see it is on our operating ratio and our bottom line improvements.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Meaning, that as coal -- if coal came back next year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Absolutely.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "But you would still show it as core price, I think, right? That it would grow if that business comes back at higher prices, no?", "John J. Koraleski", "It's a year-over-year comparison. So for the legacy business that we repriced this year, that becomes the new base for next year. And so, what you'll see is just the incremental increase from next year over this year. You won't see the full benefit of the step-up in core price. Where you'll see it is in the operating ratio and in the bottom line improvements margin.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just maybe a question on incremental margins. You guys have done a really nice job for the last couple of quarters with incremental margins even in the absence of volume. As you look out to the next quarter or 2 in a kind of flat or maybe modestly negative environment, can you sustain that type of incremental margins just given how strong the core pricing is? I mean, how should we think about that a little bit in 4Q and then even maybe into 1Q?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob, why don't you take that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. I mean, you're exactly right, Chris. We've turned in fabulous incremental margins and really what will -- what would drive that as much as anything is the volume swings that can occur from quarter-to-quarter. But we're focused, as I've said before, on core pricing gains, productivity initiatives. And to get to our 65% to 67% OR guidance that we have out there by full year 2015, it assumes that we'll get 50%-ish or better incremental margins from here to there. And so, we aren't giving specific quarter-by-quarter incremental margins, but that -- you can take that to mean we're going to continue to be as focused on all of those initiatives that help drive those incremental margins between now and then and then beyond that.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just switching gears onto the pricing side, just when you think about the Intermodal market and obviously a lack of a beginning of a peak so far, how do you think about the pricing dynamic and the competition with truck, I mean, has there been any pressure on that as we moved into October or even in the third quarter for that matter?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "We still are hugely excited about our Intermodal strategy. We think there's lots of upside in terms of conversion from truck to rail. We believe our rail value proposition has a value proposition to truck and over the road moves. And we're committed to pricing to the market and ensuring a reinvestable return. And our outlook in terms of the opportunities for conversion and the value associated with that remains.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.", "Erin Lytollis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "This is Erin Lytollis in for Walter. Just on the Intermodal again, what would you characterize as the addressable market for truck load conversions within your network area? Can you provide some color around that?", "John J. Koraleski", "Anne, in the past, what we've said is as we looked out at the potential truck market, that would be susceptible to rail conversion in the west. It's about 11 million annual truck load benefit. It's a really big number. So we have a lot of opportunity there. Eric, do you want to expand on that?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. The number as a whole is very large, and what we do is we narrow that down to the potential volume moving within a radius of our Intermodal ramps, both on the origin and the destination side. And if you kind of narrow that down and look at what we think -- what portion of that 11 million we think is really attainable, it's probably closer to a 3 million to 4 million number.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "But when you talk -- Eric, when you talk about the lost coal contracts, when do you loop those 2, and can you give an idea of -- if you're down low-double digits, what percent do those lost contracts represent?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "We don't talk about specific contracts with customers. I guess, I'm not sure.", "John J. Koraleski", "Hey, Ken, I think we're going to lap those contracts in January. The ones from this year that we lost, we'll lap that in January.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So I know we're not talking about specific contracts, but can you give us an idea of what the run rate would be?", "Robert M. Knight", "Ken, this is Rob. You're asking the run rate on volume or price or what? I'm not sure I understand.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "On the volume side, if you lost 2 and you're going to start lapping those, what the underlying run rate would be?", "Robert M. Knight", "We haven't given that guidance. I mean, it's really the factors will drive -- while we did have the loss of the contracts that we've referred to you before, of course, what will drive what our volumes actually end up doing, I realize this isn't exactly what you're asking, but what will drive that as Eric elaborated is the price of gas. Weather is a huge driver in terms of what our volumes will be in the coal business. And last year, recall, we had a very mild winter. We started the year off with very mild weather conditions. And so, weather will be as big a determinant as any in terms of where the volumes are.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. If I can get my follow-up then on, in the south, you talked about Mexico cross-border -- can you talk about Mexico cross-border volumes and when you're done double tracking the Sunset Corridor?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure. If we look at Mexico in the third quarter, our Mexico business was up about 6% compared to being flat for the rest of the network. The primary growth factor was Automotive business which is performing nicely certainly given the start rate that we saw in September at $14.9 million. So that's all good. If we look at the Sunset Corridor, we are not on an accelerated Sunset Corridor double tracking any longer. We don't really need that capacity as much as we did in the past, so we're finding that out on a logical basis, on a need basis. We'll probably complete somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 miles this year, which would put us somewhere over the 70% double tracked by the time we get to the end of this year. And Lance, do you have anything to add to that?", "Lance M. Fritz", "You've got all those numbers right.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays Capital.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Could I just come back to the fourth quarter outlook for a sub-70 OR. It just sounds like you're a little bit more cautious there. And if I look at the average performance of your company in the last 10 years, it's about flat from where we were in the third quarter. So are there some unique items here? I know few of the headwind, but it should be less of a headwind than it was in 3Q. So what could be driving that OR a little bit higher from the third quarter then?", "John J. Koraleski", "Brandon, we're not actually cautious. We think we'll have sub-70, and we think we'll have a great operating ratio for the year. Rob, do you want to expand on that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Just a couple of points. Your comment that the fuel shouldn't be as much of a headwind, I mean, that we'll see. We'll see what the fuel prices. How that actually plays out would be caution number 1. Number 2, as Eric walked through the pluses and minuses in each of the commodities, we -- there's a lot of uncertainty out there and we gave guidance here that the fourth quarter volumes will be flat to slightly down. And so those all will be factors. I mean, you're right. On a historical basis, you're 100% right. But as we head into the fourth quarter this year, we'll see how those other factors play out.", "John J. Koraleski", "The one added risk that we have, Brandon, for fourth quarter as you get into winter operations, and if we were to get dumped on with a major blizzard or something like that, we'd have to see what happens with that.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So maybe more cautious on the economy, but still delivering what you guys can, then?", "Robert M. Knight", "Absolutely, absolutely.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And can I just ask a follow-up on pricing then, because I think, it sounded like you're saying the core pricing comps could be down just a little bit from where they are this year next year, and is that because you don't have a lot of legacy to be repriced early in the year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Hey, Rob, why don't you take that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. We previously, as you all have seen, shown sort of a pie chart, if you will, of legacy renewals that come up because that's dependent upon what the volumes actually turn out to be. But we've said that there's roughly $350 million of legacy revenue that we'll be competing for and repricing next year, which frankly, a lot of that's front end loaded. But we haven't given guidance specifically on what our pricing will look like next year with and without that legacy, other than to say that we're going to continue to have a mindset of reinvestability. We'd say it's going to be an inflation plus kind of pricing environment, but we haven't changed our view of and our expectations of what we expect to achieve on pricing.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse Group.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask a question about your expectations for Automotive. I understand sales have been strong, but is it fair to say that the comparisons on vehicles that are being produced than what you're carrying get notably tougher in the fourth quarter, so maybe we should expect a slower growth in Q4 than what you've seen year-to-date?", "John J. Koraleski", "Chris, we're kind of looking at each other here. We're expecting if the economy stays the way it's planned, the SARS rate in September of 14.9 million, that would give us some nice momentum going in, and we're still in October doing well on the Automotive business. Eric, do you have any view?", "Eric L. Butler", "No. I mean, the overall economic outlook, as I've said in terms of Automotive sales, is staying strong and recent SARS rate is still growing. I think the Global Insight in our Automotive industry is both projecting continued strong sales. And we have a huge Automotive franchise and we'll play in that and get the benefits of that.", "John J. Koraleski", "Our customer base is very positive, very interested in service and making sure that we stand tall in terms of providing equipment and great turnaround times, consistent and reliable. So it's a good outlook for us for the fourth quarter.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a follow-up about the peak season. Any comments about how that's shaping up and what you're seeing with regard to surcharges, are those sticking?", "Robert M. Knight", "The peak season, as we said, last quarter, we expected it to be muted, and it is muted. Our volumes in the third quarter, as we said, were up about 1%. October volumes, interestingly enough, month-to-date, you could see the public car loadings, they're up a little bit more. They're up about 3%, 4%. So the peak season is still muted. We are remaining focused on our strategy, and we're pricing for our value of our service. Our MCP program is still we think a great strategic advantage for us and we're going forward with it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "First question, I guess piggybacking way back on Tom Wadewitz's question on shale. I was curious in terms of how you're thinking about crude oil versus pipeline, obviously, a bigger issue in terms of takeaway from Bakken south to the Gulf, maybe less so Bakken East in terms of the interchanges as you head to eastern refineries. How should we think about the timeframe for some of that pipeline infrastructure supplanting the crude by rail opportunity that you have, what do you think your window is? And I mean in terms of the growth opportunity, how big a factor is that?", "John J. Koraleski", "Go ahead, Eric.", "Eric L. Butler", "Interestingly enough, you used the word supplanting. The oil companies have made huge investments, both in terms of infrastructure and in terms of railcars. And our view of the world is that people don't make those investments just for a short-term kind of swings and usage. So we think crude by rail is here to stay. We have a value proposition. It allows a lot of flexibility in terms of moving crude quickly to different destinations in terms of moving by rail versus moving by pipeline. There will be more pipelines that will be implemented, but we think crude by rail will play a role in the market for the foreseeable future.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes. Correct me if I'm wrong, Eric, but what we see is pipelines are going to come in and that may slow our growth rate, so you won't be seeing a 300% year-over-year improvement in oil shipments like you saw this year, but we don't expect our oil shipments to go down.", "Eric L. Butler", "Right, that's accurate.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's really helpful. And then, it's kind of a follow-up, more of a second question. But Jack, in terms of what you're seeing from the broader economy, I just want to reconcile, I mean, when I look at West Coast port volumes in September, when I look at what ISM did in terms of reaccelerating off of the summer, even airfreight data. The economic data looks like you got a little bit better, and you could argue politics there probably a little bit, but not when it comes to ports and airfreight. How do you reconcile that with what you guys and most of your competitors are saying you saw in the economy, and are you seeing any inventory restocking taking place that would be beneficial in terms of a flow-through here into Q4?", "John J. Koraleski", "Justin, so I'm going to give you Jack's view of the world and what I look at internally. So I kind of take my business and I say, okay, take the coal downturn off the table, take the shale business, set it aside because those really aren't the economic barometers. And to the level that I can, take out the global impact on the steel market because that was really the game changer, the difference point between third quarter and second quarter for us, and the rest of the business, things like lumber up 12%; things like the automobile business up 13%; rock business up 6%; domestic Intermodal which was a record for us last year, still trending higher again, so we're in all likelihood going to have a record performance again this year. That says that at this point in time, the consumers aren't really pulling their horns in and that the overall economic activity is kind of a slow growth, which is what we expected going into the year. And at this point in time, in our volume levels as we've gone into the fourth quarter, despite all the handwringing over the fiscal cliff and sequestration and all those other kinds of things in our fundamental kind of economic barometers. And also I should add to that, the Industrial Chemical business, which is all pretty solid for us. We're not in bad shape. The economy seems to be just kind of moving ahead in kind of a slow growth trajectory, and that's where we are.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "I just wanted to ask a question with respect to the very strong growth you saw in your Logistics business in the quarter, just hoping you could give us a bit of an update on what's going on in that part of the business. And a comment directionally, if you would, on how the OR on that revenue compares versus freight revenue.", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "I'm assuming you're referring to our union -- all of the -- our subsidiary businesses, Union Pacific Distribution Services, our streamline subsidiary. As we look at where that fits in our strategy, those are huge leverage values for us in our strategy, those entities are really looking to provide in addition to rail services for our Autos customers, our Intermodal customers, other transload customers. And we continue to see upside opportunity for those value-added services.", "John J. Koraleski", "And when you look at that business, Cherilyn, it's not different than any of our other business. It's held to the same reinvestability standards, and that's how we look at those components as well. Rob, do want to add to that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, I just want to add to that. As that -- and because we're expanding our services here, as Eric just outlined, which is a great value-add to our customers, but in terms of the precise margins that we gain on that, it's a good question, and it isn't as good a margin, but it's asset light business. So...", "John J. Koraleski", "It's for the railroad.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. I mean, it's great business for the railroad, yes, but in terms of -- it does -- the reality of it is, and it's a great business for us, we love it, but in terms of the incremental margins overall and our overall financials, it can put a little pressure on that. But that's okay for us because again overall, we're making the progress as an enterprise that we're making, and this is all value-added, helps our customers and helps our bottom line.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, those Logistics business are a core part of our growth strategy.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "So for a 20%-plus growth in the quarter, that would have had at the margin some kind of a dampening impact on the -- both the OR and the incremental margin.", "Eric L. Butler", "Very little, but yes.", "John J. Koraleski", "Very little because, again, that business that moves on the railroad -- so we're distinguishing between the subsidiary company and the railroad, the business that moves on the railroad is at reinvestable levels.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Headcount growth has been outpacing gross ton-miles. Could you speak to what you expect for headcount growth? And within the gross ton-mile movements, how much of that is the mix versus or -- well, could you elaborate on what might be driving the changes in gross ton-miles?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Let me talk about the headcount first. I mean, let me remind everyone what we've said, we expect our overall headcount to move with volumes. So if volumes are up, we expect headcount to move up, but not necessarily one-for-one because of productivity initiatives. Now what drove our increase in headcount this quarter with flat volume was, as they had pointed out, stronger capital programs and included in those capital programs was a Positive Train Control work. So if you look at the headcount increases, they're really kind of going towards those capital projects as opposed to per se volume today. As you look at the -- your question on the sort of the revenue ton-miles and gross ton-mile question, really the bottom line answer is mix. And what you're seeing is less coal volumes, which are heavier freight carloads for us, and more, for example, autos volumes, which are lighter, if you will, from a gross ton-mile perspective. So really the answer to that question is a mix.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess a related question, fuel consumption was down more than gross ton-miles were down, what's going on with fuel consumption as it relates to those miles?", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance, you want to handle it?", "Lance M. Fritz", "That C rate improvement is really just about traction in what we've talked about previously, which is, it reflects a fluid network. The better the network, the better our C rate, all else equal. Increased in continued traction with programs like Fuel Masters where we incent our engineers to run their trains in a fuel-efficient manner and the fuel efficiency of our locomotive fleet. So you see all of it getting traction in this quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I just want to make sure I'm capturing your coal expectations accurately. So coal started to decline for you in the first quarter, down 8% or so year-over-year, and it was down 17% year-over-year in 2Q. Does it seem reasonable to expect that maybe coal volumes flattened out for you by second quarter of '13, and maybe we'd have to assume $3 gas and kind of 1.5%, 2% GDP on that? Or do you think where inventory stockpiles are right now that we could see year-over-year declines through the end of '13?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, that's a really tough question for us to answer, Peter, because so much of it depends on weather, natural gas prices and all of those kinds of issues. Maybe, Eric, do you want to take a shot at that?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. We're looking at it closely, trying to evaluate what '13 is going to be. And as Jack said, there's a lot of factors, and we're looking at them and trying to get our arms around them.", "John J. Koraleski", "This is kind of reminiscent for me. A couple of years ago, we were at this time sitting on incredibly high stockpiles and thought we were going to be in trouble, and then we had one of the coldest winters on record and we saw those stockpiles dissipate very quickly, and we ended up having very strong coal loadings. So weather can have a big impact on us, and that certainly is a big point of uncertainty for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Could you tell us how much of the business is contractually committed for '13? Or how many -- what percentage of the business is renewed for '13 at the moment? How much remains?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure, Ben. As we look at it right now, we have about 70% of our business that's already locked in place, and there's a 30% kind of a number that's out there. And as we look at that, that's pretty constant as we go throughout the year because of the way pricing takes its place and it's not all a year end, some things come up quarterly, different times of the year. So at any one point in time, we have about 70%, and I would say that's -- Eric, you want to add to that?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. And the 70% is really the percent of business that's under some kind of customer specific agreement. It's either a 1-year contract, multi-year contract, a shorter-term contract. The 30% is what's under our public agreement or tariff. And as Jack said, we have -- we're repricing all year long, throughout the year.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, that's helpful. And then back to a point that was made during the prepared remarks. Somebody had made the comment that 4Q will look like 3Q. I wanted to clarify what you were referring to, is that EPS, earnings, OpEx, something along those lines that you were referring to?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. I think, Ben, the reference that you're probably referring to was Eric's comments on the markets and the volumes that we're seeing because in his last slide, he went through sort of pluses and minuses within business group. But from a volume standpoint, we see sort of things continuing, and I further gave guidance on the fourth quarter volume that we've got to be flat to slightly negative.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So I should interpret it as volumes, not necessarily earnings?", "Robert M. Knight", "That's right.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Troy of Susquehanna.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just give us an indication of how much of a percentage of your coal book of business ex-legacy is up for renegotiation next year. I would guess, just based on the average contract duration, it's something maybe 20%, 25%, but just maybe trying to frame that for what might be up for negotiation. And then secondarily, given the fact that this is the second time in, let's call it, half a decade where stockpiles have been challenged, now we've got nat gas very low, what might be changing? Where are you getting pushback or sensitivities in the negotiations with the utilities in terms of contract negotiations? Are you looking for concessions on take or pay, or liquidated damages? Where are the touch points in this, we'd call it, new era of coal we find ourselves in today?", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay, Matt. Hey, Rob, why don't you talk about the legacy and then we'll let Eric take the...", "Robert M. Knight", "Let me just say we're out of gate. We're not going to get into as much specific that you asked. I mean, you asked a lot of kind of specific questions, negotiating strategies and things like that, that we're going to probably be very general here in terms of your questions. But in terms of the legacy, if you look at our coal book of business, our contracts are 3 to 5 years, so as Jack said earlier, we're constantly renegotiating contracts. We've got both legacy renewals next year. And I refer you to the pie that we've used in the past in terms of how much legacy renewal, overall enterprise-wide that come up for renewal next year. But behind even that, then there's just always negotiations taking place throughout the year in our coal business, in all of our businesses for that matter, so there's nothing unusual there. But if we have 3- to 5-year contracts, then yes, call it 20%, 25% kind of level of business that's up for renewal every year.", "Eric L. Butler", "And in terms of negotiation, we've said before, our -- all negotiations are difficult negotiations. Our coal customers are very smart, savvy transportation providers, and they always negotiate every factor that they can negotiate, and they're always tough.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And I guess as a follow-up then. In terms of the threshold and switching threshold with natural gas in the low $3 range, is -- it would be nice to hear you folks say just given the periodic rumors you hear in the market that you remain committed to pricing at an inflation cost plus basis or have margin targets and would not be pricing to incent the movement of coal to bring it more competitive relative to that switching cost. The discipline is still there, is that fair?", "John J. Koraleski", "Matt, not only is that fair, but again, let me just kind of reiterate for you that we need to get our business, every carload that moves on Union Pacific at a reinvestable level, and if it's not, we will walk away from it. We've had a number of customers come to us and say, if we don't lower coal rates, they're going to go out of business. Unfortunately, if their businesses is dependent on the value of their transportation contract and not on their intrinsic product that they're producing, they're probably going to go out of business anyway. And we also have to be sensitive to all of our other coal customers that are paying us. So we take a very pragmatic approach. And we are absolutely committed to pricing to market. We are absolutely committed to bringing legacy up to market rates. We're absolutely committed to our reinvestability threshold. And we think when that's all said and done, we will outperform inflation in terms of our total pricing.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just was wondering about your comments with respect to the southern part of the network, could you just remind us how do you define the southern half of the network? Could you sort of review with us what's really driving that tremendous growth there, I guess you're back to where you were before the downturn? And then with respect to the comments about train length constraints in the South, have you contemplated, or are you, in fact, reallocating some capital dollars to relieve some of those constraints if in fact the growth down in that part of the world is sustainable here going forward?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure, John. Lance, you want to handle those?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. So John, the southern region for us is essentially east of El Paso to New Orleans and south of Kansas City. When we're talking about the South and significant growth, it's mostly about Texas and Louisiana, and it's mostly about shale-related activity or Industrial Chemicals or the Petro-Chem industry that's benefiting from low natural gas feedstocks. And when we talked about capacity constraints in train size length in the South, the short answer is yes, we do know where our bottlenecks are and we are investing capital where -- when we relieve those bottlenecks, we generate an excellent return. As well as, the South is just our most significant concentration of single track, and it's a significant concentration of manifest traffic at its terminals. And those things tend to retard train length. But net-net, John, as we look forward, we will stay ahead of any of those constraints that meaningfully impact the ability to get solid productivity on that traffic growth.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-on question. With respect to the great strides you've made in improving network fluidity, could you attribute any of that improvement to the reduction in sort of the heavy tonnage coal traffic? Does that make it easier to run the rest of the network more fluidly? Or are you just on the same trajectory you've been for many years in terms of continuous improvement in network fluidity?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, I wouldn't attribute it to a decrease in coal movements. As a matter fact, our coal network tends to be one of our most highly productive networks that we run. So it's actually a headwind depending on what measures you're looking at when coal declines. I would attribute the improvement to, as we've mentioned, effective capital investment, the UP way and the full engagement of all of our employees on improving their workplace and improving the productivity of their work. And we're seeing that pay off, and that's got a very long run rate.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I think you mentioned a response to an earlier question, the cross-border traffic at Mexico is up 6% primarily in Autos. Could you please comment on potential for increased Mexico Intermodal traffic given your, what, 6 intersections I think?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure, Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "We -- if you look at the improvement of the Industrial Production and manufacturing in Mexico, we think Mexico is going to be a huge growth opportunity for us, both on the Automotive side, on the carload side and the Intermodal side. We have 6 gateways, as you mentioned. We are working with both Mexican rail carriers, and we have great franchise lanes from those border points to the consumption markets in the U.S. So we continue to see Mexico and the outlook for our cross-border business as being one of our growth stories.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And maybe just as a follow-up, taking a step back, revenue to and from Mexico this year is probably just under $2 billion for Union Pacific. If memory serves you on about 26% or so of Ferromex, and this has been for more than a decade. What would make you interested in owning more than this share, and is there any structural barrier to greater ownership stake?", "Eric L. Butler", "Sure. Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Keith, you're right, we own 26%, but it really is an investment. We have great partnership with the FXE, but if you look at our book of business, we interchange just as much, if not more, with the Kansas City, Southern Mexico. So we're agnostic, if you will, in terms of that relationship. And we're comfortable with that 26% ownership as it is. The other point I was going to just make about Mexico is, as you're pointing out, it is one of the strengths of our franchise. It's a differentiator between us and others in that we are the only railroad that crosses at those 6 border crossings. And if you look at our overall volumes, our Mexican business in the northbound and southbound is running about 6% positive volume growth versus our overall enterprise of being flattish in the third quarter. So it's outpacing our overall. And that's because of the great service relationship and the diverse franchise footprint that we have.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask, if you looked at the changes in yield that were caused by product mix versus the changes in yield that may have been brought about by length of haul, whether it's carrying grain to the ports for export or chemicals a certain distance, what's your best guess at what the impact was to yield between the 2?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Jeff, I'd say -- let me give you the mix answer because it really is a combination of things. Length of haul was down about 1% overall. But really in terms of kind of looking at the yield, it really is a mix within a mix story. I mean, if you look at each one of our commodity groups, there really is kind of a mix here. Mix, meaning length of haul within each commodity group and sometimes within each customer base. And our focus on repricing to reinvestability, there was mix within that in terms of what you saw in the coal business, for example. So I don't have a straight answer for you other than to say that overall, our length of haul was off about 1%.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kevin Crissey with UBS.", "Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I'm trying to reconcile what our utilities analyst is saying and some of the utilities have been saying in the West about the pricing that they're seeing from the rails relative to 2011 levels, kind of 25% decline in pricing overall, maybe not so much in the West or maybe it is. So I'm trying to reconcile that with the discussion of overall pricing and maybe with the -- some lost contracts. So have you seen -- how can we reconcile that with inflation plus pricing? And is it the length of contracts so that when we hit -- when we're lapping 2011, it's going to be -- you're going to see declining pricing at that point rather than today, and how is BNSF related to that?", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, Kevin, that's an interesting question from the perspective that, again, just to kind of start at a high level and reiterate, our goal is to get business to market levels and to get business up into reinvestable territory. That's our threshold. And obviously, our goal would be to go past the reinvestable level. So -- and in the event that you see us lose business, I think you could assume from that, that we could not meet that criteria and we were prepared to walk away from it because our franchise gives us plenty of opportunities to fill the gap and take advantage of the capacity to move other freight with other customers. So I don't know how you reconcile what your analyst is reviewing and what customers are telling them. Eric, maybe you want to add a little bit to that?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. I would say your question is a good one. We can't reconcile it either. So I mean, your question is a good one.", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Can I just reiterate that we say, overall, we look at our enterprise, as Jack has said several times, we're looking at an inflation plus sort of pricing environment. And the other thing I would -- your question reminds me to say here is that we're well aware of some of the reports out there that you're referring to about a 25% reduction, that is not us, I mean we're not confirming that, that was a comment, and I think frankly, the way I interpreted that comment that I know others have picked up on was somebody had an incentive to make that comment based on what they expected as opposed to there being an absolute rate reduction at 25%. But I can assure you, that's not what's happening in our book of business.", "Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. But let's say even if 25% was way out of the range of a real number, even if competitors were out there at a reduced rate, that wouldn't show up in the results really because maybe -- versus 2011, it's down, but versus the recontracting of 2007 pricing, it's probably still up, just not as up as much maybe people thought it would be. So would we see -- if that were the case, would we see a delay in the pricing affect because you're renegotiating 5-year old contracts?", "Robert M. Knight", "This is Rob. I would just -- Kevin, I would just say that you've asked sort of theoretical questions. Again, we're not going to confirm or debate what theoretically could happen. And again, we're not giving specific guidance on our pricing other than to -- by commodity, other than to say that overall, we expect positive pricing, reinvestability based -- market based, and we expect that to be inflation plus kind of pricing overall, like we've seen looking backwards.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So Eric, just a quick question on the Chemicals business. We're obviously seeing a lot of projects on the whiteboard or in the planning stages for the Chemicals manufacturing industry. And I wanted to get a sense from you about when that might actually turn into some volume. Is it a '13 or a '14 type of thing as far as your industrial development team is kind of working with those customers to look at rail capacity?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, David, that's a good question. I think at the last quarterly release, what we talked about was with the relatively low natural gas prices, there were 6, 7, 8 large chemical companies that have announced expansions, particularly in the Gulf region, in our sweet spot. If you look at the ramp-up or the construction timeline for most of those, those are late '14, '15, '16 kind of timelines, which is I think what we talked about at our last earnings release.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. And just a quick follow-up, perhaps, Rob, could you let us know exactly what the fuel surcharge revenue line was for the quarter?", "Robert M. Knight", "Fuel surcharge revenue line was -- let me look that up here real fast -- around $630 million in the quarter.", "Operator", "Our last question is from the line of Brad Delco with Stephens.", "A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "The focus on Intermodal, I was wondering, could you guys provide any color on the commentary about pricing to reinvestable levels? How close are you to that on the Intermodal side? Or maybe asked a different way, has your pricing changed at all on a year-over-year basis, maybe on a relative basis to what kind of price increases you were looking at last year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "We don't historically talk specifically about pricing by commodity group. If we look at our kind of historic Intermodal book of business, Intermodal historically has been priced at, call it, a 30% discount to truck. We think that our value proposition allows us to narrow that discount to truck, and that's part of our strategy that we're doing. And then if you look at the kind of the impact of the trucking industry, the regulations changes on drivers, increased fuel, their costs are going up. So as their cost goes up, that gives us additional headwind in terms of our value proposition. So we are narrowing the gap between the historical discounts that Intermodal has had to trucks.", "A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And then maybe one quick follow-up. Any plans or color you could give on capacity additions as it pertains to containers and the fleet for next year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "I think quite honestly at this point in time, we're looking at it, but we haven't made any decisions.", "Robert M. Knight", "That's right.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Koraleski for closing comments.", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, great. Before we wrap up this morning, just let me reiterate that we recognize there are uncertain economy issues out there, and it's going to bring us some challenges over the next several months, but we're actually very confident that our team is going to remain agile, just as we were in the third quarter. We're going to continue to leverage the opportunities of our diverse franchise. We continue to see strong pricing for the balance of this year, and I think we're going to have a very successful end to the year.", "So thanks so much for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to seeing as many of you as we can in our Investor Day in Dallas at the end of this month.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal of presentation. Please note that slides for this presentation are user controlled. [Operator Instructions].", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Young, you may begin.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good Morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings conference call. With me this morning are Rob Knight, our CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Today, we're reporting record quarterly results despite facing some challenges in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Union Pacific earned $1.86 per share, a 4% increase over 2006. Rob will provide you with the details on how record highs fuel prices, the economy, and weather impacted earnings, but there were basically four major drivers to this quarter. Rapidly rising diesel fuel price was a major challenge, especially with the two-month lag in the majority of our fuel surcharge program. Fourth quarter carloadings were up nearly 2.5% coming into December, but we ended the quarter roughly flat after being impacted by winter weather in December and some economic softness. Operationally, we improved across-the-board. Our service metrics, productivity measures, and customer satisfaction surveys all showed progress, and consistent with prior quarters coal price increases remained strong.", "Looking at our full-year results, our progress can be summarized by looking at the gain and return on invested capital of 0.5 point to 8.7%. We achieved this milestone by focusing on the key areas of our business that drive our results. We operated in safer railroad in 2007, improving safety for our employees, customers, and the public. We set new financial records for our company including net income of $1.86 billion, up 16% versus 2006. And we delivered better service for customers, which they recognized by giving us our highest ratings ever on their satisfaction surveys in 2007. The progress we made in these areas enabled us to deliver a 38% total return to our shareholders through stock price appreciation, a 47% dividend increase, and $1.5 billion of share repurchases.", "So with that, let me turn it over to Jack to talk about our revenue performance and our 2008 outlook. Jack?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Thanks, Jim. Good morning. Despite continued softness in some markets and challenging weather in December, our fourth quarter volume edged past a year ago. Average revenue per car improved 6%, driving similar improvement in commodity revenue, which is up $4 billion. Although volume was down a little over 1% for the full year, revenue grew to a record $15.5 billion as our ongoing efforts to drive yield improvement resulted in average revenue per car of $1,594. Improving service in 2007 helped create pricing opportunity even with softer market conditions as customers recognized greater value for their price dollar. And while we are pleased with the record revenue that we posted in 2007, the best true statement of our success is the satisfaction scores we received from our customers. Our satisfaction index improved over 2006 every quarter, and for the full year came in at 79, which is a new post-merger record.", "Now, let me take you through each of our six business groups with a look at how the fourth quarter played out and what we see ahead for 2008. Let's start with our Ag products business. Ag products revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter to $719 million, with a slight increase in volume combining with a 6% increase in average revenue per car. Wheat exports, especially to the PNW and the Gulf, and ethanol and DDGs led the increases. Largely offsetting that growth were declines in three markets, domestic feed grain moves to Texas was up because there was a strong local crop in the Texas area. The cottonseed crop was smaller than a year ago because acreage was shifted to corn. And we moved fewer cars of import beer due to higher inventories and the elimination of the transload from plane to insulated boxcars at Longview, Texas, which reduced carloads, but actually increased our efficiency and profitability.", "Looking ahead to 2008, we expect continued growth in ethanol and DDGs. Ethanol demand is also going to drive growth in corn volumes with increased shipments to our forward [inaudible] ethanol plants on the West Coast. We stayed strong in the startup of our second [inaudible] train in February along with increased meat and poultry exports should help drive growth in the food products line.", "Turning to Automotive, a 7% increase in average revenue per car allowed our autos team to post a 4% increase in revenue, even as volume declined 2%. Vehicle shipment fell 6% as sales continued to soften. That decline was partly offset by a 2% increase in parts, as we saw continued success with the intermodal train service between Detroit and Mexico that we started up in conjunction with CSX earlier in 2007. Both vehicles and parts volumes are expected to decline in 2008, as U.S. vehicle sales are predicted to fall somewhere in the range of 15.5 million to 15.8 million vehicles.", "Our Chemicals markets have been the bright spot throughout the year. In fact it was our only business to post volume growth in all four quarters. For the fourth quarter, revenue grew 12% with volume up 5% and a 7% improvement in average revenue per car. While we saw strength pretty much across the board in the fourth quarter, a 23% increase in fertilizer led the way driven by strength in the export potash markets.", "Plastics volume was up 6% with both line haul and storage and transit moves favorably impacted by contracts that we renegotiated in 2007. Liquid and dry volumes grew 4% aided by caustic soda production, which shifted to the Gulf Coast. We're looking for our Chemicals markets to remain stable throughout 2008.", "Turning now to our Energy business, 4% growth in the Southern Powder River Basin coal drove an overall 2% increase in volume, more than offsetting disappointing Colorado/Utah loadings. Revenue grew 8% as the volume growth combined with a 6% increase in average revenue per car. Strong demand, consistent production, few weather incidents, and fluid train operations all combined to produce the best-ever quarter for the SPRB train, ton, and carloads. Mine production and coal quality problems held Colorado/Utah volumes 12% below a year ago. We did however achieve record average tons per train out of that region for\u2026 at just over 11,000 tons.", "Looking ahead, our Energy business looks like it's got the best growth prospects here in 2008. Although Colorado/Utah volume is currently expected to be flat, we're beginning to see some activity in the international markets that could be favorable for this coal. Strong demand should produce growth of about 5% for the SPRB and that growth outlook could be even a little stronger if we had fewer weather incidents and mine production problems than we experienced in 2007.", "For the first time since third quarter 2006, our Industrial Products business posted revenue growth up 1%, having a 3% increment in average revenue per car offset a 2% volume decline. Weak demand in the housing market continues to impact our lumber business and other construction related businesses and the paper market continued to shrink with the conversion from print to digital media. The good news was a 7% growth in stone volumes driven by pent-up demand from projects delayed by customer production issues and bad weather that had occurred earlier in the year. This is a group where I think it's important to note that the mix shift associated with reduced high revenue per car lumber and increased lower revenue per car stone impacted the average revenue per car in the quarter. It\u2019s really not seeing the true price improvements that the Industrial Products team has been enable to achieve in very difficult market conditions. This is a business that of course is most sensitive to the economy and all indications are that softness in these markets is going continue to be a challenge throughout 2008.", "With a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit, Intermodal revenues grew 4% even though volume ran about 1% below last year. Continued soft import market produced a 3% decline in international volume. Economic softness also impacted our premium and domestic business, but despite that softness domestic volume was up 3% driven by growth in our legacy contract business. Although we look to Intermodal to be one of the long-term drivers of future growth, the outlook for Intermodal in 2008 is somewhat modest. While we expect to see some strengthening of the international market, our domestic volume is expected to decline a little due to businesses losses that we incurred in our IMC and truckload segment.", "Let me wrap up. As we went through each of the business groups, I highlighted our expectations for 2008, and here is how that shapes up in terms of our volume outlook for the year. As I said, our growth looks strongest in Energy and Ag is also looking pretty good for us. Chemicals and Intermodal have some upside and Autos and Industrial Products will likely see some further softening. Of course, the wild card is the economy. Clearly, there is a lot of concern about whether we'll avoid a recessionary downturn. Overall, volume is expected to be up 1% to down 1%, with the low side driven by a longer or deeper economic softness. As in the past, we expect the diversity of our franchise will help us weather a slower economy. But continued focus on driving every piece of business to our reinvestability threshold including the opportunity to re-price legacy contracts for about 6% of our revenue, we expect to see revenue growth in all six of our business groups in 2008.", "With that, I am going to turn it over to Dennis.", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Thank you, Jack, and good morning. The operating team made significant improvements in 2007, concentrating on the core areas of safety, service, value, and leadership.", "Starting on slide 15 with an overview, employee, customer, and public safety programs made gains during 2007 with improvement in all three categories. Our employee incentive rate was in its lowest level ever. Focus around the prevention initiatives also paid dividends saving more than $11 million year-over-year, and despite increasing highway traffic and urban expansion, crossing incidents declined 9%. Public education programs and crossing closures during 2007 helped drive this improvement.", "Jack just talked to you about improved customer satisfaction ratings, which correlate directly with our service metrics. System velocity increased nearly 1.5 miles per hour, while terminal dwell time improved more than 2 hours to 25.1 hours. I'll talk later about capital. We are strengthening the infrastructure, debottlenecking key choke points, and positioning our railroad for resiliency and growth. In addition, we made strong productivity gains in all facets of our operations.", "As shown on slide 16, we improved freight car cycle time by 7% to best-ever levels. This is the result of our service initiatives such as improving our on-time spot and pull performance to our customers, lower car cycle time as reflected in our income statement in the form of lower rent expense, and it also helped our customers manage their freight car expenses. We've also increased train length in all of our networks. In the Powder River Basin, we moved 1 million more tons with 1.4% fewer trains per day. We added 10 intermodal boxes to every train allowing us to move about the same volumes, with 5% pure crew starts. And in total, first crew starts declined 4% on a 1% lower volume, better yet our rate of improvement accelerated throughout the year with more to come in 2008. And we adjusted the workforce to keep our cost more volume variable. We started the year with a train crew hiring plan of about 2300, but adjusted it down to less than 1400, letting attrition reduce our operating craft by about 475 people.", "Another key focus in our productivity efforts is fuel conservation, saving money as well as reducing emissions and then making it even more environmental and friendly relative to other transportation modes. Our 2007 consumption rate improved 2%, saving nearly 21 million gallons of fuel and $43 million. Key activities include Fuel Masters, which includes training, follow-up, and rewards the best engineers with personal fuel cards to fill their own vehicles, something very popular these days, technology improvements such as automated shutdown devices and our new hybrid switch locomotives that burn less fuel and reduce emissions. The fuel conservation speed initiative that analyzes specific corridors and finds opportunities to adjust these for the most efficient fuel consumption rates while protecting fluidity and [inaudible] management principles. Results so far are encouraging and should help us achieve another nice improvement in 2008.", "Moving now to capital on slide 18, we significantly strengthened our physical infrastructure during 2007. Through our maintenance programs, we reduced slow order delay of greater heavy haul corridors, rehab debilitated yards, and improve the overall maintainability of our network. Key capacity projects include [inaudible] clearances on the I-5 Corridor that were completed allowing us to run double stack trains between Los Angeles and Portland, 33 miles of double-track and various terminal enhancements on the Sunset Corridor, the third main line in the Powder River Basin joint co-line was finished and work started on a portion of the fourth main line. Although we acquired about 1000 new freight cars in 2007, our coal fleet declined nearly 12000 cars year-over-year as we scrapped older cars and terminated freight car leases. Finally, we acquired 300 new high horsepower units and 149 hybrid switch locomotives, all helping us to lower fuel consumption, reduce emissions, and improved reliability. We are offsetting this with retirements and lease turn backs with more to follow in 2008.", "Turning to 2008, despite the fact that Mother Nature has held us down just with mudslides in Oregon and severe winter weather in the Midwest to start the year, we are optimistic about the operational outlook. Our priorities remain straightforward, achieve unprecedented levels in all areas of safety, continue productivity trends, and whether volumes pick up or slowdown become more volume variable regardless of volumes, continue to provide a better service product to our customers, and make a strong investment in our network further improving our infrastructure.", "With that, I will pass it to Rob for the numbers.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Fourth quarter earnings totaled  $1.86 per share. That compares to 2006 earnings for  $1.78 per share, which was slightly better than we were anticipating in mid-December. As I walk through the quarterly drivers, I'll point out a couple of good news items that drove the upside, but it primarily relates to better operating productivity with some additional benefit from other income and a small insurance settlement.", "Moving now to the top of the income statement, operating revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter to nearly $4.2 billion. Quarterly operating expenses also increased 6%, primarily as a result of a 30% increase in fuel and utilities expense. Through our continued focus on efficiency and returns, we overcame both fuel and weather challenges in the fourth quarter to produce record operating income of $864 million, up 7%.", "Let\u2019s turn to slide 23 and the drivers of the fourth quarter commodity revenue. Revenue grew 6% to just over $4 billion on flat volume. Revenue growth would have been even greater had it not been... had we not lost an estimated 30... excuse me, $20 million or so from the impact of the December storms on coal and grain loading. Average revenue per car increased 6% year-over-year, with improvements in each of our six business groups. Continued efforts to increase coal prices was the primary driver of the gain.", "Moving to expenses, fourth quarter salaries and benefit expense totaled $1.1 billion, a 3% decline. Our labor productivity continued to improve in the quarter. Although volume was roughly flat year-over-year, we reduced our workforce more than 3%. As you just heard from Dennis, in a lighter volume environment we drove productivity by significantly reducing train starts. Training costs were also lower year-over-year as aligned our workforce needs with business levels. In addition to training reductions, we reduced our non-operating workforce as we continued to improve our overall organizational effectiveness. Wage inflation did offset some of these productivity gains.", "Looking ahead, we will continue to increase productivity. Actual workforce levels in 2008 will depend upon volumes. These two variables will move together directionally, but it won't be a one-for-one. In other words, we'll achieve greater workforce productivity relative to the volume changes.", "On the next slide, we show our average monthly diesel fuel prices for the last seven months of 2006 and 2007. This illustrates the large year-over-year price spike we experienced in the fourth quarter. Unlike 2006 when prices began declining in the fall, diesel fuel prices increased dramatically in the last few months of 2007. Our average price per gallon started at $2.44 in October, rising to $2.66 in November, and ended the year at $2.68 in December. In fact, we paid an average of $2.59 per gallon for diesel fuel in the fourth quarter, a 34% increase from 2006. Because of the two-month lag in the majority of our fuel surcharge mechanism, the increased cost associated with these rising prices could not be recovered in the fourth quarter.", "Equipment and other rent was down $2 million in the fourth quarter. We reduced car hire expense as a result of faster asset turns and lower freight car inventories. Expenses for car and container leases were also lower in the quarter due to fewer leased unit. These gains were partially offset by higher locomotive lease expense.", "Moving now to slide 27, purchase services and other expense, this category declined 3% or $15 million to $431 million. Although we had initially expected cost to increase in this category, several different factors combined to drive the year-over-year change. Casualty expense was roughly $10 million lower in the quarter as a result of improved safety and lower freight claims. In addition, a small insurance settlement, increased productivity, lower volumes, and a couple of other items contributed to the decrease.", "For 2008, we will have an excess headwind in our casualty line. As you recall, in the first and third quarters of 2007, we recorded casualty expense reductions totaling $77 million as a result of semiannual actuarial studies. Although we expect some ongoing benefit from our improved safety performance, we won't be able to completely offset these headwinds. The net result of a 6% increase in both operating revenue and expense is our fourth quarter operating ratio of 79.4%. This slide illustrates the drivers of our operating ratio. Although coming into the quarter, we expected high fuel prices to be a challenge. The sharp spike in prices had a greater than anticipated impact. In total, higher fuel prices added 3.6 points to our fourth quarter operating ratio. The carloading impact of the December storms also pressured our operating ratio adding almost half a point. The good news is that we've more than offset the challenges of fuel and weather primarily through operating revenue growth and productivity gains.", "On the next slide, slide 29, we show our fourth quarter income statement. Fourth quarter other income totaled $40 million. Although this is slightly higher than expected due to some December real estate transaction, it is $17 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. Interest expense totaled $125 million, up 6% as a result of higher debt levels. Income taxes grew 4% to $779 million. Higher pretax income and a higher year-over-year effective income tax rate of 37% drove the increase.", "If you step back and look at our results on a full-year basis, 2007 marked another year of solid gains. Over the past two years, we've taken 7.5 points off of our operating ratio, more than 2 points in 2007. Everyone in Union Pacific is committed to continuing this improvement trend as we focus on profitable topline growth and ongoing productivity gains.", "Slide 31 shows our full-year income statement. Operating revenue grew 5% in the year to a best ever $16.3 billion. Operating expenses were up 2% with higher diesel fuel prices accounting for much of the year-over-year increase. Other income was down slightly in the year at $116 million. For 2008, our current thinking is that this number will be more in the range of $50 million to $75 million. Interest expense increased $5 million as we added $900 million of long-term debt to the book. Income taxes grew 26% to $1.2 billion as a result of a higher effective tax rate in 2007 and increased pretax earnings. And in 2008, we are expecting a tax rate of about 38%. 2007 net income was up 16% to a best ever $1.86 billion. Full-year earnings per share totaled $6.91 per share, a 17% increase.", "Turning now to cash, we've grown cash from operations nearly $700 million since 2005 to $3.3 billion. This includes the impact of slight\u2026 of significantly higher cash taxes. Between 2005 and 2007, our cash tax rate increased from about 2% to 28% as we used up our AMTs and NOL credits from prior years. We continue to take a balanced approach to the uses of our cash with a combination of capital investments, dividend increases, and share repurchases.", "In 2007, total capital came in around $3.1 billion, $2.5 billion of cash capital plus, another $600 million in non-cash capital, primarily for equipment leasing. We haven't finalized our 2008 capital plans yet, but our current thinking is that spending will be roughly equal to 2007 levels. Similar to prior levels\u2026 our prior years, the total investment will include some combination of cash capital and leasing. We will provide more details about our capital plans in the coming months.", "As we announced last November, we are also using our cash to pay higher dividends. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.44 per share. This was our second dividend increase in 2007, resulting in a total increase for our shareholders of 47%. Another use of cash is our share repurchase program. We continued to purchase shares during the fourth quarter buying back 2.4 million shares of UP common at a total cost of about $305 million. Since instituting the program in January of 2007, we've repurchased 12.6 million shares. We are committed to rewarding our shareholders as illustrated by the nearly $1.5 billion of cash that we returned through repurchases in 2007.", "Turning to slide 34, we show our total debt levels. In 2007, our total debt related obligations increased about $1.2 billion. This drove our lease adjusted debt-to-cap ratio 2 points higher to 43.6%. For 2008, we see a number of variables that will drive our results. Jeff talked about our volume outlook. Of course with 11 month left in the year, any number of things could happen that would change our volume expectation. It really depends upon how long the economy stays off, how soft it gets, and the overall demand levels for less economically sensitive goods such as coal and grain.", "As Dennis discussed, we're trying to be more volume-variable as an organization. Volume growth not only drives revenue, but also productivity. We are confident in our ability to improve our operating ratio in 2008 through better returns on our business and increased productivity. The level of the improvement however is hardly gauged today, given the uncertainty with volumes and fuel prices. We are currently forecasting 2008 diesel fuel prices will average 15% to 20% above our 2007 price of $2.24 per gallon. But if prices differ from this estimate, it could impact our earnings for the year. Taken together, we believe our 2008 earnings should be in the range of $7.75 to $8.25 per share. This result would drive another year of strong ROIC growth in 2008.", "This slide reflects the financial strength and flexibility of Union Pacific. Coming off 2007 where we grew earnings 17%, we are forecasting another strong year of earnings growth in what may be a tougher economic environment. We believe we can achieve these results because of our focus on efficiency, our dedications to returns, and the diversity of our franchise.", "Looking at our first quarter outlook on slide 36, we would expect earnings in the range of $1.50 to $1.70 per share. The key drivers of this earnings range are volume and diesel fuel prices. To reach the high into range, we\u2019d expect to see around 2% volume growth. We would also need fuel prices to stay around the current January average of $2.68 per gallon. Factors that could push us to the lower end of the range would be slower volume growth or rising fuel prices. If diesel fuel prices increase in February or March, we would not recover that incremental cost until the second quarter.", "As I mentioned earlier, we do have a challenge in the first quarter from last year's casualty expense reduction, which totaled $30 million. In addition, demand for coal and intermodal carloads, which have a lower average revenue per car, could impact our business mix and be a drive on earnings. This mix effect may be magnified by this less demand for higher average revenue per carload such as lumber and finished vehicles. Although, we clearly expect our strong trend of productivity improvements to continue, those gains were likely to be matched in the first quarter by increased casualty expense and higher fuel prices. Beyond the first quarter, we would expect the pace of operating ratio improvement to accelerate.", "So let me turn it back over to Jim for some closing comments.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Rob. What you've seen in our results and heard from the team today is that 2007 was a good year. We achieved a number of financial and operational milestones in a more difficult business environment. We expect 2008 will be another record year, even with some ongoing challenges.", "As Rob walked you through our outlook for the year, he talked about the expected headwinds of the economy and higher diesel fuel prices. Another issue in 2008 is the regulatory environment in Washington. The STB just issued another decision on Cap M last week and we expect Congress to refocus on the rails when they're back in session. No matter how you look at it though, rails must be part of the solution to addressing America's need for increased trans-station infrastructure. These challenges are largely external factors. Our opportunities, however, are within our control, and we have initiatives underway that will drive record performance in 2008 and beyond.", "So with that, we've got some time here to take a few questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of William Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Yes, good morning. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the operating plan and what sort of metrics we can watch for as fluidity improves? How that sort of benefits itself from the financials? Whether you want to think about cost per carload or cost per GTM, how much improvement is there left to go?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Bill, we\u2019ve set a minimum goal here of offsetting inflation when you think about productivity. And again, as Rob had mentioned, Dennis walked through... this business is also a function of volume, and at the higher end of the volume you can see some pretty decent improvements in unit cost. If volume is soft, there will be a challenge, but overall a good planning tool for me is to offset inflation.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then if we get the investment tax credit passed by Congress, how would that affect how you\u2019d think about your CapEx spend?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we've got a list of projects that clearly we would take a very hard look at accelerating and make the right decisions. We, as Rob mentioned, are... well, we don't have Board approval on our capital, we are looking about the same level this year. These are strategic investments when we look at it. We are going to take a hard look at some of the shorter-term areas like locomotives will be lower locomotive line next year, freight car rebuilds will be reduced\u2026 or this year, but we have some opportunities.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Just one last question, mixed price, how does it affect your average revenue per car in the fourth quarter?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think overall when you look at the fourth quarter, our average revenue per car shows you about what our core price improvement was, and I think our negative mix effect offset some of the upset we took from fuel surcharge.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks for your help.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ed Wolfe with Bear Stearns. Please go ahead with your question.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Hi. Good morning, everybody.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Ed.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Hey, Jim, with the guidance, it looks like for the first quarter you are giving volume guidance as 0 to 2 and then for the full year minus 1 to positive 1, a little less than that. What is it that you see that makes volume more challenging as you go throughout the year? I would think the comps get easier as maybe economy improves if anything.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Ed, a year ago, we were battling some pretty major weather issues up in the coalmines. So your comps are a little bit easier so far in January. In fact, I think if you look our carloads that were produced yesterday shows up about 3% I think overall for the month, 2% or 3%, and we are being cautious on the rest year in terms of the economy that... and there is a lot of winter left here in February, March. So right now, in the surplus, volume looks a bit... it is little bit stronger than we have in the plan, but I will be careful about projecting that up for the full year.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Is there some makeup from the $20 million you lost in the coal and grain loadings?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Not in coal. We... the coal demand right now given\u2026 with the coal production mine, you\u2019ve got plenty of demand there and we are handling every carload we can. There may be a little bit of carryover at Ag that's out there, but we're expecting a pretty strong\u2026 still a pretty strong year for Ag overall.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Okay. And on the... Jack talked about some business losses in truck and domestic intermodal. Is that in the thought process? And what were those losses, can you talk a little bit about that?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'll let Jack talk about this specifics here, but I will come back to... we're not going to chase business with price. And when you look at the domestic products out there, what's happening with truck capacity and recently in the trucking side we have lost some business out there. And again, that may continue the rest of the year, but we are staying very focused on our price and our return requirements. Jack, do you want to provide any--?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Ed, I think, Jim just sums it up. We did lose a piece of the business. We couldn't get to our reinvestability threshold on it, and so it is not going to be on the [inaudible] next year, but other than that we think the business environment is still very solid for intermodal. There is plenty of opportunity for us and there won't be an issue.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "What kind of a business was it, IMC or truck, and when did you lose it?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "It was truckload business.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "When did you lose it?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "We are losing it this year.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Separately, Rob, in one of your slides you talked about the OR impact from fuel in the fourth quarter of 3.6 points. If my math is correct, that's $151 million or $0.36. Was that really due to the impact at this timing of the fuel surcharges in the quarter?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It gives an easier comp, Ed, and then we look at it year-over-year. That's roughly the right math, but you got to look at what happened last year, which was basically just the opposite.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Okay. But I was thinking that you would see a large part of that invert as now you\u2019ve\u2026 the surcharges charge catch up in the first quarter. That should a pretty good positive. Am I looking at that correctly?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Ed, the way it goes to work, we are getting a stronger level of fuel surcharge, but you don't see it at the bottom line and so actually fuel prices drop because as well fuel surcharge is higher as a result of that higher fourth quarter price. The fuel price itself is also higher because it needs to be high. So you don't see the net benefit flow to the bottom line until such time as fuel prices were to drop.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And Ed, keep in mind, we are not recovering 100%. With our legacy contracts and the things we have out here we make good progress, but we are still not at a 100% fuel recovery.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "What percentages are you at?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are running probably at that 85%, 90% range.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Right. Can you give an update on the Sunset and the timing right now, where it looks like you'll be complete with the double track there?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Dennis, you want to take that one.", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Yes. As I said, we\u2019ve completed about 33 miles, but we made major improvements also on our terminal. And if you remember, part of the original plan was to balance the double tracking along with our terminal improvements in our infrastructure. So in '07, we make good improvement in West Colton, Yuma, Tucson, El Paso, along with the 33 miles. Now, we are still sticking to the time frame of 2010, 2011 first part. We are going to do a substantial piece of grading this year, so that we can look at the pace of construction and we will be responsive accordingly, but right now we are still sticking to our original plan.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "All right. One last one and I'll let some one else have it. It looks like if your headcount is down. You guys had a much better year than most of the other rails. Everyone seem to not be getting bonuses. What was your bonus comp like? It seems like you have earned some this year relative to last year.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we are still waiting for our Board to approve our performance next week. So we will just\u2026 we will wait to see how they see our results.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "But in terms of what was accrued in the fourth quarter, the incentive comp or bonus comp, up, down, flat--.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's up a little bit to a year ago.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. On your pre-announcement I guess just maybe a month ago on December 19, it looks like you\u2019ve lowered the range to $1.70, $1.80, and here you are posting above it. I just want to understand what happened in the last couple of two weeks that surprised you on the upside, just given that volumes you booked continued to become weaker in those last two weeks? Thanks.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Well, Ken, Rob had mentioned our overall productivity and cost numbers came in a little bit better. We did a little bit better on other income, real estate. We had a small insurance settlement. But I will tell you, we were sitting, as I mentioned, at the end of November with our volume up 2.5%, and quite honestly we were feeling very good about our guidance. And within about a two-week timeline, I think it turned from volume up to just about flat. Now, we... and when you look at the numbers here, the real driver was fuel. We had enough I think potential to deal with winter weather, you have winter every year, and we had enough I think momentum to deal with the weather issues, but fuel really caught us. So I don't deny... I understand we're only two weeks out, but to just give you some perspective on the volatility in this business on a two or three-week timeline. Rob, I mean do you want to--?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. In fact, you're right generated. Just a penny here and a penny there, but the big driven in terms of the delta that finished strong of course in the quarter was on the cost side. I mean productivity came in strong and as Jim mentioned there were one or two items that came in a little earlier than we anticipated, a minor insurance settlement, a minor real estate transaction came in a couple weeks earlier than planed, and you add it all up it pushed us above that revised guidance.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great. And if I could just delve into, Rob, on some of the commodities, if we look at Auto, Chemicals, Intermodal, yields were stronger than some of the other commodity basis. Is there... were there more contract renewals or anything else we can highlight as to what would be driving that pricing a bit stronger than some of the others? And then while we are talking about that, can you just speak on the coal side, did I catch that you said you are going to either start exporting more PRB coal out of the West Coast or have you already started to see that demand hit? I'm just thinking that that's a newer potential growth area for you.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jack, why don't you take that?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Ken, we did have a couple of legacy contracts in the Intermodal and Autos world that renewed last year that provided a little additional upside therefore for us and actually Chemicals as well. So I think some of the legacy stuff gave us a leg-up on some of those areas. We are looking at West Coast exports, we are looking at moving some coal right now out of Utah moving it over to Long Beach and testing that and see how it works out. Right now, it is not a big issue for it us. It's not huge opportunity, but we have to be very careful and watch how the international market play themselves out and how well that works for us.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Of the 6% that renews this year, is there any particular commodity group that you see?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "We\u2019ve got some Coal business, we\u2019ve got some Autos business, we\u2019ve got some Intermodal business, those are really kind of the top three. And I think if you\u2019ll recall from some of our earlier presentations, those are places where we have the greatest opportunity in terms of legacy contracts.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "One last I guess technical question for Rob. On the other income I think you threw out $50 million to $75 million number. I'm just wondering why you would look to that to be down from $100 plus million run rate you had I guess the last three, four years?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It is just our outlook, Ken, in terms of real estate transactions that we see in front of us as opportunities.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead with your question.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Yes. Good morning.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Tom.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Let's see, I wanted to see if you could give a few thoughts on the kind of pure price or effective price that you'd expect to get in 2008? I think that comment implies you get about 6% that would have been effective price in the fourth quarter. And I'm wondering that kind of pace is reasonable to expect in '08, and also what kind visibility you have in terms of carry through from '07 or contract you have already signed up, how much visibility do you already have to pricing in '08?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "When you look out next year, core price that excludes fuel we are looking in at 5% to 6% range. There is two primary drivers there; one, our legacy contracts as we\u2019ve talked about; two, our service metrics continue to improve, which brings some value. We are seeing some direct connection there in terms of our ability to get some price for the value of the service, while perhaps it could be volume and the economy where you could see a little bit of softness in some areas. Overall, Jack, our\u2026 right now when you look at probably what\u2019s locked in, I think we are in that probably little less than half, 40%, 50%, that's what we already really have in the book so far. Jack, do you want include anything here?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Sounds good to me.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Okay. And I guess the subtlety within the way you are looking at price, are you including... are you rebasing the fuel surcharge level moving that up in your contract that you resigned? And if you're doing that are you including that in the fuel price? It's kind of a technical thing, but I just wonder how\u2026 what you're doing with that and how you are doing that?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "The rebasing of the fuel surcharge is not included in what we target ourselves for our core price improvement.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Are you doing that or you taking the base time level from 25 a barrels or 50 a barrel or something like that? I know you do it in probably diesel, but the equivalent?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It\u2019s pretty a situational. For the most part that's the direction we are going from. But we work with customers and we look on each individual contract and the competitive situations to determine how we lay out the fuel surcharge.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Okay. On headcount, you\u2019ve had some very good traction in the third quarter and fourth quarter in headcount reductions. And I am wondering how you look at that in '08? Should we expect another two quarters of probably 2.5%, 3% reduction in average headcount and then maybe that slows down into half, or... how do you look at the headcount in '08?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We expect increasing productivity per employee this year. Rob did mention our non-operating force levels were lower. We have underway an initiative called...  looking at organizational effectiveness. We will continue to make some good progress this year, really working through really our overall cost base. Again, part of this will be a function of volume mix here. We should be able to absorb a volume with the current force count that's out here, but again you'll see increased productivity. I'm not going to give you a projection here right now, I... we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity and I think you will be pleased to see the results.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "How much was the non-operating exchange and when did that take place?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It was about 300--.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It was about 250 to 300 non-operating headcount. And as Jim mentioned, Tom, we are very focused on\u2026 as you\u2019d expect we are focused on ensuring organizational efficiency and effectiveness and we touched about 250 to 300 non-operating jobs as part of that process and we will continue that effort.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Was that impact primarily starting in the third quarter or was it earlier than that?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's the second half.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Second...", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "John, that's about 3% of our non-operating force. So I think that we\u2019ve got to be careful on... we didn\u2019t cut headcounts. In this business we know it\u2019s just pretty easy to go out and and cut jobs. What we have got to do is make it certain we maintain enough surge capacity when business does come back strong that we can handle it efficiently and you take them out at right places. So we're working very hard at taking a look at really every position in the company and asking ourselves the question what is the value, can we do it better, can we basically eliminate the work in a lot cases. So it\u2019s a... we've been working on this over a year on the organizational effectiveness piece, and I am really excited about some of the things that we see on the table for this year.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "Okay, I got... just one last one and I'll turn it over to someone else. You talked about the IMC or I guess it was a profitable business in intermodal where there is a contract that you lost. It was unclear to me whether that was allotted to your primary rail competitor or whether it is just business that was converted back [inaudible]? And if it was a lost to a rail competitor, does that indicate any change in discipline on the margin or is that really just a small thing as always?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Overall, Tom, we lost the business. I'm not exactly sure where the customer will decide to put that business. Overall, it doesn't change my outlook on the opportunities that we have for pricing in the intermodal world or for any of my other businesses.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "But it\u2019s not an example of your competitor losing a little bit to--?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I have no idea. You\u2019ll have to... I don't know how to answer that question. All I know is we lost it, I do know where--.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan", "But you don't know if it is [inaudible]. Okay, that is great. I appreciate it. Thank you for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Hi. Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for taking my questions. The lag on the fuel surcharge, which you said in many cases is as much as two months, is there anything that can be done during contract renewals or perhaps outside the contract renewal cycle or perhaps shorten that up? It seems like an extraordinary long adjustment period, given the current volatility in fuel prices.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We work with our customers in terms of their ability to process changes in the rate structures. Some contracts do a little bit better job, others are longer that is not here. I keep in mind though it also works the same way when prices go down. And while we took the pressure in the fourth quarter and a hit in the fourth quarter, as prices move now, if you have... if prices are continually on an upward trend here for the foreseeable future then we're going to lay behind in the quarters. But we look at it both way and work with our customers and do our what is best for both parties.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Thank you. One question on the construction up in the PRB. You indicated\u2026 I think Dennis did, that the fourth mainline is now underway now that this third mainline is completed. Could you give us a little indication as to how long that project will take and the impact that it might have on operational efficiency up in the PRB?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Dennis, do you want to take that?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Yes. John, well principally what we are addressing is the great territory with loads of\u2026 I can just say you this that the Powder River Basin\u2026 the efficiencies up there will not be impaired over our loading capabilities as a result of construction. And it's going to be phased approach that we are working with the DNSF on to time out, but rest assured, it will not. And we seen at this year even with construction of the third mainline already impact our ability to load out the trains on a data basis.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Is that likely to extend the entire length of the mainline?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Well, hopefully the demand will take it to that point where we will need to be that, but right now we are just addressing the first areas of critical need. It will probably follow the path of what we did with the third mainline coming up over hill with loads to accommodate to the great territories to make sure that we have adequate ingress and egress capabilities to the south end of the mines there. So that we are starting first and we\u2019ll go from there.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. Thank you. And then just one final question before I turn it over to somebody else, regarding the labor contracts. Are there any that are under negotiation or that expire here in near-term that we need to be at all concerned about?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the major that contract is yet to be finalized is the UTU, which are about a third of the employees in the industry. Negotiations are currently underway. I\u2019m hopeful that we can get a deal done pretty quickly.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "So, sometime in the next quarter or two, you hope to cover that up?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We will see, they were taking right now.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Feinberg with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, David.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "One housekeep question, in the first quarter you talked that the causalities [inaudible] leading to a $30 million headwind. Can you just remind the third quarter number as we model on out \u201908?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Third quarter was 47.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much. And then with regards to your '08 volume outlook of plus 1% to the negative 1% range that you have outlined, I want to understand what the sensitivity is there? You talked about the six businesses that you serve and two of being challenging, Autos and Industrial, I just can't understand if the difference between negative 1% and plus 1%, is that just the difference of those challenging business being more or less challenging or is it across the whole broad specturm? Maybe a little bit more color about where the sensitivities are to the economy or to your outlook by business.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "As Jack had in his one slide, we... Energy and Ag are not highly impacted by the economy here. So we think the demand there will be pretty strong going forward. In the middle where it\u2019s a little more of a toss-up, we had Chemicals and Intermodal, and that one clearly worked. We are not assuming a significant fall-off in the economy. We\u2019re assuming in the bottom end a pretty slow economy, but not a major fall-off there. And than on the other side it's a real question mark is the timing of the Industrial Products and Autos. It's not as much times as it might appear to be where we obviously can do better with a little bit strong economy. Obviously, if this economy really turns down it\u2019s going to be worse than the minus 1%.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, Dave.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Kartsonas with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Kartsonas - Citigroup", "Yes, good morning.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, John.", "John Kartsonas - Citigroup", "I want to talk a little bit about Intermodal, and obviously your international customers and line of companies are also feeling the highs of the fuel prices on the cost side. Do you get the feeling that there is\u2026 is it getting tougher and tougher to renegotiate this contract? Do you think there is more [inaudible]?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, John, there is\u2026 no customer is ever going to thank you for a price increase and they are tough, tough negotiators, particularly the Intermodal guys who can offer pretty big book of business out here. My view of those, when you look at the returns in that business we've got to make significant progress and we\u2026 as Jack mentioned, we've lost a business in Intermodal. If I can\u2019t get the returns we are going to have some challenges, but I think when you really look if the service is there it's the best guy, you have the best option to have long-term.", "John Kartsonas - Citigroup", "Do you think you\u2019ve to [inaudible] because of that, I mean do you think that's a longer term issue of just because fuel prices are higher today?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think overall, John, when you look at the East Coast situation, it just kind of sets back when you look at 2007. The West Coast imports were down about 3.5%, the East Coast imports were up about 7%. That was  a very unusual occurrence for us. I think part of that might be attributable and this is speculation to some extent on my part but also some indications from customers is 2008 is an ILWU negotiation year, and remember the last time 2002 I think it was that a contract got negotiated, there is a lot of port disruption on the West Coast and a lot of customers were very concerned. So I think they took 2007 as an opportunity to redistribute some of their business overall and prepare themselves, so they\u2019ve not got all their eggs in one basket if they are looking to 2008.", "I do think the overall the market International in 2007 was only up about 2%. Our forecast for 2008 seems to be overall market is probably going to be more like 4% to 5% this year. So we will see a little bit of the stronger market. And hopefully if the ILWU contract negotiations go a lot smoother than the last time, we will see some strength in that business this year.", "John Kartsonas - Citigroup", "Okay. That's all I have. Thanks.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Randy Cousins with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Good morning.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Randy.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Jack, I wonder if could talk about Blue Streak, how it is developing up with the prospect car for \u201908? And then as well, one of the big issues for the container probably is repositioning empties. I saw the LA statistics, export numbers are going up quite dramatically. What opportunity is that creating for you and how do you see a better balance in terms of in versus out evolving and affecting your business?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "First of all, Randy, Blue Streaks and in particular our [inaudible] with the NS is doing quite well, customer receptivity is good, operations has done an outstanding job of keeping that train on time and running. And so we think there is some really nice growth opportunity for us in that market segment.", "In terms of the positioning and the empty containers and those kinds of things, actually as we have renegotiated our legacy contracts on the international side we have put provisions in there that require balance and that has helped a lot in terms of the operating department, train operations, and how we move equipment back and forth across the network. So we are seeing our balance improve considerably. Certainly, the fact that the import dollar that the U.S. dollar is low right at the moment is kind of inspiring more\u2026 or facilitating a lot more export business forth that improves that balance as well. It gives us greater efficiency and greater profitability. So it\u2019s a kind of a win-win all the way around.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. The second question has to do with your Chemicals business. I think you guys mentioned that it was the one franchise that has had volume growth all through the year. And obviously you\u2019ve got it in your sort of neutral category. It would seem to me that that fertilizers and potash and that kind of stuff would still be an area of fairly significant growth. Any reasons for your cautiousness that are sort of company-specific or facility specific or is it just the economy that you worry about in terms of that Chemical business?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's entirely economy, in fact we have a couple of new facilities coming online that should provide us some growth if the economy stays with it. The anomaly for us has been that our plastics business and liquid and dry have stayed relatively strong and they have tended to follow historically more the pattern of the Automobile business and the construction and they are bucking that trend. And again, part of that I think is the lower dollar, part of it is that our chemical industry is more dependent up on natural gas and their competition in the world markets are depended on oil and you have seen the humongous run-up in the oil prices, but natural gas prices have stayed relatively stable. So it has given them somewhat of a competitive advantage, but it is hard to guess if that's going to turn and particularly if the economy were to nosedive from where it is today. So that's really my caution there, it is entirely on the economics.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then last question, just a reference to productivity, if we use GTM per employee as the metric, I guess, Jim, you kind of indicated that productivity would sort of match with unit cost growth. So does that imply sort of a 3% increase in GTMs per employee?", "And then I guess I want to get some sense of leverage, so if the volume starts to come back does that mean we\u2019re looking at sort of 5% GTMs per employees, how should we think about this?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Randy, I think... I hope we do see good volumes coming back here and we will see very nice leverage on the business. There is two ways to look at, the simple measure is gross ton-miles per employee, the other measure we look at is\u2026 would be our operating ratio improvement and also overall unit cost that we can drive. So it\u2026Dennis had mentioned earlier that we have put a strong focus, and you mentioned ongoing train size, that not only improves your productivity of coal a bit, it significantly improves the productivity of the assets in terms of locomotives. So we\u2019ve got upside on productively is the volume moves up.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "But in terms of GTMs per employee, obviously you have got flat volumes and you got unit cars up. Should we be still thinking about sort of 2% to 3% GTM per employee growth, and then if the volumes come back even more leverage?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think that's unreasonable.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jason Seidl - Credit Suisse", "Couple of quick questions. First, you mentioned a small insurance settlement, how much did you benefit from that in the quarter?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Jason, that was a couple of cents, like $7 million to $8 million.", "Jason Seidl - Credit Suisse", "$7 million to $8 million, okay, thank you. As we\u2019re in 2008 here what percentage of your businesses already have pricing locked in?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I said little bit earlier, Jason, that right now the\u2026 we have got a little less than half, 45%, something like that.", "Jason Seidl - Credit Suisse", "Okay. 40% to 45%, and then you have an additional 6% rolling over from legacy.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that would include the legacy... some of the legacy contracts that we have already negotiated.", "Jason Seidl - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And if I ask\u2026 going back to your carloading fuel consumption amount, obviously for the first quarter you explained yourself a little bit, but I would assume based on one of the other analyst questions that 4Q should actually be easier comps, what weather did toward the end, is your outlook for the full-year just conservative based on the economy?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It is. The economy and\u2026 you\u2019d mentioned first quarter I think also, keep in mind, February\u2026 you get the most snow in February in the US, but we think cautiously of the economy. It's hard to see this ability right now. We have got a heck of a sling even from four, five weeks ago until today and while some of it was weather we did see production shut down. We saw plants that extended their holidays and we are being cautious there.", "Jason Seidl - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And in relation to Washington, any chance that the stimulus package could have a real tax credit moved into it?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we are working on the proposal as you know and we will have to see how it works. My biggest concern though is when you think about investment as we need long-term solutions and\u2026 but we\u2019ll see. I think the discussion is good. It's pretty\u2026 we have not seen really any disagreement from any member when it comes to the need for expanded investment and transition infrastructure. And we can have either good jobs, they are local communities and so we\u2019ll see what happens.", "Jason Seidl - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Sounds good. I appreciate it.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, John.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Jim, you talked about your investment tax credit and some bonus appreciation and something like that. Given that your outlook for capital spending this year is flat with '07, if some of that legislation got past what kind of magnitude of change would you be look at in your CapEx budget?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "John, overall the industry is\u2026 it could be maybe 15% plus, but again you have to look at the location of the products, your ability to get the projects mobilized better out here, and the returns. When you sit down and look at it, I have got a long list to cover, projects that exceed what we said, but what we will do is work backwards to make certain what is it to do the return and our assessment on the performance. So overall it could be up to 15%.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And a lot of discussion about the headcount, but if I go back and look at the downturn in '00 and '01, the whole rail sector got a little overzealous in terms of headcount reduction and a lot of rails came that of that downturn. And when volumes spiked they really didn't have the manpower for at least a couple of quarters. How are you guarding against getting too aggressive on the headcount review? I can\u2019t remember\u2026 you guys actually in '00 and '01 quit hiring people completely and this time it\u2019s a matter of continuing to train people, but will attrition kind of works it way out of little bit more, just how are you balancing that to make sure you don\u2019t get [inaudible] shorthanded, should volumes kind of materialize?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "John, we not only didn't hire many at that time, we are [inaudible] and those days are over because as you know with UP we learned a pretty hard lesson and we remind ourselves of that every time we start talking about resources here. I think the problem is even potentially greater because of the acceleration and attrition in our industry. We lost last year through attrition almost 4000 employees. We\u2019ve put back again this another 4000 employees that will be leading the industry. We are being very disciplined in terms of how we look at our search capacity. And quite obviously, as I said earlier, you\u2019ve done a lot of jobs in the industry and are famous for it over the years, but we have clear guidelines analysis where we are keeping that search capacity.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And if I look at the headcount and with the assumption that volumes are pretty flat in '08 with '07 levels and therefore headcount is... headcount on the operations side let\u2019s assume is flat or maybe slightly down, even if it is flat are we still going to see labor savings as a result of 4000 employees going through the attrition process? I would assume or longer standing more extensive employees being back filled with\u2026 I guess what I am asking is could you see the required headcount and still see labor savings without necessary big jump in volumes and the productivity gains? Can it just be pure cost reduction as a result of lower cost labor and those type of things?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you need to factor inflation into your numbers in terms of what you look at on here, but we will see\u2026 again I think we\u2019ve very good opportunity in terms of continuing to show productivity beyond the operating areas, but again we want to be smart about it and you will see good productivity.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay and then lastly, just as you look at\u2026 you made some comments on the regulatory and legislative agenda that\u2019s out there and talking about when they may get back to focusing on the rails. Are you concerned at all about '08 as being the big year for rail re-regulation or legislation, or is the likelihood of the election taking that off the table in '08 and makes it more of an '09, 2010 issue?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "John, I\u2019m going to take it very seriously whether there is an election or not going on. We are going to basically be in Washington telling our story about the need. I think the [inaudible] is a good example where the STB listen to both parties and quite honestly they listen to the railroad industry in terms of some of the calculations. So we are going to continue to be active. We can't take our eye of this thing because of the potential. When you get to the second half of the year and people are looking at the elections, you may see a little bit less focus, but we are going to continue to be [inaudible] for a long time.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "And how quickly do you think the rail industry makes a proposal on the replacement, a value discussion? I think they\u2019ve put that on hold until you guys came back with a firmer kind of proposal. How quickly do you think you present\u2026 the industry presented something to the STP on that?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think my... right now, maybe first half sometime of '08 we want to... It\u2019s very complicated. There are a lot of different approaches out there. We want to make certain we understand the long and short-term applications. But it clearly is, you know this industry, you do the math, replacement costs on our capital investments are significant. So we are going to make sure we think through it in detail.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Very good. Thanks for your time. Nice year.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Gary Chase with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Good morning, everybody.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Gary.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Just a couple quick ones for Rob, and then one for Jack. The first one is, I presume that the $20 million in lost\u2026 or revenue the $20 million of weather impact of fourth quarter is predominantly lost revenue. Is there an assumption that you will be able to recapture some of that moving into the first quarter?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You are right. The bulk of that is lost revenue, and as Jim indicated earlier, maybe a little that in gain business, but not a significant portion of that was in our Energy business, Coal.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then if our calculations are accurate, it looks like based on where we are right now in the energy markets you'd have a modest amount of tailwind from the timing lag on the surcharges in the first quarter. Is that\u2026 are we looking at that the right way, about $0.10 versus $0.25 headwind in the fourth quarter?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right now, I would say no. I mean we are paying about\u2026 paying as far as about 268-ish level still. So we\u2019ve that kind of price. There is no tailwind. We have to see prices moderate here and rather quickly because of the benefit in the first quarter.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Okay.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Surcharges are pretty close in those areas to recovering the cost, although keep in mind again we don't recover 100% of fuel.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Right. And then for Jack actually, on that profit, of the 6% of these contracts, the legacy contracts that are rolling during the course of ' 08, can you give us a little bit of flavor for how many of those have fuel recovery mechanisms embedded within them? In other words, on the 6% how much of that do we need to bring up not just for core pricing, which has obviously changed a lot, but also for fuel recovery versus just core pricing?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Okay, Garry, that is real tough. One for sure had a fuel surcharge mechanism, and I'm just trying to think, the other ones I don't\u2026 there is another one that did have some fuel recovery. Some of them had some kinds of increases, which really is in the full-fuel surcharge recovery. But I think you\u2019re probably looking at\u2026 30% or 40% of that had some form of fuel surcharge in them already and 60% of them did not. That's just kind of off the top of my head.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, I think it is going to make a big difference. And then, just lastly for Jack, you said there was a lot of mix impact in the Industrial business and that masked some of the true pricing progress that you\u2019d made, just curious question, put some flavor on what that true progress actually was?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I think the Industrial Products world came a lot closer to my average price increase for the business than what their actual results would reflect because of the mixed impact.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Lumber versus stone.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Yes, lumber versus stone. The average revenue per unit on a lumber move is much higher, again length of haul can be part of the issue, and stone move is much lower.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "And we should think of that as core, right, I mean not\u2026 in other words, you said six was about your core price change.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "That's right.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you very much, guys.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "I would like to hand it back over to management for some closing comments.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you everyone for attending our call this morning. We, as I said, had some challenges this year, but we're feeling confident about our ability to continue to make progress and record another record year for Union Pacific.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Slides for this webcast will be user controlled.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you Mr. Young, you may begin.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Good morning everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Rob Knight, our CFO, Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President of Operations. I'm happy to report a strong start for the quarter here.", "We're reporting record first quarter earnings. Union Pacific earned a $1.70 per share in the quarter, a 21% increase over 2007. A key factor in this game was a 10% increase in operating income, the first quarter best of $788 million. Despite a variety of challenges in the quarter from continued economic weakness, ongoing turmoil in the financial markets, the endless climb in fuel prices and weather challenges we remain focused on improving profitability. If you look at what drove our performance in the first quarter, it was really the strong fundamentals of our company. Despite a soft economic environment, UP's franchise diversity provided a solid demand base. Record shipments of coal and strong grain movements allowed us to offset double-digit volume declines in products such as lumber, finished vehicles. And cement.", "Our continued focus on price produced record first quarter operating revenue of $4.3 billion. That's up 11% to a year ago. Offsetting a portion of our strong revenue growth was another quarter of record diesel fuel prices. Although we can't do much to influence commodity markets we are working to minimize the impact to our fuel surcharge programs as well as improve our fuel efficiency. The benefits of ongoing operating initiatives were evident as we improved employee productivity, asset utilization and overall network fluidity. In addition, the railroad's operating resiliency enabled us to improve customer service despite a tough operating environment. We are delivering a more valuable service product to our customers and in turn they are rewarding us with profitable business. Overall, it was a good quarter for us as we converted record revenue and reliable efficient service into strong bottom line growth. These results are a testament to the hard working men and women of Union Pacific.", "As many of you know, a stretch of our main line in Oregon was out of service for the majority of the first quarter. Thanks to the commitment and dedication of our operating team who literally moved a mountain. We resumed limited operations on that line a few weeks ago. We also appreciate our customers\u2019 patience during this time. So with that let me turn it over to Jack now for a break down of our first quarter revenue. Jack?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Thanks Jim. Good morning. By way of overview, all six of our businesses posted best ever records for average revenue per car in the first quarter, driving on a 11% growth in freight revenue to $4.1 billion even as the economic softness held our volume flat. Our Ag products team, chemicals and energy set their best ever revenue marks, while the other three groups had record first quarter and at the same time, customer satisfaction again showed year-over-year improvements.", "And turning the chart to page 6, chart makes it pretty easy to see which markets were impacted by the economic softness. Our automotive business declined 6% with growth in parts partially offsetting the effect the sluggish vehicle sales. But in addition to the economic softness, the American Axle Strike, which began in late February has also lowered volume and it reduces our revenue by about $15 million every month if that strike continues. Bumping construction markets continued to impact the industrial products. But the good news in our Industrial Products business was a 17% increase in steel shipments. Low inventories creating a strong domestic market and high prices for foreign steel limiting imports.  Intermodal volumes also continued to be impacted by the economy. Ag products revenue grew 10% with strength in grain shipments especially in the export market. Demand for coal remains strong and a 34% increase in export potash allowed chemicals being deferred to slight gain.", "I'm going to take you through a look at three of the businesses a little more closely. That will be Ag products, Energy, and Intermodal. We'll start with Ag products. That business posted the largest revenue gain as a 10% growth in volume combined with a 13% improvement in average revenue per car to drive revenue up 24%. Wheat shipments increased over 50% with favorable commodity prices, above average production, and a weak US dollar all combining to nearly double exports. A weak dollar also helped drive feed grain exports up 32% and much of the growth coming in milo destined to European market. Both wheat and feed benefited from improved shuttle train productivity. We expect that the export markets are going to stay strong and be a key driver of Ag products growth throughout 2008. Ethanol and DDGs continued their growth as well with volumes up about 19%. And about the only area of softness that we did see in our Ag products business was import beer where high inventory levels were still being worked off in the first quarter.", "Our energy revenue was up 17%, with volume up 6% and a 11% increase in average revenue per car. Continued strong demand along with more normal coal production and improved network efficiency drove the Southern Powder River Basin volume up 7%, setting new records for trains, tons and carloads. Colorado Utah volumes were up 4% for the quarter and were also aided by better production and improved service performance.  Now in January we talked about the fact that although demand in the Colorado Utah market looked flat, emerging export opportunities could drive a more favorable outlook. So with the shortfall of coal to meet demand in the global market and the weak dollar, we now expect that, that business will be about a 4% increase. The SPRB outlook remains unchanged at about 5% with strong demand from existing customers.", "With an 8% improvement in average revenue per unit intermodal revenue grew 5% even though volume ran 3% below year ago levels. Overall west coast port volumes were down due to the continued softness of the US economy and we saw that impact in our international segment where volumes declined 5%.  Volume in our domestic business was flat year-over-year as growth in the legacy contract business offset other business losses. We expect the intermodal to gain some strength here in the second half and to be flat versus last year when 2008 wraps up. Continued service improvements supports yield gains and helps us capitalize on business opportunities but most importantly it leads to higher levels of customer satisfaction. Our customer satisfaction index climbed to 81 in the first quarter, which was up 2 points from last year.", "Our outlook calls for the second quarter that it's going to look a lot like it did in the first. Ag products and energy should continue strong offsetting continued weaknesses in the automotive and industrial products segments. It looks like chemical volumes will stay pretty solid and intermodal should run closer to year-ago levels. Put it altogether and we expect overall volume in the second quarter to be down 1% to flat versus the year ago. Our full year outlook remains unchanged from the range of down one to plus one by year-end. The primary driver of revenue growth is going to be our continued focus on yield and we expect our core price increase to stay in the 5% to 6% range throughout the year.", "With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dennis for the operating review.", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Thank you, Jack and good morning. The operating team continued its efforts in the first quarter to drive better service to our customers and bring efficiency gains to the bottom line. The starting point for operations is safety where we continue to drive improvements in the employee, public and derailment prevention areas. The main emphasis here is our total safety culture and zero tolerance mentality.", "From a train operations and service delivery standpoints, we had another quarter of strong improvement. We are running a more resilient network today as a result of our capital programs, unified plan efforts and continuous process innovation. We are also using our resources more efficiently reducing train starts, increasing train length, and speeding asset turns.", "In the first quarter, we held 1% more gross ton-miles with 4% fewer first crew starts and 7% less yard and local starts. In the Powder River Basin, train length grew to nearly 131 cars per train in the first quarter, which will move more than a 100 additional load of coal trains of coal in '08 versus '07 without any additional crews or locomotives. We achieved these results despite a challenging winter environment. As Jim mentioned, we were without the use of our main line between Klamath Falls and Eugene, Oregon for the majority of the quarter. While our engineering team was dedicated to the task of reopening this line, the rest of the operating group focused on maintaining service to our customers in the most efficient expeditious manner. The results of those efforts can be seen in our overall network performance metrics. As you can see by the bars in the upper left corner, we had a significant increase in the level of network disruption, up 22%. Despite that we made a nice pickup in system velocity gaining a half-mile per hour during the quarter. We also managed the slight improvement in our terminal dwell and reduced our inventory levels by 1%.", "As Jack just showed you, we continue to improve the service product we are delivering to our customers\u2019, two measures that are very visible from a customer perspective are industry spot coal and freight car utilization.  The spot coal metric measures our first and last interface with the customer, did we pull the car from the customers\u2019 facility and did we deliver the car to the customer within the designated time period. Freight car utilization, which measures the days between originated carloads, was our first quarter best 9.9 days. Union Pacific and our customers benefit from this in the form of lower costs with both reduced daily equipment rents as well as long-term capital expenditures. We are also managing our unit cost with greater employee productivity and fuel efficiency. Other efforts to reduce train starts and increased train length are reflected in a 4% increase in gross ton-miles hauled per employee. We talk with you quarterly about fuel efficiency and our efforts to move more freight with less diesel fuel.", "Given the huge step-up in fuel prices, those efforts have never been more important. In the quarter, we achieved the first quarter best level of 1.28 gallons per thousand gross ton-miles. Again this is something that benefits both UP and our customers. Rails are roughly three times more fuel-efficient than trucks, so we have a natural cost advantage. For a combination of our conservation efforts and technology improvements, we have the ability to further enhance fuel efficiency and related bottom line results.", "As demonstrated in our network efficiency and customer service performance, we are achieving greater asset productivity, which in turn gives us flexibility in our resource planning. Although we want to ensure the railroad is resourced to handle whatever the economy, our customers or Mother Nature brings our way, we plan for this in the most productive and cost efficient manner. From a crude standpoint, we currently plan to hire about 2,000 new conductors, although this hiring level would be backfill for the preponderance of this, we expect attrition to take somewhere more than 2,000 and we have the ability to scale that hiring up or down depending on demand. Because we still have a couple hundred employees furloughed today, we have some volume variability with our current employee base.", "On the locomotive side, we also have a good plan in place to update the fleet, bringing on 175 fuel efficient environment friendly new road locomotives and at the same time we are also turning back more than 200 older leased units and parking up to 400 in our surge fleet. If we look further at where we plan to spend our capital and capital dollars in 2008, the plan is somewhat similar to what we did last year. Our maintenance spend budget is $1.6 billion. Those dollars allow us to improve safety, increase service reliability, provide for growth and enhance productivity.", "On the locomotive side and freight car side I've already discussed 175 locomotive ads for the year, this is 125 fewer locomotives than we bought in \u201807. So the total locomotive spend is less versus last year. For freight cars, we are going to add 300 covered hoppers to support our agriculture business, which is clearly in strong demand. Capital spending both in terms of new track and terminals is expected to total about $840 million, that's capacity spending. Approximately 85% of this spending is devoted to adding capacity in the sunset corridor and the RED-X areas of the central corridor.", "So as we move forward into the second quarter of '08, our operating priorities are unchanged; operate a safer railroad, provide an enhanced service product to our customers, and continue to drive productivity and throughput to create value for all of our stakeholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Dennis, and good morning. Before I get into the details on the first quarter I'd like to call your attention to a couple changes in our income statement. As a result of system enhancements and to improve the clarity of our financial statements we have reclassified the components of operating revenue into freight revenue and other. We have also revamped our expense categories to give everyone a better view into our business. We are reporting fuel as a stand-alone category and have combined purchase, services, and materials into one line. In addition, certain other expenses were reclassified among the operating expense categories. Of course, none of these changes impact previously reported earnings. On the Investor Relations page of our web site, we have provided reclassified quarterly numbers for 2007, 2006, and 2005 as well as a brief description of the account changes. This information should be helpful for you in updating your models.", "So, turning to the income statement summary, first quarter operating revenue grew 11% to $4.3 billion. Quarterly operating expenses increased $352 million to just under $3.5 billion. The primary driver of the higher expense was a 45% increase in fuel expense. We also experienced higher costs associated with the Oregon mudslide, which added around $20 million of operating expense to the quarter. The mudslide will also have a capital impact. Although, there's still work being done we currently are estimating between $60 million and $70 million of capital to repair that line. We do have some insurance that should help offset a portion of this, so we will be pursuing that over the next several months. The net result of our operations was 10% growth in operating income to a first quarter best $788 million. The primary driver of operating revenue growth was a $404 million increase in freight revenue to $4.1 billion.", "Our continued focus on price as well as increased fuel surcharge revenue was associated with rising diesel fuel prices drove the year-over-year gain. Splitting up the 11% increase in freight revenue, we would say about half was core price and half was from our fuel cost recovery. Today, roughly 25% of our total book of business is still under legacy contracts. And in the near-term, as we experience strong volume growth under those old legacy deals it holds back our overall yields. As you know, legacy contracts do not reflect current market prices and lack adequate fuel surcharge mechanisms. Our quarterly business mix was better than originally anticipated. Greater than expected movements of long-haul export grain as well as increased Colorado, Utah coal moves added to our first quarter growth.", "First quarter other revenue increased 9% or $17 million to $211 million. The primary driver of this increase was higher revenue from subsidiaries. First quarter compensation and benefits expense declined 3% in the quarter to $1.1 billion. Greater employee productivity allowed us to lower work force levels by 3%, primarily through attrition. Fewer train starts and lower training costs contributed to greater efficiency across our company. Looking ahead at the year, we will continue to align our hiring plans and work force levels with anticipated volume and productivity.", "Turning now to fuel expense. This category increased $295 million to $957 million. Despite moving 1% more gross ton-miles, we consumed 2 million fewer gallons of diesel fuel as we continue our focused efforts on conservation. Unfortunately, this improved consumption was more than offset by a 47% increase in prices during the quarter. Average first quarter diesel fuel prices increased nearly $1 year-over-year from $1.93 per gallon in 2007 to $2.84 a gallon this year. Of course as you all know, prices have increased dramatically in the last month and remain at historically high levels. In fact, we're currently paying around $3.40 per gallon and could average close to that price in the second quarter. This would be more than a 50% increase from last year's quarterly price of $2.20 per gallon. And as we've said, we are focused on obtaining 100% fuel surcharge recovery but until we reprice all of our legacy contracts, we are not fully protected from rising fuel prices. As a result, fuel costs will be a challenge to earnings throughout the year.", "Purchased services and materials expense were up 6% in the quarter to $469 million. We would attribute roughly one-third of the increased cost to the Oregon mudslide as third party contractors were employed to help us reopen that line. In addition, we experienced increased joint facility expenses as well as higher crude transportation and lodging expenses. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $342 million in the first quarter, up only 1%. Although we continue to improve our equipment utilization during the quarter those gains were offset by higher locomotive leased expense related to our 2007 acquisitions and car hire reclaims.", "Other expense increased 23% or $46 million in the first quarter to $242 million. The majority of the increase relates to last year's actuarial study, which resulted in the $30 million casualty expense reduction and although we continue to benefit from our improved safety performance in the form of lower quarterly accrual rate, the year-over-year comparison is unfavorable. We also experienced cost inflation related to increased utility cost and higher state and local taxes.", "Moving now to slide 28, we illustrate the drivers of our first quarter operating ratio. Our first quarter 2008 operating ratio was 81.5%. The effective increased fuel expenses, net of fuel surcharges added 3 points in the quarter. We also had the impact of last year's casualty accrual and the Oregon mudslide. Against these combined headwinds we made great progress. Strong operating revenue growth and overall efficiency gains took over 4 points off the operating ratio, nearly offsetting the cost challenges. Importantly, if you set aside these costs, we basically held our quarterly unit costs flat versus last year.", "Turning now to the full income statement. First quarter other income totaled $25 million, up $10 million year-over-year as a result of increased gains from real estate sales and higher leased income. For the full year, we now expect other income to be in the range of $75 million to $100 million. Interest expense increased $13 million or 12% to $126 million driven by higher debt levels. Income taxes grew 4% to $244 million as a result of higher pretax income. The effective income tax rate of 35.5% was 2.3 points lower than last year's rate as a result of a state tax law change. For the balance of 2008, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 37%. Net income grew 15% to $443 million, a first quarter best. Our diluted shares outstanding declined 4% year-over-year contributing to the 21% increase in first quarter earnings per share of $1.70. We continue to produce solid earnings growth in a challenging business environment.", "During the first quarter, we continue to purchase shares, buying back 3.3 million shares of UP common stock for a total cost of around $400 million. Since inception, we've repurchased roughly 15.9 million of our 20 million-share program returning nearly $1.9 billion in cash to our shareholders.", "Turning now to slide 31 and our balance sheet. We remain comfortable with our current balance sheet strategy. Over the last 12 months, our total debt increased nearly $1.7 billion and added over 3 points to our debt-to-capital ratio. We continue to generate capacity on our balance sheet through improved profitability and we are using that capacity in a balanced approach to invest in our business, pay dividends, and return cash through our share repurchase program.", "As we look out at the second quarter and the remainder of the year the two biggest variables are carload volumes and fuel prices. As Jack discussed earlier, we expect second quarter volumes to be in the range of down 1% to flat versus last year. Combining that volume outlook with diesel fuel prices around $3.40 per gallon, we expect second quarter earnings to be between $1.80 and $1.95 per share or 9% to 18% growth. The impact of fuel alone in the second quarter could increase locomotive fuel costs by $180 million or more from the first quarter level. Although we will recover a portion of that through our surcharge programs, the two-month lag will push some of that recovery to the third quarter. Setting aside the impact of higher diesel fuel prices, pricing gains and productivity will continue in the second quarter and increase overall profitability for our company. For the full year 2008, we had originally expected annual fuel prices to increase 15% to 20%. Today, it seems likely that annual diesel costs will be substantially higher than that. Despite that headwind however we are not changing our full year earnings guidance of $7.75 to $8.25 per share. Clearly, higher fuel prices will impact our earnings, but fuel generally has a greater impact on a quarterly basis than it does over the course of the full year. As I just mentioned this is because of our two-month lag in our surcharge programs.", "High fuel prices will also affect our ability to show operating ratio improvement in 2008. As we consume over 1 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually, rising diesel prices make fuel expense a bigger and bigger part of total operating expense, over 27% for us in the first quarter. And just the math of rising fuel surcharge revenue and fuel expense results at a higher operating ratio even if we had a 100% recovery, which we do not. So although 2008 is shaping up to be a challenging year, we are confident that our ongoing initiatives to improve profitability and drive efficiency will result in solid earnings growth.", "So, with that I'll turn it back over to Jim.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks, Rob. When we laid out our 2008 plan for you back in January, our message was pretty simple. Although we expected external factors such as the economy, high diesel fuel prices to challenge us, we're committed to deliver a record year for our shareholders. Our opportunities are clearly within our control and we have initiatives underway that will help us achieve our objectives. Being specific we will continue to improve safety, drive greater productivity across the organization, and increase customer value. So, with that we have got some time here to take a few of your questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead with your questions.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. Just to start off, great job in covering despite the network downside in the upper west. But just looking at the coal side, you talked about how the continued growth you are expecting from the shipments, can you talk a little bit about how if we are seeing any of the PRB volumes make up what is now moving export from the east coast, or are you seeing more and more of that PRB shipments go east?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Ken, I'll let Jack take this in a minute, but I don't... it's overall the export impact really it has an indirect influence in PRB. We are not seeing a surge in terms of request that it would displace eastern coal. We've got enough demand here just domestically that\u2026 out of PRB now we're talking about that we see\u2026 can be pretty strong here going forward here. Colorado Utah has been a little bit of a surprise to us. As you know, I think Jack mentioned, we were expecting flat volumes, we were about 4% up. Some of that could have some impact particularly, going west but Jack, is there anything I missed.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Ken, actually what we are seeing is the more likely impact is in Colorado Utah. We are moving probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 million tones in our exports heading primarily to the river and then beyond, but we are getting more phone calls as Europe gets tight and the coal imports come off of east coast mines moving to Europe due to a lot more interest being generated. But right now, the interest is more for the higher Btu Colorado Utah coal than it is for PRB.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Is there a capacity to handle that that increased demand?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I think, we're in fairly good shape and actually the mines have held up, you know we\u00a0from time to time have had problems with some of the Colorado, Utah mines in terms of their geology and things like that but they're right at the moment, mines are doing well, we are doing well and the market is pretty hot. So, we're feeling pretty good about it.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "PRB has the capacity. Colorado, Utah will be stretched. When you look at, I mean the potential you see any kind of a major surge coming out of, there\u2019s a little bit of upside but not significant.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "The network interruption days, that was an interesting one on the slide, I don\u2019t think I have seen that before on your slide.  How do you measure that?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Ken, we look at any time that we incur 50 or more greater train hours, any one particular day from an incident then we characterize that as a service interruption day.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "That's great.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "So, it\u2019s a significant advantage usually.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Now that the exposure on the insurance from the problems in upper west, are you still exposed about $25 million of that total amount that you'd given?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well, Ken again, I think we should be careful the timing of the insurance recovery.  We're not assuming anything in our financials right now. That will be a long drawn out process out there going forward. Most of it will hit capital and the pressure we'll see from this thing for the year, it will be the $60 million, $70 million capital hit we're going to take. Rob, if you want to --.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "That's right. Generally the deductible is 25, but Jim is right it will be a long drawn out process here, which is as I mentioned a majority of that cost that we incurred is on the capital side.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great. One last question if I may. On the line of locomotives, it sounds like you're turning back in a lot of older locomotives the 2 into 22, you mentioned and you only adding 175. Should we see kind of, can we see a sizable decrease in your rents going forward because of that?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well, You'll see a lower, by the end of the year, here we'll have fewer locomotives operating in our property. You should see some reduction going forward.  On the other hand, and I hope volume picks up in terms of the need to may be go back in the short-term lease market.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great, thanks for the time.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Hey, Good morning.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Good morning Tom.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "I wanted to drill down a little bit on fuel and try to understand the impact in the quarter and then going forward. In fourth quarter clearly had the timing impact with maybe a greater effect. In first quarter, if you look at surcharge and increase in expense, do you think that it was kind of neutral or headwind or tailwind. How do you look at that and then I guess second quarter just look like it's much greater headwind?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Rob, do you want to take that.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "I mean it was clearly a headwind for us the first quarter, Tom. I mean rough numbers, our expense was up roughly $300 million on the cost side and recovered roughly $200 million more if you look at it in terms of the yield. So, clearly it was a headwind for us. The second quarter, we'll see what fuel prices do but as I mentioned we're looking at currently high spot levels or prices that we\u2019re paying around $340 million. That's going to create headwind for us of which we are always, with that two-month lag, we are always behind when it's in a rising price environment. Now, that it goes both ways, when the prices soften we will see the benefit, in a rising price environment it equates a headwind.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "With our legacy contracts as we talked about there is no question, we are challenged to recover fuel and it is just going to take time and focus to as these things come up get the right fuel recover mechanism in there.  But as long as prices continue to go up, we're going to have a problem with each quarter. As Rob said, you bet...  who knows, I mean it\u2019s simply a guess where at some point, things seemed in a little bit of cycles and then you get the reverse effect. But our goal is to get 100% fuel recovery and may get mutual in our business going forward.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Right.  Okay. In terms of the 11% yield, was there any mix or was it purely $5.5 from price and $5.5 from year-over-year increase in fuel surcharge?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "There is some mix in there when you look at it and if you recall, Rob was talking a little bit about our legacy contracts that we saw some... pretty decent growth on those legacy contracts which quite honestly, there is not much in there in terms of price or what reflects in the market. So it did hold down, actually it negatively impacted our overall yields. But I will tell you, 5% to 6% is what we had set earlier for the year on our core price, we are sticking to that. There are some markets today that are hotter than that. You look at some of these commodity markets like coal, Ag, that are out here, the margin is pretty hot. On the other side, domestic intermodal pretty weak, international intermodal pretty weak. So we are in some of the markets, but the pricing opportunity is little bit stronger than others but we are sticking to our 5% to 6%.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And do you care to quantify the legacy contracts if you look at your volume growth for business under those contracts versus what total volumes were? What was the volume growth in the legacy contracts, do you have a sense of it?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "You know I really don't, I haven't broken it out that way.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "We aren\u2019t looking at it that way but we know that the legacy growth was on higher than average cycle. We haven't given that the number precisely.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Right. Okay.  And then on the opportunity that comes from high fuel prices, I guess, your franchisees has been tremendously leveraged, do you think like domestic intermodal but it would seem that truckers are extremely challenged with the high fuel prices and I'm wondering where do you see potential opportunity for us in business to come to the railroad versus truck just as the fuel prices are really hurting the truckers a whole lot.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well, Tom, there is not question, the pressure is there. We are seeing more interest, I think you have to be careful, on the one side there is a lot of pressure but I will tell there is also a lot of these truckers are just basically trying to get some positive cash flow. So they can put some pressure on pricing in the short-term which we see. But long-term, I\u2019d tell you again, we look at intermodal and coal is our highest growth potential. I just don't see the cost pressure changing on the truck side and that in my mind really bodes well for us in terms of or intermodal network.  Jack, do you want to add anything?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President,  Marketing and Sales", "No, I think that\u2019s right and I think as we move into peak season, you will see things perk go up again. Obviously, we could put a lot more business on the railroad if we wanted to change our pricing strategy, which we don't. So that's it?", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Yes. Okay. Great. Good quarter and thanks for the time.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks Tom.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ed Wolfe [ph] with Wolfe Research [ph]. Please go ahead with your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Good morning Ed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Can we get an update Dennis on the Oregon outage what exactly is going on in terms of, I get the sense you are mostly through it, but there\u2019s still a little bit of digging out?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Yes, that's a fair characterization Ed. What we did was we restored the service. On a night-time basis we take about a 10-hour window at night to run trains through there. What we are in the process of doing now is cleaning up the unsuitable material that possess risk to be able to come down on us in future operation. So, we think we're gaining on that and we should get that behind us here hopefully within the next 30 days and we'll be back with full regular operation.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So, assuming another 30 days, you know such two-thirds your quarter something like that what's the impact with a drag that we should think about from Oregon this quarter?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Well, It cost us about a nickel in the first quarter. I would, my guess there\u2019s may be half that you think about for second quarter. Now there\u2019s several components of it, lost revenue with some business, intermodal moved in the highway. You had out of route miles that came through in terms of running it where we could run through the [inaudible] and back up. And then again lost asset utilization. So, there is both an operating cost and revenue component in there and again I would, my guess is may be half of what we saw in the second quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And on the auto side, if I look at the strike which seems to be have done worse not better recently what's the impact as you think about that, as it would have last the whole quarter?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Well, it cost us $14 million in the first quarter, it\u2019s cost us $14 million a month and anybody\u2019s guess where that will come back.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. So, $14 million if we did that times three that's kind of a worst case scenario?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "It's right.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Now, that's revenue what was the earnings impact to that?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "You know, in the short-term Ed, a lot of that falls to bottom line.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Why you are laughing on me?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Well, I'm not going to give you the margins on the auto business.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Fair enough. Labor headcount down 3.3 and you made some comments about hiring but also attrition, how should we think about that moving forward?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Right now, it looks like, we\u2019ll hire about in total 4,000 employees for the year. We're going to lose about 4,200, 4,500 employees. So net net you\u2019ll see\u2026 you see that differential there. Again part of this is a really a function of how we look for volume going forward. I expect our productivity numbers, they need to continue to improve and so again it\u2019s a wildcard. What we have to be careful of here is you can take a lot of cost out pretty quick in an organization but when that business comes back we're very focused on maintaining our surge capability. We've got what we have 300, 400 locomotives sitting in storage right now. We\u2019ve got about 15,000 freight cars in storage. We have on our train and engine crew size, the total there is about 300. Now that\u2019s down from the peak where we are in the round about 800 to 900. But we want to make sure and we have the right balance between surge recovery and efficiency.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Jack had mentioned in intermodal strength that couple of times expected for at least it to improve in the second half and also said that it's not going to be based on going there to get it on price. What's the confidence, is it just easier comps, it is fuel being at these prices, why are you so confident in intermodal?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I think when we just look at the supply demand situation that's out there Ed, I think it's going to be okay. I think you will actually see volume levels pick up during kind of the peak season, kind of thing.  Although, it probably won't be as robust as we have seen in the past but I think it'll be there for. I also think that you will see some trucking, there are some pressures in the tracking industry and I do think you will see some of those guys starting to hold up.  And you will see some of that kind of take pressure off and put more opportunity for us in the domestic world for the rail side. So, just everything that we look at kind of tell us is it's going to perk up out here a little bit, it's not going to be an outstanding season but the domestic side of the business, it is going to help.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "There is another factor we didn\u2019t really talk about which is our really very good service.  As we put in service products into the market we show that consistency, customers don\u2019t automatically switch.  We have proven that, we can provide a good consistent service in the market and that's where we are also seeing more calls not only the truck, the cost from the trucking side of pressure. But good service products are put in the markets.", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "We are also extending some service out of northern California and other places and taking advantage of the new train service with MS and things like that. So we've got some growth opportunities there that are pretty attractive from us.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That was my follow-up, has the Meridian Speedway starting to open up a little bit for you?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Actually it is, we lost a little bit from this fare that we talked about I think in the last quarter with the contract, but we are rebuilding it fine and customers like the service, it\u2019s great performance, very reliable and I think that's going to be one of our growth features for the rest of the year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Last question and I will pass it off. Just could you give an update on the Sunset quarter and the timing for when you think the double track will be done from here?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "We are sticking to our original timeframe on that Ed, we're doing what we said we will do this year and that is about 36 miles additional construction, we are doing somewhere about 140 miles of additional rating and we are on target to get all that accomplished. And we are working with Arizona to get our permitting issues that behind us there as well as the local communities in Arizona. So, we are staying with the original timeframe, we'd like to be somewhere in that first part of 2011 and have it behind us.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks a lot for the time everybody.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks Ed.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of William Green with Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead with your questions.", "William Green - Morgan Stanley", "Yes, just quickly the follow-up on the intermodal, there has been some fresh reports about [inaudible] shortages, has that limited your ability to grow intermodal at all?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Not substantially at all.  No.", "William Green - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then, when we think about the repricing story, you said you got 6% of the revenue that is repricing this year.  How does that... how is the timing of that work, did you have 6% repriced in the first quarter or does it kind of layer in?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Most of it is back-end loaded into end of the year.", "William Green - Morgan Stanley", "So what are we really seeing in the first quarter, is it really, what you were able to reprice in 2006 then and then you will get the kicker the fourth quarter?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "There is some of that in there.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "\u201907 you mean.", "William Green - Morgan Stanley", "Sorry, sorry...'07, right.", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Right.", "William Green - Morgan Stanley", "And then can I ask on fuel, do you see any sort of demand elasticity as the fuel surcharges keep rising, recognizing that truck should lose more than you do but also obviously, it is hard to change with the two-week move in oil that\u2019s $17 per barrel you can change you whole supply chain. So, do you see shippers reacting at all from a volume standpoint or they just sort of accept it.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yes, I think in some cases we're again at the end of the day for our customer it\u2019s  the total cost, core price plus fuel surcharge and they're going to make their decision in terms of where there might be an alternative move that gives them more economics. In some cases, you can find some pretty low cost in the market but what we're trying to work with our customers on is long-term. In some cases, there is some business that quite honestly probably shouldn't be moving on the railroad. Again you look at the efficiency, if you look at the density, you look at the length of haul, that's out here. So we are losing and have lost some business that's out here, but nothing in terms of that I am overly concerned with. Again rationalizing the network and what business moves on here is a long-term process.", "William Green - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Two quick detailed questions. Leverage ratios, where do you see those going and do you expect that might have any impact on the second quarter call?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Bill, the leverage ratio, you saw the debt-to-cap ratio was up. We think as we improve our profitability\u00a0we have capacity on the balance sheet. We haven't given the target since what we're aiming for other than being a solid triple B flat rated kind of metrics is how we look at it and as we mentioned earlier on the mudslide in the second quarter I think Jim said about half of the impact would be a reasonable assumption to second quarter, which slowed that about $0.02.", "William Green - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thanks for your help.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Okay, Bill.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Two questions. One, have you seen, given how lean truck freight has been in the last couple of quarters. Have you seen the competitive environments pull over into any other commodity type other than intermodal in terms of more aggressive truck pricing for other types of commodity?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yes, we have... we have seen it in our industrial product. Actually, John, the way you would looked at it is any business that is susceptible to truck which covers the widespread group of things, our industrial products business would be one in particular some of the non-specialty chemicals a little bit of impact there. But it really, really kind of broke down to Jim's comment of the total price when you had fuel surcharge and the freight rate together and what you find as the business that we tend to lose is the business where we were stretching to keep it on the railroad to begin with and that's what the starts to fall off.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. Jim, to your comment about there being some freight currently on the rails that may be shouldn't be some, is that causing you any issues in terms of operational performance I mean, could your operational performance be... share  step function better if some of that freight that may be should be on the highway or else where wasn\u2019t in your system.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "No, John. I don't see a major a share step function there, we just have to keep at it in terms of process, capacity that's out here. I would say, well we had a... and you know, we always reminded we have winter every year. So, we don't want to make it a big issue. But I'll tell you, our network with the issues we had, we really showed a great capability to recover and I just don't see that on the... taken a huge chunk of business off there\u2019d be this step function.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "You know John, Dennis and I, when we came into the 2003, 2004 and the problems that we had there our teams kind of sat down as we did the unified plan and really looked at places where they were operational issues associated with business and I think we pretty well cleaned the franchise up on those kind of things.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay.  Very good.  The barge companies and these are really struggling right now, I guess again winter did show up in the first quarter, I think it was some of the worst winter conditions I\u2019d seen on the rivers on a couple of years and then one of the company's was talking about second quarter is going to be negatively impacted by higher river conditions, in the Mississippi.  Is your bulk franchise doing a little bit better than you would have expected because of some market share gains from the barges right now or would you classify that as some of the business that may be should, either shouldn't be on the rails?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "You want to handle that one Jack.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I don't see the market share shift from barges being significant as they do the export market demand that's out there today and the cheap US dollar, we are just really not seeing a significant shift from barge.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Actually I think there were some impact on our coal business because the high waters on the rail routes where we ended up backups and trains, so.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay.  And then lastly in terms of fuel, I guess, a year ago when oil was 75 bucks a barrel wherever it was, I can't keep up with it any more but the comments were made at the time that the forward curve on hedging and the type of thing wasn\u2019t that attractive and obviously, nobody had the crystal ball to think that oil was going to $120 a barrel or whatever we make get to. But I'm just curious given the rapid spike in and how fast it keeps going up and the fact that it just never seems to want give any back. Have you guys started to rethinking your strategy in terms of how you approach your fuel-cost and you're doing a great job, a better job at the recovery and surcharge programs but is there another mechanism out there that you need to start exploring again?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "John, at the end of the day our best strategy is on the fuel surcharge really, we have talked about it we don't ignore it but I\u2019ll tell you in situation that I have locked in a future price and it falls and then I have got the worst of both worlds. I am refunding, you're cutting your revenues side and you lock the high price and it can work both ways. So I just don't see that going forward here in as you said, I'm not sure anybody saw $118 crude at least the experts I followed very few of them had that on the agenda. So again our focus is on the fuel recovery, the fuel surcharge going forward.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Is there a price level that does become attractive from the standpoint of doing something on a hedge basis. I mean if all was back into mid 70s would you look to hedge it that point, or is the hedges are kind off limits and you're going to do this all through the surcharge mechanisms?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yes the only time we might look at it is where you get down to where we have the base coverage.  You look at where these things could kick in which is probably in more of the $50, $60 range.  But that\u2019s out here, but even then I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019d be hard pressed to say let\u2019s lock it up.", "John Barnes - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, all right very good.  Nice quarter, thanks for your comment guys.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks John.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus.  Please go ahead with your question.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning gentlemen.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Hi, John.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "I had a question probably best paying towards Jack, regarding the downturn International volume and how much of that do you think is a function of the slowdown of consumer consumption and how much of that is a function of fact that some of the retailers and the steamship companies running through the canals to the east coast directly, which presumably will now bounce back to the west coast if the consumer starts to purchase again?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "You know John. I think primarily right now you are seeing the economic softness, high inventory levels and things like that. You are not seeing the retailers really buying a lot or stocking a lot. We are still seeing some impact from the shift from the west coast from the previous ILWU negotiation problems that were there and you saw the big retailers in our ship distribution centers and things like that. So, we are seeing some of that but that's working itself through the supply pipeline and I think what you are seeing right now is more of function of the economy than [inaudible].", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess it increases the likelihood that we will bounce back here eventually. For Rob, perhaps I was a little surprised with your locomotive order in particular that you didn't talk at all about drawing may be some of the '09 orders into '08 to take advantage of the bonus appreciation, any thoughts along those lines?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "John, we will take a look at it but at this point in time we don't have plans to pull ahead any capital spending as a result of bonus appreciation, but we will continue to look at and is really just a timing issue as you know, but we will look at that but we  don\u2019t have any plans do that at this time.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Is it possible that perhaps take advantage of that savings with some of the work that perhaps you plan to do in the second half of the year that is not a contract yet, is that something that this is possible you\u2019ve heard that some of the other railroads are contemplating that?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "We will definitely take advantage of the bonus appreciation. But the question would be whether not it causes us to pull something ahead is we haven't determined to do yet.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "John, we have got a pretty healthy capital spend, I am not, $3.1 billion I am not, we are not going to ignore the economics of bonus appreciation, Rob said it\u2019s timing but that\u2019s a pretty healthy spread particularly given where the demand is right now.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Got it. I understand the caution. Then maybe just one question on the regulatory front we\u2019ve heard that sometime during the second quarter the railroad industry perhaps through the AAR has taken a lead, it is going to make it proposal to the STB to factor in replacement costs into the calculation of our ROIC, which presumably would take the ROIC down quite a bit below the new weighted-average cost of capital that\u2019s just generated with the capital asset pricing model. Is that a fair assessment of where we are and it sounds to me like the STB is going to seriously consider, do you think there is a strong likelihood heard that this could be adopted and what sort of opposition might you get from some of the shipper groups?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "John, as you know when I testified I guess it\u2019s about a year-ago now made a point of replacement cost and used several examples in terms of what it cost to replace bridges today and what I am pleased with this the STB is considering it. Rob and his team have been working very hard with the other railroads in terms of methodologies, we will see what happens. I'd again my comments when I am on the hill, is that what we have to keep in mind here is whatever methodology is fit we will determine how much capital goes into the business, it\u2019s going to be a function of returns and with our considering replacement cost in the equation you get to this point where you may save returns or cap, but you\u2019re going to see capital pretty flat going forward. So I again, I think there will be a nice debate Rob, you want to--.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "We believe in it very strongly and we are going to put forth our view on it. We believe the STB as Jim said has certainly opened the door and receptive to reviewing and evaluating it and will go from there.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "I think right now when you consider what's happened in this country, with trans station infrastructure the time is absolutely right to have this kind of discussion.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Sounds perfect, very helpful. Nice Quarter. Thank you.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks John.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Randy Cousins with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital", "Good morning.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Good morning Randy.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital", "Just in reference to your Ag business, I wonder if you guys could comment on the relative advantages of shipping out of the PNW versus the Gulf and whether more attractive shipping rate kind of PNW imply to the strength of the Union Pacific versus shipping out of the Gulf?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "You want to handle that Jack?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I think Randy the determinant is really the freight factors as we look at it today we did see a significant increase in the PNW. And that works out fairly well for us. But what we are looking at right now is the balance between the Gulf and the PNW and the markets will shift depending on ocean freight rates and things like that and we can play in either of those markets and play pretty darn effectively.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital", "So you don\u2019t have a preference one way or the other?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I guess it really depends on rate levels but I think intrinsically you would say that our franchise would probably favor the Gulf a little bit. But you know we are ideally suited to handle it either way.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital", "One other questions just on the revenue side, your Industrial Products Division was up about 9% which is relatively on the low end and I wonder what was going on there, was it a mix issue in terms of the arc increase or is it just complication from the truck?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Are you looking at the average revenue per car.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital", "Exactly.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I think Randy when you look at the marketplace right now in the industrial products world the price increases that we are getting, I mean that\u2019s a big book of  business for us, it\u2019s heavily denominated by lumber and some of those. And they're just not moving much products so we are seeing a mix shift there number one, and number two in some of those markets you are probably seeing more like 2% to 3% price increases instead of the opportunities that we have in export wheat, and steel and some of the other. So, I think it's a more a reflection of the market and what's happening there than it is anything else. The economic recovery will benefit us enormously.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital", "Okay. And then last question just for Dennis. 4% productivity growth in the first quarter that's, I\u2019m always impressed when that occurs in the winter, was that just either year-over-year comp or is that kind a sustainable rate in terms of label productivity?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Well, we did have a nice year-over-year comp but we stressed that we want to have at least a minimum of 3% to 5% productivity and that's our internal, external target and we try and drive our whole organization that way.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital", "Okay. And then last Rob, the guidance that you have given is that now including a sort of 340 fuel price?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital", "Okay. So if the 340 is a bit of is obviously a drag relative to what you're originally looking for where is the offset to some, can you give me some sense just as to sort of where you are getting positive variance relative to drag that\u2019s been created by this much higher fuel cost?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, it\u2019s the same thing you saw in the first quarter has continued improvement on the freight side and productivity, it\u2019s really wrapped up on those few items.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital", "Okay.  Great.  Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Independent Transport Research [ph]. Please go ahead with your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.  Good morning everybody.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Good morning Jason.", "Unidentified Analyst", "What kind of impact is going to... is the channel that\u2019s going to have with some of the factory shutting down. Is it possible that we're going to see a little bit of a double peak or may be too small hills?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Jason, are you talking about auto?", "Unidentified Analyst", "I'm just\u2026 and I know auto is going to be some of it but even some on the intermodal side, are we going to see sort of a spike in June and then may be a spike towards the latest September, October timeframe?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I wish I knew the answer to that. We're suspecting that it's going to get a little stronger here than normal in the second quarter that you're going to see a break and then it will resume after the Olympics and the key question, probably the speculative question is whether or not they'll come back from the Olympics as strong as they went into it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Have you guys sort of done any research into the factories that are shutting down on some of those smog areas and how much of your business is exposed there?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Jason a lot of those factories are heavy industrial around the area up there.  So we haven\u2019t\u2026 up there it\u2019s a wildcard here. At the end of the day, we are going to have to manage whatever happens here going forward in demand. That's what important for us, there is some surge capacity, there is some fluctuations here but I just don't see it at this point as a major issue for us.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay fair enough, and switching intermodal really quick given where fuel is at I mean have you had any thoughts to pushing up some more intermodal initiatives may be some new services to try to capture market share?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "We actually have looked at extending some of the Blue Streak lines and opening up again some of this northern California business heading to Texas and other places. So we are evaluating opportunities where we can extend the product offering.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Fair enough, impressive quarter. Thanks.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gary Chase with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Good morning everybody.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Good morning Gary.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Just a couple of quick ones and then may be one for Jack or Jim. Dennis or Rob, when you talk about these network interruption days rising is there a way you can generalize as to what the expense impact of that is or is it kind of all over the place?  What does it mean that you had 12 more network Interruption days this quarter than you did last year?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "It depends on what the interruption is, kind of short answer will be kind of all the places in terms of what the dollar impact would be. I said that this mudslide cost us $20 million in the quarter but you can\u2019t extrapolate every incident being exactly the same. So it does kind of depends upon what the incident is.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Okay.  And can you, you noted the $180 million which I took to mean the variance in fuel prices from the first to second quarter laid on top of the second quarter consumption is going to cost you $180 million right assuming 2Q is $3.40.  What's a good assumption for the incremental surcharge recovery that you would get from that given the lag that at $120 million or so?", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "I mean Gary, the running up, it\u2019s going to put pressure on us again, again if this keeps moving up Rob --.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "I mean $180 million is obviously not zero that would be an enormous number so there has to be some significant portion.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "We haven't given a number on that but again it is a similar dynamics, it depends on exactly what the price is, what you're chasing it, where it is.  But generally speaking we got two-month lag so a two-third is kind of number rough estimate right in place environment.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then Jack and/or Jim guys have talked and answered to a couple of prior questions about elasticity between modes as a result of some of the surcharges. Just curious if you've heard any color about or any instances of just the elasticity overall reaction to the total cost change and people saying well we've decided to ship less as the result of the transportation cost?", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "It really varies by commodity group. This is obvious when you look at the coal, Ag, and ores that are out of year it's pretty hot and in terms of their pricing what we've seen in demand. On the other side where they have the capability to maybe consider moving business from the highway there is some places again that we found that price elasticity point, but you have to... to me it\u2019s important to understand the market, the competition in terms of what's driving this and whether it\u2019s a short-term, long-term deal.  We could chase a lot of business by cutting prices right now, there is no question in my mind when we look at where we are seeing some business flow.  But I will tell you I just and honestly I just don't think that's the right thing to do us for long-term and Jack.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "You know Gary I have not seen any indication that a customer stops producing products because of freight rates. It's really the market, it's really the demand for their product, it's their own productivity and ability to manufacture and produce a product more efficiently or effectively than their competition and it is not freight rates that differentiate whether or not the product gets made or not.", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Okay thanks guys.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Okay.", "Operator", "Gentlemen there are no further questions in the queue, would you like to make some closing comments.", "James R. Young \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "I would, well thank you everyone for attending our call this morning. I would like to remind all of you that we do have our Analyst Meeting on May 15 in Chicago, which will give an update on our next five-year outlook.  I am pretty excited about the opportunities I see but we will talk to you about both opportunities and challenges and hopefully we\u2019ll see\u2026 all there.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you Mr. Young, you may begin.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Rob Knight, our CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales and Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President of Operations. I'm pleased to announce today Union Pacific overcame the challenges of widespread flooding in the Midwest, record high diesel fuel prices, and a soft economy to post second quarter earnings of $1.02 per share, a 24% increase over 2007. Quarterly operating income was a record $931 million in the quarter, up 18%.", "Looking at the drivers of our quarterly performance, discussion has to start with fuel. Fuel became UP's largest expense category in the second quarter as prices increased more than 60% compared to a year ago. Rob will talk to you a more about the flooding impact on our financials, but it did reduce quarterly earnings by about a nickel. Our dedicated employees quickly restored service to customers as they overcame the challenges associated with operating a 32,000-mile factory without a roof.", "UP's franchise diversity is a great strength and we demonstrated that again in the second quarter. Americans are spending more to fill their gas tanks, leaving fewer dollars available to purchase consumer goods. In fact, the Conference Board's June consumer confidence index reached its slowest level since February 1992. The effect of less confidence in the economy and reduced discretionary income is reflected in our lower quarterly loadings and automotive, industrial products, and intermodal.", "The offset to consumer weakness is strong demand for our bulk commodities driven by growth in coal, grain, and fertilizer, our agriculture, chemicals, and energy groups each hosted positive volumes in the quarter. And growth in those areas is facing even stronger before flooding impacted our Midwest operations. In fact in April and May, total car-loadings were running about flat through a year ago before finishing the quarter down 3%. So, we clearly lost some of our upside in the month of June. Despite little volume, our second quarter operating revenue was the best ever $4.6 billion. Strong pricing and increased steel cost recoveries both contributed to the gain.", "Operationally, we had a strong quarter. Dennis will talk to you through our few of the key metrics. So we had best evers in a number of areas despite the flooding challenge. That operational fluidity not only contributed to good cost efficiency in the quarter but also drove record customer satisfaction. Overall, we turned in a solid second quarter performance despite a number of obstacles and we're looking forward to further profitable gains in the quarters ahead.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jack to discuss our second quarter revenue. Jack?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Thanks, Jim and good morning.  Our second quarter freight revenue increased 13% to a record $4.3 billion even though continued economic softness and severe flooding held our volume 3% below a year ago. The revenue growth was driven by improved average revenue per car for each of our six commodity groups. Four of the six businesses posted their best ever revenues, intermodal came close, they had a second quarter record and only the automotive business sales has set a new record as our revenues in that business were down 9%. At the same time, customer satisfaction again showed year-over-year improvement.", "Last month Midwest flooding along with the flooding in the Powder River Basin in late May, clearly affected our second quarter volume with the greatest impact in our coal business. Overall, our volume was tracking flat to last year through April and May, would likely have come a lot closer to finishing there had it not been for the flood. We estimate that the flood caused us around 40,000 loads, but the good news is we think that we can probably recover some of that as we go through the second half of the year.", "Three groups, our Auto business, Intermodal and Industrial Products saw volumes decline for the quarter. Our automotive volumes fell 20% with the American Axle Strike driving about two-thirds of that decline and the balance resulting from decreased production by the big four auto manufacturers. The economic softness also showed us in our industrial products results where volumes were down 1%.", "The drop in West Coast port volumes is keeping our Intermodal business kind of sluggish, but most of that volume decline was driven by some competitive losses and the impact of the flood related embargo. The biggest volume offset was an 11% improvement in Ag products helped by continued strong grain market. There\u2019s also a plenty of demand out there for coal where volume was up 2% despite the flood. Our chemical car loadings grew 1%, as the strength in our fertilizer business offset the impact of economic softness in other segment such as liquid and dry, and our domestic plastic business. So this morning what I would like to do is take you just a little more intently on Ag products, energy and our industrial products business, talk a little bit about the highlights we have there in our second quarter.", "Turning to Ag products, once again Ag products posted the largest revenue gain with an 11% growth in volume combining with a 15% improvement in average revenue per car to drive a 29% increase in revenue. As in the first quarter, worldwide demand for grain and a weak U.S. dollar created a strong export market for feed grains and wheat, both saw volumes grow significantly in all three export markets; the Pacific Northwest, the Gulf, and Mexico. Overall feed grain exports grew 71% in the quarter and wheat exports were up 47%. While narrowed margins and tight credit are stressing the ethanol market, our ethanol markets continue to grow quite well. Our ethanol shipments were up 25% in the second quarter and we saw a 14% increase in DDG.", "For the second half of the year, the majority of the flood related damage occurred in Eastern Iowa and Southern Illinois, which were not significant UP grain origin. So we're really not expecting to see a big impact on our grain volumes for the rest of the year. And in fact, with worldwide demand for grain, for meat, and poultry and the growth in our produce rail express trains, we expect our Ag business is going to show continued strength throughout the second half of the year.", "Energy became our first business to top $900 million in revenue for the quarter as our revenue grew 21%, driven by a 19% improvement in average revenue per car and a 2% volume growth. Although both major segments of this market, the Southern Powder River Basin and our Colorado-Utah zones set productivity records for tons per train, weather-related disruptions resulted in the somewhat modest growth against last year's volumes, which incidentally were also impacted by severe weather.", "Southern Powder River Basin volume grew 4%. May loadings were hindered by mine flooding late in the month and June volumes, of course, were impacted by the Midwest flooding that curtailed shipments to the east, as well as in Iowa and around St. Louis. Chart shows you however that in July, we pretty much put that disruption behind us and we're running a strong. Production issues, utility outages in the St. Louis flood led to a 3% decline in Colorado-Utah tonnage.", "Looking ahead for the rest of the year, Colorado-Utah looks like it is going to be up about 3% for the year and we're still shooting for 5% growth out of the SPRB. With continued strong demand, the real wildcard for us is going to be the ability of the tight supply chain set, have some opportunity to make up some of the loads that were missed as result of the flooding here in the second quarter. A 10% improvement in average revenue per car enabled industrial products to grow revenue 9% to almost $900 million even as volume declined 1%. With weak demand resulting from the ongoing slump in the housing market leading to mill closures, our lumber shipments declined even further in the second quarter falling 25% below last year.", "The impact of a weak construction market also showed up in our cement business, combining with the rain in the Midwest to drive volumes down about 11%, but industrial products is our most diverse business group, and there was some good news that helped offset some of the overall volume declines. For instance, our steel shipments increased 20%, as the weak dollar limited steel import, creating a stronger domestic market and inventory replenishment across the United States. The worldwide demand for scrap and finished steel caused scrap prices to double since the end of last year and drove 17% increase in our fair of scrap volumes.", "Favorable weather in Texas combined with pent-up demand from the first quarter weather issues drove a 6% increase in rock shipments. And as we discussed in Chicago, our wind energy business is expanding by leaps and bounds. We're continuing the conversion to unit trains [ph]. We had two new unit train movement, the wind power component starting up late in the quarter, one moving from Mexico to the Pacific Northwest and another set from California to Texas. Over the second half of 2008, we're looking to win, along with opportunities and other energy-related markets, like resin [ph] and pipe, and continued strong demand in steel to help us offset the soft housing-related markets, which are showing at this point in time virtually no recovery.", "So as we look to the rest of 2008, we're expecting that our strongest businesses will be those that led the way through the first half, namely Ag products and energy. Chemicals, which is run slightly ahead of last year so far, should stay solid for us. As I highlighted earlier, industrial products is kind of a mixed bag, but we think there's potentially enough upside opportunity to offset the continued weakness in lumber and other markets.", "Domestic, intermodal, and our automotive parts won't be big growth drivers over the last year, but they should hold their own with volumes pretty much unchanged from 2007. So that leaves us with automotive vehicles and international intermodal. And at this point in time, we really don't see anything that's going to jump-start vehicle volumes. GM's announcement last week was only the most recent reminder of the troubles in the automotive sector as they deal with both the soft economy and changing consumer preferences.", "In international intermodal, West Coast imports have been down, the soft economy looks like we're going to have a fairly mild peak season. If you put it all together, we expect overall volume in the third quarter's probably going to be down in the 1% to 2% range versus last year. For the full year, it looks like we'll still be down around 1% requesting a relatively soft first half and our expectation that the economic doldrums are probably going to continue through the second half. But as we did in the first half, we will offset the volume softness with price. We'll wrap up the year with a core price improvement in that 5% to 6% range and that should continue to drive top line growth through the end of the year.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Dennis for the operations update.", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "Thank you, Jack and good morning. For the operating team the second quarter was a study in contrast. We made significant progress in April and May to improve the efficiency and reliability of the network only to have Mother Nature, set us back track with Midwest flooding in June. Despite these challenges we continue to operate a safer network in the quarter in particular with [inaudible]. Productivity was the real story line for us in the quarter, as we made strong gains in virtually every category. Employee productivity as measured by gross ton-miles per employee improved 3% in the quarter, through [ph] freight train starts were down 4%, and yard local starts declined 5% year-over-year with only a 1% decline in gross ton-miles. And another important driver of our operating performance in the second quarter was our network resiliency.", "We faced a number of weather-related disruptions on our Northern region beginning in late May. But, unlike the mudslide in Oregon these outages hit us right in the heart of the railroad. The Red Axe [ph], which is the densest part of the network, and in fact at its worst, our simple quarter over coast [inaudible]. Fortunately, we came into this flooding situation with a very fluid network. In the second quarter we experienced a total of 54 network interruption days, nine more than last year. Now some of you might have expected a bigger difference, but you\u2019ll recall that we had flooding last year around the Kansas city area, and in Texas.", "Our recovery from the flooding was much faster this year than last in part from the continuous improvement principles we acquired and from lessons learned. We set an innovative approach, establishing a co-coordinated redesign of the transportation plan that allowed us to maximize the efficiency of alternate routes.  We utilized a permitting process to control the flow of business on to our network. This allowed us to isolate the impact of a flooding to the Northern region. Our engineering team did a great job of pre-positioning resources, so we could get immediately start work to reopen the lines after the water receded. This involved rescheduling some of our work gains, giving us extra resources in the affected areas while reducing the maintenance impact on other parts of our network.", "In addition, the investments that we made over last couple of years to harden our rail infrastructure and add capacity and surge resources greatly improve the resiliency of our network.  The end result of these efforts can be seen in the chart at the bottom left where we improved our quarterly velocity by over one mile per hour versus last year. And if you look at our velocity on a weekly basis, you can see more clearly the improvements we made. We had a nice pickup in velocity through the quarter averaging 23.5 miles per hour in the month of May, our best monthly velocity in five years. Importantly, since we move beyond the major playing issues, velocity has rebounded quickly and we are running at nearly 24 miles per hour today.", "Our other key operating metrics, inventory and terminal dwell, both improved in a challenging environment. We are translating greater network liquidity into better operating efficiency and service reliability as shown by the charts on the right. Freight car utilization, which measured today between originated car loads was a second quarter best at 9.5 days. As we have improved our system velocity recrew rates, also improved declining more than 2 points year-over-year. To put this in perspective, 1 point of improvements saves us over a 100 train and engine employees.", "Jack shared with you the high marks that our customers were giving us on their satisfaction survey. Internally we're also setting new record at our service delivery index, which were used to measure customers\u2019 service commitments improved nearly 10% versus last year and set a monthly record in May. So across the board, we are improving operationally. We are consistently executing our transportation plan, which is driving greater overall efficiency and reliability.", "Looking to the back half of '08, the operating team will continue to execute on the principles that have driven the improvements year-to-date. Safety remains our priority and we will continue with implementing total safety culture across the railroad, summer is the peak maintenance season for our railroad. Our challenge to accomplish these major programs and continue to achieve the necessary throughput to improve service. We expect continued productivity from our structured approach to asset utilization and cost control and customers will see greater service reliability across all of our business segments.", "So, with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob for the numbers.", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Dennis and good morning. We\u2019ll start off with a quick look at our income statement. Second quarter operating revenue was $4.6 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year. Operating expenses increased 12% in the quarter, driven entirely by higher fuel cost. In fact second quarter operating expenses excluding fuel actually declined 1% or $28 million. Although, we did benefit in the quarter from a $12 million casualty expense reduction that was more than offset by roughly $23 million of higher cost associated with the final cleanup of the Oregon mudslide. The Midwest flooding also added cost to the quarter of a little more than $10 million, but we were able to offset the majority of these through fewer train starts and less fuel compunction. This cost performance highlights our improved operating efficiency and is even more remarkable when you consider the operating challenges that we faced during the quarter. The net result of our operations was 18% growth in operating income to a second quarter best, $931 million.", "Looking at the drivers of our freight revenue growth, we reported a 13% increase, or $496 million to $4.3 billion. Freight revenue would likely have been about $45 million higher in the quarter, but was impacted by the Midwest flooding, primarily from fewer coal loadings. Increased fuel cost recovery, driven by higher fuel prices, was the largest contributor to our 13% freight revenue increase. Pricing also continued strong for us, as we achieved roughly 6 points of core price improvement in the quarter. Our mix of business was also a positive. In particular, the business group with the highest average revenue per car, agriculture, grew volumes 11% in the second quarter.", "Turning now to expenses, compensation and benefit expense declined 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. We offset general salary and benefit inflation through greater overall work force productivity, as we moved 1% less gross ton-miles, with 4% fewer employees. Training costs were also lower versus last year, as the continuing trend of lower volumes requires us to backfill less attrition. For the remainder of the year, our work force levels will be aligned with anticipated volume and productivity. Cost per employee will likely increase, however, as the nationally negotiated wage increase of 4% went into effect on July 1st.", "As Jim mentioned, increased fuel expense was a key driver in the quarter, totaling a record $1.2 billion, driven by a 64% increase in average diesel fuel prices for the quarter. This expense category increased more than $400 million versus last year. Although our various fuel cost recovery mechanisms help offset these rising fuel prices, the effect to our profitability cannot be overstated. In fact, in the second quarter alone, we estimate that higher locomotive fuel cost over $0.75 per gallon threshold. Net of our various fuel cost recovery mechanism, reduced operating income by almost $200 million.", "By consuming 19 million fewer gallons of diesel fuel in the quarter, we somewhat mitigated the impact of higher prices. Consumption was lower as a result of moving 1% fewer gross ton-miles year-over-year, as well as our ongoing efforts to conserve fuel. The operating department\u2019s conservation initiatives, as well as the increased use of newer, more fuel-efficient locomotives have enabled us to consistently improve our quarterly consumption rate.", "In particular, our June consumption was very favorable year-over-year and better than anticipated. A portion of this variance can be attributed to our business mix, but the Midwest flooding and the associated reduction in train starts was also a factor. Another fuel headwind for us is the increased cost of gasoline and diesel used in our work and fleet equipment. This added $12 million to our second quarter expense. We are committed to improving our fuel cost recovery and reducing the negative impact of fuel on our profitability, but until we reprice all of our legacy contracts, we are exposed to rising fuel prices.", "Moving to purchase services and materials expense, this expense line increased $16 million, or 3% in the quarter. Cleanup and restoration costs associated with the Oregon mudslide and the June flooding, as well as higher contract costs, were the primary drivers of this increase. True transportation costs were also higher in the quarter as a result of increased fuel costs. On slide 24, we show both depreciation and equipment expenses. Depreciation expense increased 6% in the quarter to $346 million. This increase is driven entirely by higher capital spending. Second quarter equipment and other rents declined 5% to $338 million, a $16 million savings year-over-year. Better asset utilization and fewer shipments of finished vehicles and industrial products both contributed to a reduction in car hire expense.", "In addition, lower lease expenses for freight cars, containers, and equipments were partially offset by other rental increases. Our last expense group is other, which declined $3 million in the quarter to $199 million. The primary driver of the decrease was a semi-annual actuarial study we completed in the quarter, which reduced casualty expenses by $12 million year-over-year. Our continued safety improvements and lower estimated settlement costs are reflected in the lower expense. Offsetting a portion of this decline were increased utility cost and higher state and local taxes.", "You'll recall that in 2007, we conducted actuarial studies in the first and third quarters, which in 2008 will be completed in the second and fourth quarters. And in the third quarter of last year, we recorded a $47 million casualty expense reduction. Although, we will see ongoing benefits from our improved safety performance, last year's quarterly reduction will clearly impact the year-over-year comparison. The next slide shows our second quarter operating ratio. We improved our operating ratio by nearly a point in the quarter to 79.6%, our lowest second quarter mark since 2002.", "Of course back then, we were only paying $0.72 per gallon for diesel versus this year's average price of $3.60 per gallon. You can see the impact of higher fuel prices, adding about 4.6 points to the operating ratio. This further illustrates the substantial headwind we faced from the more than $400 million run-up in quarterly fuel expense. The ongoing strength of our base business, driven by strong pricing gains, improved operating efficiency, and the casualty expense reduction, more than offset those added costs to drive 5.5 points of operating ratio improvement in the quarter. This operating ratio improvement is actually understated a little when you take into consideration the weather events we experienced in the quarter, both this year and last year.", "You might remember that in 2007, we experienced flooding on our network that reduced our earnings by about $0.05 per share post split. This year we had the impact from both the Oregon mudslide and the Midwest flooding, which all together cost us closer to $0.08 in the quarter. We are pleased by this quarterly performance as we continue to set the bar higher with regard to our profitability. In particular, we know we have a tough comparison going into the third quarter.", "Turning now to the full income statement, second quarter other income was $17 million less than the quarter at only $19 million, less interest income and a year-over-year decline in gains from real estate sales contributed to this decrease. For the full year, we still expect other income to be in the range of $75 million to $100 million. Interest expense increased 7% in the quarter to $128 million, as a result of higher average debt levels. Income tax expense increased 13% versus last year or $34 million. Higher pre-tax income was the driver of the increase with some offset from a lower tax rate. The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2008 was 35.4%. This reduction is result of federal tax audits and state law changes, which increased earnings by $18 million after-tax.", "Through the first half of 2008, our effective tax rate is 35.5%. For the second half of the year, we would expect a more normalized rate of around 38%. Net income was a second quarter best of $531 million, a 19% increase. Earnings per share grew 24% to $1.02 per share. Of course the per share amounts reflect the two-for-one stock split that we completed at the end of May. Similar to the first quarter, our earnings per share growth is outpacing the rate of our net income as a result of our share repurchase program.", "On a fully diluted basis, our weighted average shares outstanding declined 4% in the quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased 6.3 million shares of UP common stock at a total cost of a little more than $480 million. Since starting our repurchase program in January of 2007, we have bought back just over 38 million shares, returning more than $2.3 billion to shareholders.", "Turning now to slide 29 and our balance sheet, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio is up year-over-year to the mid-40s, with about $12.5 billion of total debt obligations at the end of June. This puts us solidly in the middle of the investment grade credit range, which provides us with good access to the capital markets at a reasonable cost.", "Let me close today with a look at the third quarter and the second half of 2008. Similar to the drivers of the first half of the year, the key factors in the second half will be volume and fuel. Jack talked to you about our expectations that third quarter volumes could be in the 1% to 2% lower year-over-year range. From a fuel standpoint, our outlook assumes $4 per gallon for diesel fuel in the quarter. That equates to roughly a $135 per barrel for crude oil. At that price, third quarter fuel expense would increase roughly $550 million year-over-year, assuming a flat fuel consumption rate. The good news is that in the face of lower volume and a huge cost hurdle, we still expect solid earnings growth. We would look for third quarter earnings to be in the range between $1.10 and $1.20 per share, or 10% to 20% growth. Put some perspective around this, if third quarter car loads are down 1% and crude is near a $135 per barrel with reasonable refining spreads, our quarterly earnings could be toward the high end of the range. But if car load volume is weaker and we see fuel prices increase, that could bring earnings closer to the lower end of the range.", "We are also updating our full year outlook. We now expect volume to be down around 1% for the full year. This reflects the tougher than expected start to the year, with volumes already off 1% through the first half. We are also increasing our earnings range from $4 to $4.20 per share for the full year, or growth of 16% to 21%. This is above our previous range and is consistent with our stronger year-to-date earnings, as well as our expectation for continued earnings growth. Our focus on improvement will allow us to drive more of our strong top line growth into greater profitability for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Rob. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we'll continue to face challenges from higher fuel prices and a softer economy. We remain committed, however, to driving productivity improvements throughout the organization, while providing a safe, reliable service product to our customers. The end result of these efforts will be a record financial performance for Union Pacific and greater financial returns for our shareholders. So with that, we've got time to take a few of your questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be no conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question this morning will be coming from the line of John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question, sir.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Good morning, everybody.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, John.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "I had a question regarding the tremendous unit revenue performance in both the Ag and the energy as these segments both up in the high teens and I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on how much of that was price, how much was still surcharge, how much might have been the use of larger hours on average and how much might have been a change in the length of coal?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jack, you want to try a short at that one.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "In the energy business, John, we did have some repricing of a couple of our legacy deals and so the price component of that number was stronger than what we saw overall from the average for the quarter. And in the Ag business quite honestly it is just the strength of the market that\u2019s allowed us to go in and whereas typically we might take one or two price increases over the course of the year. We have been able to do three or four. So our core pricing in both of those segments have been at the higher end of our business groups.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "John, the other thing I would remind you is that you have a real [inaudible] on the Ag and energy, energy obviously we have got a big book of our legacy contract. So while we had a nice increase on the average revenue per unit, it really doesn't reflect what the market is right now, it is much higher than what we had in the second quarter.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Okay. I also had a question regarding the clean-up expenses with national disasters, such as the Oregon mudslide, and the flooding in the Midwest, you can recall that a couple of your other U.S. railroads in the phase of other disasters have had insurance recoveries on clean-up and rebuilding expenses. Is that something that applies in these cases?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the Iowa floods we don't see that being something that we recover in insurance. The Oregon mudslide is one that we do have some coverage on. At the end of the day though, you still you may recover insurance but you pay it back over the long term.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Got it. That's all I had. Thanks very much.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions, sir.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Let's see, I think, the only thing that really stands out the most in the quarter to me seems to be the cost improvement, the operating performance despite the headwinds in June. Where... how much of the benefit is that improvement really came in on the cost side? I guess if you look at headcount reduction in rent or was a lot of that held back by the flood impact and I guess if we look forward, do we say, okay, you are going to continue to improve and may be the cost improvement [inaudible] similar phase or is there some further acceleration. Clearly, you have a lot of momentum in the operating side. I just want to get thoughts on that.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Tom I think the best slide, debt [ph] issues in there, was the velocity for  foreign assets. If you look at, we had a dramatic fall off, we were running strong right before the flood. That's out here and then we have recovered and that's not by accident, that's by plan in terms how we\u2019re running our network today. We still have I think substantial opportunity for productivity improvement going forward here. So the rate that you have seen, while it was dampened somewhat by the floods and weather, we are going to continue. We said long-term, our productivity opportunities and said at a minimum we want to offset inflation. And Dennis, you want to add to that.", "Dennis J. Duffy - Executive Vice President, Operations", "The one thing I'd add to it Tom, is that we tried to show you at our previous analyst sessions that we have a very structured approach to cost reduction asset utilization and I think you are starting to see some significant payoffs from our efforts on the unified plans and performing our network and running in much disappoint operation and we expect that to continue.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "So if I look at, I think, equipment rents here improved about 130 basis points year-over-year if you look at as a percent of revenue and then headcount was down 4%. Is that type of case probably can continue for few more quarters and might even accelerated much if you don't have more weather events, is that a fair way to look at it?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'd be careful about just extending it out. [inaudible] a great one in there is  we are reducing our lease locomotives, short-term lease locomotives, which is directly related to the velocity improvement, or end the year with fewer locomotives when you look at it and as we\u2019ve said you before, part of the additions, and all that's looking backwards were the part of challenges we had with velocity, but we\u2019ve got opportunities going forward. Rob, you want to add?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "One comment. Just to remember last year's third quarter was a very good performance period. So while we continue to make the improvements, you got headwind of a difficult component third quarter. The other point I would make to your earlier comment is on the fuel consumption. As we pointed out the fuel consumption in June as a result of some mix issues and the weather was extraordinarily good and I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that that run rate would continue, we'll continue to make improvements but that particular run rate could help us on the fuel consumption side in the second quarter.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And what... it seems like improvement in velocity is a good indicator at the present time, some improvement in your cost side performance. Where do you think velocity may ultimately go to, is it realistic to look back to '02 and say you get to those levels or you think there is a sense maybe going into next year, you could even exceed those type of levels?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We're going to continue to improve our velocity, part of this will... part of this in my mind is, is the market willing to pay for the service fees, there are two equations of velocities, which are reducing assets, improving the returns. The other fees, in fact my head of marketing actually missed the slide, so I have to bail him out here, on the customer satisfaction side. If you look at, we had a customer satisfaction for the quarter of 83, the best since merger and there is a great value there from the customer base as we turn their assets and provide great service. I don't have a number... I mean we don't have a number [inaudible] what's the ultimate velocity what we're focused on is every year improving our asset utilization earnestly [ph].", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then I guess last one, I'll pass along to someone else. On legacy contracts, I think you commented that coal got a bit of boost from some legacy pricing in second quarter. Is there more, I guess your contract is kind of second half loaded, so can we see a little further acceleration even in effective pricing on some of the lines in second half as more of those legacy yields are repriced here?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You will see the carryover effect of things we've done so far Tom and really from this point forward, the bulk of them are going to be year end expirations. We don't really have many coming up here in the third and fourth quarter.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay great, well, congratulations on the strong results.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "The other thing regarding the energy business was also in some of our export co-opportunities. We have a new move of export coal that's driven down to Mexico. We've also stated moving some coal off the West Coast to Asia and both of those helped us as well from a pricing perspective this quarter.", "Thomas Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of William Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question sir.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Hey Jim, maybe I can just follow-up with one comment you just made here at the end. The service improvement, should we think about that as being able to extend the period where you can kind of the same as modest 6% core pricing or could it actually mean that contracts you\u2019ve already priced even more upside, so we can think of maybe even growing that core price.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, I think they\u2019re... both exposed there really as were you, and we said it consistently, there is a market price for obviously the service we're providing today, but we clearly are seeing some very good opportunities where we're clearly entering new markets providing service products. So I think the value of railroads really are... really showing through right now with our customer base, so I see that upside on both sides.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then you mentioned that you think coal to be strong. Do you have a sense for where your stockpiles are? I mean is this something where you just going to makeup the flooding or we actually have even more pent-up demand there?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Stockpiles at the moment are declining and but that's really not unusual for this time of the year. I mean this is the heavy season burn. So you would expect that, I don't know that they would say they are declining at an alarming rate, they are kind of seasonally acting the way we think. So we think we will have stockpile replenishment as well as some upside opportunities collectively for some export business and then we got some other recoveries stuff that\u2019s out there. So, I think there is three things that again contribute to our strong second half for coal.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just last question, at the analyst day you mentioned that you had seen lumber shipment sort of, seen no longer to deteriorates sequentially. Are you seeing any signs that things are getting better now in that world or was that just sort of a fluke?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll answer that one. I don't think we\u2019re now what 25% in quarter, that\u2019s on top of, we are down almost 50% I think from where we were in the peak. I don't see anything out there on the housing side that there is a recovery in the near-term, where our planning cycle next year say, certainly peaks up. Now we are fortune to have good mix of business. If you look, fuel was up what 15% or so, 17% stone, some of that is related to highway constructions. But I don't see anything in the near term that is going to drive our private lumber business backup.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks for your help", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question, sir.", "Kenneth Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great, good morning. Just on the oil side, now that we have seen a bit of a pull back you were talking about [inaudible] and the impact to earnings but since we seen a $20 pullback, I'm just wondering do you see any of that domestic intermodal that Jack, you were talking on might be good in the second-half. Do you see any of that may be potentially going back to the truck or do you think you keep winning even at these high lumpy [ph] levels", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Ken, I really think that the domestic intermodal will stay fairly strong for us over the\u2026 even at the pullback 20 bucks. I think we're going to see a sustained demand or some good initiatives that we have in the marketplace. We\u2019ve got some great service product and our service is getting better and better all the time. So one of the cool things we\u2019re seeing happen right now is that the service gap between truck and rail as our service improves and this highway congestion gets worse we\u2019re closing that gap and so we've got a lot of very strong products particularly on the Southeast and the Sunset route [ph], or places like that. I think we will continue to make inroads even as fuel prices bring that down. Well, part of the domestic, two things. One obviously, the economy. But there is a second one here is what is happening with excess freight capacity today. And we know it's been shrinking in terms of if you look at equipment being sold overseas, we've actually have seen some areas that have we saw some shortages in terms of equipment. So I think there are obviously fuels of energy cost are big feel to the truckers, but there are other factors that have played out here.", "Kenneth Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Just a two quick technical questions if I can. In the annual targets, are you using the $1.02 or you excluding the tax gain in that full-year target?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We are using the $1.02.", "Kenneth Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then the same for was it last quarter you also had the tax gain?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. We are including that.", "Kenneth Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks. And then on the fuel Rob, do you use WTI or diesel in your surcharge rate?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We\u2019ve had several different surcharge, but very little of it is WTI. DOE is the persona driver.", "Kenneth Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then I think you rather, it was mentioned earlier but intermodal was driven by competitive losses, I think maybe Jack mentioned that. Can you talk about the scale of what on the international side is being losses, you're going outward or East or is it being lost to other carriers out West?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Ken, we lost some business to rail in terms of the contract. So, it wasn't really shifting to these.", "Kenneth Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then the pricing mix in that high teens performance this quarter great 16% yield. I think can you simplify that what percent was share price?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Fuel price is up about 6%.", "Kenneth Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "So [inaudible] 5% range", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "Kenneth Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And the last question I have is, just as you look on the 4% increase in cost, the employee decrease [ph] and the new contract that Rob talked about... just wondering what... are there anything specific that you need to do in order to offset this, immediate increase in this quarter or is that going to be something you just trying to keep the ongoing productivity that gradually offset that, so could we see\u2026 is that why you are being cautious on the third quarter because of the scale of that employee cost decrease [ph]?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're going to have the pressure as Rob mentioned but would need to continue to focus on our productivity, we are now reducing recrews, we talked about that before. We... our recrew rates while we had a good improvement year-over-year we're still running about 8% or 8.5%... 8% or 9%, so we got to keep focused on the productivity piece.", "Kenneth Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Right. Thanks so much for the time. Great job.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay Ken.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Feinberg with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question, sir.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi David.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "One question, because weather has been such a hot topic, I figure, I might as well ask it, I guess [inaudible] is that having any impact on you, close to Texas?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No major impact.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Say that again.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Not a major impact at all.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "You made some comments about your international Intermodal business in the second half of the year, talking about a mild peak season. I was wondering if you provide some more color, were you speaking specific to UNP or those comments based on your outlook for the U.S. economy, does it have to relate to the fact that you lost this contract? I'm Just trying to understand what led you to think that the peak season will be mild, is this overall or were customer-specific?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we are speaking to UNP but it really starts at where do you think consumer spending is going to go. I mean of course, part of peak is getting ready for Christmas. Our auto producers, which also are part of peak as they are producing new models, we don't expect that to be strong this year. So, it is unique to UP but it also reflects the reflex what's happening in the overall economy. We will have a peak, it just simply... it may be only a hill instead of a mountain.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Fair enough. And then last question, you talked a little bit about truck-to-rail conversion, can you talk about length of haul, I understand you have some new service offerings that are helping you win but are those offset... what's the length... what's the typical length of haul, shorter in duration or they longer, is there any difference [inaudible]?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Typically long haul business, it's West Coast to the Southeast, Northern California business heading to the east.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Are you seeing anything on north, south moves in the Midwest shorter distances or not yet?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Not particularly strong.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks very much.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay David.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ed Wolfe with Wolfe Research. Go ahead with your question, sir.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Hi thanks. Good morning guys.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Ed.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "What happened in the last two and a half weeks that allows you to print such a strong number at the end of the quarter, I mean you still talked about Nickel of impact from the West Coast, so, what really happened at the end of the quarter that was so positive and can you talk about that relative to how July begins?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Ed, we ended up with just a much stronger finish to the quarter. It was when we gave our guidance, the fuel impact or the weather impact came in pretty close to what we thought, but we saw a pretty strong bump quarter in the quarter... at the end of the quarter. And right now, it\u2019s\u2026 if you take auto side of the equation, we are\u2026.Dennis, we had shown you what was happening with coal running over 37 trains a day out of PRB and coal. So it's seeing a little bit stronger. But it just\u2026 it doesn't take much when you look at\u2026 our productivity came in a little bit better, and then fuel, fuel consumption came in better.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Right. Jack talked before about Oregon through PRB and Gulf. Can you us a sense for on the export grain side for the mix of volume or revenue in terms of how that puts up?", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Right now, the markets are favoring some of the Pacific Northwest shipments, and so we are seeing product move from the Midwest, up to the PNW. But we are seeing uniform strength whether it is moving in Gulf, PNW or Mexico right at the moment. It's typically for us the PNW would be one of the, one of the weaker market, but it's pretty strong right now. So all three outlets for our international grain feeds are doing quite well.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "But in terms of the size of each one, where are they right now?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I don't have the specifics on that, Ed.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Relative to each other\u2026", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Pardon me.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Relative, are they fairly even at this point\u2026 not just specific, but just relative to where more volumes were?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "You can have more volume would be flowing Gulf of Mexico then you were to the PNW.  That would be the smallest of the three for us.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "And the Gulf and Mexico, where is that mostly moving to?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Part of it\u2026 in terms of the final destination?", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Yes", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Asian markets.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "You have concerns at all at the end of the year based on what we\u2019re hearing from Australia in terms of after two years of drought, it feels like they are going to have some very strong planting?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I think where that' going to impact us is going to be in the weak markets. If you look at last year's weak crop around the world, the U.S. had the bumper crop. Everything else was relatively soft. So the Australian wheat crop and others are going to bounce back. That said, we are going to basically, probably diminish some of the strength in wheat sometime around the fourth quarter but I think we'll still have plenty of market demand for our products and that shouldn't be an issue. Another place where we've seen some pretty strong exports is also to Europe or in Italy in particular through our wheat products. And so we think some of that's going to roll back a little bit here in the fourth quarter. But it is not going to be draconian by stretch of imagination. We will still have solid market demand for our grain products.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Revenue forecast, you have a little bit last weak but made up in other areas basically [ph]?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Yes, corn is going to be okay despite the kind of the concerns right now. In our served territory, our corn crop should be good. I mean, you know always have that normal crop risk that you have to worry about early frost and those kinds of things. And some of the loss acreage got transplanted into soybeans and again, you know the soybean market should be strong, the acreage is looking good. The corn profit itself the quality of the crop, we were concerned that the quality of the crop was going to be weak but it's actually the latest projections of back up to 150 bushels in acres. So, it should be good.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Okay, and just shifting here Jack, to coal and export coal you talked about Mexico and West Coast. Can you talk a little bit about what the size of that export coal product is currently in and what the capacity is to stand that over the next couple of years?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Yes. Well, this year in total, Ed we will probably do about 4 million tones of export and probably 1 million to 1.250 million of that is going to be throughout the West Coast going to steel producers in the Asian Rim countries. Probably a half of million tones down to Mexico and then the balance is going to move through the river and head off to Europe, Spain and other places. That's kind of the run that there is right now. There is actually more capacity out there, I think from the port perspective and the rail perspective than there is right now at least on the mine side of things. So, yes, in fact we could get greater production out of Colorado- Utah. I think we would have some greater upside potential right and I think in the first quarter I mentioned that our export potential were somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 million tones alone just off the West Coast. I think my team now would say new interests, new contracts would say that export market is probably somewhere in the 15 million tone range, in terms of what the potentials. We don't know how many of those will come to fruition, but we are feeling actually pretty good. We spend a lot of time working with ports. We think there is port potential capacity out there that's been used that we have the opportunity and I think our biggest concern right now, our biggest opportunity is that we can get more production out of the mine.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "What's your best guess in the mine can get you more production?", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "They are working hard at it, it is pretty hard to determine...", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "The quarters are years away.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "I would say is, the quarters, I would say next year I think over the time period, I think you\u2019re 12 to 18 months away. Ed, I think question though was long term, when does Australia come back into market I think again they are talking about a couple of years. RPB could be of interest as moving export. So, I think again we export coal in cycles and this is one of the positive ones here. I think if it's sustainable, you will see the supply chain respond. The other thing we're seeing on is just a pullback phenomena of the Eastern Appalachian coal going international. Because we have got a lot more interest now from Eastern utilities running to bring in PRB coal. Typically what they are trying to do is blend it. So they don't have to make major modifications to the boilers. But there is far more interest in trying to make those movements happen now as well.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "And is that magnifying itself or manifesting itself in terms of test run or request for a test, where are you in that process.", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "Yes, it\u2019s a combination of test run, but it's not only any, I mean any rail road that has a test run, whether it is us, or whether it is our competition the contracts when they come up for opportunistic bidding will be a free flow for all of us.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Okay. When is [inaudible] of that and then I just had one quick one [inaudible].", "John J. Koraleski - Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales", "We could actually see some of the come to fruition in 2009", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Okay, just the last one. You talked about the split between 6% pricing, what the other 9% or so, how do that split between fuel and mix. Give or take?", "Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Two points may be mix, Ed.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Thanks for the time. That's helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen we\u2019ve reached the end of our allotted time for questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments.", "James R. Young - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I want to thank everybody for being on the call this morning. I hope to see we've got some great upside going forward here and look forward to talking to you again here in our third quarter call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides today will be user control.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you Mr. Young, you may begin.", "Jim Young", "Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Rob Knight, CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales and Dennis Duffy, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Today UP's reporting record results. Third quarter earnings grew 38% or $1.38 per share. Solid pricing our fuel cost recoveries and strong operating productivity all combined to produce record quarterly operating income of $1.2 billion, up 21%.", "All the economic environment has clearly weaken during the year, we have maintained our focus in running a profitable railroad and are delivering strong results for both our customers and shareholders.", "UP's franchise diversity provide us with a solid based load demand, as evidenced by the 1% growth in revenue ton-miles during the quarter. Our business mix was favorably impacted by the strong demand for both commodities, which brings with that high-density long haul moves.", "With coal in particular we set a number of Southern Powder River Basin loading records in the quarter. Capital investments in the Joint Line UP's train size initiatives and co-dated efforts were both producers and receivers all contributed to these achievements.", "Third quarter carloads, despite 5% year-over-year decrease was still a strongest of the year. Although, most of this weakness is clearly related to the economy about one point of the decline can be attributed to Gulf Coast hurricane.", "Operating revenue of $4.8 billion was a quarterly best, up 16% from the strength of both price improvement and fuel cost recoveries. As we announced this September moderating fuel prices were also good news in the quarter. Rob will walk you through the details that Union Pacific lower diesel fuel price is up our bottom line, since we don\u2019t recover 100% of the higher cost.", "Operationally, we had a very good quarter, despite hurricane distributions, we set quarterly operating best and attain to our highest quarterly network velocity in five years. Better network efficiency translates directly in to lower operating costs and increased customers' satisfaction.", "With that I\u2019ll turn over to Jack to talk you about our revenue results.", "Jack Koraleski", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Our strong price improvement in each of our six businesses drove a 16% increase in freight revenue to a record $4.6 billion. Overcoming a 5% decline in volume resulting from continued economic softness in the disruption caused by hurricanes Gustav and Ike.", "Five of our six businesses set best ever marks for revenue with only automotive failing to set a new record. And at the same time we had another great year-over-year improvement in customer satisfaction.", "In the third quarter, we continued to grow in market tides of the global demand for energy and food, but two hurricanes and the weak demand in some of our key rail markets, more than offset that growth leaving our volume down 5% for the quarter overall. Economic softness continues to be most evident in the automotive and construction related markets, along with the international segment of our intermodal business.", "Production cutbacks by the largest auto manufactures let to a 25% drop in vehicle shipments and our parts lines were down almost 22%. Industrial products volumes drop 3% below last year. Our steel shipments grew 23% and markets related the energy demand like resin [ph] pipe and wind components remain strong, but still was it not to over overcome the softness lead by a 24% decline in lumber volumes and the 9% falloff in rock shipments.", "Well, all of our business groups saw some impact from the two hurricanes, the impact of the chemicals business along the Gulf Coast was most significant, back without hurricanes I think chemical business likely would have come in flat, compared to a year ago.", "The two groups that have done the strongest all year grew again this quarter. Coal demand remains strong in a 38% increase in ethanol and DDG set the pace for our young products growth. During the quarter, we began to see whole grain volumes lose a little of theirs strength, were shipments down about 1%. Most notable decline was in Gulf wheat exports, which were at 20% from last years record setting level.", "Going forward, we expect that world production ocean great spread, the shipping value was the dollar lower feeds of our life stock numbers and global economic problems are going to cause our grain shipments to fall back in 2008 strong market. Maybe even to slightly below 2007.", "This morning I would like to take the closer look at our chemical intermodal and energy businesses. Although, chemical volumes declined 6%, a 20% increase in average revenue car drove a 12% increase in revenues.", "The two charts on the left highlight the impact of hurricanes are, on the two largest segments of chemicals business plastics and liquid and dry chemicals. The falloff in September comes from not only the disruption that occurs as the storms came through, but also the after maths is, we waited for commercial power to be restored and production to flow these are brought back online.", "Customer recovery from these storms are still not complete and we expect to lose probably as much as 2000 cars here in the fourth quarter, mostly in plastic where plants are not yet back in full production.", "Beyond the clear impact of the hurricanes on September volumes both liquid and dry, and plastic are also starting to see some softening due to their ties to housing consumer markets and automotive business. And higher oil prices are impacting our (inaudible) and diesel volumes.", "On a brighter note global demand for food continues to drive growth in fertilizer with our volume up 6%. Intermodal revenue grew 9% with a 19% improvement in average per unit, more than offsetting a 9% decline in volume. As I indicated earlier, the decline in intermodal was driven by weakness in the international segment were a 14% drop in volume was only partially offset by the 2% growth in domestic.", "Significant portions of the international intermodal markets are tied to housing and automotive. The economic conditions in those two industries along with reduced consumer spending have resulting in a decline throughout the year and imports from Asia. Also influencing the comparison for international is the evolving status of our legacy contract.", "Last year favorable pricing in the remaining legacy deals in our international business actually attracted volume. Some of those deals have now then repriced in 2008, portions of that business have shifted off the Union Pacific and that\u2019s pretty much consistent with our focus on improving pricing and returns, and we saw that reflected in the intermodal groups third quarter results.", "On the domestic side, a contract loss going in to the year continues to impact our comparisons year-over-year. Offsetting that loss was a 29% increase in our EMP volumes with IMCs and some share gain from the highway. We also saw volumes improved in our domestic legacy contracts.", "We had continued strong demand for coal a 3% increase in energy volume combine with a 24% in average revenue for coal to drive revenue up 28% over $1 billion. Energy is the first of our commodity businesses to top that mark in the quarter. Coal moved at a record setting pace from the Southern Powder River Basin during the quarter. Tried on the upper left highlights of the strong trains per day performance through out the quarter. Network productivity and efficiency translated in to the best ever quarter for trains, for carloads and tons, were tonnage at 7% from a year ago.", "Unfortunately, difficult mining conditions and poor coal quality lead to a 7% decline in Colorado Utah tonnage. Network performance was lone bright spot for this segment as we said best ever tons to train. We expect Colorado, Utah growth to be back in the plus side for fourth quarter, a comparison that\u2019s going to benefit from last years relatively low tonnage. And we expect the full year for the segment to the up slightly from 2007. For the Powder River Basin we still expect growth, again in the fourth quarter even against the last year\u2019s record tonnage and resulting of the full outlook for the basin remains unchanged at 5%.", "Strong service performance continues to translate in the customer value, which in turn is leading to higher levels of customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction improved four points from year ago coming in at 83, which matches last quarter at the highest level, since early back in 1995.", "Now looking ahead for the rest of the year, it\u2019s clear, but we are not going to see any improvement in the economy. Strong demand for energy remains one of the key drivers of our growth opportunities. For our energy and our Ag products group that means continued growth in coal and ethanol, although the pace for both may slow some from third quarter levels.", "Ag's going to benefit from the recent expansion of our railroads [ph] express service for perishables, a new train from California to New York, which is providing the same great service customers experience than the original Washington to New York train.", "However, as I mentioned earlier we expect grain volumes going to soften slightly from the very strong levels that we\u2019ve seen so far through 2008 and with that Ag moves kind of down in to our mix demand drivers grouping.", "With some softening of chemical segment that are tied to housing, our chemical business price up. Really depending on the expected strength in fertilizer and soda ash and how quickly customers can get back to full operations, as they recover from hurricanes.", "Energy related demand for resin [ph], for pipe, for wind components is going to continue strong for our industrial products business, but steel have now fallen back to our normal levels, as projects and spending have slow our weakness in housing related markets continued.", "Domestic intermodal should continue, the kind of hold it\u2019s on year-over-year. International Intermodal will continue to run below last year and continued economic growth is going to keep our automotive volumes below a year ago levels as well. Put it all together, and we expect overall volume in the fourth quarter to be down, probably around 5% versus last year, which we\u2019ve got the full year outlook at about down 3%.", "Now again, some pretty strong comps, we expect volume run softer then down 5 through October, and November. And we are going to makeup some ground in December where we are hit by storms last year.", "As in previous quarters car price improvement, fuel surcharge are going to drive revenue growth despite the volume shortfall. Based on what we are hearing from our customers and what the economic prognosticators tell us and recognizing, but there is still a lot of uncertainty out their in the economy. That\u2019s why we are currently thinking about 2009.", "Right now, it\u2019s pretty hide to see that, much is going to change for the better in 2009. Volumes are expected to be flat to down 2%. Any improvement in market conditions will looks like it\u2019s going to be in the second half of the year. And the second half should also look stronger, because comps were going to be lower quit obviously.", "Grain shipments likely are going to match 2008, a very strong demand and forecast projected vehicle sales and housing starts are going to decline slightly next year, from the already low levels.", "In chemical and industrial products, the outlooks for commodities and the wheat construction markets are going to stay soft, while those markets that have been strong are expected to continue. Demand in all energy related markets is going to stay strong. But we are going face some pretty tough comp comparisons to 2008 in our coal business.", "The cost and environmental advantages of rail are going to combined with our continued service improvements, it created additional opportunities for conversion high way traffic to rail across our business, especially in our domestic Intermodal business.", "The anticipated weakness in imports were result in international Intermodal being slightly softer, but we still anticipate a peak season, which we was a no show this year, we thing that will reappear at least to some extent in 2009. As a result of our renegotiated legacy deals and built in escalators we have about 70% of our 2009 price plan will be in the market by the time the year start on January 1st, and with those pricing gains and improved fuel cost recovery, we expect to see solid revenue growth again in 2009.", "With that, I am going to turn it over to Dennis for the operating results.", "Dennis Duffy", "Thank you, Jack, and good morning. The 2008 story lines for UP's the operating team continues to be improvement and resiliency. As this start illustrates, we significantly increased network velocity year-to-date, despite a number of weather related disruptions. For the third quarter, we made steady velocity gains coming out of June 1st, only it to get knock back again in September with two Gulf Coast hurricanes.", "Fortunately, our railroad do not sustain any major infrastructure damage from hurricanes the primary issue was the loss of commercial power needed to operate signals crossing gates and switches. But as you can see, we again quickly bounce back from the storms and our network is running very well. In fact third quarter, velocity increased more than two-miles an hour over \u201907 to 23.7 miles per hour.", "Year-to-date, the velocity is averaging more than 1-mile per hour faster at a 6% gain. Beyond velocity gains our network management initiatives send it around the unified plan, flow control and strict inventory management are continuing to drive further productivity in service improvements.", "In the quarter, (inaudible) was a best ever 24.4 hours and system inventory at a little more than 300,000 cars improved 4% in the quarter. Last time our inventory was at this level, was in March \u201903 when we are averaging about 171,070 carloads versus nearly 185,000 in third quarter \u201908.", "Another key driver is our continued effort to improved train productivity. By making our transportation point and more volume variable. We continue to achieve train starts savings relative designed. For the third quarter year-over-year, we reduced train starts by 5% and yard local starts by 4% on 3% lower gross ton-miles.", "These achievements are especially considering the impact of the hurricane, although turnout [ph] well. Times in both Houston yards by to over 90 hours coming out of hurricane Ike that were back to near normal within the week. This demonstrate the resiliency of our network, it's also attribute to the coordinate of planning and preparedness of UP team in advance of the storm. As the result we\u2019re able to quickly restore rail services to our customers.", "Better-inventoried well and speed translates the better freight car utilization, which measures the number of days between the originated loads. Year-over-year our utilization improved 6% to our record 9.2 days. Faster asset terms help both UP and our customers lower their equipment costs and long-term capital needs. Better performance in our terminals and crossed our main lines has the added benefit of driving better free utilizations.", "Has shown in the top right and bottom left, we improve both our reaccrual rate and our overall labor productivity. A one point reduction in the reaccrual rate saves us more than a 100 train and engine employees.", "Throughout 2008, we have reduced hiring levels and workforce as business levels had been somewhat below the expectation and asset productivity has improved. The overall train crew workforce will be down about a 1,000 people year-end \u201908 versus \u201907. Both our crew and locomotive resources have provided us with ample search capacity, during this year is whether events.", "We are translating greater efficiency, whether would be freight cars, crews, and train size into more reliable service product. We have told you earlier, that our customer satisfaction index at lower rate is a record levels. These metric show good progress that we also have many opportunities ahead us to further increase productivity and enhanced our service.", "We expect to close out the fourth quarter with a same momentum and improvement we demonstrated today. Specifically, solid safety improvements and network that is well resourced and resilience to deliver improving service, our capital programs are on target and delivering the anticipated benefits and achieving further service and productivity improvements. By managing our cost structure to more volume variable in the somewhat uncertain economy.", "With that, let me turn it over to Rob for the financial review.", "Rob Knight", "Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. We start today with look at our income statement. Third quarter operating revenue totaled $4.8 billion, up 16% versus 2007. Operating Expenses increased $445 million or 14%, primarily driven by a $349 million increase in third quarter fuel expense.", "Also contributing to the higher expense was $66 million increase in other expense. If you recall, the last year we\u2019ve reported a $47 million casualty expense reduction related to our semi-annual actuarial studies. So, if you isolated the fuel and other lines ongoing operating expenses grew about $49 million or 2%.", "Strong revenue growth in ongoing efficiency gains combined to produce third quarter operating income of $1.2 billion, a 21% increase. UP produced very strong quarterly results, especially when you factor in the impact of the Gulf Coast hurricane.", "Lost revenue and higher cost related to the hurricanes took roughly $0.08 per share out of our third quarter earnings. Revenue losses coming out the hurricanes with somewhat less than what we had anticipated saving us about $0.02 per share versus our September guidance.", "Looking at third quarter freight revenue, we\u2019ve reported 16% growth the $4.6 billion. Although, our carload volumes decline 5% year-over-year increased fuel cost recoveries and strong pricing gains more than overcame the deficit. Driven by record high diesel fuel prices fuel cost recoveries were the biggest contributed to the quarterly growth.", "In addition, we are improving returns on each piece of our business at evidence by approximately 6.5% core pricing gains in the quarter. The mix of the business was also factor, adding about five points of growth to the average revenue per car. Increased agricultural loadings, which carry our highest arc, coupled with fewer intermodal moves, which have our lower arc were the primary contributor.", "Turning to slide 21, compensation and benefit expense grow 3% in the quarter for $1.1 billion. As we discussed in our second quarter earnings call, cost in this line were pressured by the 4% wage increase that became effected for our Union employees on July 1st. There were also added costs in the quarter related to post retirement benefits.", "And as you may recall, last year\u2019s third quarter expense including favorable one time adjustments associated with the structure of labor contract ratifications as well as our long-term visibility plan. Offsetting some of these headwinds our ongoing efficiency efforts related to both field and office personal. Greater labor productivity is evidenced by 1% gain in gross ton-miles moved for employee.", "In addition as you heard from Dennis, fewer train starts and lower reaccrual rates are helping to further reduced our true needs as volume demand stay soft. Altogether comp and benefit expense is usually a couple of points higher sequentially in the fourth quarter, we expect to somewhat smaller increase this quarter.", "Turning it now to fuel expense. Total cost increased 44% in the quarter to $1.1 billion. The good news is extends since peaking in July prices have moderated, averaging $3.70 per gallon for the quarter. This saved us nearly $0.10 share from our estimated third quarter fuel price up $4 per gallon.", "The bad news is we still paid a $1.38 per gallon more year-over-year for a 59% increase in our cost per gallon. And although, we did see some catch up on our fuel recovery lag, we basically drove even for the quarter, when you compare the increase in fuel prices overall benchmark rate for the actual recoveries.", "As we look out the fourth quarter, we are assuming on average diesel fuel price of around $2.95 per gallon are so. If that estimate holds, we would be paying $0.33 per gallon more than we did a year ago for a 13% increase.", "Because we do not have 100% cost recovery, higher year-over-year fuel prices are cost hurtle for us. But as a result of the two months lag in most our programs; we could actually experience in earnings fuel win, if diesel fuel prices stay at the current levels. Purchase services and material expense will basically flat in the quarter up only $2 million.", "Clean up cost associated with the Gulf Coast hurricanes increased expenses $11 million in the quarter. In addition increased usage and prices for freight car wheel set add $7 million of expense. Offsetting in these items, were proceeds from rail scrap and reduced locomotive contract manner.", "Equipments and other rents expense declined 5% in the quarter of $326 million. Increased asset utilization illustrated by records freight car utilization as well as fewer shipments of finished vehicles, and Intermodal containers, all contributed to the year-over-year decline.", "In addition, we have a less volume demand and faster asset turns we have returned access leased equipment. As I mentioned earlier, other expense increased $66 million in the quarter, primarily as the result of $47 million unfavorable comparison. We also had higher cost for property damage state and local taxes and utility costs.", "Our third quarter operating ratio of 74.9% is the lowest quarterly ratio we have recorded post merger. Over the last three years, we have taken more than 11 point half of our operating ratio. As we have discussed before, UP is driving this improvement through both yield gains and productivity. When we talk about yield, it accomplishes both our strong pricing gains as well as the continued expansion of our fuel surcharge programs across all of our businesses.", "As legacy contracts renew, we have a combined opportunity of increasing prices through a market rate, as well as adding adequate fuel cost recovery mechanisms. On the productivity side, we must first provide safe transportation product. But beyond that the efforts of project operating ratio have focus the entire organization on increasing efficiency and eliminating waste.", "Coming into the third quarter, we knew we had a tough comparison against last year. So making this next step of improvement gives us great conviction and our ability to drive greater profitability in the future.", "Moving on the full income statement, third quarter other income was $2 million lower year-over-year, primarily as a result of lower gains from real estate sales. Year-to-date other income totaled $67 million, making it likely that full year other income would be roughly $90 to $100 million.", "Quarterly interest expense increased $6 million to $130 million, driven by higher average debt levels in 2008. Income tax expense increased $31 million in the quarter or 8%. Although, our taxes are higher year-over-year, the effected tax rate is nearly 5 points lower. Last year our effected tax rate was higher at 41.3% as a result of new tax legislation in the state of Illinois.", "Our 2008 rate of 36.6% was slightly lower than the expected as result of federal tax audits and state tax law changes, adding $0.03 to our third quarter earnings. For the fourth quarter, we are planning on a quarterly tax rate of roughly 38%. Net income was a quarterly best $703 million, up 32%. Earnings per share increased 38% to a $1.38 per share.", "As a result of our ongoing share repurchase program UP's outstanding share balance declined 4% in the quarter. This repurchase activity is allowing our earnings growth to outface the rate of net income increases delivering more value to our shareholders. As we approach the end of the year, I\u2019ll give you a quick update on our capital spending.", "At this point, we think total capital could be slightly more than $3.1 billion. Adding capital cost as a result of the Oregon mudslide and Midwest flooding were likely push us over the original $3.1 billion capital plan. Assuming that all of other schedule capital work is completed as plan.", "In terms of the split between cash, capital and leasing, leased financing is somewhat lower this year at $353 million, primarily as a result of few equipment acquisitions. During the third quarter we repurchased 5.9 million shares of Union Pacific common stock, returning nearly $445 million in cash to shareholders.", "Since inception in January of last year, we\u2019ve repurchased almost $2.8 billion worth of stock. Although we completed the initial 40 million share authorization during the third quarter, we have the new 40 million share authorization that was granted by our board in May.", "Our repurchase program gives us an opportunity, take advantage of today\u2019s low share price, but of course will balanced this with all other corporations cash need to make sure that we continued to have solid liquidity, especially in light of today\u2019s uncertain credit environments. In fact, let me spend a next few minutes talking about UP's current debt levels and our liquidity position.", "Slide 29 illustrate UP's adjusted debt balances at the end of September totaling $12.7 billion or 44.7% adjusted debt to capital ratio. This is inline with our targeted mid 40s, debt to cap ratio and is consistent with our continued commitment to maintaining a solid BBB, BAA2 investment grade quarter rating.", "Since the end of September, we issued an additional $750 million of 10-year notes, which adds to that debt balance. We then have $500 in debt maturities rolling off within the next four months. Between the proceeds from the recent issuance and the cash already on our books, our liquidity remains strong. We won\u2019t either additional equipment financing this year, as our program is already completed. So we continued to be well positioned to meet key cash need.", "And finally our liquidity position is enhanced by a $1.9 billion credit facility. We have not drawn on this facility and we have no plans to grow on it. But we\u2019re glad to have it as an emergency backstop in these volatile times.", "Looking out to our fourth quarter expectations, it will again comedown to our business volumes and diesel fuel prices. As has been the cash all year, these two drivers are really the swing factors in the quarter. As Jack discussed our fourth quarter volume expectations are for about a 5% decline. Quarterly volumes are currently running a little softer and we expect to see continued downward buyers in November against strong 2007 loadings. But the month of December has an easier comparison, as a result last years winter storms.", "I mentioned earlier that our outlook calls for diesel fuel prices to average $2.95 per gallon for the quarter, which is still in oil at $80 or so per barrel the rest of the year. Refining spreads are at historic highs following some of Gulf disruptions. So, we are not seeing the full benefit of our diesel fuel prices from the lower crude oil.", "We continued to see volatility in the crude oil market as investors speculate about the state of the global economy. But at the downward trend we have seen over the last couple of months continues that could provide an upside opportunity for earnings.", "Conversely, a fuel prices spike as we did last year; it was clearly pressure the low end of our earnings estimate. We also expect to continue the productivity momentum, we have demonstrated throughout 2008. In a challenging marketplace we have to be cost comparative and we are working daily to align our operating expenses with the business demand.", "Given these expectations fourth quarter earnings should be in the range of a $1.25 to $1.35 per share or growth of 34% to 45%. With this, we are raising our full year 2008 expectations of $4.50 to $4.60 per share or year-over-year growth of 30% to 33%. Union Pacific is demonstrating substantial earnings power in the phase of economic softness and high fuel prices. And we look forward to closing out record year for our company.", "With that, I will turn it back over to Jim.", "Jim Young", "Thanks, Rob. Before, we open it up for your questions; I\u2019d like to share our initial jobs in 2009. At this point, it\u2019s clear the business demand will remain soft. Our volume outlook flat to down 2% assumes a pretty weak first half of 2009 with some strengthening in the second half. Legacy contract renewals provide support to our core pricing plans, which remains steady at 5% to 6% for 2009.", "Our productivity opportunities are ongoing, we will continue to balance our network resource with the business demands driving increased efficiency and service reliability. And as Rob discussed, our liquidity in balance sheet are in good shape.", "At this point, despite a tough economic environment, we expect to achieve low double-digit earnings growth in 2009. Of course, there are number of moving parts that will continue to play out over the next several months, but early read on the year is still positive. Our commitment to our employees, customers and shareholders is operate a safe, efficient and profitable railroad regardless of the economic environment.", "So, with that let's open it up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Our first question is from Tom Wadewitz with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi. Yeah. Good morning. Jim and Rob, I just jumped over from the UPS had their call going on, so I apologize, if I\u2019m going to ask you something, you\u2019ve talked about in detail. The forecast you guys going forward, it is lot of resiliency to the business despite some weakness in the economy. But, what do you think, I guess the room for prices in that forecast, but who is the drivers of price in that forecast, either to the upside or to the downside? I mean, you think pricing can come in may be better than you\u2019re expecting in the five to six and do you feel like that the volume side, may be on the downside, it is pretty conservative with that due to 2% or is there some risk that might be worse than that range?", "Jim Young", "Yeah. Tom, the wildcard here really is consumer and where and what happens in the economy. As we stated here not assuming real strong year, and will manage accordingly. I think we are going to be very cautious in terms of what we look out and our spending and we\u2019re going to be very aggressive in our operating productivity. We have mitigated fuel here with our fuel surcharge program, but we\u2019re still not recovering 100%. So, you see a continued falloff in fuel, you might have a little bit of upside there. But I just talk, we are going in to end of year with that pretty uncertain, we are going to really watch our cost and be prepared, if we see little uptick to get it to the bottom line.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "You productivity trend has been very impressive and it seems like perhaps even if you worse in 2% volume, even if you are down 4% or so. You might be able to getting in to the earnings range you are talking about is that. Is it fair to think that, may be you have some upside from productivity to offset it, if volumes did come a little worse than you are expecting?", "Jim Young", "Well, Tom, again I feel good about our productivity. We have got, as Dennis mention, we are still \u2013 even we had \u2013 with the quarter we had, we are still reaccrue over 7% of our trains, that\u2019s good opportunity and again. The question will became one on, if you have more series falloff in volume demand, what is that mean for fuel prices, I mean they generally correlate each other, so you could have some upside there.", "We also have \u2013 I think, something a little bit different \u2013 we seen in prior years, which is our attrition. Historically, when you had a short falloff in volume, in other way you took labor cost out of lot cases was to do or buyer program. Even with the slowing economy we are still have a good attrition, which will take advantage, if our volume falls. ", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. And the last one, I will pass on, you had very strong focus on return and I think, a lot of discipline on taking rates up, you got the legacy contracts. Are you seeing anything at all from your primary competitor if that would indicate a little increased focus on getting some volume in the weakness, or do you think that the competitive dynamic is still pretty similar to what it\u2019s been over the last year or two years even though the volume (inaudible) of more challenging?", "Jim Young", "Tom, I have to concentrate on new specific here. We are very focused in understanding where our returns are, the markets we should playing in, and we\u2019re offering good service, we are going to keep the pressure on our attainment terms of making certain minimum returns, I don\u2019t we look at our business, we could lose that. We\u2019d loss some and off both in terms of business that didn\u2019t meet our return expectations, but we\u2019re going to be focused right on our business and it continued to increase the return to capital.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. Great, well congratulations on this strong results, they are very impressive.", "Jim Young", "Thanks, Tom.", "Operator", "Our next question is comes from the line of Adam Lawson of Morgan Stanley. Please ahead with your questions.", "Adam Lawson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, gentlemen. Thanks.", "Jim Young", "Good morning.", "Adam Lawson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "When I look at the productive trends, I understand it was hurricane in the quarter, but outside of fuel, it looks like the unit costs performance on a GTM basis was not nearly as good as see in the past few quarters here. It looks like if you adjust for some of the onetime item that was probably a little over 4% versus flat over the previous year's quarters. Are just more of a normally or is it, how do we think about that, how the productivity gains becoming harder to obtain?", "Jim Young", "As you lose volume, Adam, you're not going to match the 100% in terms of unit costs. I assume you're taking fuel out of that equation?", "Adam Lawson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right.", "Jim Young", "That's in here. I would also take a look at what's happening with unit cost in the revenue ton-mile basis. You actually revenue ton-miles were up 1%. You get a little bit better look out there. But again, in our business, if you have a sharp falloff in volume, you're going to have little pressure in unit costs. I will keep this in mind though. We still see good productivity opportunities going forward next year, and we will manage our cost as accordingly as we see volume. It's just tough to get them out quickly when you see a sharp falloff.", "Adam Lawson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Fair enough. And in terms of the mix impacted, it seemed like it was pretty big in the quarter. And I know some of that is just the commodity mix, but it seemed like there was some ton mile whether it was willing to fall or tons per car that really were a big benefit, too. Can you give us any sense of whether that's just because of the hurricane or can some of that continue going forward?", "Jim Young", "I'll let Jack answer that one.", "Jack Koraleski", "I think when you look at it overall, you'll see that with our intermodal businesses was being soft when you see the bulk businesses increasing, when you see what, the export business and things like that you can see that shift kind of manifesting itself into a very favorable mix in the quarter.", "I think the fourth quarter, our grain business is going to be a little softer here, because of the shifts in some of our wheat and things like that across the country, but coal's going to continue to be strong. Steel's kind of softening up a little bit, so you may see that mix impact decline a little bit. You won't see quite as pronounced as what we saw in the third quarter.", "Adam Lawson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Just last one and then I'll back it on here. In terms of CapEx for 2009, it seems like, I mean, clearly everybody's worried about volume trends. I think, Jim, you sort of hinted at it. Is there any thought about, hey, maybe we pulled back some of the growth here, we got permitting issues anyway like but things like double tracking the sunset quarter. Does that make sense in this kind of environment?", "Jim Young", "We're going to take a hard look at our capital. What we need to make certain we do here is not lose sight of the long-term opportunities, which I absolutely over there. We'll take a hard look at it. Where we see maybe the slope of the line on growth isn't as strong here in the next several years, we will take a hard look at it. I do have a minimum commitment here on locomotives. I got the last year of a three-year program, I got a one-year commitment on locomotives, 125 locomotives that quite honestly right now I don't need. But part of that's our velocity that we\u2019re generating here, but we going to take a hard look at capital for '09", "Adam Lawson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks a lot. Nice quarter, guys.", "Jim Young", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Edward Wolfe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question, sir.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Jim Young", "Good morning, Ed.", "", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Can you talk a little bit about the visibility into the legacy contracts? I know, you talked about what's coming up in '09. Is there some visibility or some that you just have pretty far apart and you have confidence that are going to go away that have a profitability standpoint it helps, but that's in your volume? Or what you see pretty much, there's nothing that's obviously not going to be resigned in '09 as it comes up?", "Jim Young", "", "Jack?", "", "Jack Koraleski", "You know, Ed, most of our legacy deals of '09 are done. We have probably no more than 2% coming up in the year itself before year-end, and the majority of that is going to be coal business. We have lost some business, and the reason we've lost it, because in the old deals that we've done, we did winner take off, and we ended up with some business that quite honestly don\u2019t fit our franchise very well. So we've lost some of that, but we're fine with the legacy deals that we've renegotiated money they're lot being place. We saw the pricing, we got fuel recovery, we've got good escalations and we're feeling quite positive about our legacy business.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Thank you. If I'm repeating something, again, like Tom said, I was on UPS. A little bit, I apologize. Can you talk about coal expectations? I saw what you talked about Colorado and Utah. Can you talk about the PRB and your sense of demand for coal going into '09 as well as your sense for the little amount of export coal that you're doing?", "Jim Young", "Let start with PRB, right now we see demand still continuing to be quite strong. We're encouraged by inquiries and test moves going to the east. We're also very excited. We had the head of our coal team out in Prague at the coal Trans conference. The developing world of looking for opportunities for Powder River Basin coal and places like Japan where they don't want to be totally tied to Australia, and then some of those other places. Indonesian coal has the same kind of burn characteristics, so those are other markets. So we\u2019re pretty pumped about the export side of the business.", "Domestically right now, our customer base is about where they want to be in terms of where they are for the year. They're not really over supply. We have a couple that probably have too much where we also have couple of very large input to take all of the coal we can get them. So in terms of the overall our knowledge of stock files and working with customers, we\u2019re in pretty good step there.", "And we think it's going to play itself in the 2009 as well. As I said, we did have a couple of losses from this year just in terms of the fact that our franchise is probably as good as the other folks are. That'll play itself out will be fine. The disappointment for us with Colorado, Utah, we went into the year, thinking Colorado Utah would be a plus 4% or 5% kind of an idea as the export demand heated up. But they've run into really tough mining conditions.", "They're working really hard to say that. So I think we'll probably be leading more in the 2% or 2.5% kind of world for that export. Business out of Colorado Utah, That's also very strong demand. That's that 11,000, 12,000 btu kind of coal that Japanese steel makers and things like that would be happy to have a source. So we're working with the mines and doing everything we can to help support them in terms of delivering that coal to market. We think outlook for coal\u2019s very strong we think it\u2019s going to continue next year as well.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "In the zero to negatives to total volumes, what's the total coal prognosis? I'm guessing it's above that?", "Jim Young", "We think coal's going to be relatively flat year over year.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Can you talk a little bit about I think it was Jim in your general comment where's you talked about you expect for '09 that there'll be some strengthening in the second half. What\u2019s that based on? Is that just hope more than anything at these points?", "Jim Young", "Well, we always have had some hope, I guess. At the end of the day here, we're not expecting a real strong recovery. This is going to be a sharp job. We just believe you get towards that latter part of the year. We'll probably see a little bit of an uptick. So don't read into that that is a strong recovery. You also have cycle and comps. I'm not certain how much lower our lender and construction business can get, it's down almost I think from the peak probably 60%. You look at your autos, finished vehicle business, were down 25% this quarter. Running an annual vehicle sales rate. I think is around $11 million or $12 million that out there. So again, don't think of it as a sharp uptick, we're just simply looking at probably some uptick.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Fair enough. There is buyback slow down in your mind at some point? If the credit market uncertainties continue or are you pretty comfortable with the pace you're on?", "Jim Young", "I\u2019m very comfortable where at. Again, our liquidity positions in good shape, we had access to the capital markets. A little bit higher cost than what we wanted in terms of what we're paying, but the business is generating good cash. We've got flexibility, terms of our capital spend next year, but you know with the stock sitting at $57 a share, we're going to continue to buy stock.", "", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "The real safety act now that we know what the beast looks like, have you had a chance to look at, you know, between positive bank control, reduced limbo training, where do you think are the areas that are going to impact you? Are there offsets in product? How do you think about these costs going forward?", "", "Jim Young", "Dennis, you want to take that one?", "", "Dennis Duffy", "Yeah, Ed. We don't think there's going be a major impact to us on the real safety bill. The limbo time issue is one that will have to continue to work with the organizations on, maybe possibly restructure some of our crew districts. That's not going to be a major impact to us. Obviously, the puts thing is going to be a challenge to us. The funding on that is gone nab critical. We'll take a very measured approach to that in terms of priority.", "We have our two pilots already in place that will be running to fruition in '09. One of them up in the coalfield, the other one's up in Washington in dark territory. So that's going to help us really get a good gauge on the benefits here. We think there's benefits to be derisive from the fuel standpoint.", "Additional capacity and certainly safety. We'll look at the labor situation sometime in the future. Bottom line on rail safety, we're going have to learn the interpretations for sure. We're all about doing that right as we speak. We don't see a major impact at this point.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Thanks a lot for the time, everybody. That's helpful.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line John Barnes of Boston Company. Please go ahead with your questions.", "John Barnes \u2013 Boston Company", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "", "Jim Young", "Good morning, John.", "John Barnes \u2013 Boston Company", "You guys have made impressive moves there with volumes down 5%, fuel consumption down nearly 10. I was wondering if you could tell us when's going on there and when's driving that?", "Jim Young", "We have a multifaceted approach. We talked a lot about fuel. It's not just a new phenomenon. Fist off, we'll start off with we have employee recognition program called fuel masters which are professional engineers gauge themselves against a golden run in our recognized commensurate league. It's been very successful.", "Our engineers have really internalized the challenge of fuel consumption and have really helped us realize some of those savings. We have a fuel conservation speed that we put in, the optimum speed that we allow our trains to run at. We take advantage of gravity where we can. Again, the engineers have been very significant with that. We put a maximum speed out there, 50 miles per hour.", "Our contribute processing, technology has been very influential. We think there's about 4 to 6% btu trains on a fuel consumption savings. Then raising the percent of our ton-miles from about 30% up to over 55% now that our handle with DPU. We're gone ma continue that trend into '09. Obviously, our shutdown policies that's system wide all crafts and we've been successful in driving it there. So I would say a good use of technology, our new locomotives, the age of our fleet operating practices of our engineers have been the key drivers in the fuel conservation.", "John Barnes \u2013 Boston Company", "Keep up the good work.", "", "Dennis Duffy", "If I could just add one other comment to that. That is the mix affecting the third quarter certainly benefited us as well.", "John Barnes \u2013 Boston Company", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.", "", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Can you quantify the third quarter?", "Jim Young", "Rob?", "Rob Knight", "You don\u2019t, because we're not recovering 100% of fuel, higher fuel prices still are a negative on us, but it's \u2013 there was a slight \u2013 you know, basically if you look quarter over quarter, we recovered. The lag effect helped us out where it was about a push. The cots versus the recoveries in the quarter alone were about a push.", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Jim, you mentioned that 70% of your pricing is locked, and then I think jack threw in all of the contracts were pretty much locked in for '09. So I just wanted to dig into I presume then the 30% that was left is the stuff that renews annually like grain. What would be your expectation for the remaining portion? Do you think you see pressure if we get a little on the volume side?", "Jim Young", "You know, Ken, the market's going to determine how effectively we can be on the price side. We're going to have some of those markets that we will do very well in pricing. We'll have some other places like in the lumber world and places like that where it'll be a little bit tougher, but we're still thinking overall it's going to average out into that 5 to 6% range.", "", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then on the grain, the Ag market, you know, looking at the articles we've seen obviously hitting how farmers are pulling back on some plantings. Just wanted to get your outlook from what you're hearing from your customers.", "Jim Young", "Well, you know, we're in a position right now if you look at our fourth quarter year-over-year, the big difference is going to be export wheat. We had a great program last year and the United States wheat crop was excellent and others were soft. This year, the Baltics, Eastern European, Australia all had solid wheat programs. Harvests were good. That's going to get softer for us.", "The other thing we're seeing right now in our grain markets is because of the high feed prices, there's been a reduction in the head count \u2013 oh, the head count in the animal count for things like poultry and cattle. That is impacted to some extent as well. I think it's still early to say what the total market outlook for next year. We're thinking we could be down a little bit from our record setting pace here in 2008.", "We don't expect it to be a heck of a lot. There's always the upside that crop conditions around the world, what happens with the value of the dollar, those kinds of things could turn that around and turn it into a positive for us. So we're just watching carefully. We're going to have the capability to move it, and we think ethanol's going to continue to do well for us. We had a couple more plants come online. We think that'll be some upside for us. We think it'll be okay.", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Rob, I take it from the shift of guidance for the near term there's nothing you're changing on your 2012 targets at this point, there?", "", "Rob Knight", "That is correct.", "", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question will be coming from the line of David Feinberg of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions.", "", "David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning.", "Jim Young", "Good morning, Dave.", "", "David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I just wanted to confirm, I think you address this earlier. Quick question in terms of your legacy contracts. One of your previous slides from the previous quarter. It's 3% of your legacy contracts that are set to reprice in '09, that correct?", "Rob Knight", "You know, Dave, where I am right now, I still have 2% to go in '09.", "David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then trying to understand the $750 million debt issuance from a few weeks ago. Was the goal of that to take care of your own financing needs? It struck us a little interesting that you were in the market during such a tumultuous time?", "Jim Young", "No. It wasn't to take care of our '09 needs.", "David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And at this point, based on the slides that we saw, it looks like you as you highlight it, you have substantial liquidity on hand. To feed all of your debt maturities through '09, correct?", "Rob Knight", "Yes. Assuming we meet our plan. One of the things we do have is about a $250 million term on debt due early February time frame. So we're well position for that at this point in time.", "Jim Young", "We're in good shape, Dave.", "David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Maybe one last question following up on I think it's Ed's question on share repurchase, is there a stated plan in terms of how much free cash flow or how much of the operations you plan to return to shareholders through a combination of the dividend and share repurchase program or is it more based on quarter by quarter-by-quarter assessment over the stock prices?", "Rob Knight", "We're opportunistic and we haven't given a number on that. So we take advantage of the opportunities.", "David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of (inaudible). Please proceed with your questions.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. How's your pension funding doing?", "Jim Young", "Rob?", "", "Rob Knight", "We do not have a requirement to fund our pension plans, so we're in good shape there, but of course like all other pensions, we felt the impact of the market. So we'll take a look at it at year-end and if there's a need to put additional cash into the fund, we'll take a look at that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Do you have any sense where that would be a significant requirement?", "Rob Knight", "No significant requirements. Running down about 15% right now. Maybe that's 100 million or so. We'll take a look at what the needs are. At end the question.", "Jim Young", "We've been putting cash in over the last several years and it's pretty healthy.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "It is pretty healthy. Fantastic. Regarding domestic intermodal that has shown amazing resiliency. What\u2019s driving that?", "", "Jim Young", "A lot of that it S. a great service. I think our intermodal customers are looking at the performance of our key intermodal lane and particular some of the lanes our new partnership with the Shreveport Gateway. They're seeing trucking because of highway congestion. Our EMP box fleet is being a real opportunity for us. We're working hard to within their confidence and business. It's going quite well.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I would expect that as the economy weakens a domestic intermodal might be going down. On the other hand, you might be winning business from trucking. Do you have a sense for the pitfalls of one stringing than the other?", "Jim Young", "", "I think it's good service and winning business from the highway that's going to carry the day for us.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "So you would expect that intermodal domestics would still be coming ahead in spite of a weakening economy?", "Jim Young", "", "I do.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "And lastly, for the coal, you mentioned that you were expecting flat year \u2013 is that flat growth for '09 on coal or is that the fourth quarter?", "", "Jim Young", "", "I think there's a chance it's going to be flat growth for '09 and we will completely offset any volume loss that we had from those legacy deal conversions that I talked about earlier.", "Unidentified Analyst", "All right. Okay. Those were the questions. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will be coming from the line of Randy Cousins of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Good morning.", "Jim Young", "Good morning, Randy.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "In terms of your guidance for the fourth quarter, you obviously talked about car loadings and I think to some extent, jack, you answered the question. If car loadings are going to be down 5%, it looks like the length of your haul has increased over the course of the year. If we're down 5 in car loads, request we have flat RTM.s?", "Jim Young", "You know, Randy, quite honestly, I think the relationship you saw in third quarter it will not hold where you had 5% reduction in carloads, 1% increase in Reeve knew 10 miles. I don't expect revenue ton-miles to be down at the same leave as carloads. Again, your automotive business is not going to recover. Intermodal business will be weak. On the other side, our coal business still should continue to be strong. There won't be one for one, but you'll still have revenue ton-miles will not be off the same effect as carloads.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "In a somewhat related question, the GTMs were down three but the RTMs were up. Are you getting more back haul business? What is happening there that the total work goes down but the revenue work goes up?", "Jim Young", "You know, Randy, I think, it's mix when you look at it.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Could you guys comment on you've got a strong Mexican franchise, what's happening with your Mexican business? Is it growing, it strengthening? What's happening there?", "Jim Young", "Mexico in the third quarter was down a little bit in volume, 5 to 7% and revenues were up around 16, 17%, and it kind of follows the path of the rest of our business, you know, certainly our automotive franchise, our largest franchise in Mexico and of course with the automotive suffering. That's the primary reason fort downturn. Still had solid grain movements to and from Mexico. We think that will continue and that's how it's going to play out.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Last question, there's been a run-up on the US dollar. Do you guys see the change in exchange rate impacting your business in any way, shape, or form? Particularly the chemical business.", "Jim Young", "Long term it will have an impact. Our exports in second quarter are up about 4%, 5% in exports this quarter were down. I think 5% or 6%, 7%, something like that. I don't think the short-term fluctuation will show up. Long term obviously it will have some impact.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot. That's it.", "Jim Young", "Okay, Randy.", "Operator", "Our next question will be coming from the line of Gary Chase with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions, sir.", "Brandon Oklanski \u2013 Barclays", "Good morning, this is actually Brandon Oklanski. I'll keep this brief, but could you give us any idea of how much mix really impacted the fuel consumption? On the GTM basis, it looked like you got significant gains in fuel efficiency.", "Jim Young", "You know, Brad, I don't \u2013 it's not quite clear to me. Again, the trend has been pretty consistent for several quarters. This wasn't a one-quarter kind of aberration when you look at the improvement that's out here. And a lot of the things Dennis mentioned on technology, the incentives are driving, including new locomotives. Again, when you look at a new locomotive today, compared to what we retire, there's a substantial improvement in fuel consumption.", "Brandon Oklanski \u2013 Barclays", "Does this have anything to do with maybe the mix of a lot less intermodal on a GTM basis?", "Jim Young", "Absolutely. No question about it. It's not clear to me. I think it's not a huge impact in the mix or the mix impact doesn't have a huge impact on the consumption rate but it's clearly there.", "Brandon Oklanski \u2013 Barclays", "", "Okay. And then I guess looking at your 4q guidance, I know you mentioned that the lag impact was essentially flat for 3q but with fuel sitting here today at about 67, 68, you know, we're modeling a pretty significant gain just in the lag impact. Any way you can give us an idea what that could be in the fourth quarter?", "Jim Young", "", "Rob?", "Rob Knight", "Again, if fuel goes down, that lag would benefit us. If it spikes back up like we saw last year it could hurt us. If I gave the guidance of $2.95 for the quarter, if fuel stayed where it is today that might give us a positive of I'll say a nickel. That gives you relative spread on that.", "Brandon Oklanski \u2013 Barclays", "I'm sorry if you guys have already mentioned this, but do you have \u2013 have you given us an idea of how much business is actually rolling over in 2009?", "Rob Knight", "We haven't.", "Brandon Oklanski \u2013 Barclays", "What does that mean, rolling over? How much business are you recontracting in '09?", "Jim Young", "As I look at my contract base, we got about 45% to 50% of our business tied up in long-term, 25% or so in one-year deals and 30% in tariff and so the long-term contracts are fairly much done for the year in 2009. Those will take effect January 1st for the most part. Those are all completed. Many of the one-year deals are completed at this point as they were in the third and fourth quarter kinds of negotiations here. Though my contractual business is pretty well locked in place for \u201909 right now. Again I have about 2% of legacy that will expire between January 1 and December 31 of \u201909, most of that at the end of the year.", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "Okay. And then on the business, that isn't rolling over so the contracts that are staying in place from '08 to '09, what types of escalation factors can we expect or are built into those contracts right now?", "Jim Young", "It's everything from the RCAP to the RCAP without fuel, with fuel surcharge on the ones that we have renegotiated with the new ones, and then a variety of them have fixed percentages.", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "Okay. Thanks a lot, gentlemen.", "", "Jim Young", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "", "Jim Young", "Good morning, John.", "", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I had a question about EMP program in your domestic intermodal operation, looks like that really grew pretty dramatically during the quarter. I think you shot up to 29%. What is the state of that fleet? Are you upgrading it, expanding it, reducing it?", "You know it's quite interesting you have a fairly different strategy than brand x has with regard to your own container equipment.", "Jim Young", "In our EMP fleet we consider that to be a real opportunity working with the IMC community particularly the non asset owners. That's where we're targeting that market. If you look at our fleet today I think going into the year we had like 19,000 containers, hopefully by the end of the year, we\u2019ll probably exit at around 21,000 \u2013 21,500, something like that with a few retirements in and out. It's a great product offering particularly now with the domestic service that our operating team has provided. It's catching on a lot in terms of people taking a look at it and comparing that with truck and other options that they have. And we continue to think it's going to be a great market opportunity for us.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "So you're actually adding, what, 2,000 boxes to the fleet over what time period?", "Jim Young", "This year, I think what we did is we probably added 3,500 and took out, you know, 1,500 retirements, I think, is how since we ended up buying 53 footers and retired some 48 footers.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Do you own the chassis as well?", "", "Jim Young", "Yes, we do.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "All right, and the IMC is responsible for ranging the drayage, is that correct?", "Jim Young", "You know, we can work both ways with them. We can offer to take that on and provide door to door service and they become just a sales agent for us. We\u2019ll just do ramp to ramp and allow them to do however they would like to deal with the direct door-to-door ramp to door thing performance.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.", "And the growth in that business didn't seem to have much of a negative impact, excuse me, on the so-called legacy domestic intermodal business. Is that looking to grow also?", "Jim Young", "Legacy intermodal business, domestic intermodal business also grow as well.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Interesting, okay. To the extent there's still an efficiency gap between what I'll call the old S.P. and the old Union Pacific, how many more years of capital expenditure and hard work will it take before that gap is completely close to where you'd like to see it?", "Jim Young", "We've made a good progress in terms of getting that property in better shape. There's still a few years left out here when you look at some of the areas, but again, you can improve your velocity as we have seen in the overall network without having all of your properties starting to move up. And we still have some opportunities. We are looking at them, but again our long-term guidance we said in a low 70s operating ratio and the kind of financials, that'll be part of that equation long term.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "If it takes say another two or three years to get that gap completely closed the way you would like to see it ultimately, does that imply that at the conclusion of that process that perhaps your CapEx may drop down a little bit relative to, say, revenue?", "Jim Young", "It would when you look at it. Again, there's a certain amount of catch up that's in here. I don't see anything substantial when you look at it. Part of it, again, you have to separate maintenance, property that wasn't maintained to expansion and a good example is double tracking the sunset corridor. Obviously we would have liked to have that double tracked several years ago but that\u2019s not going.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "There might be some small amount of incremental free cash flow to apply to share repurchases and increased dividends and that sort of thing. Then one last question regarding the grain business. There's been a big drop in the drive off rates here over the last couple of months. Has that shifted any traffic from the T.M.W. down to the gulf and has that had an impact on your traffic flows and/or revenue outlook?", "Jim Young", "Probably the most dramatic thing for us has been the bean harvest and so we\u2019ve been moving a lot of soybeans from the current harvest down to the Gulf and that\u2019s been to our benefit. That's probably the place where we've seen it the most.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. But there's still a fair amount moving to the P.N.W. as well?", "Jim Young", "We are not a big player in the P.N.W. So you know, we will follow wherever the grain wants to move, we will take advantage of the P.N.W. but right now, it's the Gulf business that's kind of on a solid, steady foot for us.", "", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "How about range of the river? Has there been an increase or decrease in that business?", "Jim Young", "It's kind of hard flat, kind of hard to tell with all of the disruptions we've had with hurricanes and things like that as to how much of that plays out, but it's not growing substantially.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thank you very much. That's very helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question will be coming from Jason Seidl. Please proceed with your question.", "Jason Seidl", "A couple of quick things here. One of your Eastern counterparts yesterday in the conference call talked about they were getting more positive about pushing through that 25% expansionary tax credits. I was wondering if you guys can give your thoughts on that.", "Jim Young", "Well, Jason, where we're getting more prospective the next round of stimulus coming out of the hill and infrastructure strikes a cord with every member of Congress and if you believe we have a \u2013 I\u2019d call it a crisis in the infrastructure in the US and you look out the next five, ten years, I think it's a good opportunity here. We'll see what happens. What I remind members is capital flows in terms of returns, and if this helps maybe increase returns, we may accelerate a little bit of capital. But I wouldn't take it to the bank yet when you think about it. It's great jobs, investment in America when you think about where you're putting your money, and you know, we're prepared if it happens to probably do some things but we'll see.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay. Jim, on the outlook for '09, you mentioned potentially going down to about negative two on the volume side. Is that assuming a little bit of economic slippage from here, or is that some sort of a steady in the economy right now?", "Jim Young", "We look at first half next year. You're going to see negative industrial production, negative GDP. I'm not \u2013 we kind of look at it right now, it's probably about the run rate you're at right now going forward. Then again, some pickup towards the end. But we're prepared to manage our business in a very tough economy next year.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay. My last one here on the call. You touched a little bit on maybe export demand for some of the western coal. What are the ports that are moving out of?", "Jim Young", "Today it's Vancouver. I guess it's called St. Roberts. We've also moved some off of Richmond and also moved some off of Long Beach.", "Jason Seidl", "Are there any other potential options for you on the west coast?", "", "Jim Young", "You know, we're looking for options. We are talking to all the ports and looking for some potential to see what would make most sense but at least at this point in time, those are kind of the three front-runners.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay, guys I appreciate your time as always.", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments.", "", "Jim Young", "", "Well, thank you for attending the call here. As we had indicated we are looking at a pretty tough economy going forward here but I\u2019m confident that we can run our business in a tough economy and deliver for our shareholders.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides today will be presenter controlled.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you Mr. Young, you may begin.", "Jim Young", "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Rob Knight, our CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales and Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Union Pacific\u2019s fourth quarter earnings grew 41% year-over-year to $1.31 per share, as operating income totaled $1.1 billion, up 32%. We\u2019re posting strong earnings for the quarter as we completed an outstanding year for our company. The fourth quarter was clearly a challenge with carloadings off nearly 12%.", "Our profitability was driven by improved safety, productivity, great service for our customers, positive pricing and lower energy cost. Falling fuel prices were a nice reversal after paying higher diesel fuel prices over the last seven quarters.", "Looking back at 2008, we achieved these results despite facing the challenges of a weak economy and record high fuel prices. Our success stands from consistently executing our long-term strategy. Although rail is already the safest form a ground free transportation, we\u2019re committed to improve, which we did across the board in 2008.", "We provided our customers with excellent service as we offered truck competitive products in key market corridors. Their employee innovation, technology and hard work will increase the efficiency of our railroad and we\u2019ve made strategic capital investments that support our long-term growth as well as [Audio Break] drive further safety, service and efficiency.", "These efforts produced recorded financial results for our shareholders, increasing returns through a two-for-one stock split, a 23% dividend increase and share repurchases totaling $1.5 billion.", "Our 2008 results were one for the record books, providing a solid foundation for the challenges we face in 2009. Obviously, one of the biggest challenges we face this year is economic uncertainty. Jack, Dennis and Rob will all give you some prospective on 2009. But, as you will see from their comments, our ability to forecast demand is very limited. As a result, we will not affirm or provide specific financial guidance for the year. Although our confidence in the long-term opportunities for Union Pacific is undiminished, the current environment will be very difficult.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jack to talk to you about our revenue results. Jack.", "Jack Koraleski", "Thank you, Jim and good morning. Our revenue grew 2% to a fourth quarter record $4.1 billion as price improvement and fuel surcharge tailwinds drove a 16% improvement in average revenue per car more than offsetting the sharp decline in volume. The economic problems that dominated the news throughout the quarter clearly impacted volume with the greatest declines in the groups most sensitive to the strength of the overall economy.", "Each of our groups set best ever or best fourth quarter records for average revenue per car, but only Energy and Ag products were able to overcome the volume shortfall to post revenue gains. There was an anticlimactic end to a year that saw revenue climb 11% to a record $17.2 billion. Automotive was the only business group failing to set of a new full-year revenue mark. All fixed groups set records for average revenue per car and energy posted record carloadings as well.", "So, now let\u2019s take a closer look at how the fourth quarter played out for each of our businesses. Ag products revenue grew 10%, as a 16% improvement in average revenue per car more than offset a 5% decline in volume. We indicated in October that we expected to see our grain volume soften from the very strong levels we saw during the previous crop year.", "During the fourth quarter feed and wheat shipments declined in both the domestic and export markets with overall whole grain volumes down 16%. On the positive side, growth in ethanol and DDG\u2019s continued with growth up more than 20%. Expansion of our produce rail express product with the startup of the California Origin early in the quarter drove volume growth of nearly 70% for this truck competitive refrigerated service.", "I doubt there is any surprise in the weak showing of our automotive business during the fourth quarter, but the only good news was that our progress in renegotiating legacy contracts helped drive a 12% improvement in average revenue per car, partially offsetting to 26% volume decline and holding the revenue shortfall to 17%.", "For the quarter, finished vehicle volumes were down 29%, while parts declined 21%.", "Our chemical revenues were down 1% as a 14% decline in volume was nearly offset by a 15% improvement in average revenue per car. The residual impact of the September hurricanes and the downturn in the economy drove weakness in the two largest segments of our chemicals business.", "Liquid and dry, which declined 21% and plastics, which was up 18%, refinery issues resulting from the hurricanes, volatile crude oil prices and economic conditions impacted petroleum products. Fertilizer volume was down as industry sales declined driven by tightening credit and unstable market prices that led many farmers to delay or even to skip their fall fertilizer application.", "Volume for carloads increased 26%, largely the result of some new unit train business and a strong export market drove increase soda ash volume even as domestic shipments declined due to continued weakness in the housing and automotive markets.", "Energy revenue grew 20% on the strength of a 22% improvement in average revenue per car. Strong demand in continuing productivity improvements in our network performance drove a 2% growth in Southern Powder River Basin tonnage. Establishing fourth quarter records for cars, for tons, for trains and tons per train and closing out a record year for the SPRB. Unfortunately, widespread problems among the Colorado mines lead to a 5% decline in Colorado Utah tonnage and resulted in the overall 1% decline in volume.", "In industrial products, we saw 15% falloff in volume partially offset by a 14% improvement in average revenue per car, unfortunately mix worked against us and resulted in a 3% reduction in revenue overall for the quarter. Our lumber volume fell 30%, as housing starts dropped to their lowest level since the [census bail] began tracking 50 years ago. The slump in housing and commercial construction is also impacting roofing, cement and stone and the ladder too were also hit by reduced funding for highway projects.", "Market softness cooled the steel and scrap markets that were running strong earlier in the year. Industrial products saw customers across many of their markets take extended holiday shutdowns to allow for inventory adjustments during the quarter. On a brighter note, [Inaudible] and other drilling materials provided some good news with volumes up over 20%.", "Intermodal revenue was down 7% as a 16% decline in volume offset a 10% improvement in average revenue per unit. As we have highlighted in the past, significant portions of the international Intermodal business are tied to the housing and automotive industries. The deepening contraction of the overall economy was the primary driver of a 19% decline in our international volume.", "The weak economy also impacted the domestic side where volume declined 9%, despite the continued success of our EMP revitalization effort, which filled volumes with Intermodal marketing companies up over 20%. If you exclude the contract loss that we incurred earlier in the year, our improved service helped hold truckload volume flat versus last year, which is actually pretty good performance in this economy.", "We closed the year with record setting customer satisfaction as our customers recognized the value being delivered given our significant service improvements. Satisfaction came in at 85 for the fourth quarter that\u2019s the highest quarterly score in the 22 years we\u2019ve been measuring satisfaction. For the full-year, we improved four points to 83, which is also our best ever mark. ", "Okay. Looking to the future, I thought maybe a good place to start with, with a recap of our legacy contract status. Last year, including contracts that expired on December 31, we renegotiated legacy contracts totaling about 8% of our revenue base. Well, at this point, we have now been able to reprice 82% of our business.", "Unfortunately, 2009 will take a little less than one percentage point off the table, but we will get the benefit of the price improvement from those December 31 expirations throughout the coming year and we\u2019ll also have a nice carryover price impact from the other contracts we repriced earlier in 2008. On the right, you can see the mix of business tied to our remaining legacy deals, half of that business is still in energy, 29% is in Intermodal, autos and chemicals are both 10% and Ag and industrial products shared just one percentage point between them.", "Clearly, we\u2019re going to have our work cut out for us in 2009. On the chart, we have highlighted some of the biggest hurdles that we faced as well as opportunities that will drive some strengthening as the year plays out.", "Looking at the full-year; let me take you through how we think these and other factors are going to influence growth potential in each of our groups. Start with Ag products, Ag products is going to face some tough comps, at least until the new crops are harvested. Increased world grain production will impact whole grain exports and a decline in animal feeding will slow the domestic grain business.", "As a result, we expect whole grain volumes to slide back closer to the levels we saw in 2007. The soybean crush is forecasted to be down over 6% for the crop year, but we do anticipate that ethanol is going to grow, although the pace maybe a bit slower as lower gasoline prices and higher corn prices squeeze margins. Continued market softness and production cutbacks drive the automotive outlook for 2009, but it should run better than it is now. The ramp up however, is going to be slower than normal this year as some plant shutdowns will extend all the way until March.", "In chemicals, the poor economy will likely lead to some further softening of plastics and domestic soda ash will continue to mere demand in the building and automotive markets. However, we remain cautiously optimistic about export soda ash. We think that liquid and dry is going to hold its own and fertilizer should see an up tick with the spring planning season. Continued low crude prices could also create some opportunities for us in asphalt.", "Our energy volume in 2009 is expected to decline slightly from last year\u2019s record setting performance. We successfully renegotiated quite a few legacy coal deals last year, but there were a few that wound up not going our way. The good news is that continued demand for SPRB coal should allow us to offset most of that loss. So far there\u2019s been an issue for Colorado Utah, but that production is going to ramp up as the mine\u2019s start to get squared away with those production issues.", "With housing starts expected to decline somewhat from their already low levels and overall economic weakness impacting many of their markets, industrial products faces a real uphill battle. The one bright spot is still energy related markets, which appear to maintain their strength.", "Growth with IMCs driven by the EMP revitalization program and continued service improvements is expected to spear growth in our domestic Intermodal, but the weakness of the overall economy still going to take its toll on the international side. Current economic projections anticipate growth and imports by the fourth quarter although admittedly against 2008 to current levels.", "So, with the free fall and economic indicators over the past few months an uncertainty about how quickly the new administration can get their plans in place; let alone how quickly those plans will have an impact. An honest assessment of 2009 is that at this point, we probably have more questions than we have answers.", "Our volumes have started off slowly, but as I just outlined they should strengthen. Extended shutdowns, inventory right-sizing combined with a comparison against a relatively strong first quarter volume a year ago makes things look weaker right now than we believe they really are.", "It seems likely that an economic stimulus bill will be coming across much of our business. A successful stimulus package offers some upside to the extended focuses on rebuilding infrastructure in energy development. Ultimately, the key to strengthening demand is job creation. The government stimulus check more money in your pocket from low gas prices, low mortgage rates and zero percent financing for automobiles, probably isn\u2019t going to make much of the difference if you\u2019re not employing.", "We still expect that our core price improvement will be in that 5% to 6% range for the year, although it appears the impact to that improvements going to be masked by the decline in fuel surcharge, when you\u2019re looking at it from an average revenue per car perspective. Keep in mind though, that from a customers\u2019 point of view, that decline of fuel surcharge is going to result in lower transportation charges year-over-year.", "So, with that I\u2019m going to turn it over to Dennis, for the operating review.", "Dennis Duffy", "Thanks, Jack and good morning. Today, I\u2019d like to wrap up the operating team\u2019s performance in \u201808, as well as talk a little bit about our plans for \u201809. Let\u2019s start with safety. We think of safety as it relates to our key constituents; employees, public and customers and over the last several years and in \u201808, we made significant improvement in each category.", "The tools we used to improve safety; communication, technology, process improvement, engineering and investments are universal across the three areas and all contribute to our gains. Of course, our goal with each of these categories is to reduce to zero, so we\u2019ll continue our efforts in \u201809 to operate an even safer railroad.", "Turning to service, as with any year we had some bumps along the way with an assortment of natural disasters, but the resiliency of our infrastructure and our network resources allowed us to quickly recover and achieve record performance levels, but also we finished the 23.5 miles per hour for the year and 25.1 in the fourth quarter. In a declining volume environment, like we\u2019ve experienced in the last two years, operating\u2019s role is critical in driving cost out of the business through streamlined operations and increased asset utilization. These objectives must be balanced however, against our customer commitments.", "Our 2008 service delivering index, a composite metric of all customer commitments, set all-time records for the year and the fourth quarter 84 and 89 respectively. The increasing levels of customer satisfaction that Jack just discussed, mere the improvements in the SDI.", "Lower volumes have certainly contributed to these results, but we have significantly improved the fundamentals of our railroad, largely due to our evergreen unified plan process, our continuous focus on inventory management and technology also plays a big role. Increased usage of distributed PRO locomotives, which currently move about 55% of our gross ton-miles allowed for a more efficient use of our locomotive and crude resources as well as saving fuel.", "Finally, our work to operate as a volume variable network; volume variable means managing our cost in line with our demand volumes even in a down economy and the results can be seen in productivity.", "In the fourth quarter, we reduced our total starts by 9% compared to 9% fewer gross ton-miles year-over-year. For full-year, our start reduction was more than proportional to the volume decline. This was achieved concurrent with improving asset terms. You can see freight car cycle time, the number of days between loads reached record levels in 2008. Our train size initiatives played a role, a key role in our productivity results by reducing train starts.", "The manifest network was a particular challenge, where we managed to increase train size and service levels despite the declining volumes. The end result was leveraging lower volumes into fewer starts and also lower fuel consumption. For 2009, we have a menu of productivity initiatives covering all major classes of spending and asset utilization all managed under the umbrella of our operating productivity counsel process.", "The combination of following demand in greater efficiency has generated extra resources. When you compare year-end of 2008 with \u201807, we have reduced our working level of critical resources significantly. From a locomotive standpoint, we have reduced the working fleet by more than 1500 consisting of lease turn backs, retirements and storing more than 1200 locomotives, partially offset by 179 new deliveries in 2008.", "Likewise on the freight car side, our working inventory has been reduced by more than 67,000 or 21% including 48,000 cars and storage. Demand from the train and engine workforce shown in the upper right is down by nearly 3900 including approximately 3,100 furloughs. It is our intention to get these folks back to work in the near future, but that will be driven by volume demand and attrition.", "We continue to make short-term adjustments in our critical resources to reflect current economic conditions. However, as we\u2019ve discussed before, we have built some level of surge capability into our network to handle network outages and volume spikes.", "Turning to capital for a moment, our proposed \u201809 plan will total around $2.8 billion, nearly 80% of the spend represents replacement and renewal of existing capital assets. This includes 125 new locomotives for nearly $290 million. Current market demand does not warrant this purchase, but they conclude the third year of a three-year purchase agreement. We will put these to good use expanding distributed power usage and retiring older less efficient locomotives.", "The engineering spend continues our commitment to hardening the core infrastructure for safety, productivity and performance business reasons. With soft demand, we are reducing gross spending by more than $300 million in capacity and commercial facilities. We are slowing down spending on the Sunset Route, while making strategic investments for long-term growth.", "An example is the new Joliet Intermodal facility, which we will continue to work on in 2009. Emerging market opportunities such as ethanol, wind power, and drilling materials are protected in our \u201809 plan. The technology portion includes strategic investments in computed aided dispatching and positive train control systems.", "Our operating plans for \u201809 built upon the progress made in 2008. Specifically, solid safety improvements in the employee, public and customer areas, the service record set in 2008 are now the benchmark and we will make further gains from here. We will remain volume variable in an uncertain environment and finally, we will be disciplined in our efficient use of capital.", "With that, let me turn it over to Rob for the financial review.", "Rob Knight", "Thanks Dennis and good morning. We\u2019ll start today with a look at our fourth quarter income statement. Quarterly operating revenue grew 2% to nearly $4.3 billion. Fourth quarter operating expenses came in at $3.1 billion, a 6% decrease versus 2007. The primary driver of the expense decline was lower fuel expense, which decreased 19% in the quarter.", "As I\u2019ll discuss more in a moment, lower fuel prices contributed to the decline, but the sharp fall-off in business volumes in our efficiency efforts also played a major role. Higher revenue and lower expenses resulted in fourth quarter operating income of $1.1 billion an increase of 32%.", "Fourth quarter freight revenue totaled $4.1 billion, a 2% increase from 2007. Against the 12% drop in carloadings, our pricing gains and increased fuel surcharge recovery drove the yearly growth. Core price increased roughly six points in the quarter and although our fuel prices actually declined year-over-year, the two-month lag in our fuel cost recovery programs drove higher year-over-year recoveries. Similar to the third quarter, our mix of business was positive, adding six points of growth to our average revenue per car.", "Turning to the expense detail; slide 27 shows fourth quarter compensation and benefits expense down 2% in the quarter to $1.1 billion. Increased productivity and a significant decrease in volume were the primary drivers of the year-over-year decline.", "As Dennis described for you, increased velocity as well as our efforts to increase the efficiency of our crews, drove savings in the form of our lower crew costs. We also continued actions taken throughout 2008 to better align our workforce with demand, reducing both operating and non-operating personnel, a total of 4%. Offsetting some of the productivity is the ongoing wage inflation associated with the 4% increase that became effective for our union employees on July 1.", "There were also added costs in the quarter related to pension and post retirement benefits. For fuel expense, our cost declined by 19% to $732 million as fuel prices declined 6% in the quarter. Our fourth quarter average diesel price per gallon was $2.46 compared to $2.62 per gallon in 2007. This lower price saved roughly $47 million in the quarter, although lower prices help drive quarterly fuel expense, the 9% decline in gross ton-miles was actually a bigger contributor, saving $77 million in the fourth quarter.", "The 5% improvement in our fuel consumption rate also contributed to the savings. As we moved through 2009, we should see the benefit of lower year-over-year fuel prices. In fact, we\u2019re currently paying about 40% less $2.84 per gallon we paid for diesel in the first quarter of 2008. Our customers are also seeing the benefit of lower fuel in the form of lower surcharges.", "Purchase services and materials expense totaled $458 million, up only $2 million. Although below third quarter levels, year-over-year costs were higher as a result of component price inflation. This increase was largely offset by a lower expenses related to our improved productivity and volume decline. For example, expenses for crew transportation and lodging, as well as Intermodal ramp fees declined year-over-year. ", "Equipment and other rents expense decreased $13 million in the fourth quarter or 4%. Lower freight volumes particularly for finished vehicles, industrial products and Intermodal shipments resulted in less car hire expense. Locomotive lease expense also declined year-over-year.", "Fourth quarter other expense declined 1% or $2 million, there were a number of pluses and minuses in this expense line during the quarter. Adding to the quarterly expense, were several unfavorable year-over-year changes such as an increased provision for bad debts, higher state and local taxes while equity income was lower in the quarter. We also received an insurance settlement in 2007 that contributed to the tough year-over-year comparison. Many of these item should be considered quarter-specific and do not indicate a change in our expense trend.", "Balancing out some of these unfavorable changes was a reduction in our casualty expense. We continue to see solid improvement in our safety performance as well as a benefit of lower estimated settlement costs. We also completed a review of our asbestos liability in the fourth quarter, which demonstrated better than expected claims experience. Together, causally costs were lower in the quarter by roughly $65 million.", "Looking now at our operating ratio, the bars on the left illustrate year-over-year fourth quarter progress. The bars on the right show our full-year improvement. As we discussed with you in our May analyst meeting, we are using project operating ratio to focus the entire organization on our efficiencies. These efforts enabled us to drive steady improvement culminating in a 73.4% operating ratio in the fourth quarter a best ever mark.", "Lower fuel prices certainly contributed to our improvement, although offset somewhat by the volume declines. Our efforts to drive greater efficiency and improve the returns on our business enabled us to make a nearly 12-point gain since the fourth quarter of 2005.", "On a full-year basis, we also made great strides. The 77.3% operating ratio in 2008 was the best annual mark we\u2019ve achieved and nine point five points better than 2005. This performance really highlights all the hard work that\u2019s taken place across our company to improve profitability.", "Moving onto the full income statement; fourth quarter other income was $15 million lower year-over-year, primarily as a result of lower interest income. Interest expense increased $2 million to $127 million driven by higher average debt levels in 2008.", "Fourth quarter income tax expense increased, 31% or $90 million. Although, taxes were higher year-over-year as a result of increased income, the effective tax rate was slightly lower at 36.4% in 2008 versus 37% in 2007. Fourth quarter, net income totaled $661 million up 35%. Earnings per share increased 41% to $1.31 per share, reflecting both stronger earnings and the impact of our share repurchase program.", "Slide 33, shows our full year income statements. Operating revenue grew 10% to nearly $18 billion. Operating expense increased 8% to $13.9 billion. Higher year-over-year fuel expense contributed nearly 90% of this increase. Other income was $24 million lower in 2008, as a result of fewer real estate sales and less interest income. With a tough credit market, we are likely to continue in 2009 our real estate sales could be challenged in that market.", "Interest expense grew 6% to $511 million; the driver of this increase was higher average debt levels offset somewhat by lower interest rates. The combination of higher income and a lower effective tax rate for the year produced 2008 income taxes of $1.3 billion a 14% increase. Our 2008 tax rate was 36.1% which was 2.3 points lower year-over-year primarily related to a change in Illinois state tax legislation in 2007.", "2008 net income grew 26% to a record $2.3 billion. Full year earnings per share was $4.54, a 31% increase. From an overall financial standpoint, one of the key measures of our performance is the cash we are generating. In 2008, cash from operations increased $793 million, a 24% gain. As we improved our returns, increased productivity and drove strong bottom line results, we are generating more cash. In 2008, cash from operations was also favorably impacted by bonus depreciation, which added about $225 million. On the flipside, we made $200 million voluntary pension contribution at year-end.", "Cash generation is especially important in today\u2019s tight credit markets, as we will rely more heavily on this cash to sustain our business going forward. In terms of our uses of this cash, we will continue to take a balanced approach. Obviously in this uncertain environment, we will be conservative with our cash management. In fact, we ended 2008 with more than $1.2 billion of cash on the books, which will help us with our payment obligations in the first part of 2009.", "Let\u2019s talk about some of the other uses of cash in 2008. We closed our 2008 capital spend at roughly $3.1 billion. The breakdown on this spend was nearly $2.8 billion in cash capital and $315 million in non-cash capital for equipment leasing. As Dennis just mentioned, our current plans target 2009 capital at around $2.8 billion likely all in cash. ", "Looking at share repurchases, we bought back $3.4 million shares in the fourth quarter returning nearly $200 million to shareholders. This run-rate is slightly down from previous quarters reflecting our desire to maintain the liquidity in the current environment.", "On a full year basis, 2008 repurchases totaled $1.5 billion bringing the program total up to $3 billion of cash return to shareholders since, January 2007. Although, the price of UP shares are certainly attractive today, we are not currently buying back stock. We are monitoring our cash flows as we start the year to ensure adequate liquidity, as we start to generate more cash; we look forward to making additional share repurchases.", "Slide 37, illustrates UP\u2019s adjusted debt balances at year-end, which totaled $13.9 billion or a 47.4% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio, consistent with how our ratio is viewed by the credit agencies. Increased debt levels as well as higher pension and OPEB liabilities contributed to the year-over-year increase.", "Throughout the current credit crunch UP has maintained good access to the credit markets. We do have a $250 million debt retirement coming up in the next couple of weeks and we will fund that from the cash we currently have on the books. So, to wrap up 2008, it was a great year for UP in many ways and our financial performance was no exception. We made tremendous progress with our efficiency and returns and significantly increased our profitability.", "As we turn the discussion to 2009, we are no less optimistic about the potential for our company. We do however face tremendous uncertainty. As Jim mentioned, we will not provide specific financial guidance for 2009. Instead, I would like to spend the next couple of minutes talking qualitatively about our approach to the year.", "As Jack discussed, the demand forecast is very uncertain and our current volume levels are weak. In fact, we believe, we maybe seeing the toughest comparison for the year right now in the first quarter. When you consider that the first half 2008 volumes were down a little more than 1% while the second half volumes fell off 8%. We should at least see an easier comparison in the back half of the year.", "Another factor to consider for 2009 is that our reported revenues could actually be lower year-over-year due to the combination of declining volumes and less year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue. For example, in January 2008, our rate-based surcharge was 21.5% versus only 16.5% this January, a five point difference and as we move to February, the year-over-year decline grows to nine points. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that although the absolute dollar amount of revenue may be lower, the quality is higher.", "Since we do not have 100% fuel surcharge recovery, lower fuel price has actually helped our bottom line. In fact, less volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue could mask the impact of the 5% to 6% core pricing gains we still expect for 2009. We have already priced the bulk of our legacy business for 2009 and we\u2019ll see the benefit of that pricing throughout the year.", "From a productivity standpoint, we know we have further opportunities ahead. Dennis discussed with you how throughout 2008, we operated our railroad to match resources with demand. Although, it\u2019s clearly more of a challenged increased productivity with declining volumes, we are working to operate as a volume variable railroad. From an earning standpoint, the key variable is economy, which will drive volumes.", "For the first quarter, we have volumes running well below last years\u2019 levels it\u2019s unlikely that we will be able to reach last years\u2019 first quarter earnings of $0.85 per share. Beyond the first quarter, if volumes improve earning should also improve. We are clearly in a very strong position to utilize our network resources more efficiently in a stronger demand environment, but of course, if current volume trends continue it will obviously be a challenge for us.", "We are being very cautious in our approach to the year. Although, we are still very confidents about the positive fundamentals of our business that optimism is clearly tempered in the near-term by the economy. We also believe that the key long-term goals that we established last May are still intact. Our volume growth will be challenged even if you assume some reasonable level of economic activity returns, but a lot can happen over the next four years and we are unwavering in our commitment to improve. In particular, the objective of obtaining a low 70\u2019s operating ratio by 2012 is still our goal.", "So, with that let me turn it over to Jim.", "Jim Young", "Thanks Rob. I\u2019d like to add a couple of points to the discussion on 2009. First, although this will be a difficult year for our company, our customers and employees. We will act carefully to avoid short-term decisions that could impact strong long-term opportunities we see ahead for Union Pacific, but we are responding aggressively to the significant shortfall on demand we see today.", "Building off, our success in 2008, we\u2019ll make further improvements to our safety and productivity also providing customers with great service. Quality of service supports our pricing plans, generates assets for our customers and opens up new markets. Part of that service commitment involves our capital plans, as Dennis discussed, the majority of this investment is for ongoing track replacement and renewal supporting safety service and efficiency. In addition, we\u2019ll continue to make strategic investments for long-term growth.", "Although, we are providing specific guidance; I can assure you that we are challenging ourselves to deliver another strong year. We set the bar higher in every category during 2008 and 2009 and beyond. We are focused on delivering an even higher level of performance than ever before.", "So, with that we\u2019ll open it up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from William Greene - Morgan Stanley.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "I\u2019m wondering if you can comment a little bit on the tradeoff between volume and price. In the past you have said, A; we would be willing to walk from business if it\u2019s going to do the right thing for returns and margins, but with volumes doing what they are doing at some point, the negative operating leverage from volume, I would think is going to have to play a role in your thinking. Can you just talk about how that\u2019s evolving?", "Rob Knight", "Well, we\u2019re still sticking with our philosophy here, if it doesn\u2019t meet our minimum return, we\u2019re willing to walk from the business and we have lost some business, we have won some when you look backwards here. Of course, when you\u2019re running down 18% on volume, which is what we\u2019re running right now, we\u2019re going to take a hard look at the future here, but our concentration right now is efficiency, getting costs out, making certain we are still very competitive, but again I think long-term we have to be very careful here in terms of taking a short-term view at the expense of the long-term viability of our company here.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "So, now does that apply as well to the cost side? So, if you\u2019re dealing with down 18% to 20% volumes now, what are you resourcing for, in terms of a volume change, I would think not that level because, that would mean you\u2019ve taken quite a bit more.", "Rob Knight", "I don\u2019t, listen 18% right now through 21 days with slow start up of the auto sector and many of our customers and autos are obvious, but we sold really across our whole customer group. There was a real slow start up going forward here. I\u2019ve said before, again to try to predict the future here, I don\u2019t think 18% is realistic and where we are going to end up the year here at all, but you could end up with a smaller network with higher quality revenues and better returns.", "We are being very aggressive; we are assuming right now that this, again it\u2019s going to be a very tough year. We are aggressive on the cost, but I\u2019ll also tell you, we\u2019ve got to protect, but when the business does come back and it will and as you know, we learned a pretty hard lesson in 2003 and 2004, where we were short of resources. So, we are managing this thing to be aggressive, but be smart and when business comes back.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "All right, just one quick question in the end then. Well I guess two. Stockpiles how are they? And number two, how much of your revenues are locked in for 2009 and for 2010?", "Rob Knight", "You are talking about coal stockpiles I assume?", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Yes, correct sorry.", "Jack Koraleski", "Stockpiles are about where they should be at this time of the year and maybe while, across our broad base, I would say they\u2019re about where they should be. We have some customers that have more coal than what they wanted at the moment. We also have some customers that would be interested in taking a little more coal. So, it\u2019s a kind of a balanced look. At this point in time, we think coal demand is going to be fine and the second question was\u2026", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Revenues that are locked in for \u201809 and \u201810?", "Jack Koraleski", "Revenues that are locked in, I would say at this point in time that we probably have 80% locked in and 53% is just new legacy deals that we dealt with in 2008 that have a 2009 impact and then the balance of that would be either pricing decisions from the fourth quarter or previous legacy contracts that have escalation causes that kick in, at various points in times throughout the year. So, we\u2019re probably 80-85% of our price in the market where it should be at this point time.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "And for 2010, there is very much or no?", "Jack Koraleski", "No, it is a little better than 2009, but it\u2019s a relatively small piece.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose.", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose", "A couple of quick questions here, you mentioned you weren\u2019t entirely successful on some of the coal contract pricing. I was wondering, if you could elaborate on that a little bit, was that the reference of the Great Plains Energy ruling and maybe a loss in a little bit of business to CP or is that something else?", "Jack Koraleski", "You know Jason, I didn\u2019t say that we were unsuccessful in pricing, what I said was that some of the contracts didn\u2019t go our way. In the old legacy deals that we had. We had some business that basically was a winner take all deal that ended upon our franchise, but when you really look at it, route structure and everything else that goes into it, it\u2019s not our strong suite. So, the fact that we lost some business was not surprising, there were a couple of contracts that we didn\u2019t renew some of it CP, others it just kind of plays out over the life of the deal. We\u2019ll get another shot at those in a couple of years, but overall it really wasn\u2019t a surprise for us.", "Jim Young", "Jason, we do as Jack indicated even with some of that loss, it looks like we\u2019re going to be able to offset a big piece of that long-term. Again it boils down to the return, some of these deals you\u2019ve got some pretty big spreads on the original legacy price than we are today and we\u2019re going to stay disciplined and what we expect in railroad.", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Co.  ", "Because sometimes it\u2019s just you guys showing a willingness to walk away from some business at a certain price?", "Jim Young", "", "No. As said early, we\u2019ve lost some and we won some last year.", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Co.", "Okay. If I could go back to the fuel surcharge lag, I don\u2019t know if missed this or not, but did you guys give the amount of lag impact for the fourth quarter?", "Jack Koraleski", "", "I don\u2019t believe we did. Rob?", "Rob Knight ", "No. Jason, we did not. It was a contributor clearly, but we didn\u2019t give that number specifically.", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Co.", " ", "Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. Also in your capital spending outlook, I know you are down a little bit here from 2008, but if you don\u2019t see volumes recover how quickly can you cut again and in other words, how much of this spending is going to be in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year?", "Jim Young", "", "Well, you run out of time here and your ability to cut it back. We may have a little more room that\u2019s out here, but again we\u2019ve got to be careful. This is a great time for capital investment in the business. The efficiency, track time availability, price of materials that we see will start coming down. We\u2019re going to take a hard look at it here, but we\u2019ll be smart about it. Keep in mind, we\u2019ve got 125 locomotives, but $250 million in that spend that as you saw from Dennis\u2019s chart. I don\u2019t need a locomotive next year and maybe the next couple of years, but we\u2019re going to take them and try to get some value out of them.", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Co.", "Okay and one more question, I\u2019ll hand it off to somebody else. How much pushback have you been getting from some of the customers on some of the price increases? I mean obviously, the environment out there is not too good as we\u2019ve all seen the numbers out of the railroads. I\u2019m just curious as to sort of a real-time to update from you guys on pricing?", "Jim Young", "", "Jason, obviously and I have said this consistently, I haven\u2019t met a customer yet that said thanks for the price increase, but what we\u2019re selling is the value proposition here. In terms of our service products where we are delivering service that our customers haven\u2019t seen in many, many years and there is a value proposition there. So, again it\u2019s about service, our customers are under pressure, but we\u2019ve got to continue to help them take out cost. Jack, you want to add anything?", "Jack Koraleski  ", "No, I think you covered it pretty well as you said.", "Jim Young", "", "There is one other item here Jason, which is the decline in fuel prices. At the end of the day, customers they don\u2019t separate fuel surcharge for base rate, they just see their total rates and we had a lot of pressure when fuel hit $150 per barrel last year with the run up. Right now, they\u2019re seeing their prices; real prices are moving down with the reduction of fuel surcharge.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Can you talk a little bit about RCAF and what percentage of your contracts are RCAF right now?", "Jack Koraleski", "If you look at our book of business right now only about 10% uses RCAF as an escalator. Most of that is in the remaining legacy deals that we haven\u2019t been able to touch and for better or for worse quite honestly those don\u2019t include 100% of RCAF. So, as it turns out RCAF is not a very big issue for me.", " ", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "And is that the mostly coal at this point?", "Jack Koraleski", "Yes, pretty much coal. If you looked at that pie I showed you, coal and Intermodal are the two biggest players and that\u2019s where you see the RCAF impact.", "Ed Wolfe - Wolfe Research", " ", "Okay. When you look at the pricing that\u2019s already complete for this year? You obviously have pretty good visibility into it based on what you said. What is the RCAF look like both net and gross of fuel? Obviously, it\u2019s going to be negative gross to fuel. What does is it look like net of fuel?", "Jim Young", "I\u2019m not certain we can even answer that, that\u2019s in terms of the details. So, what you know obviously, RCAF is moving down in total that\u2019s out here. There is a strong fuel component of that. I think core inflation in the railroads though are still going to be positive then when you look at labor increases that have come through; some contract pricing that still have some pretty healthy price increases that are out here. So, I know that I can\u2019t give you the percent change here, but the components clearly are moving in opposite directions, Jack you want to add.", "Jack Koraleski ", "You just look at the first quarter RCAF and you see I think RCAF was down probably year-over-year in about the 3% range but [ALF] which is our RCAF without fuel was actually up about 0.5%. So, I think that kind of points out to you the fuel differential and says that the overall cost still had some inflationary impact for us.", "Jim Young", "Ed, to me RCAF should be zero some gain overtime, you\u2019ve got it linked, if your inflationary costs are going up or down, you\u2019re covering 100%, that\u2019s the very 100% unfortunately with some of our contracts, we don\u2019t have 100% recovery of our RCAF.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "No, I get the zero some gain and the reason I am asking is, we have gotten a lot of questions since [Inaudible] yesterday. They apparently reported it when you look at your 6% pure pricing that you talked about for the quarter. They had historically looked at that number including RCAF gross of fuel. When you look at that number at 6%, do you have included in that the RCAF contracts and if so, is it included in, I would guess it\u2019s net of fuel not a gross of fuel?", "Jack Koraleski", "My 5% to 6% includes the contracts that are escalated by RCAF and that\u2019s the core price increase that does not reflect what happens on the fuel side.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay, and it\u2019s cosmetics, but I think it\u2019s important just so people understand the yields so that\u2019s helpful. In terms of the operating ratio and direction, I know you haven\u2019t given earnings guidance, but if we look at first quarter directionally I am guessing the operating ratio is going to be down year-over-year as you lose some of that headwind on the fuel, is that fair assumption?", "Rob Knight", "", "The operating ratio actually year-over-year, if you look anytime going from fourth to first it tends to go up.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "No, I am looking year-over-year and first-over-first. So, if I look at my model in first quarter \u201807 your OR was 81.3, I am assuming it\u2019s going to be higher deteriorated from there given fuel, is that a fair assumption?", "Jack Koraleski", "", "Ed, we are not providing guidance here on the first quarter, but there will be some pressure. Again, when you look at what\u2019s happening on volume that\u2019s out here that will be tough to offset.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Jack you talked about extended plant closings over holidays and things like that. Can you talk about the different industries and the timing of when you will start to see some of this stuff move or where you have visibility that things are going to reopen and where you don\u2019t?", "Jack Koraleski", "Sure. Probably the most visible at this point in time is the automotive industry given the concern that everyone has and today in total we look at about 60 plants and today this week we see probably 37% of that is still shutdown, 63% open that will decline overtime, but it actually is a fairly moderate decline and it extends all the way into early March. We actually still believe based on what our customers tell us that we could have about 12 plants shutdown that first week in March.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay and so by the end of March you think all 60 are open?", "Jack Koraleski", "By the end of March of course, there is a lot of time in between that and it depends on if people are going to start buying cars again, but the indications are that people intend to reopen those facilities and have them operating so that\u2019s what we are counting on.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "How about other verticals, chemicals?", "Jack Koraleski", "The chemical plants are just starting to show some life. We just recently got some information from some plastic guys that they are resuming production and that\u2019s a pretty big decision on their part from the perspective that, once you take a cracker down you don\u2019t open it up until you are feeling pretty good about your business model. So we take that as a positive sign. The lumber side of the business, still we are not seeing much of an interest in opening up. Although, you have periodic pieces of information.", "At this point in time, inventory levels are so low, but the thing that offsets that, if you look at the ratio of inventory to sales, we were making some great progress all the way down into November and then that ratio went way up again and it wasn\u2019t because inventory sparked this, it is because sales disappeared. So, at the first sign of sales I think you could actually see some inventory rebuilt, start-up and things could be a little better than what everybody thinks.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Do you have any utilities that are shut? ", "Jack Koraleski", "I can\u2019t think of anybody that shutdown.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay. On the chemical side, once somebody makes the decision that we are going to reopen, how long does it take to physically reopen give or take?", "Jack Koraleski", "I don\u2019t know the specifics on that, but I think it depends on what the facility as if it\u2019s fertilizer, if it\u2019s plastics, if it\u2019s whatever and I don\u2019t know the technical side of how long it takes to open, but the one experience we had it was about three weeks from the time they told us until the time things started moving so.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Very helpful directionally. Can you talk a little about the timing, Dennis the Sunset line completion and if that\u2019s been pushed out a little bit?", "Dennis Duffy", "", "Well as you remember Ed, we were looking to target that somewhere in the 2011 timeframe. What we have slowed down is the double tracking of that. So, we\u2019ll do just 11 miles finish off 11 miles that we had started from \u201808 and \u201809, that leaves us at about 300 miles left to do, 60% done and obviously we\u2019ll take a good hard look at that. Now we\u2019ll greater to head about 80 miles, so that we can if we see business come back, go back out there and lay some more additional double track. Though, we probably pushed out at least two to three years, I would say Ed, right now, but we\u2019re still going to be working on some of the terminal aspects of it particularly some of the run through facilities that we see are current bottlenecks.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay and last question total STE is down about 4% year-over-year, what should that look like as you continue to rightsize towards volumes? Is that a fair number going forward, is it going to be even lower when we look at first quarter?", "Jack Koraleski", "I think the first quarter number probably is going to be in that 4% or 5%. Again Dennis had shown you, we\u2019ve got over 3,000 employee\u2019s furloughed numbers probably going higher where we\u2019re at, that\u2019s out here. Again what you are trying to predict here is when you think there is going to be some turnaround, I am not real optimistic this year, so we are being pretty conservative on our assumption about a return, but again you have to be prepared for when this thing comes back you don\u2019t just automatically turn it on and off but. So you will see first quarter probably 4% or 5% down.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay, I am sorry I said that was my last one, one real last one. Jack you talked about losing some coal business because you are sticking to pricing, legacy stuff which is part of the plan, but can you talk about the timing and the magnitude where we might see that in the model of when those comp actually walked away from?", "Jack Koraleski", "", "It\u2019s started January 1. ", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "January 1 of last year?", "Jack Koraleski", "", "January 1st, of 2009", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "That\u2019s when you\u2019re starting to see contracts that you are walking away from, so going forward\u2026.", "Jack Koraleski", "No, wait I am sorry I misunderstood your question. I thought you\u2019re asking about the contracts that I lost, when was the impact of that in terms of our volume and we lost those contracts effective January 1.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay, so we will see that starting now going forward is what you are saying?", "Jack Koraleski", "", "It\u2019s in your numbers Ed.", "Jim Young", "Ed, in fact if you look at coal right now you are running about 2% to a year ago, got a lot of factors in there but, that is where we are at.", "Ed Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "", "Okay that is in the numbers.", "", "Operator", "Your next question is comes from Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC", "Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC", "", "Just one clarification, you mentioned around 80%-85% your 2009 book is contracted or is priced in. A ballpark what percentage of your total book is contracted and balance that off against the remaining that is tariff?", "Rob Knight", "If you look at our mix of business we have between 40% and 45% that\u2019s under our long-term multi-year contract. We have about, okay I am going to start guessing here about 20% to 25% it\u2019s probably closer to 20% that is one-year contract kind of leather coats and things and then the balance 30 sum percent would probably be in the tariff.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC", "Okay, that\u2019s good. Next question is just on the on some of the modal shift that you might be seeing regarding truck, fuel prices coming down significantly you mentioned that it is going to be a lower top line cost to your customer and clearly the truck reductions, because there is a higher fuel consumption and that mode is probably going to be even more pronounced to the extent that you might have seen some traffic flow over to truck when we saw 140 oil are you seeing any of that traffic going back to truck now that fuel costs are come down so significantly ?", "Dennis Duffy", "Yes, we have bought some business to track here recently and it\u2019s interesting it\u2019s for two reasons, one of which is the lower fuel prices has actually breathed some life into some small trucks that had been on the verge of going away. So, they now have new hope so, they have got some pretty sharp rates in the marketplace. We have seen that particularly up and down in the IFAD\u2019s corridor and some of those locations.", "So, that\u2019s one factor that has impacted us and the rest of the business is holding pretty solid. We\u2019re all kind of watching to see what happens here in terms of the registrations. They have to get a new license for their tractors at about $4000 a copy. So, we\u2019ll see the staying power that we have there.", "Overall, the other factor that we\u2019ve seen that\u2019s probably been interesting for us is, some business that shifted to track and when we push back on the customer to determine the reason, they basically said, \u201cwe can put four truck loads and one railcar\u201d, but in today\u2019s financial market, I don\u2019t really want to carry the inventory from four truck loads, so, I\u2019ll just buy the truck load at a time until things improve. So, we\u2019re seeing both of those, we have lost some business, but we are watching it pretty carefully.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC", "Okay. That\u2019s good color. Now moving sort of to the intra-rail competition; you\u2019d mentioned that one of the contracts didn\u2019t go your way. Is there any sense of risk here that we are seeing increased price competition between the railroads, based on what you\u2019re seeing out there today?", "Dennis Duffy", "We\u2019re not going to get into a lot of details on the specific pricing. Clearly, there are some markets that it\u2019s softer. As Jack said, the domestic Intermodal, you\u2019ve got some pressure there, that\u2019s out here, but we\u2019re staying firm on what we require. While we had a great year in 2008, you start looking at the capital needs, you look at replacement cost of assets here, these returns need to go up and we\u2019re going to be smart about understanding where our sweet spots are in our network and our margins here, but so far we\u2019re not seeing that, there is just pockets that are out here, but we\u2019re sticking our outlook here.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC", "Okay, well that is good to hear that, I applaud that. On the volume [Technical Difficulty].", "Dennis Duffy", "I think we just lost the feed.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Troy - Citigroup.", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "No, actually relating to the pension plan. We\u2019ve started the year under-funded like a lot of folks with a heavy equity allocation; I think you were close to 70%. Can you just give us an update on the status of the pension expected funding in \u201809? When you need to start thinking about that and positioning for it, I guess it is still as early, but rough estimates would point to a significant contribution needed to top-off the plan. Any thoughts or update there?", "Jim Young", "Matt as I mentioned, the year-end \u201908, we put a voluntary payment, a cash contribution of $200 million. In \u201909, we\u2019ll work through that during the year, likely will be a contribution, but we haven\u2019t determined how much and exactly when.", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Is it fair to say that it would be higher than what we saw in 2008?", "Jim Young ", "Probably not, but I can\u2019t give a precise number on that.", "Rob Knight", "Matt, we\u2019ve been putting some cash in pretty consistently for the last three, four or five years that\u2019s out here.", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "But, again I think everyone is in the same boat with the equity market being what it is, just looking for an update.", "Jim Young", "Keep in mind, our pension implies again the number of people that is a pretty small proportion, it actually I think implies to about 10%, 9% of our total workforce here?", "Matt Troy \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. Second piece of the question, was the debt rate you\u2019ve did late last year was the largest I believe of the class ones at 7.9%. Maybe a little higher than what we have seen from you guys in the past, is that debt rate cover what you\u2019ve got expiring in 2009 or will you need to swap out that debt when it comes due or are you covered now given the size of the rate late last year?", "Rob Knight", "As I mentioned, we\u2019ve got $250 million payment due in the next two, three weeks and we are covered with that. Beyond that, we\u2019ll look at it and determine what the market is at this point in time that further debt is due.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Just a follow-up on that last question; do you have anything else due in \u201809 or is it just the $250 million?", "Rob Knight", "We do have additional debt; we can do during that later in the year, about $600 million or so in total.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "In total, so different issues through the year?", "Rob Knight", "Correct.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, you kind of talked about the 3000 employees you are going to furlough or have furloughed, what is the process to, how long do you keep them furlough, do you have to, is there a contractual agreement that you have to keep them in the furlough for a certain amount of time before you can reduce your staff overall just wondering what kind of ongoing costs furloughed employees have relative to your on-book employees?", "Jim Young", "", "It varies by group, I\u2019ll have Dennis talk, but a majority of those folks right now are trained in engine crew, but go ahead Duff.", "Dennis Duffy", "Again and [Inaudible] side, which is preponderance of that number, they come off the direct cost obviously right away and we don\u2019t incur anything there. Now there is some continuation of benefits out there for several weeks, which would be somewhere close to probably $1000 a month something like that per employee. And then we also have a temporary work arrangement that would put some of these under that we call AWAT\u2019s, it\u2019s an alternative work and training that we pay them eight days a month plus the benefits. So that we could always have a rate of reserve and what we tie that to the anticipated attrition rate for the next six months is what we are working through there.", "So that if things do change, whether we do have that rate of reserve that we can put them right back in play immediately and we make adjustments to that on a monthly basis and can we chose. ", "Jim Young", "And we chose to do the AWAT\u2019s that was not a requirement in the agreements and again as Dennis said it\u2019s an attempt. We try to bridge the time there that we furlough and get them back to work. Now we also have our attrition while it has slowed down a little bit. We are still going to probably see 5%, 6% this year.", "So, again as we said before with an aging workforce as you have and attrition rates kicking up. We are hoping we can again we\u2019ve literally or stop hiring other than couple of specialized areas here. We can get people back to work as quick as we can.", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay and then is there I am just wondering if you are really seeing some increased costs from some of your competitors, is this an increasing amount of pricing competition you are seeing you noted on the coal side. I mean why not start calling out some of these I guess losses to whoever is being the more aggressive so investors can understand who is starting to see or lead the pricing competition within the group?", "Dennis Duffy", "Well Ken, it\u2019s against the law here. I know you don\u2019t literally mean call out what we are seeing here. We are very careful in terms of what we do internally here and again I don\u2019t see any dramatic change. I want to be careful here, you are seeing pockets we compete, at the end of the day again, we have lost some but we have won some and but I don\u2019t see a huge change right now in terms of price pressure at this point and again volumes in the railroad industry have been weak for three years, if you look at it the recession started quite some time ago. So, we are going to be smart about where we go here in terms of our returns long-term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan.", "Tom Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "A question in terms of productivity going forward, you have already had a very good trend in headcount reduction. Your fourth quarter I guess train starts down 9% that\u2019s a pretty impressive number and you are not quite keeping up with the decline in volumes, but you are not that far away, is there risks that its, you are not able to keep up the pace of productivity and you have already kind of you are getting a little bit to the end of some of the momentum on that? Or do you think that there is really continued ability to have the productivity momentum in 2009 that you had in 2008?", "Jim Young", "Tom reduced volumes are going to put pressure on the business, I mean there is just no question about it. Run an 18% down year-over-year on volume is going to put pressure on productivity. We are focusing on a lot of things, if you recall we have got a project OR operating ratio initiative that we are looking and that\u2019s been in place for several years now. We are putting a lot of pressure there to take a look at our costs, that side had great success there, that\u2019s out here. We have technology deployment that we are continuing to push on. Dennis, showed $150 million technology investment this year that pointed productivity.", "Our process initiatives, we have as you know really it is called lean management [Inaudible] engineering that really continues to show us opportunities for our productivity. I would tell you the headcount reductions match with volume, we have to continue to do, but long-term our target here is we want to be handling more volume with fewer resources and but you have to go to slow, this whole industry, if the pace of falloff continues, we are not going to be able to keep up with it. We are going to be very aggressive on it. We are going to prepare ourselves when this thing turns back that we don\u2019t wakeup someday and realize, I don\u2019t have enough people to move trains so, and we are going to keep at it.", "Tom Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "", "Is there a way that you can think about the kind of ratio between the two, I know part of it is how well you can actually forecast the volume, so you can set the resources accordingly, but I mean if volumes end up down 10% on a full-year basis, would you expect headcount and let\u2019s say train starts to be off at half that level or can you be closer to volume down 10, train starts down eight or nine?", "Jack Koraleski", "A rule of thumb is probably I think on variable cost maybe 30% to 50% when you think about it. Again, fuel is going to be highly variable to highly correlated to volume or other costs will be [Inaudible] a rule of thumbs 30% to 50%. I can tell you one of the things we are seeing right now not only capital investment, the productivity crude rates, cycle time you are generating assets here that\u2019s out here and we are just going to keep very aggressive on our costs but be smart about it.", "Tom Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Do you think there is maybe upside to I think you said maybe in first quarter headcount down 5%, but if you are down 10% in volumes for full year, do you think you can be down further than that in headcount?", "Jack Koraleski", "I think we we\u2019re down 10%. We are going to down more than 4% or 5% on headcount.", "Tom Wadewitz - J.P. Morgan", "Right okay, and as you look at \u201809 you\u2019ve got I guess some obvious unfavorables, but a few favorables you\u2019ve got, do you think that you are still going to get 5% to 6% price you have got under-covered on fuel surcharge, so you should get some net benefit from lower fuel and then you have got the operating leverage and lower volumes. Is there a volume level where you would say, if we are in this range, we think those, positive and negative offset and we can have kind of flattish earnings? Is there a way you can think about that that if it\u2019s kind of down 5% maybe you can get flat on earnings, if it\u2019s down 10% then that becomes a lot harder?", "Jack Koraleski", "Tom, I said I wasn\u2019t going to provide financial guidance here, but I would just ask you to think about the positive, you just listed them that are out here. Pricing, productivity out here, energy cost, I mean don\u2019t forget, you not only have diesel cost, but we have got a lot of other energy costs in the business that are coming down. How that plays against volume it\u2019s a tough call. We are going to do everything we can to have relatively speaking a very good year for us financially.", "Operator", "Your next question is comes from the David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Most of my questions are asked, so I have just a few housekeeping questions. On the locomotive purchases in \u201809, can you just run through those numbers I saw the $400 million in locomotive and equipment, but I missed the number of locomotives and the dollars spent on those standalone?", "Rob Knight", "Well, it\u2019s a 125 locomotives, I would figure a price tag about 2.1 or so 2.2", "David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then you\u2019ve talked about some of the modal shift you\u2019re experiencing in Intermodal losses to truck, can you talk about, is that peer price in other words traditionally we\u2019ve thought about railroads being priced at some discount and when we put ranges anywhere, costs from the 15% to 40% relative to truck. The modal shifts that you are experiencing, is that purely based on price, in other words are the trucks coming down to the traditional rail rates and then losing it? Or is there service element there as well?", "Rob Knight", "Jackson, you want to take the price question there?", "Jack Koraleski", "David, for the most part as I said to the earlier question, some of it is price, some of it is they just don\u2019t want the inventory carrying cost associated with a much larger shipment. The one thing we have going for us is our service and the service improvement that we\u2019ve seen so, if we looking at discounts to market, if you look at something like over The Sunset Corridor, LA to Dallas and things like that, our discount to truck is probably in the ten, Chicago to Laredo our discount to trucks probably 15% something like that LA to Chicago more like 20% today. So, we\u2019re watching the market price very carefully and I think that our service improvement plays very strongly in our favor.", "Jack Koraleski", "", "Yes, there is no question on the service piece, when you look at we\u2019ll put new products into the markets, but also keep in mind with customers, you\u2019ve got to prove it overtime, you got to be consistent in terms of your service delivery and I will tell you, it is making a big difference in terms of how our customers are viewing the real products that are out here in the industry.", "David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great and then one last question, you\u2019ve talked about the percentage of your business to roughly 20% that are on one-year contracts. When we think about 2010, when will you start talking to those customers about the 2010 pricing on that 20% of your book of business?", "Jack Koraleski", "", "It goes all throughout the year, I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s any one quarter dominates I would say a lot of it probably comes most closely to year-end, but I wouldn\u2019t say, it is anymore than 30%-40% of that amount.", "David Feinberg \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Is it safe to assume that piece of your overall book of business those discussions might more vigorous in terms of re-pricing, I think you\u2019d mentioned earlier, you never met a customer, who didn\u2019t like a price increase, but are those the toughest conversation is that where you get the most pushback? Or is it pretty consistent across your book of business?", "Jack Koraleski", "I think all of my pricing discussions are vigorous with lots of pushback. So, I don\u2019t see it very different, they are not a heck of a lot different than negotiating a multi-year contract or a tariff increase.", "Jim Young", "David the key on the discussion, like again keep the mind some of these, where is the value. Not only the service product, but what other products can be, what does it mean to the customer, when you turn in assets and many of these quarters like we are today, you have customers that who may own equipped real assets and step back and look at it where they can take millions of dollars out of their logistics costs. So, all that comes into play as Jack said, none of them are ever easy on the discussions, but we\u2019ve got some great products that we have out there today that really do provide value.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "A couple of questions for Rob, the tax rate this year was around 36%. Can you give us some sense as to 2009 and then you\u2019ve mentioned about the $250 million or roughly that number that you got is sort of accelerated depreciation. How should we think about the deferred taxes for 2009?", "Rob Knight", "Randy for about tax, cash tax rate going forward I would just use similar what we had experienced here in 2008. From bonus depreciation, what I had mentioned on the benefit we got most depreciation in 2008 and of course what you are referring to is about $225 million, looking forward we haven\u2019t given that number.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "But, do you see for modeling purposes and we think about sort of what we should put in the deferred tax line, can you give us some help in terms of, should we go back to what we used in 2007 or should we assume that the ratio of deferred to the total accrual stays the same?", "Rob Knight", "", "Randy, I can\u2019t give you any specifics, so I can\u2019t suggest a change and I think it\u2019s kind of the same as you look forward.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay the congratulations on the safety performance on and you guys made tremendous strides over the last few years on safety. Looking to 2009, is there some opportunity to again reduce the accruals for your safety? Or for workers\u2019 compensation not workers\u2019 compensation, but for the whole sort of accrual process that you got for employee injuries et cetera?", "Jim Young", "Randy there is, but again what we\u2019ve got to continue to focus on our performance. Dennis has set some aggressive goals, we have got good programs in place, our total safety culture is one that we have introduced and we\u2019re hoping we should see good trends.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "So, Jim can you give us a scalar in terms of potential reduction?", "Jim Young", "Randy, I\u2019m going to stay away from that in terms of the order magnitude. I would just tell you though that you still have within our company pretty substantial cost item related to safety failures, whether you talk about employees, whether you are talking about derailments, whether you are talking about public safety and we\u2019ve got great progress, we are going to continue at it.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "", "Jack, one question for you; there is a lot of skepticism about the railroad industries. The ability to get 5% to 6% of baseline price increases. When you think about your 5% to 6%, how much of that 5% to 6% would be repricing of legacy contracts from last year in terms of year-over-year comp issue and I guess the other thing I was kind of looking for is some sense of granularity in terms of the 5% to 6%? So for example, do you still see getting 5% to 6% in the Intermodal or do you make more in some category and less than others?  ", "Jack Koraleski", "As we look at it Randy, we\u2019ve said before in our conference with Security Analyst\u2019s last year that we expected to get 3% to 4% plus a 2% pick up from legacies. And so, in total that\u2019s kind of the way we look at it. Our 5% to 6% right now about 55% of that comes from new legacy renewals that we did in 2008 and that\u2019s their impact in 2009. So, it\u2019s about 55% of my 5% to 6% through this year and then also in there you would have other legacies that were done before 2008 that have escalation and plus our tariff pricing and our other pricing.", "In terms of the individual groups it\u2019s pretty difficult to say. It\u2019s really market-by-market, lane-by-lane that looks and so in some pricing corridors we are able to get more than 5% to 6% and others we are taking less and we\u2019re just watching the market very carefully and working with our customers.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Last question, god I think we shot your stock last year in terms of floods, landslides and hurricanes. You guys mentioned to getting insurance recoveries as a benefit for previous years? Looking into 2009 are you in disputes with any of your insurance companies and do you see a situation where you\u2019re going to get an insurance settlement in 2009?", "Rob Knight", "Randy, we always work through that. There is no disputes to share here, but we\u2019re working through all those challenging insurance processes.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "So, can you again give us a scalar in terms of sort of potential contribution?", "Rob Knight", "No.", "Jim Young", "It is not going to be material. At the end of the day, we don\u2019t have any thing like that in our plan. So, I wouldn't, not the material.", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay and then I\u2019m going to squeeze one more, bonus accruals. Was there any change in bonus accrual in the fourth quarter? Did you reduce it; was it up year-over-year? Can you give us some sense as to what happened?", "Jim Young", "Randy, I still have my board meeting in a couple of weeks, but at the end of the day we had a great year, one of the best years in a history of the company. We\u2019re going to do reward the management team for their performance that\u2019s out here. 2009 is a different situation, in terms how you look. So, there are no changes in bonus accruals in terms for fourth quarter and we\u2019re taken a hard look at, we are making some tough decisions right now in 2009.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse.", "Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse", "Just a couple of quick one\u2019s left. First, what do you expect the increase in pension expense on a book basis will be \u201809 versus \u201808? ", "Rob Knight", "I would expect that the pension expense would be probably similar to that what we\u2019ve experienced in 2008, which is around, $35 million or so.", "Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse", "Okay and then can you give us a feel on an average basis maybe like-for-like in terms of routes and products on a year-to-year basis, what you are seeing right now in tariff pricing?", "Rob Knight", "I really can\u2019t, it varies all over the place and again it depends on the market, it depends on the commodity, it depends on the competition as it just depends on so many things. It\u2019s pretty hard to give you an average.", " ", "Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse", "There was no consistent team there?", "Rob Knight", "No.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Gary Chase - Barclays Capital.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Just a quick cleanup for maybe Rob or Dennis; when you talk about the folks on furlough I assume the folks in the AWAT\u2019s program are immediately available that\u2019s the whole point of it. For folks that aren\u2019t, how long does it take to get them back into active service. Do they have to go through a full training regiment again?", "Dennis Duffy", "Well Gary, it depends on how long they\u2019ve been off, but I\u2019d say a maximum 30 days. We usually try and get them back and get them back into the fold so, that\u2019s why we try and peg the immediacy of AWAT\u2019s to the anticipated attrition rates, so we can have them readily available as you said and then the rest would probably be about a 30 day lag.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Okay and then just two for Jack, if I could. Just want to clarify, you said earlier, I think it was Ed Wolfe asked you about, whether or not RCAF, if I can phrase this right. The impact of fuel on RCAF is included within your 5% to 6% core price increase and I think I heard you saying no, so that means whatever fuel does to RCAF positive or negative that\u2019s not going to affect what you\u2019ve report to us as your core price gain, is that accurate?", "Jack Koraleski", "Yes, we try to exclude fuel and try as best we can to come up with the core price calculation, but again RCAF is not a very big factor in our book of business.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Okay and then so, good and to the last question. When you think about the business that is not RCAF, can you give us any color for what that is, is it RCAF ex-fuel plus the surcharge? Does it have nothing to do with RCAF? Or what\u2019s in there, when you think about contracts that are not rolling, that are progressing year-to-year. How do we think about what the escalation clauses in there are?", "Jack Koraleski", "There is an RCAF component that\u2019s about 10%, you\u2019ve got an [ALF] plus fuel surcharge component and then you have fixed price increases that we\u2019ve negotiated with customers in terms of just how over the length of the contract we would escalate the pricing of the deal.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Okay, any sense of what [ALF] plus fuel surcharge is? Is that a significant percentage of the non-RCAF?", "Jack Koraleski", "My guess is ALF plus fuel surcharge is probably in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% of our base.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Okay, so 10% for straight RCAF, 10% to 15% for that and then the rest is other escalation clauses you\u2019ve negotiated overtime?", "Jim Young", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments.", "Jim Young", "Well, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us in the call and we will talk to you again in about three months.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode a brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and slides for today's presentation are user controlled.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Young. You may begin.", "Jim Young", "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today in Omaha are Rob Knight, our CFO, Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales, and Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President, Operations.", "Our first quarter earnings totaled $0.72 per share, a 15% decrease versus last year's quarterly earnings of $0.85 per share. Strong service, productivity, pricing, and lower fuel prices helped drive our results.", "In the first quarter, we experienced one of the most challenging business environments we have ever seen. Jack will talk in more detail about each of the groups, but the weak global economy played a role across the board. Even our bulk commodities, which tend to be less economically sensitive, were impacted by weak export grain demand, reduced animal counts for feeding, and reduced electrical consumption by industrial manufacturers.", "Given the sharp volume decline, our efforts in the quarter focused on reducing costs while improving customer service. We are taking advantage of the lower volumes to increase operating fluidity and efficiency. Regardless of what measure you look at, we have never run better.", "First quarter velocity increased more than 20% year-over-year, but was an all time quarterly best. These productivity efforts, along with lower fuel price, helped us achieve a record first quarter operating ratio of 80.3%.", "In addition to increasing efficiency, we are focused on further improvements in safety and customer service. First quarter safety measures were better in all categories, while our customer satisfaction scores hit a new high.", "In times like these, customers are focused on improving their supply chain efficiency. This provides us a great opportunity to show both current and potential customers the excellent value and service Union Pacific has to offer.", "Finally, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet while maintaining a high degree of financial flexibility in today's world of low business volumes and uncertain credit markets.", "With that, let me turn it over to Jack to give you the marketing perspective. Jack?", "Jack Koraleski", "Thanks, Jim. Good morning. Our first quarter volume fell 21% as the economy took its toll on each of our businesses. Our core price was at the top end of our target range, but our average revenue per car was only up 1%, as lower fuel prices drove a decline in our fuel surcharge revenues.", "Total freight revenue declined 20% to $3.2 billion for the quarter. What I will do now is take you through a walk through of each of our six businesses.", "We'll start with Ag. Our Ag products carloadings were 12% below last year's strong first quarter showing. With a 1% decline in average revenue per car, it lowered total revenue for Ag products 13% for the quarter. Whole grain exports were down 34% against stronger worldwide supply and a stronger US dollar. Domestic grain and meal shipments also saw some due to a reduction in corn shipments to ethanol plants, a weakening of the wheat market, and reduced animal feeds.", "Our DDG business grew 9% while ethanol volume fell about 1% as four plants were closed by the VeraSun bankruptcy. These plants are expected to resume production over the next couple of months.", "Frozen meat and poultry and sugar beet shipments also were down. Food and refrigerated products were the bright spots with our produce rail express leading the way with a 50% volume increase resulting from our new California unit train start. Import beer, canned goods, and wine shipments also increased.", "Looking ahead, we expect grain exports to show modest improvement in the second half. An increase livestock and poultry should give a boost to domestic grain, and higher gasoline usage during the summer vacation season should lead to stronger ethanol volumes later in the year.", "Auto volumes dropped 48%, resulting in a 55% revenue decline, as negative mix and lower fuel surcharges dropped average revenue per car 13%. Finished vehicle shipments declined 54% while our parts volume was down 40%.", "Thirdly, there is a lot of uncertainty in the auto industry. Most forecasts suggest production will remain low through the second quarter. Some strengthening in the second half. We are just now in the process of digesting the GM announcement from yesterday. We will have to see how that plays out in terms of their additional plant closings.", "Growth opportunities, our strong service performance, and our Insight Network Logistics team are allowing us to penetrate both the parts market and used car market. And we are particularly excited about the used car markets. Today that's growing much faster than new cars. Through INL, we have developed capabilities to manage truck-to-rail transportation of autos nationwide providing a retail channel for door-to-door transportation.", "So this summer, we are going to be launching a fully transactional e-store called shipcarsnow.com, which in combination with our new co-loading capabilities will allow us to blend used cars into our existing new car delivery network.", "Our chemical revenues were down 15% as a 6% improvement in average revenue per car partially offset a 20% decline in carloadings. Reduced downstream demand in the automotive and construction industries, along with the decline in consumer spending has impacted our liquid and dry business, plastics and soda ash. Fertilizer volumes were also off with reduced demand both in the export and US markets.", "Sulfur shipments were the bright spot. They were up 21%, largely the result of some new unit train business that we put on the railroad. Improvement in liquid and dry plastics volumes will largely depend on the strengthening of the economy. Soda ash export volume should improve in the second half, and there continue to be some spot opportunities in petroleum markets with crude oil, asphalt, and diluence.", "A 10% decline in energy volume was partially offset by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car, resulting in a 6% revenue decline in our energy business.", "In January, we indicated there were a couple of legacy deals that got away. Those losses cost us 2.8 million tons out of the Powder River Basin in the first quarter. Our SPRV volume was also hampered by utility outages, lower electrical demand, and relatively high coal stockpiles.", "Mine and coal quality issues continue to impact Colorado Utah tonnage and resulted in us losing about 200 trains during the quarter leading to a 21% decline. We knew it was going to be a tough year and that those contract losses would hold energy below 2008's record volume, but the deepening economic slowdown in the high stockpile levels have dampened our outlook a little further for coal markets.", "Continued weak demand across industrial products market led to a 27% drop in volume, which with the 3% decrease in average revenue per car resulted in a 29% decline in revenue.", "Weakened demand has steel production at 43% of capacity, compared to 91% last year. So we have seen our steel volumes about cut in half. Lumber shipments were down 37% as the market showed no signs of recovery during the quarter.", "Slow demand for highway projects and commercial and residential construction impacted stone carloadings. However, we are starting to see an increase in the Texas DOT project lettings. That's over and above the normal seasonal lettings or pickup that we would expect at this time. Largely the result of some of the stimulus funding finding its way into the market. Paper mills continue to reduce inventories, driving a 29% decline in our paper volume.", "Looking ahead, it looks like our best prospects for significant improvement are later in the year in our construction segment, driven by stimulus-related infrastructure projects. ", "Our intermodal volume fell 22% with a slight improvement in average revenue per unit offsetting some of the impact of a 23% volume decline. Volume in our international segment was down 30% while domestic was down 9%. There are some good things happening on the domestic side.", "Our Streamline subsidiary, which offers door-to-door intermodal services, saw volume grow 113% for the quarter with about 30% of that growth coming off the highway. Great service drove our EMP volumes up 18% with intermodal marketing companies, and it is also supporting new truck competitive products including our LA to Dallas and Memphis markets and some refrigerated service in several lanes that again were targeting highway conversions. That success helped drive some strengthening as the quarter progressed with our domestic intermodal volumes closing March down only 2%.", "Looking ahead, international could very well continue to trail 2008 volumes, but we expect domestic business will benefit from our EMP product offering and strong service. That's supporting some additional truck competitive products, including our new LA to Tacoma doublestack service, that was made possible by our investments to clear the tunnels along our [I-5] corridor.", "So while inventory levels have dropped significantly, they have not come down enough to match the falloff in sales. Top chart shows average retail trade inventories during the first quarter from 2006 through 2009. And for '09, we used only January and February since that's what's been reported so far.", "While inventories are back to 2006 levels, the inventory sales ratio is significantly higher than in any of the prior years as the falling inventories couldn't match the pace of falling sales.", "Bottom chart shows that the same is true for automotive industry. The extended shutdowns have significantly reduced inventory, but sales have dropped even more quickly.", "Until these inventory levels and these and other segments of the economy align with demand, there is not much pull in the supply chain. And of course, that impacts the demand for transportation services.", "Many of our customers are telling us that their inventories are already at very low levels. But until consumer confidence returns, I do not think we are going to break that cycle. That makes the timing of a recovery pretty hard to judge. However, some customers believe that the deeper that inventory sag, the greater the potential for more of a v-shaped recovery when, in fact it does come back.", "So here are some of the leading indicators that we are watching in our business. In the upper right, gondola orders are show no signs of life, which fits with what we are seeing going on in our steel markets.", "In the upper left, we have plotted orders for center beam flat cars which handle lumber. We've seen some seasonal strengthening here of late. Of course in this economy, even a seasonal upturn is starting to feel encouraging for us. Boxcar orders appear to have stopped their slide and have even shown a slight uptick the past few weeks, while this time last year we were actually trending down. And in the lower right, our southern rock carloadings are trending up, although not as strongly as a year ago.", "So we've got down decidedly. Boxcar showing some signs of life, and the other two following their seasonal patterns. I guess you could say that these leading indicators reinforce the general uncertainty that remains with perhaps some faint signs of life. The good news is that the favorable economics of rail combined with the great value we can provide with our service is a competitive advantage for us, and it's one that our customers are recognizing.", "Our first quarter customer satisfaction ratio came in at 87, topping the fourth quarter of last year as our best ever. The satisfaction index of 88 in March equals our best ever month, hit only one time before back in February of 1994. So we're pretty pleased with those results.", "With that, I will turn it over to Dennis who's going to talk about our service ", "Dennis Duffy", "Thank you, Jack. Good morning. The operating department took on the challenge of the lower volume environment working throughout the quarter to align resources with demand while increasing network efficiency. This chart highlights four different service metrics, each attaining new bests in the first quarter.", "Starting in the top left quadrant, network velocity increased 5 miles per hour to 27.2, a 23% increase. This is our highest quarterly speed ever and drove better asset productivity and strong customer service.", "As we have said before, lower volumes do help, but unified plan initiatives, lean management principles, and strict inventory controls are helping us leverage today's lower volumes into capacity for tomorrow.", "Velocity and productivity gains also led to a [recrue] rate of 3.8%, another best. As well as a 5% improvement in our fuel efficiency rate. Our first quarter dwell times were almost a full hour lower year-over-year at 24.3. We are consistently making our car connections minimizing inventory in our terminals.", "Freight car utilization, measuring the days between loads, was a first quarter best at 9.1 days. Faster asset turns allows us to reduce short-term rental expenses. It also adds capacity.", "Service delivery index reached a best ever level in the quarter at nearly 92. This is a composite metric of all customer commitments and correlates directly with the improvements Jack discussed with customer satisfaction. Importantly, we achieved this high performance level while making safety gains in all categories employee, customer, and public.", "A key question is, how volume variable can UP be in a declining volume environment? The concept of volume variability can best be illustrated by this chart.", "Our working resources, crews, locomotives, freight cars coupled with our fixed plan, determines capacity in terms of network throughput, which is the most appropriate definition of capacity in the rail industry. Although seven-day carloadings have been running about 145,000, we believe today our physical plant has fixed capacity for roughly 200,000 weekly car loads.", "We needed to adjust our working resources to reflect the current economic conditions. To achieve that, we employed a number of levers that impact each category, such as furloughs, lease returns, retirements, and network redesigns. These steps work in a down economy, but we have also built in recall steps should volumes increase. To date, those efforts have yielded strong results.", "In the first quarter, UP's gross ton-miles declined 20% year-over-year. As we have discussed in the past, one of our primary objectives has been to match train starts with the freight demand, and with the first quarter starts down 21% against the 20% tonnage decline, we again achieve that goal.", "For the quarter, we averaged 18% fewer train engine and yard employees. Used 24% fewer road locomotives and 26% fewer freight cars. So our working resources lined up well against the first quarter volumes.", "As we enter the second quarter, resource storage rates exceed first quarter averages as we have taken additional actions. Currently on the right-hand side of the chart, you can see we have roughly 26% of our train in furlough, 31% of our road locomotives stored, and 31% of our freight car fleet parked. We have also furloughed about 700 employees in other crafts as the overall network work load has declined. Moving forward, we will continue to make adjustments as warranted by demand.", "Beyond these adjustments in our working resources, we are also making changes in the use of our fixed plant, adjusting terminal operations and train networks to maximize efficiency.", "We are using our unified planned process to shift workload to our most efficient yards and to dramatically scale back or close other less efficient facilities, as represented by the pyramid on the left. Through this approach, we have significantly reduced activity at the regional and local yards in our manifest network.", "For intermodal and automotive traffic, we are combining the two networks to match volumes and maintain or enhance service performance. Then we aggressively are controlling costs within these scaled-back networks through the applications of remote control locomotives, shift eliminations, reducing staff levels, and other cost-related actions across all terminals.", "So as we look ahead to the rest of 2009, the operating team's objectives are unchanged. Safety is always a top priority, and we expect continuous improvement. The work of being volume variable is evergreen.", "In fact, we believe the operational changes we are making today are creating capacity and service consistency for our customers in the future. As we enter the summer capital maintenance season, we have the opportunity to work very efficiently on our unit costs with the lower trade volumes.", "When the economy turns around and volumes return, we are ready. We will apply the principles of volume variability to generate upside leverage to the growing volumes. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Rob for the financials. ", "Rob Knight", "Thanks, Dennis. Good morning. Let me start today with our first quarter income statement. Operating revenue declined 20% in the quarter to $3.4 billion. Lower revenue was primarily driven by the 21% drop in carloadings.", "In addition, fuel surcharge revenue decreased more than $300 million year-over-year as a result of lower diesel fuel prices. Operating expenses also decreased 21% to $2.7 billion. The company's cost-saving initiatives associated with the lower volumes and increased efficiency helped hold down expenses.", "Another contributor was the 47% year-over-year decline in average quarterly diesel fuel prices.", "In addition, last year's first quarter included roughly $20 million of higher costs associated with the Oregon mud slide. So we have a slightly favorable comparison year-over-year.", "The combination of lower revenue and expenses resulted in first quarter operating income of $672 million, a 15% decrease. First quarter freight revenue totaled $3.2 billion, down 20% year-over-year on lower carloadings.", "On the pricing front, our results were consistent with our outlook for average increases in the 5% to 6% range. In fact, in the first quarter, we were at the higher end of that range. Average revenue per car also increased year-over-year, up only 1% to $1,755 per car, as lower fuel surcharges nearly offset the positive pricing.", "In fact, if you look at average revenue per car over the last five quarters, it peaked in the third quarter of 2008, when diesel fuel prices were at their highest. Customers see the benefit of lower fuel prices in their freight bills, which have decreased on average 9% over the last six months.", "Our opportunity in today's depressed carload environment is to align expenses with volumes, while at the same time increasing efficiency. As carloadings started falling off last November, we have taken action to better align supply with demand. And those actions aren't just confined to operations. We have acted across the company to reduce spending.", "Our efficiency has also improved significantly in the last several months. Although it's difficult to separate how much of this is driven by volumes, the gains are evident in our costs and in our service.", "Back in January, we discussed that roughly 30% of our costs are linked to quarterly volume changes. We also stated that the share of costs that vary with volume increases to about 50% over the course of a couple of quarters. Longer term, over a number of years, costs are increasingly variable as we size our business to match volume levels.", "With first quarter volumes declining 21%, quarterly operating expenses adjusted for the change in fuel price, declined 12%. We combine the impact of lower volumes and greater overall productivity to achieve 55% expense variability in the quarter. As we walk through each of the different expense categories, we'll point out areas where volumes, efficiency gains, or both, helped drive lower costs.", "Let's start with compensation and benefits, down 5% to $1.1 billion. An 8% reduction in our workforce, enabled by lower car load volumes and record operating efficiency, were the primary driver of the year-over-year decline. As you heard from Dennis, our [TE and Y] workforce declined 18% in the first quarter.", "Frame men, which accounted for roughly 30% of our workforce, are clearly the most variable part of our employee base. All UP departments experienced workforce reductions in the quarter.", "Furlough levels increased throughout the first quarter and are continuing today. As a result, we have a timing difference with our quarterly averages and the actual reduction trends. Offsetting a portion of these reductions was wage inflation, associated with a 4% increase last July for Union employees as well as higher benefit costs. As we move through 2009, we will continue to align our workforce levels with demand and productivity.", "Purchase services and materials expense declined 15% in the quarter, or $70 million. This category benefited from decreased contract service expense, as well as reduced crew transportation and lodging. Lower volumes and increased productivity were the primary reasons for less usage of purchase services.", "First quarter fuel expense totaled $386 million, a 60% decline versus last year. We saved $335 million in the quarter, as fuel prices decreased from an average of $2.84 per gallon in 2008 versus only paying $1.51 per gallon on average this year.", "Interestingly, the $1.51 per gallon is the lowest quarterly average price we've paid in four years.", "Fuel expense was also lower year-over-year as a result of consuming 78 million fewer gallons of diesel fuel in the quarter. The 20% reduction in gross ton-miles saved approximately $177 million while our continued fuel conservation efforts contributed another $45 million in savings.", "Although diesel fuel prices have inched up some in the last few weeks, we're still only paying about $1.55 per gallon today. At that level, fuel prices could be as much as $2 per gallon lower in the second quarter of 2009 versus last year. If these prices hold, similar to the first quarter, customers will continue to see the benefit of declining fuel prices in the form of lower fuel surcharges.", "Depreciation expense increased $5 million year-over-year to $345 million. This reflects increased capital spending in recent years. However, effective January 1, 2009, lower depreciation rates for rail and other track material offset most of the increase. The lower depreciation rate is associated with longer asset lives in reduced track usage.", "First quarter equipment and other rents expense declined to $317 million, down $25 million from 2008 levels. Lower carload volumes of finished vehicles, industrial products, and intermodal, continue to drive down short-term car rents. Fewer leased assets also reduced rental costs in the quarter.", "Other expense declined $16 million in the first quarter to $226 million. Freight and property damage expense decreased in the quarter along with our volume levels. In addition, first quarter casualty accruals were lower in 2009 as a result of ongoing safety improvements. Somewhat offsetting these reductions were higher state and local taxes, as well as an increased provision for bad debt.", "A 21% decrease in operating expenses against a 20% decline in operating revenue resulted in a first quarter operating ratio of 80.3%. This record operating ratio was driven by lower year-over-year fuel prices, pricing gains, and increased productivity, offset somewhat by low are volume. In fact, year-over-year, we improved 1.2 points on our operating ratio. Over the last four years, despite declining volumes, we've taken 3.4 points off of our first quarter operating ratio.", "Moving on to the full income statement, first quarter other income was $2 million lower versus 2008 at $23 million. Gains from real estate sales declined in the quarter, while interest income was also down reflecting lower interest rates. Interest expense increased 12% in the quarter to $141 million. Although UP's effective interest rate was slightly lower year-over-year, higher average debt levels drove then increased expense.", "First quarter income tax expense declined $52 million, or 22%. Lower pre-tax income and a slightly lower effective tax rate of 34.7% contributed to the expense reduction. Similar to last year, our effective tax rate includes a deferred tax benefit associated with newly enacted state legislation. On a full-year basis, we would expect an effective tax rate closer to 37%.", "Net income for the quarter totaled $362 million, an 18% decline versus last year's record first quarter. Earnings per share came in 15% lower year-over-year at $0.72 per share. Slide 32 illustrates UP's adjusted debt balances at the end of the first quarter, which totaled $14.4 billion, or a 47.9% adjusted debt to cap ratio.", "In February, we retired $250 million of debt, and we took advantage of a favorable capital markets window issuing $750 million of additional debt. First quarter ending cash balances totaled nearly $1.5 billion, reflecting the proceeds of the debt offering I just mentioned. We are continuing to maintain a strong liquidity position through these tough and uncertain economic times.", "We are also taking a hard look at our capital spending in 2009. Although we initially budgeted $2.8 billion, we now plan to trim that back to about $2.6 billion. As Jack discussed with you earlier, there is still a great deal of uncertainty in the marketplace, although we can point to certain inventory figures in leading carload indicators that hold the potential for trends to improve, but timing is unclear. It does feel, however, like we've reached a point of stability in our volumes.", "With little visibility to near-term change and demand, we will work to further align resources with volumes, while also improving efficiency. Keep in mind, however, that we've already achieved over 50% cost variability. Lower year-over-year fuel prices should continue to help drive a decline in quarterly operating expenses. Since we don't yet have 100% fuel surcharge recovery, lower prices help.", "We are also committed to achieving strong pricing gains for 2009, which are necessary to earn a return on our investment. While we are not providing quarterly earnings guidance today, it is safe to say, however, at these continued low volume levels we won't reach last year's second quarter earnings of $1.02 per share.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. ", "Jim Young", "Thanks, Rob. As we look ahead at the year, there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty regarding business volumes. Although we are watching for signs of a recovery, we don't anticipate a turnaround any time soon.", "With business volumes continuing to run down more than 20% versus last year, we are taking additional steps to take costs out of the network. Included in this, as Rob mentioned, is a reduction in our 2009 capital budget to $2.6 billion. Although we are slowing some of our capacity additions, we're still investing for the future when the volume returns.", "This cost focus does not, however, reduce our commitment to increasing safety and providing excellent customer service. The performance record we have built in these areas is fundamental to increasing the value we provide to our customers and our shareholders.", "Customers are looking for supply chain solutions that can help them meet their business objectives, and our network is poised to meet that need. In fact, we believe we will leverage volumes more strongly than we have in the past cycles as a result of our unified plan efforts, lean management, and other network initiatives. UP's safe, fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly transportation offerings further increase the already strong value of rail.", "Today's balanced, regulatory environment supports our ability to invest and advance the value we can provide our customers, our shareholders, and the nation's economy. UP 's goals of investing and growing with our customers will be challenged if regulations change and limit our ability to earn an adequate financial return. We are dedicated to increasing shareholder value, and we look ahead optimistically to a growing global economy that will benefit from the strong rail franchise UP has to offer. With that, let's open it up for your questions. ", "Questions-and-Answers Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question, sir.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. I'm just wondering if we can talk a little about incentive comp. Sorry I jumped on late, so I wasn't sure if you had mentioned it. Incentive comp, I don't think, came down very much. So is that suggesting that maybe you feel like the first quarter is perhaps the trough for the year? Or how should we think about what incentive comp trends suggest?", "Jim Young", "Bill, I think first thing you have to be careful looking at maybe what you saw at some other railroads. Our program is not similar in terms of the way you do mark-to-market. Ours is a little more consistent. It's out here incentive comp is down a little bit to a year ago. Or, take a look at it each quarter in terms of our performance going forward, and we will adjust according to how our performance will work. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Alright. So Jim, UP used to be one of the best railroads, if not the best before the SP merger. Can you get back to that level? And if you can, what's the philosophy? Importantly what's the CapEx requirement for you to get back there? Because I look at the locomotives stored, and I look at what you've done at CapEx. And I say, CapEx maybe can come down materially from where we are. And yet, if you want to get back to those operating levels, and you have improved a lot. I would think you still might have to spend quite a bit from here.", "Jim Young", "Well, Bill, we used to be one of the best. I think we are one of the best right now, but we can debate that another time. We are being smart about our capital investment, and if you look at it again, you have to go back to the SP-CN&W merger. We bought some properties that needed capital. We have been putting it in. I think you see the results in several areas. Customer service. Clearly, we have substantially changed the mindset of customers. I will tell you, that does not happen overnight.", "You have got to work at it. Consistently show what you can do. Our efficiency. Granted, we are benefiting from lower volumes, but I will tell whether you we're running 145,000 cars or 190,000 cars, our productivity is going to be very good. We still have some needs going forward, and I have got to keep an eye on the long-term here.", "Now is the time to put capacity in. I will tell you, we are seeing our productivity in terms of capital efficiency is we are up almost 20%. So we are going to be smart about our capital long-term, and we have adjusted. You heard we cut it back about $2.6 billion. You'll recall I have 125 locomotives in that number right now that, quite honestly, I don't need another locomotive for several years. But we'll be smart going forward. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "And the CapEx number on locos is about $300 million? ", "Jim Young", "About $300 million. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "So that doesn't repeat in 2010, I assume? ", "Jim Young", "Not unless we see one heck of a v-shape in this recovery. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thanks for your help. ", "", "Jim Young", "Okay, Bill. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks very much. Good morning.", "Jim Young", "Good morning.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "Just on the pricing side, it sounds like you got a pretty good 5% to 6% in on the high end of that, you were mentioning. I was just wondering how is the tone right now of your recent renewals? Are you still getting 5% to 6% in the first quarter? Or is it coming down because of the economy? ", "Jim Young", "Jack, you want to take that one? ", "Jack Koraleski", "There's really not been a substantial change in our renewals. I think what you would have to do is distinguish between our legacy contract renewals and then our other day-to-day contract renewals. The negotiations are ongoing. We're trying to be competitive. Trying to make sure customers recognize the value they are receiving. We really have not seen a substantial change. ", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Do you have a sense of how much your 2010 book is priced in right now? ", "Jim Young", "Right now, Walter, we are not providing any guidance on 2010 that's out here. Again, what we look at is keep in mind, go back to your first question here. There's still a significant spread between an old legacy contract and even a softer market that's out here. So I'm confident if we keep providing the service, the value proposition to customers that we have today, we're going to see positive pricing. ", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "Jim, some of your competitors have been talking a bit just yesterday about the risk of cutting too much too quickly. Can you talk to us about how you look at that? And what are the big challenges you see if volumes do start to come back, and you stored a lot of cars, furloughed a lot of workers. What's your biggest challenge if we do see that v-shaped recovery to getting things back online and be able to service the demand? ", "Jim Young", "Walter, you may recall, we learned a pretty hard lesson in 2003 and '04 when we were short substantially when the economy came back. We were short locomotives. We were short people. And it hurt us in terms of in fact, we still have business that we lost then that hasn't come back. We've got a very disciplined approach. Dennis and his team. We know what the lead times are on each one of our resources. Every Monday morning, we have the team together looking for signs of recovery and ask the question if it's a v-shape how quickly can we respond? I will tell you right now though, at 143,000-142,000 cars a week with Dennis' slide that we'd shown or we've got fixed ability of 200,000. We've got a long ways to go before we're going to be stretched in terms of an economic problems of handling volume growth. ", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "This last question here, Rob, on the share buyback. Very quickly, what is your thought? I saw you cut that down this quarter. Any view on resuming that? Or, are you going to wait until the markets improve a little bit? ", "Rob Knight ", "Obviously, our price is very attractive, but you nailed it. We're going to take a hard look at economic recovery, and of course, our resulting business volumes. So we're taking a cautious approach at this point. ", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good morning. Jim, when we were talking a couple months ago, it sounded like you said if volumes stay down 20%, we may have to look at things a little bit differently. We're kind of still at that 20% level. How long, and what do you think needs to shift here? I mean, you said you made more cuts on the headcount reduction. Can you get the employee costs even down close to that? Do you want to? What other moves do you want to make longer term with volumes staying at these levels? ", "Jim Young", "Ken, the question is how long. We are taking additional action. We have not stopped. We're, again, trying to I said in my summary here I don't see much of a recovery this year. So we're really looking next year, at best. I'm going to have Dennis address us here in a minute in terms of some other of the new things we're looking at. But we're after it. And again, we're down 20% in volume right now. Our force counts are down about 8%. I think second quarter you'll see that spread, even do a little bit better. You're not going to match a 20% reduction in volume with force counts in the short term, but I'll have Duff talk a little bit about some of the additional things we are looking at in our network right now. ", "Dennis Duffy", "Obviously, Ken, what we've done is intent a job on the variable costs, and we continue to do that. As you saw on Rob's chart, we showed 55% variable. We really think we're in that 55% to 60%. What we're trying to do is move up into the fixed plant and see what economies we can derive there. I mentioned that just a few in our terminal operation, where we have it stratified between network, our regional, and our local yards in driving the efficiencies into the network yard.", "We are doing that on the intermodal side, the auto side, and our manifest network so that we can leverage as much as possible out of the fixed plant and continue to take that percent variability higher and higher as we see these volumes erode. So the other thing is, we're trying to shorten the cycle time between the time we see the volume reductions and the time that we're able to take it to the bottom line.", "In the past, that's been elongated. We always talk about the percent variable in each quarter. We like to get it down to days. So that we're totally responsive when we see those volume fluctuations. I will just reinforce, with Jim, that we do that on the downside, but we also build in recall steps [of fully] along the way. We don't take a down action that we don't have a recall step and be able to work our way back out of that with a predefined lead time so that we can recover volumes are there. ", "Jim Young", "A couple quick points here. One, we're not going to jeopardize customer service. It's very important. We are seeing a lot of value there. Two, we still are seeing attrition. We expect our attrition and force counts this year while it slowed done a little bit, we'll still see 3,000 to 4,000 folks leave the Company. And that's down a little bit from what we saw in prior years. So we're trying to take advantage of that as much as we can. ", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Just a quick financial question on the surcharge lag benefit. Was there what dollar, Rob, was the benefit this quarter? And then, I guess a Jack question. On intermodal yields were actually positive this quarter, how did you do that relative to what we have seen from the industry? ", "Rob Knight ", "Ken, on the lag benefit, it's roughly $0.20 on an EPS basis for the surcharge. So while prices were clearly down, in our surcharge number was down as you know, which drove our revenue down. We did get a benefit in the first quarter of about $0.20 on an EPS basis. ", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. ", "Jack Koraleski", "In terms of the intermodal pricing, Ken, we've got we did have some on the international side, legacy renewals last year that gave us some carryover benefit this year. We have, also, on our premium domestic business, with the service levels being what they are, some of the new products like our Streamline growth, that's actually been quite good for us. We have been able to get price on the market on those. ", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Then on coal, do you look for at the Transportation Coal Conference last week, it sounded like things are abysmal with export declining, no test burns east of the Mississippi. What is your outlook for continuing to push PRB coal east? Are there any opportunities? And what do you view as volumes going forward? ", "Jim Young", "The phone has stopped ringing again for Eastern opportunities. There are occasional opportunities that we're continuing to work on, but it's not nearly as hot as it was a year ago. And so we're looking right now primarily at our own domestic franchise. We have said before, we're not a big player in the export market, so we didn't gain a lot from that. We're not going to lose from that, either. ", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Last question I have is, Jim, if you can just give an update on what you think is coming out of Washington? It sounds like everybody's in a huddle room right now with the AAR joining in. Do you think we see some legislation? Are you more confident that something is going to come down the pike? ", "Jim Young", "We are active in Washington as we have been the last two, three years, and what my goal is to make certain if legislation comes down the pike. And, you can read the tea leaves. They're clearly with the new Congress up there, there's the higher potential. But again, one of the things that whenever I'm in a member's office, particularly the folks that want to push some new regulations, the discussion always ends up with how do we put more business on the railroad?", "Our discussion, you've got to be careful where we're going because capital will dry up very quickly, and you have to take into account replacement costs of assets going forward. So I think we've got a good story to tell with our service, the value we're offering. We're a private industry that's putting capital into capacity. So we'll see what happens here. I would tell you, I feel pretty confident that the members understand the value of railroads, and that we're going to get this right going forward. ", "Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for the time. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Troy of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Appreciate the dashboard you provided in the slide deck about indicators you're watching for a turn. Just curious, looking at the AAR traffic that came out this morning. Both your numbers, the industry numbers over the last few weeks. They are a couple points worse than the first quarter rate of decline, which certainly doesn't point to anything improving any time soon. Was wondering, though, what are you hearing from customers? People have talked and speculated about the potential for destocking, and how that might drive a pickup. Wondering if your actual conversations, your boots on the ground are having those conversations, and showing that people are intending to do that or at least contemplating it? ", "Jim Young", "Keep in mind what I said here is if you look at our numbers. I don't see it. You have to be careful about each week here. I think there's a little bit of carryover from Easter in the numbers. Traditionally, in fact if you look over time, when you in early April, the start of the second quarter is generally weak. I mean, we see a pickup toward the end of the quarter that it falls off then it picks up. What I see right now, and what I'm hearing from customers is, as Jack said, there's some sign of hope, but not a strong leaning toward things are getting worse. If anything, it's kind of balanced right now. Jack, you want to add anything? ", "Jack Koraleski", "I would say, Matt, our customer conversations there's a lot of optimism for the second half. Nobody really sees much happening right at the moment. There's a lot of speculation as to what the stimulus bill will or will not do. We're working very closely with our customer base to make sure they understand opportunities within the stimulus bill. So there's some bright spots associated with that. But overall, I think our customer base is relatively realistic. They're not pessimistic in terms of it getting worse. They think, for the most part, it's kind of bottomed out. You can pick an industry, pick a customer to walk through it, but everybody's looking toward the second half as starting to really show substantive signs of recovery. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Just the concern being is that in December everyone was looking towards the first half in the middle of 2009, that hope didn't materialize. But certainly, we're pulling for the stimulus to have some . ", "Jim Young", "The way we're looking at resources, though, don't hear from us that we're saying there's a second half recovery. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Right. No, I understand. And I appreciate that. The second question I had, and it relates to Washington. From a different perspective. Certainly the expectation is, we'll get some kind of regulatory update in the coming weeks. On the stimulus side, it seems that a lot of red meat was thrown to a lot of different industries in the rail freight industry which checks a lot of the boxes in terms of what the stimulus was trying to accomplish got just bread crumbs. I was just wondering is there a strong voice representing the rails in Washington? It would seem that you would be a natural beneficiary for more stimulus funds given the environmental benefit, given the infrastructure benefit. If you could just give us an update on the efforts there. Whether it's a tax credit? What might we work towards toward longer terms to get some of that money that is being thrown around in this industry? ", "Jim Young", "Matt, I think there are two issues there. You have the long-term investment tax credit that we have been talking about for some time. Our objective there, obviously, is if we believe more rail capacity is needed to meet the country's needs in the future, which I do. One way of attracting capital and improving returns is investment tax credit. That's a long-term strategy. The stimulus money, quite honestly, we did not make a major ask. If you look at what came out for the overall transportation about $80 billion, $85 billion, I think, in total. Very little of that is for freight. Much of it's commuter. What we focused on were some of the city projects, like Chicago's Create, that we focused on communities where money would help in the communities. There's one big deal hanging out here though, which is positive train control, that is a huge investment for this industry. You can call it an unfunded mandate because that's what it is. That we're going to have to figure out how that's paid for long-term. Not only in the freight system, but the commuter operations. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "And I understand why direct government stimulus into the industry might not make sense. But the tax credit is certainly something that we have been hearing about for a while. Is there any kind of road map or process that that can happen sooner rather than later? Or is that just a work in process, and we should just stay tuned on this end? ", "Jim Young", "I would say when it comes to rail industry right now, the number one focus in DC is new regulation. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Okay. ", "Jim Young", "Investment tax credit is someplace down the priority list, but it is still out there. I think everyone is focused right now on what happens the next two, three, four quarters. And that's where a lot of the energy is focused. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Absolutely. Last question is just a one-off. In terms of the lower depreciation rate effective 1/1/2009? What was the impact of that in the quarter? In terms of just our modeling accuracy, what impact would that have in terms of benefiting depreciation rates through the balance of the year? ", "Rob Knight ", "Walter, it excuse me, I'm sorry, Matt. I think looking forward it should be a similar 1% to 2% kind of increase run rate. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "On D&A.? ", "Rob Knight ", "Yes. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you very much for the time. ", "Jim Young", "Okay. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JP Morgan Chase. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase", "Good morning. ", "Jim Young", "Good morning, Tom. ", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase", "I wanted to, and, I missed the beginning of the call. There was some overlap. I don't know if you talked much about the coal view. It seems like in the East, the volume outlook has gotten materially worse. And there's more sensitivity there due to low natural gas prices and some switching on the margin. What's your coal view looking forward? Do the volumes get worse year-over-year? Are inventory levels too high? Do you care about natural gas prices? Do you think things actually get a little bit better for your coal volumes? I guess the other factor there is that you had talked about production issues in your Colorado mines. I'm not sure how that could affect going forward as well. ", "Jim Young", "If you look at the first quarter, tonnage is down about 10% or so. You can split it three ways. About a third was to some lost legacy business that we incurred. About a third to Colorado Utah, in terms of some of the production problems. And a third to overall demand. Right now, we're running about 27 trains a day, 28 trains out at PRB. So that's down a little bit from what we finished the quarter at. It's going to be weak, I think, the balance of the year. Unless, again the wild card here is what happens with summer heating that's out here. We're not again, we will see our volume, our coal volumes down for the full-year. Jack, you want to add anything to that? ", "Jack Koraleski", "I think you are right, Tom. I think we're less sensitive to natural gas pricing. A lot of our customers have peakers, but they don't actually have the ability to convert massively to gas. So we tend to be cushioned a little bit from that, although you never say never. That tends to be more a Southeast and a Northeast kind of phenomenon for us. Stockpiles are relatively high. As Jim said, depending on weather and what happens. They can melt away pretty quickly if we have a really hot summer. ", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase", "Right. Okay. Jack, since you're I guess on the line. Can you give us a sense of the breakdown of yield in terms of fuel price and mix. I know you talked about price being toward 6%. What was yield impact from fuel and mix in the quarter? ", "Jack Koraleski", "If you go back and you look at it from a yield perspective, I think fuel hit us for about 7%. We were on the high end of our price range, as I said, and then you probably got a point or so from positive mix. ", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase", "Okay. A little bit from positive mix. Okay. Good. The last question, I'll hand it off to someone else. From a higher level strategic view, I guess if you looked a few years back, you might have said that the way you ran your terminals. Let's say pick Houston as a point. There would have been some room to run the terminals more effectively in terms of, you've got a couple Houston terminals, and maybe the way you manage the flow could be improved. I think you did some work on that back a few years ago. Is there further opportunity to make major changes in the way you run terminals where you have more terminal density? And perhaps even shut down terminals and expand others? Is that the type of thing you can really do to make structural changes when you are in such a weak volume environment? ", "Jack Koraleski", "Absolutely, Tom. That's exactly what we are doing with all of our terminal infrastructure. If you look at the slide that I showed that shows the hierarchy of our terminals, you're talking about those major network terminals, the Houstons of the world. Our impetus is to drive volume into those, and obviously take the economies from the lower level to our jobs. The local yards, the regional yards, and even within the major yards. We have still still, plenty of opportunities there to run those more efficiently. But we certainly want to take advantage of the economies of scale offered by those yards, and then make them as efficient as possible. That's exactly what we're doing. And redefining the transportation plan as we do that using the unified plan. So that we can at the same time, improve customer service and derive the efficiencies associated with it. ", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase", "Did you actually end up shutting some terminals as a result of that, or not necessarily? ", "Jack Koraleski", "We have shut down some of the local serving ones, yes. And we continued to do that. ", "Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase", "Okay. Great. Thank you for the time. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question today will be coming from the line of Randy Cousins of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", " ", "Good morning. Rob, for you, the first question. You don't have 100% fuel surcharge coverage. I guess the fuel surcharge drop was $300 million and the fuel cost drop was $570 million. Obviously, there's a volume factor in there as well. Could you give us some sense of what you thought the benefit was in the first quarter of the lower fuel prices juxtaposed against the issues of coverage that you have in some of your book of business? Does that benefit continue over the balance of the year, assuming fuel prices stay where they are? ", "Rob Knight ", "Randy, we don't break it out as precisely as I understand you're asking. The net was when you add it all in, the net benefit versus last year was at $0.20. Of course last year, we were facing a rising fuel environment. As you look forward into the second quarter, if fuel prices stay where they are and volumes stay down like what they're running, you won't get well, there might be we would expect some lag benefit moving forward. It won't be as material because now you're in a flatter environment.", "So as time goes on and fuel prices stabilize, you don't see that kind of a lag benefit going forward. So it all depends on what fuel prices do in the second quarter. Again, assuming they just stay flat and everything stays as it is, while prices would be significantly down versus the previous year in the second quarter, you wouldn't see any kind of a material lag benefit. ", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "So that $0.20 you're talking about? That includes the fact that some of the business just doesn't have a good fuel surcharge coverage number in it, right? ", "Rob Knight ", "That's correct. ", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", " ", "I don't know whether this question should go to Dennis or Jack. But your RTMs were down a lot less than the GTMs. I noticed that the chemical ratio looked particularly a big difference between RTMs versus GTMs. Can you give us a sense as to what's going on there? ", "Dennis Duffy", "It's primarily mix, Randy, and length of hall improving some of those kinds of issues. ", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "That would be a good thing for you, not a bad thing, right? ", "Dennis Duffy", "That's right. ", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Just with reference to the intermodal business. You talked about the domestic side being down 9% versus the international being down 30%. Can you give us some sense do you think you are picking up market share against the trucks? Or can you give us some sense as to some color within that 9%? ", "Jim Young", "Randy, we definitely are picking up some market share against trucks. Again, what I said was it was down 9% for the quarter, but by the end of the quarter for March, domestic was only down 2%. And, we're continuing to see that strengthen. It's largely on the benefits of the service that we have today. We are very competitive with trucks. And some of our new service offerings, we opened up several lanes to run intermodal, refrigerated trailers that we haven't had in the past. The new doublestack service up and down the I-5 corridor on the West Coast. The Streamline door-to-door product is catching on in the marketplace. Very attractive to customers, as I said. About 4,000 they grew about 5,000 containers in the quarter, and about 1,700 of those came off the highway. We are definitely making some improvements against the trucks. ", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Some of your competitors have talked about RCAF being an issue in terms of price. I wonder if you could talk about whether that had any impact in terms of your arc in the first quarter? ", "Jim Young", "RCAF is a pretty small factor for me. In total, RCAF-related is probably 3% to 4% of RCAF alone. And then, you would have another 8% or so associated with [ALIF]. But of course, there is a differentiation there. In total, only about 11% or so of my business is RCAF-related. So it's not a big factor. ", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Last question. Last May when you had your investor conference, you talked about what you could do in terms of operating ratio reduction. Going along with the expression necessity is the mother of invention. Obviously, we're taking a look at systems and approaches you never had to before because of the environment that we're in. Do you feel safe to say that there's another two or three points of OR to come out of this system simply because you found efficiencies you never realized you had? ", "Jim Young", "Randy, I am not wavering from our long-term view that said our operating ratio should get down to the low 70s. While this is obviously, the volume environment is a challenge. We still have tremendous opportunity at both price, the service to value equation, and our productivity piece. ", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Jim, do you think you could even go even lower given that you have seen how the system performed through this downdraft? ", "Jim Young", "Randy, I've said consistently, we could be a smaller railroad with much higher quality revenue. And we're humming in terms of asset turns and efficiency. You're seeing that to some extent right now. You have to have some volume, though. There's a point here we are running at 140,000 cars. We're resourced for 200,000. You have got to have some volume pickup. I believe it will pick up. The value proposition for railroads is there. And we're proving our we had a great example of how you prove that there. It says greater velocity drives efficiency. Better service drives efficiency. You can see it in our numbers this quarter. ", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Then I will flip it round and say, if the volumes went back up by 10,000 carloads or 20,000 carloads, could you give us some sense of what you think the torque would be to the EBIT line? ", "Jim Young", "You know, I used the term your print money, but you really do. When you look at the way what we're resourced for today, we can take on a pretty significant increase in volume and lever the bottom line. ", "Randy Cousins - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Edward Wolfe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody. ", "Jim Young", "Good morning, Ed. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Hey Rob, can you talk to the headcount a little bit? You average 45,000 FTEs? Where did you end the quarter? And how should we think about that going forward? ", "Rob Knight ", "Ed, I don't know if you caught some of the detail that Dennis gave in going through his, but we finished the quarter at a lower run rate than the average was for the full first quarter. So we're off to a start here that would suggest that at this level of volumes, that we're lower than that first quarter average. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "That was my question. What is that number, if you have it? ", "Rob Knight ", "40 just under 45,000. 44,700ish. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Directionally , are you done there? Or is it a process that you will expect more to happen in the second quarter, assuming no change in volumes right ", "Jim Young", "This is Jim. As I said, we are we have additional activities underway. The way this process works, you don't put a plan out and then stop. We have been watching our carloadings and volume. We're continuing. You're going to see more reductions if this volume then starts to turn around. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Fair enough. Can you talk a little about the Utah Colorado situation. Has anything come back? And do you have any visibility into the timing? I think you said, give or take, one third of your coal demand is a result of that. When should we see that third start to come back? ", "Jim Young", "You know, we've seen some comebacks, and we have seen some setbacks. We're still sitting there today with about, I would say, two and a half mines down. We've got one mine that is working at about half-tilt trying to work through some coal quality issues. We have one mine that is trying to get through some issues with MSHA. And one that's working diligently to get their coal line back up again. With two and a half mines down, they're anticipating that certainly during the second quarter everybody will be back up and running. We're rooting for them. We want to see that happen. But that's kind of the place where we see it right at the moment. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "And has it been basically that same level, give or take, that we've been at for the last three or five months? ", "Jim Young", "You know it has. It seems like, unfortunately, as one mine comes back, another one develops a problem. And we've been running about two and a half mines down since certainly since the beginning of the year. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "Hey, Jack, can you talk to, directionally, when you look relative to each other which end segments new pricing as you're in those negotiations right now. Where are you seeing relatively greater pressure? And where are you seeing relatively less pressure on pricing by segment? ", "Jack Koraleski", "You know, the place where the truck competition is the most intense is probably the places where we're seeing the greatest pressure. That certainly is understandable. Particularly, as we look across our book of business, you work through those ebbs and flows. We are not chasing business by any stretch of the imagination money. We are working very diligently with our customers to provide good value and to help them get through these tough economic conditions here. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "One last big picture for Jim. I understand your thoughts on the regulatory environment and the need to make sure that DC understands the importance of the railroads. We certainly heard that kind of talk from everybody. To you at UP, assuming that something has got to change. What do you see is the main issue that is out there? What is the focus do you think that the regulators are looking at, and that the rails are going to have to come to terms with settling? Or, negotiating through? Is it bottlenecks? Is it switching? Is it a whole pricing scheme? What do you see as the main issues here? ", "Jim Young", "Ed, from the customer perspective, you can call it what you want to, but it's about pricing. They call it competition to some extent. At the end of the day, you're looking at some kind of added perspective on pricing that's out there. My view of this thing, again the other side, the complicated thing is every member I talk to, including the STB agree that replacement costs are also an issue. And how you think through it long-term.", "So we've got a pretty big spread here. But all of them, again, even customers the representatives in Washington that are supporting new regulations want to see more investment in the railroad business. And I think there's, again, what I try to point out in this business when you look at cash flows and you look at return on capital, when you bring up replacement costs in. We don't have much room for there to be any error on new legislation. ", "Edward Wolfe - Wolfe Research", "I appreciate the time and the honesty. Thank you. ", "Jim Young", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Good morning, everybody. ", "Jim Young", "Good morning, Gary. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "I just wanted to ask a couple of questions. First, a quick cleanup one for Jack. Coal pricing was a little better than we thought. Was the Colorado Utah mix change. Is that lower revenue per carload, was that mix positive to lose some of that volume? ", "Jack Koraleski", "Gary, I think the biggest issue was the legacy renewals that we had last year. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Rob, could I ask you also to just clarify. You said the fuel tailwinds were $0.20. Was that net year-on-year? Or was that in the quarter added $0.20? ", "Rob Knight ", "That's year-over-year. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Could you just remind us what the year ago number was? ", "Rob Knight ", "About the same. You would have to look back at the transcript to get the exact . ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "The important thing is it did . ", "Rob Knight ", "Gary, just one comment. In that environment with rising fuel prices. I think net-net, last year was a similar number. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "No real impact on the actual earnings you created this quarter? ", "Rob Knight ", "No. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "As you look at some of these slides that Jack put together. You look at the utilization level in terms of where you think you are at 75%. The mention that inventory really isn't the issue, and that what's required is a real shift in demand. How much how far through the cost reduction process are you? And does it not make sense to go further because it really does feel like it's an end market demand issue unless things come snapping back, feels like the volume isn't going to be up to that 200,000 plus carload throughput you're capable of. ", "Jim Young", "We are not stopping. We are continuing, and don't hear from us that we believe 200,000 cars is in the near-term. Our assumption and what we're doing on the way we're running the business here, is this is number one, not much recovery, if any this year. And then a very slow recovery when you look out to the future. Could be wrong. We've got to protect that if we're wrong, we can respond. You are going to see continued progress on our cost numbers, efficiency, for the foreseeable future. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Is there a way, Jim, to think about how much of that you were able to get through in the first quarter? ", "Jim Young", "Well, Gary, long-term again. What Rob was talking about it was about 55% variable this first quarter. As things progress or don't progress, and it's neutral. That percentage starts to increase. We can get into a model here where we're closing yards. We are shutting down on weekends. There are a lot of things that you can start to deploy that we're actually looking at right now in terms of our cost structure. Again, mention. Keep in mind here, we're still seeing attrition. 3,000 to 4,000 employees a year which, again, we will manage as we're going forward here. Our capital spend we're not going to talk about next year. But again, where you look at, if you assume that this is a long haul. You're going to see substantially lower capital numbers going forward. ", "Rob Knight", "A couple of comments, Gary. One, as you know, if we thought we're not predicting this but if you thought volumes were going to stay down forever at low levels, you would start to take those deeper bust actions. So you've got to balance that with a long-term perspective. I wanted to come back to your first question to me, Gary, where you asked about fuel. I looked up your question about what happened last year. Last year, actually the lag hurt us in the first quarter. So when you look at year-over-year, there was a $0.20 all-in benefit to us in the first quarter this year versus last year. Last year versus the year before that, lag was a negative. So you've got lots of moving parts there. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "I guess all I'm trying to get at is, would you have earned anything less or more than $0.07? So the answer sounds like no. That's a clean number for the quarter. ", "Rob Knight ", " ", "Well, the other thing you have got to keep in mind is, offsetting volumes volumes were of course a much bigger drag on earnings. So while we got a benefit of fuel in quarter year-over-year, the bigger driver, of course, was volume. So we did a good job of overcoming. Fuel certainly helped us. Productivity and price were the other major players. So we were able to offset that rather significant volume drop. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Okay, thanks very much. ", "Jim Young", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups on the coal situation. First, I apologize if you mentioned this. How much of an impact over the past few weeks has weather been? We have seen a bit of a downleg in volumes there. How much of that is related to weather issues? ", "Jim Young", " ", "Chris, typically I would tell you that there was some impact associated with weather. But in this market with stockpiles being so high, I'm not sure I would say weather was a significant factor for us. ", "Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse", "So it's more fundamental than that. ", "Jim Young", "Yes. ", "Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse", "And then, have you seen last year folks were talking about a potential knock-on benefit for western rails in the coal business as the eastern guys were making a lot of money shipping stuff out of the East Coast ports. And maybe you were doing some backfilling with western coal. Has that reversed at all with the sharp dropoffs in exports out of the East? ", "Jim Young", "Well the enthusiasm has certainly gone out of the market. It has not, again, been a big factor for us. I think the bigger factor is just high stockpiles, energy consumption, electrical consumption being down. And then to some extent some of the mine issues that we have had in Colorado. ", "Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse", " ", "Okay, and then one quick one on the ag business. Did you see farmers holding inventory in the quarter because prices are low? Did that hurt the ag volumes? What is your outlook for that? ", "Jim Young", " ", "I think the bigger issue is that world supplies are so much stronger this year than last year was a record first quarter for us in the ag products business. World supplies were relatively weak. The dollar was weak, and so the US market was incredibly strong. It's very, very different the first quarter this year. World supplies are relatively strong. The dollar is higher value. We have been surprised that some of the Gulf exports have been stronger than what we have anticipated. We are watching pretty carefully. It looks like the soybean crops in Argentina may not be anywhere close to what the world had expected. That could actually provide greater export opportunity for us later in the year. That's where we see it right now. ", "Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse", " ", "Okay, thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning, gentlemen. ", "Jim Young", "Good morning, John. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "I had a question on your Streamline product which you mentioned a couple of times. Very high growth off a relatively small base providing door-to-door intermodal on your own line. Is that correct? Hello? ", "Jim Young", "Yes, that is correct, John. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Can that product peacefully coexist with your intermodal marketing company customers? Truckload customers, and so forth? It seems to me that in some ways you are beginning to compete with your customers? ", "Jack Koraleski", "Actually, the biggest users of our Streamline product are the intermodal marketing company. So we are not using it to aggressively go out and retail against our IMCs. The product is really focused at the IMC community. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Do you provide your own chassis and boxes into that system? How does that work? ", "Jack Koraleski", "We do. We use our EMP box fleet and chassis to provide the service. ", "Jim Young", "Hey John, there is another factor that you have from Streamline which is market intelligence. Is what's happening in that truck sector. And there are several values, when you look at it, long-term. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "I'm sure that is right. We have heard during the first quarter that there was an awful lot of bidding of intermodal packages by big shippers. Who ends up absorbing any price decreases that might get built into those bids? Does that all get absorbed by the IMCs? Does the UP have to absorb some of that as well? Or does it depend on the particular circumstance? ", "Jim Young", "It depends on the circumstance, and what the supply chain in some places it gets absorbed in the supply chain. It's difficult to say whether it is IMCs. I can just tell you from our price perspective, we are looking good. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Your service from, let's say, LA to Chicago which I guess is the biggest intermodal market out there. It looks like that has improved pretty dramatically over the last few years and maybe even in the last six months. How does that stack up on a reliability and perhaps a transit time basis relative to [Brand X]? ", "Jack Koraleski", "When you stratify it from a premium service down to the more general domestic product in the doublestack, it would be very, very competitive on all fronts now, John, when you look at transit times. With very little variability associated with each one of the services. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Have you maxed out on the service improvements there? Or as you continue to more slowly build out the Sunset Corridor project, is there still more upside to the service? ", "Jim Young", "Absolutely. We expect continuous improvement in every one of those lanes, and we have defined initiatives to make sure that happens. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "That's extremely interesting. Thank you. One last question. With fuel having dropped so dramatically and stabilized, is this a good time to consider laying in some hedges at this point? If you believe that the economy is going to recover and perhaps fuel prices recover along with the economic recovery. ", "Jim Young", "John, we are looking at it, but we are not pulling trigger. Right now, if you look at it, where you have the natural hedge with the fuel surcharge. Quite honestly, I think you are just rolling the dice. But we're taking a look at it. It is attractive right now. I'm not ready to pull the trigger yet. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "If the economy started to improve and credit conditions improved, would you be more inclined to perhaps take a risk there? ", "Jim Young", "We might. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "That's very helpful. Thank you very much. ", "Jim Young", "Okay. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose", "Hey guys. ", "Jim Young", "Good morning, Jason. ", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose", "Good morning. Quick question. You are talking about the stimulus at least showing up in Texas in some of the projects. Is that the only state that you are seeing action in? And could you give us a little bit more color about when that might be flowing through the system? ", "Jack Koraleski", "Jason, it's not the only one. It is one of the larger ones right now because of their extensive highway program. So there has actually been some real benefit there. But actually we actually have a team of people that are going through the stimulus bill with a fine-tooth comb, carving out what we think our opportunities for our customers. And then we are sitting down with our customers to make sure they are aware of them. And we've actually started in some of the construction projects, (inaudible) sand, gravel, some of those actually seeing some dollars flow our way because of that effort. But again, one of the biggest markets is Texas and that's one of our biggest opportunities. ", "Jim Young", "Although Jason, there is a lot of money flowing to California, also, on the stimulus plan, and I think there are obviously going to be opportunities for us there. ", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose", "That's very helpful. We have seen a lot, obviously in the press, regarding the problems Mexico has been having. We have seen some tariffs levied by the Mexican government to the US. But it appears to be more truck-like traffic. How is that impacting your business to and from Mexico? Or can you even parse all that out. ", "Jim Young", "It's, at the end of the day, in terms of our service metrics it's having no impact. There are issues at the border that have been well publicized that we are working cooperatively with the US government on. But in terms of our service, it's the economy. ", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose", "Okay. Fair enough. Rob, not to beat a dead horse on the lag benefit. The number you quoted was $0.20 compared to the prior year. In the quarter itself, what was fuel like for you? ", "Rob Knight ", "Jason, the year-over-year, all-in benefit to us with all of the moving parts, year-over-year it was about $0.20. ", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose", "Right. ", "Rob Knight ", "Lag was a I don't split it out exactly as you're asking but lag was a piece of that. And in looking forward as I said, with a stabilized assuming stabilized fuel prices, that lag would be the component that we would not anticipate as great in the second quarter. There would be year-over-year price differences, obviously, because last year was a peak price point in the second quarter on the cost of fuel itself. But the lag benefit should dissipate. ", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose", "Right, and you should get a headwind in 4Q. ", "Jim Young", "Which Q? ", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose", "4Q. ", "Rob Knight ", "Assuming everything was absolutely stable. ", "Jim Young", "You must have a forecast for fuel prices for us, Jason. ", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose", "I'm not forecasting at the fall like I did in 4Q '08, I will tell you that. ", "Jim Young", "Not a great time. ", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose", "Alright, fair enough. I appreciate the time, as always. ", "Jim Young", "Okay, Jason. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Arturo Vernon of MacQuarie Capital. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "Arturo Vernon - MacQuarie Capital", "Thanks. I guess most of my questions are answered. So let me drill a little bit deeper on coal. Over the last four weeks, we have seen what looked like very weak core volumes. And there has always been sort of an explanation in terms of blizzards at the PRB or Holy Week, or this or that. But it seems to me across the nation and it seems to be just unusually low. And I just wanted to press a point and see whether you see anything unusual out there? ", "Jim Young", "Arturo, it's demand. You are always going to have the issues weather we're in the spring season here. But, just fundamental demand is weak. We have a little bit of some issue with Colorado Utah production. We did I'll remind you we did lose some business on a legacy deal. But the real issue right now is just overall industrial demand. I think if I recall the numbers I think, electricity demand was down in the first quarter by about 1%-2%. I just don't see I think it's going to be soft all year. ", "Arturo Vernon - MacQuarie Capital", "Correct. We are seeing electricity demand it was down 7% for February. Coal-fire demand was about 14% in [deflation]. And March demand was also down. And these numbers just seem very, very low. And not at all consistent with what we might hope is an economy that is doing better. But they just seem so darn low for something so status as power demand that I was just wondering whether there is something else going on? ", "Jim Young", "You have got it right. Your question the issue you have right now is thinking long-term. When the economy turns, you are going to see electricity demand turn with it. ", "Arturo Vernon - MacQuarie Capital", "Alright. That was it. Thank you very much. ", "Jim Young", "Thank you. Okay. ", "Operator", "Our last question is coming from the line of David Feinberg with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question, sir. ", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", " ", "Good morning. Actually, I'm on the sales side, just to be clear. I know you are not calling for the bottom in the second half of the year, but I just wanted to hear your thoughts in terms of your conversations with customers in terms of which lines of your business you might expect to lead us out of the current recession? Do you think it would be consumer-led? Do you think it would be industrial? And along those same lines, there has been a lot of conversation about inventory destocking and then the potential restocking. If you are having any of those conversations with customers hearing about anyone getting to low levels of inventory. Clearly not on the coal side, but perhaps some of the other products? ", "Jim Young", "I think you have to ask the question what impact will the stimulus spend have? And to me, that says something about industrial demand. You look at, Jack, I think we were talking our lumber loadings right now are down almost 70% to the peak about three years ago. If there's any pickup toward the end other than some seasonal, like ag. If you think about some of those products, I think it's going to come on the industrial side. I don't see consumer spending picking up until you see some pickup on the industrial side because that is, obviously, jobs. And, some confidence there. I think in a very simple sense, that's about as good an outlook as we can see for the rest of the year. ", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "One specific question on intermodal. I missed part of the call, so I apologize if you addressed this. You talked about domestic growing faster than international. When we look at your actual overall carloads for the intermodal carloading for the quarter you grew at a slower rate than your closest competitor in the region. I'm trying to get a sense if that was driven by mix? Or if there was in fact also share loss that might have been occurring. Particularly on the international side, and what might have been driving that? ", "Jim Young", "We tend to be weighted a little bit heavier on the international side, and so that's an issue right from the get-go. The bigger you could look at our product itself and our total mix of business international was down 30%. Domestic down 9%. We're 60% international. So it hits us a little harder. We are still in the process of wrapping a contract, and that's a domestic contract that we lost last year. And that won't actually work its way completely through the system until probably June of this year. It's tailoring down here in the second quarter. But that is something that will lap here in the second quarter. So that will change the numbers somewhat. ", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Just to be clear. No contract issues on the international side. ", "Jim Young", "No. ", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Young for closing remarks. ", "Jim Young", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us on our call. I hope you heard from us today.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are user controlled. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific.", "James Young", "Good morning everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today in Omaha are Rob Knight our CFO, Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, and Dennis Duffy, Vice President, Operations.", "The second quarter, we're reporting earnings of $0.92 per share, a 10% decline versus 2008. Included in that number is approximately $0.14 per share from a land sale in Colorado. ", "Similar to the first quarter, the business environment over the last three months was extremely challenging with volumes down nearly 22%. Although we typically see car loading increases from the first and second quarter the seasonal growth was notably absent this year, in particular coal volumes were at their lowest level in nine years.", "Our operation ratio for the second quarter best at 77.3% a more than two point improvement from last year. Lower year over year fuel prices contributed to this performance but we also worked diligently to size our resources with demand and align spending priorities with today's economic reality.", "While aggressively reducing costs in the organization, we're also pursuing new business opportunities in markets benefit from UP's outstanding service product. Our safety performance, operating metrics and customer satisfaction are all at best ever levels.", "We ended the second quarter in a strong cash position with a very solid balance sheet. Although the economy appears to have stabilized over the last month or so, it's important to maintain financial flexibility in such uncertain time.", "With that, let me turn it over to Jack to walk you through the business groups.", "Jack Koraleski", "Good morning. I thought a good place to start this morning would be by taking a look at some of the market indicators that touch several of our business segments from a 47 point drop in steel capacity utilization to a 10% reduction in electrical generation by coal. I think these give you a pretty good indication of the broad impact this recession is having on our business.", "So let's take a look at how these economic undercurrents played out in our second quarter volume. Volume fell 22% in the second quarter as the weakness of the overall economy was reflected in declines across most of our businesses. Domestic intermodal is the only major market segment to post a gain.", "Lower fuel prices drove a significant decline in fuel surcharge revenue and along with a little negative mix, resulted in an 8% decline in average revenue per car even as our core price improvement stayed within our 5% to 6% range, reflecting the value proposition that our improved service brings to the market. The end result was a net year over year price decline for many of our customers.", "With both volume and average revenue per car down, total freight revenue declined 28% to $3.1 billion for the quarter. This out looked across each of our six businesses. ", "A 14% decline in ag products car loadings combined with an 8% decrease in average revenue per car, lowered revenue 21% for the quarter. Export demand for whole grains was well below last year as export shipments of feed and wheat both declined over 40%.", "Weak demand lowered domestic wheat shipments 30% while domestic feed volumes were down 13% due to the continued decline in animal inventory. The decline in animal feeding is also a significant driver of the reduction in the U.S. soybean crush and that led to a 15% drop in meals and oil shipment.", "On the positive side, two of the ethanol plants that were shut down by the [Varison] bankruptcy resumed production under new ownership and that contributed to a 4% growth in ethanol shipments for the quarter while DDG's grew 11%.", "Auto volumes fell 47% which combined with the 12% decline in average revenue per car resulted in a 54% reduction in revenue. Continued efforts by the manufacturers to align vehicle inventories with slumping sales levels along with the bankruptcy proceedings for Chrysler and GM led to plan shutdowns and production cuts across the industry. As a result our finished vehicle shipments declined 49% and our parts volumes were down 44%.", "In chemicals, 24% decline in revenue was the result of a 22% decrease in car loading and average revenue per car reduction of 2%. Fertilizer volumes fell 43% with weak overall demand and a sharp drop off in the Canadian potash moves, both the export and the domestic moves.", "The economy took its tool with a 23% decline in liquid and dry chemical shipments, a 22% drop in soda ash and an 11% fall off from plastics with strength in exports partially offset weak domestic demand.", "The slumping construction markets' impact on asphalt shipments and lower refinery utilization led to a 25% decline in petroleum volumes. With volumes down 16% and average revenue per car off 7%, our energy revenues declined 22%.", "Southern river basin tonnage declined 14% due to lower demand and the contract losses that we talked about last quarter. Reduced demand is a function of the recession's impact on industrial production above normal inventory levels from utility outages and to a limited degree, lower natural gas prices.", "In addition to soft demand, coal quality problems and production issues resulted in 366 fewer trains out of Colorado and Utah, 35% reduction in tonnage.", "Our industrial products volume was down 34% which combined with a 9% decrease in average revenue per car resulted in a 29% decline in revenue. Our steel shipments declined 64% as production ran at only 45% of capacity during the quarter, half of what it was a year ago and scrap steel shipments fell 50%.", "Housing starts ran 45% last year, so our lumber car loadings were off 41%. With weak demand for residential and commercial construction products, cement and stone volumes also dropped almost 30%.", "Non metallic mineral shipments decline 34%. The U.S. drilling rig counts are down by 50% from last year as natural gas prices remain low, reducing the demand for sand, pipe and the other minerals used in the drilling process. Last but not least, our paper volumes were down 24% for the quarter.", "Turning to intermodal, with intermodal volume and average revenue per unit down 18% and 6% respectively, revenue declined 23%. West coast imports drove the decline in international intermodal and the bright spot for the quarter was a 4% growth in our domestic segment where our capital investments, process improvements and service performance are supporting a wide variety of new truck competitive services.", "During the quarter our IMC business grew 26% and our streamlined subsidiary saw volume grow 60% with over 40% of that business coming from highway conversions.", "So what do we see for the second half? The economic outlook appears to have stabilized as Jim said, but the economy is still somewhat fragile. That being said, here's some of the opportunities that should produce a stronger run rate for us.", "The fall crops are looking pretty good right now and the harvest should lead to an increase in grain shipments and soybean processing. The drought impacted bean crop in Argentina looks like it could create some opportunity for U.S. meal exports, probably in the fourth quarter.", "Ethanol will also benefit from two additional former [Varisun] plants that will resume production here in the third quarter.", "With record low auto inventories, resolution of bankruptcies and new models should provide traction in the second half. Sales rates are strengthening with June coming in at 9.8 million vehicles, so that plus the government's Cash for Clunkers program, that's got some manufacturers actually adding to planned production schedules for the first time in 18 months.", "Chemicals will depend heavily on strengthening down stream markets. Liquid, dry and soda ash have both shown some modest improvement here recently and we expect them to kind of retain their current run rates. Fertilizer which has been disappointing both in the fall last year and spring this year could actually be an opportunity for us.", "For all the reasons I mentioned earlier, our coal volumes will likely be off as much as 10% from 2008's record level. We expect to see some seasonal strengthening of that run rate during this high demand summer months, but it will certainly be at lower levels than prior years. In fact if you look year over year, energy faces some of the toughest comps in the third quarter last and a record fourth quarter as well.", "Fuel production has been strengthening lately with at least three mills starting back up and an early July production rate topped 50% for the first time since late last year. We've also seen an increase in brown paper production with additional paper machines being brought back online so strengthening in steel and paper are hopeful signs, which if they are sustained, could also help drive some recovery in the industrial demand for electricity which would give us an additional coal boost.", "We're starting to see some stimulus project activity, but so far it's still hard for us to tell whether it's generating the incremental projects or just shifting the source of funding. ", "Intermodal, like energy and ag should see some seasonal strengthening although international volumes will continue to run softer than last year, but we look for continued growth in our domestic segment with the added business from Hub and the continued success in new services.", "Now we've seen some of these opportunities reflected already in the recent strengthening of our run rate. While we expect it to continue strengthen, I think the chart clearly shows that a year over year challenge that we face and we're going to continue to pace below last year.", "Let me wrap up with a look at customer satisfaction, in the second quarter again averaged a score of 87, matching last quarter's best ever performance and up four points from last year.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Dennis for the service performance report.", "Dennis Duffy", "Good morning. The priorities of the operating team are two-fold; run a safe, efficient volume variable railroad, and provide a high quality service product.", "Our second quarter results demonstrate we are performing well on both fronts. Let's start with service. These are four key service metrics; train speed at 27.4 mph, was a quarterly best and up 27% versus last year highlighting the progress we've made through our network management initiatives.", "Lower car load volume also helped to create a fluid network which we are leveraging into better asset productivity. Freight car utilization at 8.6 days between loads was another record quarterly rate. Despite fewer yard starts and reduced yard operations, terminal dwell time remained steady at 24.5 hours and matched last year's second quarter best level. ", "Consistent with the high customer satisfaction scores that Jack just showed, our internal service delivery index reached a best ever quarterly quarter at 93%. While enhancing service and efficiency, we also improved employee, customer and public safety, reducing incident rates, 16%, 13% and 12% respectively.", "Along with safety and service improvements, we continue to drive productivity gains across the board using organized, well defined processes. Let me share a couple of examples. UP's re-crew rate improved to 3.8% in the second quarter, a record performance, reducing overall staffing requirements and crew related costs.", "We reached another best ever in our fuel consumption rate, beating last year by 6% and setting all time records for the second quarter in the month of June. In the first half of '09, we saved over 35 million gallons of diesel fuel by better locomotive technology and increasing employee engagement with our fuel masters program.", "These efforts enhancing productivity and performance also create capacity for the future when volume returns. In the meantime however, we continue making the operation more volume variable.", "With second quarter gross ton miles down 22%, we were fully volume variable with our train starts and resources. We reduced train starts 25%, our working TE&Y train, engine and yard workforce 22%, and our road locomotives and inactive car fleet by 27% and 30% respectively.", "As volume in April and May fell below first quarter results, we increased furloughs and stored more assets. In June we recalled a few employees and brought back some assets into service as we saw some increased volumes and entered the peak period for vacations and summer maintenance.", "We're managing volume variability, keeping in focus our dual challenge of improving both productivity and service. I talked with you last quarter about how we're using our unified plan to shift work from smaller, less efficient yards to more efficient network yards. We reduced shifts and overtime at virtually all yards on our network to size the operation for current volumes.", "To date we have also closed or significantly reduced operations in 24 of UP's 114 principal yards. At the same time we achieved a dual goal of improving customer service, improving car load SDI's, service delivery index, by 10 points versus 2008. Also, industry spot and pull which captures our first and last interface with the customer reached an all time best of 97% on time in the second quarter. ", "Our productivity and performance initiatives are supported by our capital investments. We invest for safety, service, growth and productivity improvement. As we told you in April, we reduced our '09 capital plan by $200 million to the current outlook of $2.6 billion.", "The pie chart shows the split between the placement, spending and investment for productivity and growth. The engineering replacement spend was reduced by $88 million on the basis of better productivity and material prices, yet protects our long term goal of improving the infrastructure. Results are encouraging. Miles of main line slow orders are down 20% year over year, and we're beating our production plan, running at 111% of goals through the second quarter. ", "As we discussed before, the capital plan also includes $290 million for 125 new locomotives that include a three year purchase agreement. Although demand does not warrant these, we are putting them to good use in distribute pair operations, saving fuel and storing less efficient locomotives.", "The majority of the growth spend is on the Joliet and the Mobile facility plus select rifle shots where commercial opportunities such as wind energy, and a few high leverage productivity projects including signal upgrades along our central corridor.", "Looking forward through the second half, for the second half the operating team is committed to achieving further safety improvements, meeting the dual challenge of improving efficiency and service, progressing our summer capital programs with great productivity and being ready to leverage the upside potential when volume returns.", "With that, let me turn it over to Rob to talk about the numbers.", "Robert Knight", "Good morning. Let's start the second quarter financial discussion with a look at our summary income statement. The 22% fall off in car loadings and lower fuel surcharges drove a 28% year over year decline in operating revenue to $3.3 billion. ", "Second quarter operating expenses totaled $2.6 billion, down 30% from a year ago. The company's ongoing initiatives to increase efficiency and operating volume variable network played a major role in reducing quarterly costs. We also benefited in the second quarter from a 68% decline in fuel costs and a reduction in casualty expense.", "Another factor is that our 2008 expenses included over $20 million of higher costs associated with Oregon mud slide and Midwest flooding, so we have a favorable expense comparison versus last year. Lower year over year operating revenue and expenses combined to produce $751 million in second quarter operating income, a 19% decrease. ", "Second quarter freight revenue fell 28% to $3.1 billion as a result of lower car loadings and reduced fuel surcharge revenue. Interestingly, this quarterly revenue amount is more than $100 million below first quarter levels, further highlighting the depth of the current economic recession.", "Average revenue per car declined 8% in the quarter as we continue to pass on the benefit of lower fuel prices to our customers in the form of reduced fuel surcharges. In fact, fuel surcharge revenue declined more than $500 million in the quarter.", "Our pricing efforts in the second quarter yielded results just north of 5%. For the full year, we are still comfortable with our outlook of 5% to 6% core pricing gains. ", "The mix of business in the quarter was slightly negative as a result of significant declines in carloads of finished vehicles, lumber and steel. ", "Turning now to the quarterly expenses, as I walk through each category, I'll highlight the impact of both volume and efficiency. Starting with compensation and benefits, this expense category declined $125 million in the quarter of 11% to $976 million. Second quarter work force levels were 10% lower year over year as we continue to furlough employees and reduce overall employment through attrition and management actions.", "In fact, UP's average quarterly employment levels are the lowest since the Southern Pacific merger. Strong network fluidity and lower car load volumes, enabled us to make these reductions and drove a 1% decline in average compensation per employee.", "Also contributing to the decrease was lower expense related to our incentive program. Offsetting a portion of this productivity was the 2008 union wage increase of 4% and effective July 1, 2009 the union wage increase becomes 4.5%. For the remainder of 2009, we will continue to manage work force levels with demand.", "Second quarter purchase services and materials expense declined 21% to $391 million. On the purchase services side, lower volumes and increased operating efficiency contributed to both decreased contract service expense as well as reduced crew transportation and lodging. ", "From a materials standpoint, we performed fewer locomotive repairs in the quarter as a result of lower volumes and having a significant portion of our fleet in storage. This category also benefited from the favorable year over year comparison to last year's mud slides and flooding.", "Turning to fuel, this chart illustrates the impact of changing fuel prices. The solid blue line shows our actual monthly fuel price. The dashed black line is our monthly fuel price lag by two months to illustrate our fuel surcharge programs.", "The areas shaded in red with the solid line is above the dash line, represents periods where the lag in our surcharge had a negative earnings impact. Conversely, the areas shaded in green, shows the periods when fuel prices declined and earnings benefited from the surcharge lag.", "For the second quarter of 2009 the impact within the quarter was negligible. Although we had a slightly positive lag to start the quarter, the lag turned negative as diesel fuel prices increased in May and June.", "Looking at fuel on a year over year basis however, the surcharge lag added about $0.20 per share to our second quarter 2009 earnings. As you can see from the chart fuel prices spiked in the second quarter of 2008 where a significant earnings headwind was experienced in that quarter.", "As we look ahead, it's hard to say what might actually happen with fuel prices. It's a little like trying to predict the economy, but if you assume prices remain at current levels through the end of 2009 which is around $1.90 per gallon, you get some idea of  how fuel might impact earnings. Assuming fuel prices don't fluctuate much, the earnings impact within the third and fourth quarters is minimal. ", "The more meaningful perspective is how the year over year comparison is likely to shape up. For the third quarter of 2008 it was about a wash as prices receded in the back half of the quarter. But in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a substantial tail wind to earnings from the surcharge lag.", "In addition to the lag impact of fuel, we consumed 84 million fewer gallons of diesel fuel in the second quarter. A portion of the lower consumption relates to the 22% reduction in second quarter gross ton miles which saved us approximately $234 million. Improved consumption was also the result of our ongoing efforts to conserve fuel which saved $65 million in the quarter.", "As Dennis mentioned, the operating team is having great success reducing fuel consumption with more to come. ", "Second quarter equipment and other rents expense declined $31 million in the quarter or 9% to $307 million. Similar to what we've experienced over the last couple of quarters, lower volumes of industrial products and intermodal are driving down short term car rent. Better asset utilization as fewer leased assets reduced quarterly expense as well.", "Other expense declined $46 million in the quarter to $153 million. The primary driver of the decline was a semi-annual actuarial study completed in the quarter which reduced expenses by $38 million year over year. Our strong safety record and lower estimated settlement cost contributed to the lower expense.", "In addition, expenses for employee travel, utilities and other miscellaneous expenses decreased in the quarter. Offsetting a portion of these reductions were higher property taxes and an increased provision for bad debt expense.", "Turning now to Slide 30, we've summarized our expense performance in relationship to the quarterly volume decline. The casualty expense reduction and last year's weather related expenses helped our overall expense performance in the second quarter, but with volumes remaining at historically low levels, we took actions throughout the quarter to align resources with demand.", "Reduced work force levels, stored locomotives and freight cars, as well as ongoing efficiency gains, combined to achieve a roughly 70% expense variability rate in the second quarter. Of course, this analysis of variability normalizes for the year over year change in fuel prices.", "Our ability to operate in a volume variable manner contributed significantly to achieving a record second quarter operating ratio of 77.3%, 2.3 point of improvement versus last  year. Lower year over year fuel prices, pricing gains and the casualty reduction also played a role and helped offset the impact of lower car load volumes.", "Taking a look at the full income statement, second quarter other income totaled $135 million driven by the $116 million pre tax gain on the land sale to the Colorado Regional Transportation District. Excluding that one time item, other income in the quarter was $19 million, equal to last year's amount.", "Quarterly interest expense increased $22 million or 17% to $150 million. Higher year over year debt levels drove the increase, although offset somewhat by lower effective interest rates in the second quarter of 2009.", "Second quarter income tax expense declined 8% or $23 million to $268 million as a result of lower quarterly earnings. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.4%, a point higher than the year ago rate. We expect the full year effective tax rate to be around 27%.", "Net income in the second quarter declined 12% to $468 million for reported earnings of $0.92 per share. However if you exclude the RGD land deal that we talked about, adjusted second quarter net income would be $396 million or earnings of $0.78 per share, a 24% quarterly decrease.", "Slide 33 shows our quarter end cash position and current debt levels. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, we are continuing to maintain a strong liquidity position as the recessionary economic environment lingers and business volumes remain low. Adjusted debt levels increased moderately to $14.8 billion, reflecting new debt issuances over the past year.", "As we think about the remainder of 2009, what happens with the economy will clearly be the driver of our earnings. Our current seven day car loads are running about $150,000 a roughly 19% decrease versus last year. ", "Although this is slightly better than what we experienced in the first half of 2009, as you heard from Jack, volume levels will remain challenged for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned earlier, at current fuel prices, we will likely lose the positive fuel tailwind we enjoyed in the firs and second quarters. In total, lower fuel prices and the resulting surcharge lag added about $0.40 to earnings in the first half of 2009 versus last year.", "While low business volumes and fuel will pressure our second half results versus last year, the entire UP team had done a great job playing the hand that the economy has dealt us. We're not using the excuse of a slow economy to stop improving our overall profitability, and we produced solid results despite the challenges.", "Through our own ongoing commitment to pricing, strong operating efficiency and focuses efforts to right size the organization, we will continue to increase UP's future earnings power. ", "With that, let me turn it back to Jim.", "James Young", "Although we expect it will be some time before the economy recovers, our business levels as we've said, appear to have bottomed out with a few opportunities for improvement as we move into the back half of the year. This feeling is supported by the latest round of economic indicators which seems to support the view that the economic is stabilized.", "With that in mind, we're managing the company under the assumption of a continued low volume environment, advancing efficiency efforts while at the same time providing excellent service to our customers.", "We're fully prepared to handle more business when the demand returns. We're running the network very well which positions us to generate stronger volume leverage going forward. ", "Talking more strategically for a moment, we're well aware of the activity in Washington regarding rail regulation. Because of the potentially negative consequence that this increased government regulation could bring to our industry, we're spending a great deal of time on Capital Hill. ", "We're talking to legislators and educating them about the benefits of rail. Everyone understands and agrees that rail needs to play a vital role in solving America's transportation infrastructure problem. We're optimistic that the leaders in D.C. also understand the importance of a financially, healthy rail industry.", "Union Pacific and the entire industry is uniquely suited to help our nation's economy grow and compete in the 21st century. Our fuel efficient and environmentally friendly and safe transportation products, help customers compete globally, saves tax payer dollars, and as our business grows, creates good paying U.S. jobs.", "While our company is challenged by these unprecedented economic times, we remain confident in our long term strategy which is still firmly in place, focused on improving safety, increasing efficiency and delivering price driven value for our customers which will enable growing financial returns.", "With that, let's open it up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "I wonder if you could comment on your Mexican business. How has it been doing? How is the trans border stuff performing? Has it been hit harder than your domestic?", "Jack Koraleski", "It probably has been a little bit hit harder. It's down about 30%, 32% something like that in the quarter, and of course as you would expect a big portion of our largest piece of business typically would be the automotive franchise. So with the turmoil there for both Chrysler and General Motors, that kind of hit it pretty hard.", "On a brighter side, a lot of new business opportunities coming out of Mexico. We've increased our sales force a tad there in Mexico and we're going after those new business opportunities so we're feeling good about that.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Do you see the Mexican business coming back fairly strong in the second half or do you see your Mexican business lagging your domestic U.S.?", "Jack Koraleski", "I hadn't given that too much thought, but I'm thinking it's probably going to mirror what we'll see on the U.S. I think the automotive industry coming back will help us to some extent, and I think actually we should see a little bit improved grain movement between the U.S. and Mexico. So I think it will probably mirror what we'll see on the U.S. side.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "You mentioned bad debt. How big a number was it and I believe you have some legacy auto contracts. Did the bankruptcies of a couple of the auto related companies create an opportunity to maybe get at those contracts maybe earlier than otherwise would have been the case?", "Robert Knight", "As I mentioned, we increased the bad debt reserve and it was relatively small, $2 million to $3 million in the quarter, so not a material item.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "And what about the legacy business? Is there a chance to get at that auto legacy business a little sooner as a consequence of the insolvencies?", "James Young", "Keep in mind, Chrysler is already a new contract when we look at it, and General Motors has just a short time left. We're in discussions over it.", "Randy Cousins \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "In terms of cash balances, you're sitting with about $1.6 billion in cash. Do you have a sense of what you think of as a suitable level and if the cash continues to build, do you put to towards share buy back?", "James Young", "Obviously $1.7 billion is not the going run rate we think in normal times. We talked yesterday that $400 million kind of range would be better. We're being conservative now, till we see the economy. We're in a good position.", "Our share purchase program is off the table right now, but when we start to see this thing turn around, we'll consider what's best for shareholders.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Seidl \u2013 Dahlman Rose.", "Jason Seidl \u2013 Dahlman Rose", "Let's talk about pricing a little bit. You mentioned just north of 5% and you're sticking with your guidance for the full year. Can you talk about what you're signing contracts at right now currently and also what percentage of you 2010 business is locked up?", "Jack Koraleski", "I'm not going to talk about individual contracts for next year other than we're seeing real value we're providing in the market. We are getting price for our service. You start looking at some of these quarters, I won't get into the specific customer, but his cycle times, when they looked at it, pretty book of business had improved 20% to 25%. They signed a very significant value of that to them internally, obviously inventory carrying costs. ", "In this case they owned equipment. We were able to get a very good price in that new contract that's been consistent with where we're going. Again, it's hard to look out to next year and where anything is going to be but even if you look at where we're at today in this very tough environment, I'm confident that 5% to 5% range that we look at will be there for this year.", "Jason Seidl \u2013 Dahlman Rose", "What percent of next year is already signed up? Forget percentage wise in terms of the prices you've got, but what percentage is already booked?", "Jack Koraleski", "We're not going to get into that right now.", "Jason Seidl \u2013 Dahlman Rose", "Can you expand a little bit on some of your new intermodal offerings, some of the contacts initiative that we talk to are sort of very excited about some of them and you've got a lot of people being able to sell this versus the truck load business because of your cycle times. Can you elaborate what services were launched in the quarter?", "Jack Koraleski", "Northern California down to Texas was the market that we had exited we brought back. We opened seven lanes of refrigerated boxes including now an interline program with Norfolk Southern that's gaining a lot of attention.", "The improved service on our Blue Streak network with the Norfolk Southern is also doing quite well. Service levels just all over the network are really doing well.", "James Young", "We're not done here. Keep in mind if you go back three or four years ago, we walked away from many of these markets. When you recall we were struggling in terms of our business volumes and so we've been consciously and slowly looking at new markets to re-enter. You've got to prove yourself. This isn't a business that you open it up one day and it's full. You've got to prove your service offering.", "We've got a good track record that many customers are willing to one, reconsider UP or two, are looking to ship on a railroad for the first time. So we're pretty excited about it. As you saw, our only book of business that grew in the quarter was domestic intermodal, and that directly relates to our strategic approach on the domestic market.", "Jason Seidl \u2013 Dahlman Rose", "As you look towards service levels, how are they going to be impacted by the eventual turn around in the economy without putting a time frame on it. Do you think you could maintain levels near where you have them at now with business coming back?", "Jack Koraleski", "We're running 28 mph right now. My goal is when we run 100,000 cars, we're running 28 mph.", "Jason Seidl \u2013 Dahlman Rose", "Could you refresh my memory when those ethanol plants you talked about actually came back on line? Was it late in the quarter or early?", "James Young", "They were kind of mid quarter and then the third one just came back up not, so it's up and running, and the fourth one I'm not completely when it's coming back.", "Jason Seidl \u2013 Dahlman Rose", "The third one came back in July then.", "James Young", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase.", "Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "I wanted to see if you could give some comments on the coal perspective. I think what we heard from CCS last week when they were talking about coal, that I think some of the utilities have contractual obligations with the coal producer and that would help their income lines in the third quarter maybe look a little better than they did in second quarter. I'm wondering if that would affect your customer base at all and help your coal volumes in third quarter and also just in terms of stock piles, if you can give us a sense of where they are.", "James Young", "The latest information we have is that stock piles are down a tad from their record high levels in May, but still substantially higher than what they were a year ago, maybe to the tune of 16% to 17% greater than where they were a year ago. I'm not as bullish on the idea that the customer commitments are going to drive business volume.", "What we're seeing right now is just the burn rate from the summer season is much higher so we're seeing customers put more transits back in service again. We've seen our volumes kind of pick up here and we would expect that that would continue through the September maybe even October. It kind of depends on the weather, but that's what we see right now.", "Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "Does that give you a little better year over year performance in coal looking forward or is that just kind of normal seasonality and the year over year looks similar.", "James Young", "It's normal seasonality but it's going to be well below last year's pace. We set records in the third and fourth quarter last year, and we're no where even close to that this year.", "Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "I think there's some degree of optimism about a turn in the industrial economy, the ideal that they've been producing below actual consumption levels, taking inventories down and you would be a pretty lean level on inventories for at least part of your customer base, but it seems like there's a lot of caution about the outlook for volumes. Are you seeing that with steel customers, automotive, with chemicals? Is that something that you would see and lead you to be optimistic or do you really just don't have any sense when the volumes will get better in the near term?", "James Young", "Our optimism is one of it looks like things have stabilized. Jack had indicated there are a couple of areas. Steel is up. We're going to reopen I think two or three plants we talked about. But we're a long ways to go to get back in that market where I'm going to feel good about it.", "So again, you have to stabilize at some point before we can actually turn things around and we'll see. I think the stimulus money, I think most people were pretty up, maybe overly optimistic on its affect on the timing. What we see with some of our local groups we work with, most of them aren't going to see real dollars spent until the later part of the year.,", "And if you think about the timing it takes to prove it to Feds, get it to the State and get it out of bids, that's probably realistic. So I could say there's some optimism of balance there, but we're going to be pretty cautious about it.", "I would tell you we're in a position to handle it. If this thing turns around with the assets we have in place and the leverage, we will lever very nice in the bottom line with just a little tick in volume.", "Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "When you look at the third quarter earnings, seasonally, they're higher than second. That's kind of normal, but I'm wondering given some of the comments you've got, do you think the expectation of a pretty big ramp in third quarter versus second, does that seem realistic in terms of a $1.07 versus the $0.78?", "James Young", "You can get a wide range on the numbers right now. You're going to see our car loadings. They are picking up some. I can get a pretty wide range on the numbers and really the bottom line there is going to be the volume. Again, we will lever very nicely any volume impact. I'm just going to be real optimistic right now. ", "You'll see it. Watch the car load numbers that are produced every week, and if you see those start to move, you're going to see we'll leverage very nicely.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew Troy \u2013 Citigroup.", "Matthew Troy \u2013 Citigroup", "I was wondering, tactically and strategically how you can resource or re-resource the network? You went into this downturn a little bit over resources. You've done a great job in terms of right sizing tactically whether its deploying locomotives or cars back on line or getting furloughed employees back. If you could just help us in terms of getting comfortable that there's a plan in place to accommodate whatever volume ramp we might see. How do you look at that versus past cycles? How are you confident that it's going to look better?", "Dennis Duffy", "That's a great opportunity for us. Everyone one of the resources that we have whether it be locomotive, freight cars, or personnel on the operating craft side have recall plans that we have for 30, 60, 90 days that we can do. And we think right now, we've got at least 10% to 15% capacity in our existing network.", "But I can assure you that we spend a large amount of time looking at the cyclicality of our business and how can we respond to that immediately so there are very well defined plans, well rehearsed in terms of how we recall these resources back. We are not going to get caught short again and we've not going to overspend in making that protection too abundant either.", "James Young", "The other thing to think about here is you've got the fixed infrastructure. As Dennis said, the fixed infrastructure is probably a 200,000 car load per week number in terms of what's built in there, is the variable operating resources as Dennis said is 10% to 15%. But there are other things.", "We introduced that alternative work program where we keep employees at least current on training. Their benefits are paid. That has worked very well for us as we start to call them back. I will tell you, I am very confident on the processes we put in place and our ability to respond.", "I'm going to respond in the context I want to handle that volume and provide great service. That is what we will lean to here as we think about recovery. We're ready to handle it when it comes back.", "Matthew Troy \u2013 Citigroup", "Relating to the safety and casualty adjustment in the second quarter of $38 million, was that a true up and look back for prior periods like we saw with CSX in the east in their second quarter. I'm trying to get a sense of the economic impact allocated between the relevant period. Is that a true up or is that a run rate savings going forward? How should we think about the net year over year savings in impact going forward in contribution to the other expense line?", "Robert Knight", "It's a look back. It's a look at over a number of years looking back. We do get an ongoing benefit in the neighborhood of $2 million to $3 million kind of number, but the adjustment in the actuarial study that we took in the second quarter was primarily a look back over the last several years.", "", "Matthew Troy \u2013 Citigroup", "And that $2 million to $3 million you just mentioned, that was per quarter going forward?", "Robert Knight", "Rough numbers, yes.", "Matthew Troy \u2013 Citigroup", "On agricultural, obviously the export story there is impacting everyone in the industry. I'm just wondering in terms of looking for signs of a turn in ag, are there one, two or three things that you can point to that should lead us out of this downturn, be it exports, be it on the fertilizer side? Just in terms of barometers, what do your ag guys watch for in terms of a more meaningful turn away from what would be more macro driven weakness in the industrial segments.", "James Young", "Here's what we monitor. The first thing is the global crop situation. That plays a big role. Last year we had record setting performance because the rest of the crops around the world had not fared all that well and the U.S. dollar was weaker. So with some strength back in the dollar, not to be mercenary about this, but the good news was when we see the drought in Argentina and we see their soybean crop substantially reduced, that says our soybean harvest and going forward in the fourth quarter you should see some opportunity from that hitting the U.S. market, just from an overall supply situation.", "The second thing we look at is animal counts. We've been surprised that the animal count across the U.S. has not increased more. It's still below year ago levels and at some point in time we do expect that to pick up. When that does, that will be another trigger point for us.", "The third is the quality of the crops and right now the crop quality in the U.S. look excellent. There was an increase in corn acreage year over year and also an increase in soybean acreage. So that should help us as well.", "And then the last thing we look at in particular is wheat, and in the UP service territory, the wheat crop did pretty well, and all we need now is for some demand to start drawing that into the market and we should see that turn around.

We're hearing some more about increased price competition, price discounting and that some of the customers are looking at truck as a, going back to truck from rail and sort of counter from what we've been hearing from you. I just want to hear your updates on how you're looking at the trucking competition and whether you think it's sustainable and how you're approaching it.", "James Young", "We've been consistent here that the intermodal market and trucks have been pretty tough for half a year or more. Many cases, when you look at the pricing, it's not sustainable, and the question we have to decide is whether we're going to chase it. In several cases, we haven't.", "So really it does vary by quarter and the markets we're in. What we're focused in is the long term plan, building those products that are in there, working with customers, helping them understand the long term perspective of our market. But I will tell you, I'm not going to chase it.", "Our pricing is still on the positive side when you look at taking fuel off the table, but it one that you have to decide kind of tactical versus strategic discussion with the customer.", "Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Moving still on the pricing but more on the regulatory side, can you give us an update on what you're hearing out of Washington, sort of gone radio silent there as they're working away on the bill and just any update on the talks that you've had, if they're going well and just your view on regulatory environment going into the six to twelve months.", "James Young", "Our industry as you know, and all the CEO's are very active back on the Hill. Obviously I think there are other priorities on the current administrations agenda besides new regulations for us, but we're not going to let our guard down. We continue to be aggressive in terms of working with Chairman Rockefeller's staff, in terms of understanding the long term values of our industry and the economic realities.", "I'll tell you a good example that I think is important. We focus a lot of the potential new regulation side, but you have Chairman Rockefeller and Senator Lautenberg who wrote a bill proposal to shift 10% of the business moving on the highways to the railroads. Now they weren't specific about how that actually is accomplished, but I think it gives you a little insight in terms of where they're thinking is on the value of rail in the United States.", "We've made it very clear on what I think where the points of real conflict are and what's needed for this industry to continue to invest. Again, I can't predict. You may see something come out of the House this week on anti-trust, but at the end of the day, this things is going to handled over on the Senate as a starting point and we'll see what happens.", "Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Do you expect it in the next six months, three months out of the Senate?", "James Young", "That's a tough call. One thing, you can never assume anything when it comes to DC. Our view is we're going to be very active.

At the end of your presentation you gave a bit of outlook for how things were trending. You talked a bit about fuel. I just want to understand. Were you trying to suggest that earnings deceleration would continue at a faster pace because of the $0.40 comp in fuel that you are not going to have that you had in the first half?", "Robert Knight", "I was trying to make clear what the impact of fuel has been on us year to date, but yes, look last year's third and fourth quarters where there was a dramatic difference in terms of how fuel played out in the third and fourth quarter of last year versus the first and second quarter of last year.", "So when you look year over year, assuming the fuel stays about where it is, you come up with a different equation in the back half than you did in the first half assuming fuel prices stay where they are, which nobody knows what's going to happen with fuel.", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Looking at volumes down over 20% and the record level unemployment levels, you highlighted you're not nervous that you're overdoing it on the employee side, but however if volumes stay at these levels, is there more that you can continue to pull out on the cost side if you stay at this static volume level let's say for the next six months?", "James Young", "We are not going to see the kind of drop you had what we've seen the last six months. But we're trying to gauge and we're being a little conservative here in terms of when this thing will come back. But if we continue to sit at this kind of a level, you'll see more cost come out. You're not going to match though what you saw before, but clearly we've got kind of a their three, four and five kind of look at what we would do on our spending if this thing remains flat.", "", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Have you been approached by any of the unions to say on that 4.5% wage increase job's are more important than getting that wage increase? Is that something that you've had discussions at all?", "James Young", "No. Where we're spending our time, town halls all over the railroad. We get folks in the room there and we talk about what's going on. It's very clear in talking with our local chairman, the general chairman and the presidents of our unions, I just had lunch in DC with one of our presidents. They're all over jobs.", "They're focused on what do we need to do in terms of turning the economy around. I get that from whether you're the head of the union or you just were hired three or four years ago. They understand the importance of safety. They understand service, what it means in terms of putting products in the marketplace.", "We have not had any discussions about that trade off at this point. That will be part of when you get into the next round of negotiations.

Coal quality with some limestone deposits that's in the coal seam and just a variety of very tough issues for them to deal with.", "You couple that with weak demand, and it creates the scenario that we have today. We're running basically eight trains a day or so out of Colorado/Utah. That's down from what I would say our record setting levels of 12 or 13 trains a day. So it's just down. It's pretty soft.", "They're working to solve those problems. I think they're working to get them resolves as quickly as possible moving forward. If the demand were a lot stronger, they probably would work a little harder, maybe spend a little more to get them resolved more quickly, but they're doing the best they can with the economic scenario they have.", "There still is ample demand for Colorado and Utah coal and sooner or later they'll get it behind them and we'll be moving forward there.", "[Alison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse]", "Is it still about 15% of your coal business or has that declined?", "Jack Koraleski", "I would say that's roughly, it's not too far different from that because the whole coal business has declined as well.", "[Alison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse]", "In terms of natural gas, I know it's about $3.50 which is a little bit  more than the competitive PRB price, but even still have you seen any switching of utilities on the margin?", "Jack Koraleski", "In our serve territory, the natural gas capability to switch is not prevalent. Most of the utilities that we serve, they have peaking capacity in natural gas but the majority of them don't have the wholesale ability to switch over. However, given that you have the grid out there, that doesn't completely insulate us from low natural gas prices because other organizations and utilities that do consult to the grid depending on the pricing.", "James Young", "I think the switch has already happened. You look at the price of natural gas, we had some stories that you had natural gas at $2.00 in some of the markets so any meaningful shift has already happened.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I had a couple of questions on the domestic intermodal side which looked very good for you. Congratulations by the way on winning that Hub business. That's a huge win. How much of the Hub business was included in the second quarter? I got the impression that that was spooling up during the quarter. What would domestic intermodal have been say without Hub and what would it have been in terms of growth if Hub had been running full bore with you the entire quarter?", "James Young", "If you look at that domestic market, Hub started to come into play towards the end of June. Hub has actually been part of our business for a long time and their core business was growing in terms of what they already had on us, so it did have an impact in terms of the core. I don't want to get into specific numbers.", "I think you have to keep in mind though in this market, we've won some and we've lost some if you look at the year over year comps and again, I feel good about our domestic strategy that I think right now is just really starting to play. This is one that there's much more upside for us going forward.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "But fair to say that that growth rate with Hub in the fold for the entirety of the second half should be a little higher in the second half?", "James Young", "That's right.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "You talked about your streamline product and how that has been growing very nicely for you, about 40% if I heard it correctly, that growth is coming from the highway. The other 60%, is that coming from the other western railroad or is that coming from other IMC's or other folks that operate on your system?", "James Young", "What it is, it's coming a lot of it from our own system where the IMC's are moving from a ramp to ramp product to the door to door product that streamline offers, so it's a value add for the product that we offer and also a margin enhancement for us. So that's good business for us.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Is it fair to say that as you've done such a great job of variabilizing your cost structure that you've been able to take the 25% or 30% of the least efficient locomotives, the least efficient freight cars, maybe those that are closest to needing major maintenance and laying those up and at the same time essential furloughing your least experienced or least productive workers, is it possible to be that good about eliminating the most inefficient assets and people?", "Jack Koraleski", "I think that's an investment. We did put down our older, most inefficient locomotives. We did do the same thing with the freight cars as much as possible and obviously [audio break] under all three of those scenarios the employees, the locomotives and the freight cars.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "So there won't be a big lump of maintenance expense when you take them out of storage?", "Jack Koraleski", "Will not. ", "Robert Knight", "Just one more time, I just want to clarify, some of that 60% did come off the competition. Clearly Hub is a good customer of streamline as well so I don't want to imply that none of it came from them, but I just don\u2019t think that was a major drawing factor of the 60%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "You talked about pricing, real pricing up around 5% which is down from 6% you were talking about last quarter. Can you talk about in the three months which segments that are relatively feeling a big weaker and which one are holding up a big firmer?", "James Young", "I would be careful about interpreting the 5% that is a weakening price. You also have a mix impact in there. When you think about a good example, is in the auto business where we've been able to renegotiate some legacy contracts, the book of business is off 50%. When you think about coal is another one that you've got a book of business that has still outstanding and some large legacy contracts that have been renegotiated in that business, and that business is all down.", "So I would look at that more in the context of again, we said 5% to 6% for the year. We had a little bit stronger first quarter, but I'm in the bottom end of the range for the second quarter. I think the majority of that again is mix. ", "Jack Koraleski", "That is not what I would describe as same store sales. It is in fact what you would say is the actual price realization for us. So to the extent the business didn't move, we weren't able to capture any price off of it. There really hasn't been any substantive change in our pricing environment between the first and second quarter. ", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Can you talk a little bit about the timing as you understand it for the regulatory bill? I think you said the anti-trust could come in a week in the House, but the Senate Regulatory bill, any sense that there's a chance that still happens before August recess or at this point is this a, if it's going to come, it's at the end of the year at this point?", "James Young", "Nothing will happen before the August recess. I would tell you one other thing with this bill. What is also important to understand about this bill, the members on the Hill that are involved with this discussion understand the significance of this thing, and it is complicated and we made it very clear that if you get it wrong, capital is going the other way.", "I don't see a focus here to get something done quickly. If something happens, they want to get it right because they do understand the consequence. So nothing will happen before August. I think there's one sign that said nothing happens this year, but we can't take that assumption. We're going to be very active working our story.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Slide 17 where you talk about bringing back some of the resources and the April/May peaks for furloughs and locomotives stored, if I look at these numbers, you're bringing back 17% of your heads and 9.5% of your loco's and 15% of your cars. Yet when I look at '08, there really wasn't much on an absolute basis change in volume between third and second quarter. What's your assumption here of peak and if it doesn't happen, is it easy to put this stuff back into the closet?", "James Young", "What you have to be careful of again, is you don't want to, calling employees back, it's tough obviously to furlough people here. It's real personal in terms of what it means to them and you have to be careful about calling them back and then cutting them off again. So we want to make certain we see some trends here. ", "But if this thing turns back around and starts going south on us, we will put more assets back in storage and we'll unfortunately be forced to furlough employees.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Why, other than just historically there's a seasonal pick up, we didn't see it last year. Obviously you think there's going to be a seasonal pick up this year that you're doing that. Is that a safe assumption?", "Robert Knight", "Keep in mind, you also have attrition here. We're going to lose this year, I just looked at the latest numbers in terms of our attrition rate, and we're going to lose 3,000 employees this year. Now that's down from where we're running, but we do have real attrition that we've got to keep up and then again, the seven day run rate when you look at car loading has picked up. We're running about 151 or so right now. We were at 143.", "My gut says you will see some seasonal, the more traditional seasonal pick up with a peak, but we watch it very closely.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "You said before that volumes are the key because you can leverage the year. Where do you think you can start to leverage volumes in terms of margin? Is it minus 15? Is it minus 10? Where is kind of directionally you start to see some of that leverage?", "James Young", "Any time right now, even the current train network we're running has capacity in terms of train size, so you think about, again coal would be different because coal is in train starts, although you're not adding any capacity there, so it's immediate.", "When you look at the first 5% to 10% of bump in business volume, you are not going to see much in terms of adding new train starts into our network. So I think it's pretty significant and pretty immediate when it starts to turn.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "On cash before, you said you've got $1.7 billion and $400 million's more of a normal level. Does that $1.7 billion keep going up? Is there some level, $2.2 billion or is there some debt that you have in mind that you want to make sure you have covered for out a couple of years from now? Where do we think that you stop growing the cash and start to deploy it in other ways?", "James Young", "We'll continue to grow cash as the business earns income here. I don't see us doing any incremental addition of debt in terms of what's out there. Again, we're being cautious. I just don't have a visibility. You can see forecasts that say this is stable, but this is just kind of a point before you turn down even more, that's out here.", "We're being cautious and again, I want to put our company in a good position that when it does turn around, we've got some great opportunity to return value to shareholders.", "We have about $500 million of debt due next year, so that's all part of the equation.", "Edward Wolfe \u2013 Wolfe Research", "But it sounds like if we're modeling for the end of the year, we're going to assume that you're going to continue to generate some free cash and that $1.7 billion goes up, not a substantial change to your dividend or start to repurchase stock at this point.", "James Young", "We could. But again, it's a function of where the business is going here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I wanted to clarify something first, and obviously you're not going to talk about the specifics, but somebody had asked you about GM and whether the bankruptcy allowed you to open that process. My understanding would be they could open it, but you couldn't, and all I'm asking is should we expect that there's going to be some resolution on that business or is it just as likely you'll keep operating under the old contract until it renews?", "James Young", "Your assessment is right. They have the option. We didn't of changing the contract. There's a short time left. I'm not going to get into the details. We're in discussions right now and quite honestly with the service, products and the value we're providing, they adopted the old contract is the point, but there's a pretty short time left on it.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "It's the way it was. There's nothing special that the bankruptcy creates.", "James Young", "That's right.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "You talked a lot about the unified plan and the ability to better leverage volumes and there have been a lot of questions. When you were answering Ed a second ago, you mentioned attrition and we can see that the head count, as we see the volume start to pick up as it is, depicted in one of your charts here, should we expect that head count could continue to go down on a net basis? Is it going to flat? Or are you going to need to take some heads back on period to period on a net basis, net of attrition in order to handle that volume growth?", "James Young", "We've got some actions underway right now that we're reducing employment that doesn't show on these numbers here. Again when you say when it turns back up, how quickly will we respond, we'll lever very nice, but we're going to have to make the decision is this a sustainable trend.", "That will be the decision point in terms of calling employees back. I'm not quite certain where that head count number will go. Quite honestly, I hope it starts to move up as we continue to grow aggressively over the next several years.", "If you look at it, it will be in the areas where you see the direct connection to volume like our train and engine crews. That is where the biggest reductions come in play and it's over a quarter period, it's directly related to volume.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Everybody is talking, no doubt you are aware of the auto production outlook as we move from the second to the third quarter, presumably that's going to have a significant impact on your volumes and I assume network wide, you talk about capacity network wide but it obviously matters what you've got in specific lanes. Presumably you're fully prepared to handle whatever you're expecting from that production increase.", "James Young", "The thing about these numbers, the first half of the year production was at about 3.8 million units if I recall, 3.5 million out there. I think the forecast of about 10 million a year is about right, so if you think about that, we know inventories are at I think the lowest point they've ever been, about 64 days right now. They were running as high as 118. The 118 isn't realistic, but they're clearly very low.", "So you have the potential for the numbers to pick up quite nicely on the auto. We are very well positioned. We handled, we're the largest carrier of finished vehicles in the west. We're very well positioned to handle the pick up. I'm looking forward to it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "On the follow up with the autos, inbound and outbound, does that matter for you, because I think of you as mostly a destination railroad. So is it really about production not about what you would send into plants?", "James Young", "No, it would be balanced for us.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you Mr. Young you may begin.", "Jim Young", "Good morning everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. With me in Omaha today are Dennis Duffy, Vice Chairman Operations; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales and Rob Knight our CFO.", "We are starting off 2010 with a record quarterly performance as earnings grew 40% to a first quarter record of $1.01 per share. This includes the one time cost impact of the announced CSXI deal which totaled roughly $0.06 per share. Rob will give you more details on that when he discusses the financials. ", "A major contributor to the year-over-year gain was a 13% volume increase, our first quarter of color growth in two years. Jack will provide commentary on the volume picture but we clearly saw a pick up in demand across the networks. ", "For example, although coming off of a low base in 2009, steel, lumber, soda ash and fertilizer all experienced solid quarterly growth. Equally important to our quarterly results was the volume leverage we generated by running a safe service focused efficient operation. We\u2019re utilizing our capital investments, technology and productivity enhancements to move increased car loadings with fewer resources. ", "Strong service levels continued to deliver value for our customers which also supported our pricing gain and attracted new customers to the rail road. The net results of increased volumes, solid pricing and operating efficiency was a record first quarter operating ratio of 75.1. This achievement is consistent with our commitment to significant leverage any volume growth in our network. Operating income was also a record totaling $988 million up 47% for 2009. ", "Our record financial performance enabled us to achieve strong free cash flow after dividends in the first quarter further demonstrating the power of our operating leverage and the great UP franchise. Now we\u2019ll hear from Jack with a discussion about our volume growth. Jack.", "Jack Koraleski", "Thanks Jim and good morning. Over the more stable economy of the first quarter marked the long awaited swing back to volume growth. Against last year\u2019s recession impacted business levels, our volume grew 13% with five of our six businesses posting gains. Energy was slightly down, they were the lone exception. Average revenue per car increased 3% with core pricing gains of 3.5% and higher fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by some negative mix that was largely the result of volume growth in intermodal. ", "Negative pricing in intermodal, that\u2019s the lingering effect of domestic legacy contracts that have now been replaced. Once again impacted overall price performance and produced what will be our weakest reported price gains in 2010. ", "The growth in volume and increased revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up to 16% to $3.8 billion with each of the six businesses posting revenue gains. So, let\u2019s take a more detailed look at each of the six groups. ", "Agricultural products revenue grew 10% as 8% growth in volume combined with a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. Whole grain export car loads increased 28% led by a near doubling of weak shipments through gulf ports. ", "The continued impact of damaged South American crops last year boosted soybean export 13% and also drove a 48% increase in soybean meal exports. Our ethanol shipments grew 28% as the federal mandate ramped up and California blending increased and DDGs also saw a continued growth with volumes up 15% in the quarter. ", "Automotive revenue increased 88% as a 21% improvement in average revenue per car combined with a solid increase in shipments. Volume was up 56% from last year when the auto industry was struggling with high inventory levels of sales swamps. Average revenue per car received a boost from the renewal of the last auto\u2019s legacy contract as well as some other contract increases. ", "Increased production and sales was reflected in growth for all manufacturers with vehicle shipments increasing 67% and our parts volume growing 42%. Our chemical revenue grew 14% as volume climbed 13% and average revenue per car was up 2%. Fertilizer and industrial chemicals were the primary drivers of the volume growth although car loadings were up in all major chemical markets. ", "After a couple of disappointing seasons, our fertilizer shipments grew 39% with a 126% increase in export potash leading the way. Compared to a weak first quarter a year ago, a modest increase in demand coupled with a more balanced inventory level position produced a 14% increase in our industrial chemicals business. Soda ash volume grew 19% as both export and domestic demand increased and LPG shipments were up 16% and plastic volumes were up 4%. ", "Turning to energy, while stronger economic activity increased electrical demand, it wasn\u2019t enough to drive year-over-year growth in energy where volume decreased a little less than 1%. However a 6% improvement in average revenue per car produced a 5% increase in revenue. ", "The trend out of the Powder River Basin was encouraging posting year-over-year increases in February and March after running below 2009 levels in January but finished up 1% for the quarter. ", "Our Colorado Utah tonnage was down 4% as high stockpiles curtailed shipments for a few large customers. Franchise productivity improvements continued in both markets and if you flip to the next slide we can talk for a second about coal stockpiles. ", "Drawn on this graph is the monthly coal stockpile data for the Powder River Basin. The grey line shows you normal stock in terms of normal days of burn, the blue line shows how stocks are actually tracking. The most recent data available is for February, but you can see how sharply the severe winter weather cut in the coal stock piles, dropping the Powder River Basin stockpiles to 59 days of burn, compared to what would be a more normal level of 52 days.", "I suspect that when the March report comes out its going to show continued improvement as well. A more stable economy, a pick up in industrial production particularly in energy sensitive industries like steel, improvement in the export market for coal as world wide demand increases and the reduction of stockpiles are all encouraging things for the coal business so, if we have normal summer burn our coal business could actually strengthen as the year progresses.", "Industrial products line grew 9%; it\u2019s the first year-over-year growth since the first quarter of 2006. Revenue grew 10% as the volume increased combined with a 1% improvement in average revenue per car.", "Average revenue per car was impacted by the significant growth of our uranium tailing shipment for the department of energy. The volume for the short home (inaudible) was 450%. Improvement in the automotive industry and energy drilling as well as restocking by metal service centers pushed steel mill capacity utilization to 68% in the first quarter that was up from 43% a year-ago. ", "That improvement was reflected in a 28% increase in our steel and scrap business. Increased drilling activity also helped drive a 20% increase in non-metallic minerals with growth and frac sand shipments. And although our lumber business grew 8%, we are still looking for some real significant signs of recovery in our cement, rock businesses both of which declined largely a reflection of a lack of demand tight credit and shrinking spate in the local budgets.", "Intermodal revenue increased 25% as a 21% increase in volume combined with a 4% improvement and average revenue per unit. While Intermodal pricing should improve as new contracts take affect, I would remind you that the benefits of the new Pacer arrangement are phased in between and the original contract expiration.", "Further more some of that benefit will be in the form of field surcharge recovery which still results an improved margins, but it\u2019s not reflected in our core price calculations. ", "Improved consumer demand and inventory restocking led to a 12% increase in our international Intermodal volume. Domestic Intermodal volume grew 33% aided not only by an improved economy, but also by business converted from the highway and our year-over-year growth with hub.", "Our streamline subsidiary door-to-door product grew 77% in volume with almost half of that growth coming of highway conversions. Also during the quarter we announced the creation of the new UMAX container program. The new UMAXs program replaces our own CSXI legacy contract and it strengthens our domestic Intermodal value proposition, better positioning us for highway conversions and other growth opportunity.", "Like the Pacer deal last fall, the CSXI renegotiation was pulled ahead and with its completion there are no remaining legacy contract in our domestic Intermodal business. This is significant because it allows us to work directly with the majority of our Intermodal customers.", "The new UMAXs program provides those customers with access to more than 20,000 containers an expanded market reach across North America with over 600 service lanes supported by faster and more frequent train schedule.", "Our Intermodal franchise positions us to offer the most complete coverage of domestic Intermodal lanes and our strategic investments and process improvements that support excellent service allowed us to improve our transit time in 60 of those lanes during the first quarter. And the good news is it\u2019s only going to get better when we open our new Joliet Intermodal Terminal late this summer. The new facility will increase both of our international and domestic capacity, it will improve our efficiency and it will further strengthen our Intermodal value proposition.", "Without question customers have come to except the higher level performance from us, so we are pleased that customer satisfaction stayed strong, coming in at 87, matching last years score. As we continue to offer strong value proposition underpinned by excellent service and backed up with strategic investment from a strong customer relationship.", "So let me wrap up with a look at where we are. A more stable economy has produced a stronger run rate so far this year an external forecast predict continued year-over-year improvement in key areas like industrial production, imports and exports. Since the beginning of the year, the outlook for vehicle sales has strengthened but the projection for housing starts has weakened a bit. Taken all together, we think the economy is going to stay the course as we looked ahead of the second quarter and beyond to the rest of the year.", "A continued slow recovery will likely keep our business stronger than last year, but below the levels that we\u2019ve seen in the past. It is a look at some of the drivers that we see for each of our businesses in the second quarter.", "In Ag the South American grain harvest and normal seasonality have already begun to soften grain export volumes. Although, we may see some recovery later in the year with the North American harvest exports could run below 2009 level.", "Providing some offset the federal mandate and increased lending in California should drive continued growth in ethanol and DDTs. Obviously the second quarter last year was a tough time for the automotive industry, expectations this year are for significantly stronger production and sales levels and the external forecast projects strengthening through the year. Apart from the anticipated seasonal slow down of fertilizer, demand in most of our chemical market should remain stable.", "In terms of energy, increased industrial production should spur further recovery in electrical demand and our Southern Powder River Basin business will also benefit from the startup of the new unit at San Antonio during the quarter. Colorado, Utah volumes were expected to be about flat for the year, but should post growth against last year\u2019s coal quality in production challenge second quarter.", "Continued strength in the auto industry and drilling activity should translate in to growth and steel and non-metallic minerals and we are watching for some signs [in-light] from that construction area as we move into the second quarter seasonal ramp up in construction activity.", "International Intermodal should benefit from stronger imports while a strong value proposition should continue to attract highway conversions to our domestic Intermodal business. We\u2019ll also benefit from the shift of the hub business.", "Our strong value proposition not just in domestic Intermodal but across to all our businesses will allow us to take advantage of the opportunities that arise if the economy that recovers. Stronger economy should be good for pricing which along with excellent service, strategic investments and innovative product offerings will drive a stronger price plan over the balance of 2010. Although it\u2019s still early in the quarter we\u2019ve already seen price up about a point versus our first quarter.", "So with that, I will turn it over to Dennis for the operations report.", "Dennis Duffy", "", "Thank you, Jack and good morning. With volume growth starting to return, we operated a safe and efficient [rail road] that continue to deliver the quality service customers have come to expect from Union Pacific.", "First quarter 2010 metrics illustrate that performance. Starting with safety, both employee incidents and great crossing accidents were at record first quarter lows. Our internal service measure, the service delivering index at 89 is close to last year\u2019s record mark of 92. In fact, we tightened the windows around our service commitments beginning in the second quarter of last. So the 89 was achieved against a higher standard.", "On a more apples-to-apples basis, we would have been closer to 93 without the reset. This illustrates how as we take variability out of the network, we are holding ourselves to a more rigorous service standard and delivering consistently better service to our customers.", "Although velocity decline mile per hour year-over-year much of the decline related to the winter weather and an aggressive engineering program on the Sunset Corridor and across large portions of our single track rail rod in South.", "Importantly running a safe fluid rail road generated excellent operating leverage in the quarter as evidenced by volumes increasing 13%, while through freight train starts increased only 1% and yard and local starts actually decreased 7%.", "Our core track infrastructure is built to handle a 190,000 to 200,000 weekly car loads. So with today\u2019s volume running around 170, we have capacity for growth. We are also creating capacity to an evergreen approach to improvement. A key fundamental component of this is inventory management.", "First quarter freight car inventory declined 3% versus 2009. With this productivity improvement, we handled 235,000 more carloads in first quarter 2010 with nearly 9,000 fewer cars versus first Q\u201909. Train design efforts are helping us maximum throughput across our network, this work in combination with greater utilization of locomotive technologies such as distributed pair, enable us a significantly increased train link.", "For example, in the first quarter we achieved a 15% increase in our Intermodal train size saving roughly 900 Intermodal train starts. Locomotive technology also drives better productivity and lower fuel consumption. Additionally our engineers play a key role in conservation. Through our fuel masters\u2019 unlimited program which shares some of the company\u2019s cost savings with the employees, we are seeing continuous improvements in our consumption rate again, setting us a new first quarter record.", "We are also ready with the necessary working resources to handle the growth. We have recalled about 1600 employees so far in 2010 bringing furloughs down to around 2800 remaining. Our retention rate remains nearly 90%, which is very good considering most of these folks haven\u2019t worked for a year or more.", "We are anxious to get everyone back to work and are even using voluntary transfers to relocate employees to areas where additional crew resources are needed. This is a win-win, saving hiring and training cost for the company and putting a paycheck back in the hand\u2019s of the employee sooner. We anticipate additional engineer training and transfers in 2010, the extent to which will depend on volume return. While it has placed some locomotives and freight cars back in the service, we still have a good supply and storage. Beyond having the available resources, improved utilization is essential to delivering on our volume leverage opportunities. We are seeing productivity gains across the board; in particular freight car utilization was a first quarter best.", "So, going forward the key for the operating team continues to be agility. We have to be prepared to meet and beat customer expectations regardless of what happens with volumes. To that end, we follow the principles that have driven our improvement, focusing on safety, hardening the infrastructure thus reducing operational variability. Efficiently leveraging the network volume and delivering excellent service and creating value for our customers.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob to discuss the financial.", "Rob Knight", "Thank you Dennis and good morning. Before we go through UP\u2019s record first quarter earning, I\u2019d like to make everyone aware that the 2009 fact book is now available on the UP website under the Investor\u2019s tab. So please feel free to check that out.", "Slide 21 summarizes our first quarter results with operating revenues up 16% to nearly $4 billion, driven by double digital volume growth, increased fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gain. Operating expenses increased only 8% to $3 billion demonstrating great operating leverage. This leverage is especially evident when you consider the fact that higher year-over-year diesel fuel prices accounted for nearly 75% of our quarterly cost increases.", "Quarterly operating expenses also included a one time payment of $45 million to CSXI as part of the transactions restructure our Intermodal transportation relationship. As Jim mentioned, that payment subtracted roughly $0.06 from our quarterly earnings.", "Operating income totaled $988 million, a first quarter record and a gain of 47%. First quarter other income was only $1 million as we incurred roughly $16 million in early debt redemption cost plus higher environmental remediation charges.", "Interest expense at a $155 million, was up $14 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher debt levels. Our effective tax rate was 38.1%, 3.6 points above the 2009 first quarter rate of 34.5%. You might recall that last year\u2019s rate was lower as a result of a newly enacted state tax legislation.", "Taken together, first quarter net income totaled $516 million or earnings of a $1.1 per share, up 43% and 40% respectively. On the pricing front, we are reporting core pricing gains of roughly 3.5% in the first quarter. That number includes about a 0.5 point related to the year-over-year increase in RCAF fuel escalators. We recognized that consistent core price improvements are critical to improving our overall returns and we are committed to that task. Importantly, with the economy turning around, our continued strong service offerings as well as the re-pricing of some major legacy deals, we believe pricing will improve over the balance of the year.", "In other words, we believe the first quarter of 2010 price numbers should mark the low price point for the year. Our legacy renewals also provide us with better fuel cost recovery. And although this does not contribute to our core price numbers, it definitely improves our Intermodal and overall company margins.", "Let\u2019s look at the expense side now, starting with compensation of benefits at $1.1 billion in the first quarter, a 1% decrease versus 2009. Although car load volumes grew nearly 13% in the first quarter, UP\u2019s work force levels actually decreased 6% versus 2009.", "As you might recall, volumes fell off very quickly last year, leaving us to play catch up as we worked to align our resource levels with demands. To now put this in perspective, slide 23 shows both first quarters seven day car load volumes as well as our employment levels between 2008 and 2010.", "With volumes [off] 10% over the two year period, employment levels were down 14% as we increased productivity in all areas of the business. Labor productivity can be measured several ways, but the common measure of gross tonne miles per employee increased an impressive 16% in the first quarter of 2010, versus 2009. Offsetting some of our productivity gains where higher cost per employee driven primarily as a result of the agreement side of last year\u2019s 4.5% wage increase, as well as health and welfare inflation. ", "Going forward, we\u2019ll continue recalling employees if need to back fill attrition and handle business volumes. ", "As we\u2019ve said before however, this won\u2019t be on a one-for-one basis as we expect offset some of those needs with continued productivity. First quarter fuel expense increased 51% to $583 million as a result of higher year-over-year diesel fuel prices and increased tonnage moving across the network. First quarter prices averaged $2.16 per gallon, a 43% increase from 2009\u2019s $1.51 per gallon. Although increased diesel fuel prices added a $171 million to our quarterly expenses, we offset roughly $14 million through greater fuel efficiency.", "Turning now to slide 25, we summarize the year-over-year change in three of our expense categories. Starting on the left with purchase services and material, this expense increased 7% in the quarter to $432 million.", "Increased volumes led to greater contract service expense in areas such as Intermodal ramp operations and purchased transportation. Offsetting a portion of that increase was less material usage associated with fewer locomotive and break car repairs. We should also notice slight change in the amounts reported as purchase services and materials expense for 2008 and 2009.", "As we reported in the 10-K we changed our accounting policy for rail grinding cost in the first quarter of 2010 from a capitalization to a direct expense method. We will show this change with respectively in the quarterly earnings releases and SEC filing.", "The annual impact of this change is very small affecting only a couple of expense lines and totaling a penny for all of 2009, but there are some minor differences, so please be aware of this change.", "Equipments and other rents expense decreased $27 million or 9% in the quarter. As discussed previously $22 million of the decline is associated with the locomotive leases restructured in the second quarter of 2009. Expenses were also lower in the quarter as a result of fewer leased break cars and Intermodal containers. We did however see an increase in short term car rents versus last year as both automotive and Intermodal volumes made very strong gain.", "Other expenses grew $20 million in the first quarter to $246 million an increase of 9% the biggest driver was the $45 million one time payment to CSXI.", "Reduced quarterly personal injury expenses related to our ongoing safety improvement and lower bad debt expense helped offset a portion of this increase. With volumes running higher year-over-year and excluding the $45 million payment, the run-rate for other expense should be more in the neighborhood of $200 million per quarter. The key first quarter\u2019s storyline was the tremendous operating leverage generated from the volume growth, slide 26 illustrates that and while our business volumes increased 13% in the first quarter, operating expenses only increase 2%", "On this chart we have normalized 2010 operating expenses to reflect the year-over-year change in diesel fuel prices which illustrates that we are only about 20% expense variable in the quarter.", "In 2009, we were about 80% variable in a declining volume environment, but as volumes increased you want to reverse that map rolling volumes faster than cost and we did just that. Although, we are very early in the recovery cycle, we are clearly enjoying the leverage associated with adding cars to existing trains improving the utilization of our locomotive and freight car fleet as well as increasing employee productivity", "Going forward it will be a challenge to add volumes faster than cost, cost will necessarily comeback in a linear fashion, so we\u2019ll likely see some step functions depending on how the volume actually returns. Over all though, we believe that roughly a third of the cost reductions that we achieved last year should be permanent. The strong efficiency illustrated by our operating expense variability is also reflected in non-operating ratio which was a first quarter record at 75.1%. We achieved 5.3 points of improvement versus 2009 more than offsetting the headwind created by higher diesel fuel prices and the CSXI payment which together impacted our operating ratio by about four point.", "The ongoing efforts of project operating ratio strong volume leverage, continued operating efficiency and core pricing gains all contributed to this record mark. Solid quarterly financials carried over to both our cash flows and balance sheet. On the cash side we achieved free cash flow after dividends of $426 million. This is a substantial increase versus 2009 and is principally driven by improved first quarter earnings, lower cash tax payments versus 2009 and the timing of payments for some capital equipment.", "We also continue to have a very strong balance sheet with our adjusted debts to Cap solidly in the mid-40s range. This balance sheet metrics supports our goals of maintaining a solid investment of great credit ratings.", "With a record first quarter in the books, let\u2019s look ahead at the second quarter. The primary driver of our quarterly earnings will be volumes, and as Jack discussed earlier, we are seeing stronger year-over-year demand. As you recall the second quarter 2009 was the low point for our seven day car loading volumes which came in a little over a 143,000.", "Although we aren\u2019t giving specific volume guidance, at the current run rate we could again see double digit gains. With the continued car load growth, we would expect to generate solid volume leverage. The comparison will get tougher however, as we move through the year. ", "We took cost out of the systems throughout 2009, becoming more and more aggressive as the months passed without any economic improvement. We\u2019ll also face the added pressure of agreement, wage and benefit inflation. As we previously discussed health and welfare expenses are driving cost higher in 2010. We don\u2019t accept this as an excuse however and we will continue to work to offset a portion of this increase through productivity. ", "Another cost increase that we are already seeing is higher diesel fuel prices which pressures margins and impacts earnings as a result of the surcharge lag. Our current spot price is running over $2.40 per gallon which compares to an average price of only $1.57 per gallon in the second quarter of last year.", "Because of the inflationary pressures we faced, as well as need to increase shareholder returns pricing continues to maintain a focus within our organization. As we mentioned earlier, core pricing is expected to improve for the year as we achieve real pricing gains plus the benefit of legacy renewals and excellent service. ", "Assuming the economy continues to grow, we look forward to building of our first quarter momentum with continued operating ratio improvement, as well as solid cash generation from the business. Those gains support our balanced approach of deploying cash which involves investing in the business as warranted by returns, maintaining a strong balance sheet and rewarding our shareholder. ", "With that, let me turn it back to Jim. ", "Jim Young", "Thanks, Rob. What a difference year mix. A year ago everyone was trying to find the bottom and we were focused on idling assets and reducing operating cost. Despite some lingering uncertainty, we are feeling better today about our opportunities for volume growth in a more stable economy.", "The visibility to a future demand is still a little crowded however, so we need to remain flexible, be ready to act if the economy losses theme. We have significant volume leverage remaining in the systems so we look forward to additional growth.", "[Good] operations are key to delivering upon our customer commitments, customers rely on the strong value proposition of UP\u2019s service product allowing us to extend our supply chain reach and compete in new markets. We are also continuing to make the critical long term capital investments that support the company\u2019s growth strategy. ", "Union Pacific is becoming more profitable producing stronger cash flows and generating higher finance returns which will enable us to reward shareholders for their investment in the great UP franchise.", "With that, its time to open it up for your questions. ", "", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Young. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. In the interest of time and in order to allow as many as possible to ask their question please limit yourself to one question with a follow-up. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Matt Troy of Citigroup. Please ask your question.", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Dig a little bit deeper on the Intermodal side, there is obviously a lot of moving parts and pieces, but I wanted to be clear on the IMAX renegotiation, what kind of implications that would have wither for volumes revenues and ultimately operating profit.

Obviously the mix the timing of legacy agreements, the length, you know as Jack had indicated our legacy deals are spread out over time, I also if you think about what Jack said we are already running about a point higher so far in April in terms of what we saw first quarter. You know the question really becomes one also what you assume on volume as volume and demand pick up should create even stronger pricing environment.", "Jack you want to add to that?", "Jack Koraleski", "", "You know Matt its kind of like three things that I think you can kind of think about number one is we have said in the past that the Pacer contract basically increases overtime and this will be the last quarter that we have negative pricing in our Intermodal franchise, so that\u2019s a good thing for us so, secondly some of our legacy contracts including the largest which was an automotive deal was a mid year or mid quarter first quarter transaction so there is greater strength moving forward from that the third thing is as we look to the pricing environment for the future we have tariff business in place right now that is still reflective of last years software economic terms those will change over time as we go through the year with continued strengthening in the economy. So we are feeling pretty good about what our price picture looks like going forward.", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "I would imagine you are somewhere 80% or so negotiated for 2010, so you do have very fairly clear line of sight visibility.", "Jack Koraleski", "Yeah for the contract deals, but you know for the tariffs we have greater flexibility and already as we start to see truck capacity tighten and truck pricing going up those kinds of things, we are back at the table looking for opportunity.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan please go ahead with your question.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Yeah good morning and just a great performance on the cost side very impressive. Let\u2019s see the operating leverage is very good and it sounds like you have more room and the network to continue to handle volume growth with limited additional expense. I was wondering if you could give a sense of average train length in the car load network and average train length in the intermodal network and then a sense of kind of what the potential train length would be just giving a sense of some more sense of the operating leverage?", "Jim Young", "Duff, do you want to take that one?", "Dennis Duffy", "Tom the average train length that we have is for the entire system; all of our network is about 5500 that we grew about over 10% year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. Our biggest growth obviously within the intermodal side, Jack showed you a 21% growth. We added about 20 boxes per train there and with a very minimal [fuselage] as you saw we only added a 1% [fuselage] there against the 13% volume. And when we look at our overall network, we think that we have another 10% to 15% on train length on a macro prospective, obviously that would differ by commodity groups somewhat, but we think over all that\u2019s a pretty safe measure for us and would have to look at the corridors where the growth occurs, but we still see a good upside for our leverage opportunity on train length", "Jim Young", "Hey Tom. And I would be careful though on taking the first quarter and extrapolating it out. You know as Rob said this is more of an exponential relationship delinear if you start moving up towards that theoretical capacity we have in our system. We get a little more cost pressure, but we clearly have, we have got Dennis who have shown about 1300 - 1400 locomotives in storage. We have got 2600 employees per load. We are in some location starting to do some hiring, but again, I think first quarter is outstanding we hold our operating team to a high standard in terms of what they do the next three quarters but again you will get a little cost pressures as you move up that curve ", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JPMorgan", "What in Intermodal specifically Dennis can you tell me how many containers per train you were on average in the first quarter?", "Dennis Duffy", "About a 160.", "Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JPMorgan", "160 Okay and that I guess in theory that number could go up to what like 260 or 270", "Rob Knight", "", "You are close right around 250 range, Tom.

Jim you have talked about in the past how overtime, longer period of time your goal is to offset half of the inflation through productivity.

We got a lot of excess capacity right now as with idle assets that\u2019s my definition of productivity that\u2019s not great productivity when you look at asset utilization what\u2019s stored here. But if you get back into where may be the normal run rate on volumes that we were looking at long term. I think assuming offsetting half of inflation is not unreasonable.

And then on the intermodal side, can you talk a little bit about how if at all, your strategy changes with regard to not only pricing but just how you go to market. I mean you significantly cleaned up the Legacy deals; you\u2019ve really structured the market in a way that it advantages you in a major fashion. So how does that change how you market your product?", "Jack Koraleski", "", "It really allows us to deal now directly with the IMC community. We are not changing our strategy, we are not pulling away from the IMC\u2019s and in fact what we want to do is offer an even better product offering for them and give them greater flexibility of choice whether they want to go ramp-to-ramp or whether they want to use our streamline door-to-door product which gives them a lot more flexibility working with their customers.

Is it fair to look sequentially as we think about some of that leverage as we worked through the rest of the year and maybe you can help us with some of the puts and takes on a cost side that would have restrained that leverage as you walked from Q4 to Q1?", "Jim Young", "", "Chris, I\u2019d be careful about making a comparison of fourth quarter. You get a lot of variables in there that are out here. I know we had I guess PI.

Please go ahead with your question.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "", "Jim, if we think back, one of the questions we often get is if we look at some of the rail\u2019s prior experiences in the last upturn in 2003, service levels obviously deteriorated. So what do you think are the right metrics for us to watch to kind of as a canary in the coal mine to look at things. We saw the train speed slow a little bit. But that maybe is there something to worry about so I know exactly how to think about the public metrics what you would watch if your were us to make sure that service levels are being maintained?", "Jim Young", "", "There is a good correlation of velocity. Its really is, we went backward a little bit first quarter but big part of that was weather and we\u2019re back up to 27 miles an hour right now through April, so we are feeling pretty good but the metrics you get there were reported AR velocity, the inventory levels and cars and dwell time are pretty good indicators of the health of our network.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay and then if I can ask you a question about inventories. If we look at the merchandise customers you serve, have you seen much in the way of restocking from them already? Is that already past or are we still to see that come as the economy picks up? How do you feel their inventories are now?", "Jim Young", "You know Bill they\u2019ve been really balanced. We have seen some inventory replenishment but I think the general mood and attitude right now with the bulk of our merchandise customers is they are going to rely more on kind of a just-in-time inventory process, they are being cautious about placing orders and overstocking so there\u2019s a good management flow around watching the balance between inventory and sales. If you look at the inventory sales ratios right now, they are looking really good and even with the up tick in volume, we don\u2019t see a lot of inventory build that I would be concerned about in terms of overhang. I think it\u2019s pretty much been demand driven which is really healthy.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "And then just one on buybacks, what are the metrics you watch for when you get comfortable adding those back. Thank you.", "Jim Young", "Well as I committed every quarter in here our job\u2019s here\u2019s to create a financial performance and the cash flow that put us in a good position and you know we said as we feel better about the business this year, we\u2019re going to take a hard look at what we do next in terms of returning cash for shareholders.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Flower with Macquarie (inaudible) Please go ahead with your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Jim I wonder if you can give us some flavor on what\u2019s going on in Washington.

I would view right now that its not in the top of the priority list when you look at all the other challenges that DC is working with but you can never underestimate the potential here and as we\u2019ve said consistently, we are engaged and helping. Every member I talk to you go back, they value rail. It\u2019s interesting when you sit across from a member who thinks about the realm of value that brings in terms of jobs the value it brings in terms of energy efficiency.

If that\u2019s a give and take, we\u2019ll add at one or two every once in a while depending on where we see the growth but the overall productivity levels are up, as I said across the board, particularly in our manifest yards.", "Jim Young", "If you think about our industrial products business which is primarily manifest, we\u2019re still substantial. Its first time we\u2019ve had growth in several years, we\u2019re still substantially below the kind of peak levels we saw back in \u201807. Let me give you an example, lumber loadings in the peak second quarter 2005 we loaded in that peak quarter about 63,000 loads of lumber. We hit a bottom here last year about 18.

Just wondering what you might have gathered from that and any new information with that test. And sort of as a follow on to that there was some public backlash against the length of that train, I think they were misunderstanding the whole reason you are doing it but what are your impediments. You mentioned service is a limiting factor, is there any other limiting factors like things like this kind of public opinion thing.", "Dennis Duffy", "Well Walter it\u2019s actually a proof of concept. We had some new technology that we were trying out with our locomotives and our DPUs. We proved we could do it and that was a one time deal. We are not going to repeat that kind of an issue with those long trains but remember, the leverage in train length is on the average train length. It\u2019s not on the maximum train length and we did prove we could do it, we did learn some things. We think that we have, as I said earlier, adequate opportunity for upside leverage here on our train lengths. We are dealing it with inside of our capital budget here, some of the impetus that we may see an exciting length and we have a few exciting extensions I\u2019ll run through track capacities, we\u2019re addressing those as we go along.", "So as I said, we are around 5,500. We have plenty of upside left there across the board and we continue to press the technology and we\u2019ll appear to be able to accommodate those trains.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "Perfect, just a follow up question here now on the attrition side you mentioned attrition, to what extent can you remind us here your yearly rate of attrition and to what extent is that helping you in sort of realigning your work force and bringing people back to fill jobs due to attrition as opposed to higher volumes.", "Jim Young", "Well it\u2019s a key component and if you will recall back about three years ago we were running about 7% to 8% attrition, that\u2019s fallen off here and last year so which wouldn\u2019t surprise you where people are deferring retirements or defer may be looking for jobs elsewhere but we expect this year to lose about 3,000 employees, that\u2019s down from kind of the peak of 5,000 plus and it will continue. ", "I mean you\u2019ve heard us talk before, the baby boomers will move into the chain and are retiring so it\u2019s given us a good opportunity to manage our employment levels to attrition. If you look at our numbers, we hit a peak on our employment of around 51,000 to 52,000 employees a couple of years back. We finished this quarter at around 42,000 or so, a big piece of that was attrition in terms of just simple not filling jobs as they left.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank", "All right, I guess a question going back to the pricing side of things, I wanted to get a sense you said that you had a contract on the auto side that reprised mid-quarter this year and mid quarter this quarter and that was part of the point bump that we are seeing in Q2 right now. Are there any other timing guidance that you can give us throughout the year in terms of when any of the other legacy contracts or repricing that we could expect to model in perhaps some improvement?", "Jack Koraleski", "", "Sure Justin we have the one in the first quarter. We have the fact that Pacer ramps up over the year so that will change over time. The (inaudible) side contract basically takes effect in the second quarter and then we do have a couple of mid year legacy deals in the July kind of mid year timeframe, not the biggest of deals but a couple there that will come on stream.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank", "Okay that\u2019s helpful and I guess just vis-\u00e0-vis that and may be giving a little context around it, you talked about better fuel surcharge recovery and I am assuming that comes with some of this intermodal change. Can you speak to where you\u2019ve been, where you are now and where you expect to be on a full run rate basis in terms of offsetting incremental fuel costs as we kind of move through 2010 and exit into 2011?", "Rob Knight", "We continue to make progress and you are right as we continue to click off legacy contracts and as Jack talked about the intermodal that improved our position, we\u2019ve done a great job of moving forward on the recovery and minimizing the negative impact that comes with rising fuel prices. We still of course have the risk of the challenge from quarter-to-quarter should there be swings in fuel prices with the lag effect but we\u2019ve made great progress on a recovery. We are going to continue to make progress as we move forward. ", "The other thing just talking about fuel, when you look at the impact of fuel year-over-year it costs us in the first quarter about $0.10 EPS and that\u2019s primarily a result of the fact that we got a $0.20 plus as a result of favorable surcharge lag last year. So you kind of get those swings from quarter-to-quarter depending on what\u2019s happening at the timing of the recovery but the bottom line is we continue to make progress, we have made great progress in minimizing the negative impact as a result of the contract.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank", "Is there a number that we should think of in terms of incremental fuel costs recovery that you guys are able to achieve now versus prior and may be where you think you are heading?", "Rob Knight", "I can\u2019t give a number Justin and there\u2019s 75ish kind of fuel surcharge programs in our market. So trying to tie to a single number is not particularly useful at this stage, I think the bottom line here is we\u2019ve really kind of removed that as being a major negative rising fuel price environment. ", "Just on an annual basis as Rob said, we pretty much neutralized fuel either way, you just have to be a little careful on a quarter to quarter basis particularly when you get a spike either way that you can have bigger impact on your earnings in that quarter but because of timing, on an annual basis we\u2019ve pretty much limited it the majority of the fuel variability.

Workforce productivity is impressive and getting a sense that you are starting to get to those friction points on productivity where you\u2019ve got to make some decisions. When you guys are sitting there looking at that and trying to figure out how to bring on clues and what have you. What are the key metrics and what should we be looking at? When we look at our labor costs should it be more tighter volume, more tighter revenue, more tighter what we think OR should be and I guess the balance of all three to some extent but may be if you could give us a little more color on how you make those decisions. ", "Jim Young", "", "Justin its tighter volume I mean it really is. I mean we do look at kind of productivity offsets but you start adding more volume it will eventually add more train starts which means we\u2019ll eventually have more train crews that we are going to again more volume will drive more maintenance. So, I want to get back to where, we\u2019ve got a strong hiring program going on. That means we have got good growth in our business. We see good long term opportunity but at the end of the day volumes is the prime driver. ", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank", "Okay and last one, I\u2019ll turn over to someone else.

Everybody else kind of throws in same store sales basis, so, you do it if I recall right over the entire base which may be dilutes that number a bit. Do you have an idea what it would be if you just thought about it on a same store sale basis?", "Rob Knight", "Ken it\u2019s not a number that we talked about but it will be logically a little higher of course than the way we report and just to elaborate on the points you\u2019re making you\u2019re exactly right. The way we calculate price is we take it across our entire book of business. So it\u2019s a yield if you will that takes into consideration every dollar of our revenue even that which we haven\u2019t been able to touch for the contracts. So it is a conservative way of looking at price that\u2019s how we have looked at it but so if you dissect it, just the same store sales base which we don\u2019t, we won\u2019t be logically be a little higher than that.

At the end of the day, with the folks of productivity, you look at the amount of capital we\u2019re putting into our business. We are working hard this year in terms of our performance and you are going to work hard in terms of you look at return on capital. We\u2019re working hard to get this thing above a double digit number. So, you should hear from many of us that we are satisfied with where price is because it\u2019s got to up.

When do cost start, I know you said it comes in stair step functions during the remarks before, but when do you think it needs to start leading the volume growth and how long does it take, remind us of kind of training the employees to be able to be proficient again?", "Rob Knight", "Well, keep in mind Ken that we have got a program, we call it alternative work, unique in the industry where we didn\u2019t 100% furlough on employees. We actually had several thousand at the peak where we are paying 100% of their benefits and they were getting about eight or nine days of work. So, they were current. We have a very disciplined process that looks at each territory who understand lead times, we keep in touch with our fellow employees. We are not going to jeopardize safety.

We are up I think 18% or 19% through the first three weeks in terms of our volume. So I haven\u2019t seen it fall off at this point. But again, I think the key whether you\u2019ll start seeing hiring numbers get a little stronger. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you our next question is from is from Edward Wolfe of Wolfe (inaudible). Please go ahead with your question sir.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "", "Can you just give me a sense on the mix, the break down of the mix and the fuel you gave the pricing that makes up to 2.8% yield.", "Rob Knight", "", "In rough numbers, average revenue as far as you see is a free, deal was a roughly three and mix was roughly a negative three. And the reason mix was so strongly negative, to the point we had such strong growth in our intermodal and automotive business groups. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "", "Okay, when I think about what Jack said about pricing tracking, one point higher in April than first quarter. Jack did you mean 1 percentage point above the 3% price excluding our [ARC] or the 3.5% including ARC.", "Jim Young", "", "I am saying right at moment, its about a percent higher and that is again the core price number. The core price number, the three is looking like four so far in April.", "Unidentified Speaker ", "", "Okay so excluding the ARC.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "", "If you think about it I know there has been a lot of people trying to get that pricing, but I guess the thought is that if you look at pricing excluding ARC went from 3.5 in fourth quarter to 3 in first quarter despite the 5% or 6% of legacy contracts replacing early in the quarter. And you have actually have better absolute volume in first quarter than fourth quarter. So it\u2019s the sense that\u2019s lagging that pricing that was going down six months ago, nine months ago. And now we are starting to turn and inflect and that\u2019s why it starts to go up in second quarter. Or is there something else I am missing there.", "Jim Young", "", "Again its, mostly attributable to the domestic intermodal legacy overhangs that are going to shift, and we are going to be in a better position here going forward in the second quarter and beyond. So that\u2019s really kind of the key driver of that. Its pretty much a timing issue.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "", "So I guess, the intermodal as a driver going forward, but the first quarter being worse than fourth, is that lagging stuff that just takes a little while to play through?", "Jim Young", "", "Yes sir.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "", "And then on the share re-purchase timing and I guess back to your answer to the question before, do you not have confident yet in the economy that the recovery is sound enough here to buy back stock at this moment in time?", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "Ed we are feeling better, I think everyone right now is surprised at the strength in first quarter and what we are seeing so far in April and if we see these things sustained here as we are going forward, we commit into our shareholders we are going to look at how we return some cash.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Scott Malat with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs", "We have just really seen some shipping rates increase out of China. You talked a bit about the coal but can you talk about what you are seeing from Asian demand and outlook from some of the other categories maybe green that was paper good or anything like that?", "Jim Young", "We are seeing some good strength in our international, intermodal, finally its up 12-13% so and it looks fairly sustainable and it looks like we\u2019ll actually have a peak season this year, so that\u2019s a good thing for us. The grain business right now, the export markets in the world supply is going to shift here and that\u2019s going to hurt US exports but domestic, it looks good. It\u2019s a little early to say in terms of getting the crops planted and how the harvest is going to look in terms of potential, but at least the initial indications are you will see larger corn and bean crops which should be good for us and certainly the ethanol business and DDGs associated with it are strong.", "Autos as I said, continued strength is what everybody is looking for. Energy, we are feeling more bullish about. We\u2019ll just have to see how that plays out, what we need though is a nice strong hot summer that will be useful. Industrial products is turning for us in a good way and that was kind of my key benchmark. The three things I was looking for was rock, cement and lumber and my theory is that an economic recovery isn\u2019t sustainable unless you have those three planned and we\u2019ve actually seen a nice up tick in lumber and now the rock business is starting to show some good so we are just waiting for cement.", "And then we have already talked about intemodal. I think not only do we have the great upside on the domestic piece because the service is excellent and we\u2019re seeing highway conversions at a much higher rate than what we had thought we would and that the new max program had some great (inaudible) competitive schedules going to the north east. That\u2019s gaining share and of the highway and the international solid and I think you need to look at also what\u2019s happening with truck capacity as you know it has been tightening, pricing has been firming up which again, if this economy has some lakes that should give us additional opportunity rest of the year.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs", "Just a quick data plan and just how much your business is now still on legacy contracts?", "Jim Young", "It 12% is I think where we had left for the rest of the year but you need to keep in mind that things like Pacer, some of those are ramping up over time. So 12% is what\u2019s moving under a legacy deal that has not been repriced since 2004 and we\u2019re making progress on all the others.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of FBR Capital Markets. ", "Chris Wetherbee - FBR Capital Markets", "Jack a quick field question for you, just from an our cap perspective, can you give us a sense of what that might look like in the second quarter from an escalation perspective and how that kind of factors into the 4% growth you are talking about?", "Rob Knight", "As you have seen the published projected our cap of fuel component is expected to go up in the second quarter versus last year second quarter because of the change in fuel price but its all part of our expectation and our confidence that we are going to improve our pricing going forward but keep in mind that our contracts that renew that have an archive fuel component in the index, its not linear. I mean it can be lumpy and it\u2019s not all of them reset for example on the second quarter. It builds into our overall confidence that things will improve from here. ", "Chris Wetherbee - FBR Capital Markets", "I guess just one quick follow-up question, sticking with you Rob, I guess on the health and welfare kind of cost increases that we\u2019re seeing on a year-over-year basis. Can you give us a sense of what that trend looks like as we go forward to the next couple of quarters may be on an absolute dollar perspective if you can get that granular that would be great.", "Rob Knight", "Yes, you may recall in our last quarter earnings we indicated that, health and welfare cost would be higher and as a result we projected and did give guidance that we thought the inflation on our overall labor line would be closer to 5%ish. And in terms of absolute dollar amounts, that\u2019s probably roughly $25 million quarter kind of number. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning gentlemen and thanks for taking my call. On the healthcare cost increase front may be Rob can answer this one, have you factored in any cost associated with the healthcare reform package the past time was here recently?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, but its not going to be a major challenge to us and it\u2019s not a hit to us in the first quarter as you\u2019ve noticed in our earnings. So, yes and I guess I have to say because who knows what it all brings in terms of the actual details of the bill, but my number does take into consideration what we know about the healthcare bill yet. ", "Jim Young", "", "John, we have to think about it two ways. The direct impact on our programs right now at least in the short term is not a big hit but what does it mean long term to our customers or suppliers that we have to work through. So, we are going to keep our eye on it. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thank you and then I think somebody mentioned the fact that you are continuing to work to convert what I\u2019ll call single stack intermodal service to double stack. Where do you think you are in that conversion and how much is left and how much just in a very general terms more profitable is a double stack operation compared to a more traditional (inaudible) operation?", "Dennis Duffy", "", "I\u2019ll be glad to answer Jack\u2019s profitability. As far as the upside John, what we have, a good portion of it depends on the lanes obviously but in some lanes we\u2019re at 85% double stack, other lanes were as high as above 95% to a 100%. So there is some transition going on in some of these trailers to containers, Jack and John and the marketing team are working through. So I\u2019d say we have a few percentage points to go on an intermodal network here before we get to where we want to be. ", "Jim Young", "", "But to think about the operating efficiency, I mean you are doubling the volume technically on a train. If you have single stack versus double stack it\u2019s a significant improvement in operating efficiency and then as a consequence to that should be on a margin. ", "Rob Knight", "", "If you look at our data you will see that trailer business is a very small portion of our total intermodal. I forgot what the actual number we\u2019re down to now but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it in the 5%, 6%, 7% kind of a range. And there is a price differential. Its not exactly that just because we double stack with the pricing on the trailer business is significantly higher than the pricing on the double stack business and that reflects market and the demand that\u2019s out there truck competition and everything else that we have to consider. ", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "On a similar note couple of years ago I used to talk a fair amount about converting a lot of the, what I would manifest car load business in to unit trains wherever possible. Is that still a lever available to you or are you more or less converted everything that can be converted at this point. ", "Jim Young", "It\u2019s really kind of a growth cycle for us because you start off with an opportunity, it\u2019s a small group of business over time, that customer grows, service is good and eventually we go to multi-car blocks and then eventually in places like pipe and in track sand and now windmills and all of those kinds of things we are able to convert than into unit train business that then creates more opportunity for a manifest that opens up available capacity in the manifest network and we go out and get additional business to fill that. I think we still have some opportunity", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "How much of the volume currently moves in what I would call manifest trains versus unit trains?", "Jim Young", "Well manifest is about a third of our overall business.", "Operator", "Our last question is coming from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Jeff Kauffman - Sterne Agee", "Dennis we talked about system capacity, you talked about the average number of cars per day you think you can get on the system, maybe that\u2019s 15-20% higher than now but I know velocity helps that capacity, your management helps that capacity. So if I look at it three buckets, how much capacity the track can handle before we need to change things. How much capacity volume you can grow before you really need to start making changes to the cars, locomotives and how much capacity you can grow before you really need to start adding the people and you mentioned you were doing some hiring now? Can you give me rough idea of where those start to kick in so I can get an idea how the incremental margins retard a little bit as growth gets to X lets say?", "Dennis Duffy", "Jeff if you take a look at that upside leverage chart that I showed here, if you think about the track infrastructure, that\u2019s really the throughput category, that\u2019s the fixed resources and when I say we are sized for 190,000 to 200,000, that\u2019s the fixed plan. That\u2019s the main lines in the terminal and then when you look at the rest of it you know on the cars and locomotives that would be more on the train size discussion that we had. We\u2019ve given out the number 10 to 15% beyond where we are today and then the adding people as Jim talked about, that\u2019s incremental. As the volume comes back and we look at the train starts we are anticipating them.", "But remember we\u2019re training ahead. So we\u2019ve got those costs already into our cost structure. We do see that we may have to do more engineer training if the volume continues and we may have to do some more relocation as I indicated in there. So the adding people part is incremental with the growth number and that\u2019s the best surrogate we could look at is that seven day number to try and graduate what an estimate might be in terms of people coming back.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments", "Jim Young", "Well again, thank you for joining us this morning. I hope you see we are keeping our commitments to our shareholders in terms of our performance and we are looking forward to talking to you again in July. So again thanks for joining us.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Young, you may begin.", "James Young", "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Dennis Duffy, Vice Chairman, Operations; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Rob Knight, our CFO.", "Union Pacific set a new quarterly earnings record of $1.40 per share, 52% increase over last year's recorded earnings of $0.92 per share. Last year second quarter included about $0.14 per share from a land sale, so on a more apples to apples basis, we actually increased earnings almost 80% versus 2009. Operating income was a record $1.3 billion, a 71% increase. A key contributor to our strong earnings performance was the return of business volume to our railroad. In fact, this is the first time in six years that we've reported volume growth in all six of our businesses in the same quarter.", "Beyond the strong earnings growth, the real quarterly highlight was achieving a 69.4% operating ratio. This is our first ever quarter under 70%, and is a tremendous achievement for the men and women of UP. We are demonstrating great volume leverage, efficiently handling an 18% increase in business with little incremental cost. It's really a team effort, beginning with our employees who are dedicated to running a safe, efficient railroad. Our commitment to rail infrastructure investment, a disciplined yet flexible transportation plan, and our continuous safety improvement efforts are all paying off in the form of enhanced productivity and resiliency.", "These are the keys to delivering high quality service for our customers. Customers increasingly recognize the great value that UP franchise has to offer, allowing us to reach new markets and supporting our pricing plans. Not only are customers rewarding us with their business, second quarter customer satisfaction scores were an all-time best. With another record quarter in the books, we feel good about the direction of our company and the opportunities we have in front of us. With that, let\u2019s turn it over to Jack for a review of our business team.", "John Koraleski", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I thought I\u2019d lead off this morning with a look at our customer satisfaction which came in at 89% for the quarter. As Jim said, that's a new best ever result, and we believe it's a pretty good indicator of how customers view the value proposition that Union Pacific is offering them today.", "I wanted to lead off with this slide because it's not only the stronger economic activity that drove our growth in the second quarter but also a stronger value proposition that\u2019s been driven by excellent service and our new product offerings as well.", "The second quarter of last year marked below point for volume as the impact of the recession was felt across the business. This year with all six commodity groups posting gains, overall volume climbed 18%. We saw stronger core price improvement driven in part by a reversal of intermodal\u2019s recent trend of negative pricing. With our major domestic legacy deals behind us, intermodal joined the other five groups in posting core price gains during the second quarter. Overall, core price improved about 5%, which combined with the increased fuel surcharge revenue and a little negative mix to produce an 8% increase in average revenue per car. The volume gains and improved revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 27% to just shy of $4 billion. So let's take a closer look now at each of our six businesses.", "Our Ag products volume grew 5%, which combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car to produce a 13% increase in revenue. Ethanol volume grew 24% as U.S. production expanded to meet the government mandate. ", "Soybean meal shipments declined 5% with the stronger South American crop now finding its way into world markets at the expense of a higher priced U.S. production. Whole grain exports increased 16% with shipments of both corn and wheat up in all three of our markets, Mexico, Pacific Northwest and Gulf. Domestic feed grains grew 9% with a boost from corn shipments to forward ethanol plants in both California and Idaho that have now resumed production. Overall, our whole grain shipments were up 9% against record low volumes a year ago.", "Our Produce Railexpress perishable service in conjunction with the CSX grew 16% attracting business off the highway with a strong value proposition.", "Automotive revenue was up 105%, driven by a 71% growth in volume and a 19% increase in average revenue per car that reflects some contracts that have been re-priced over the past several years.", " ", "U.S. vehicle production is estimated to be up just over 70% in the second quarter reflecting the industry's continued recovery from last year's low sales levels and financial turmoils. For Union Pacific, that recovery was reflected in a 77% increase in finished vehicle shipments and a 67% growth in auto parts volume.", "Our chemical volumes grew 11%, which with a 6% improvement in average revenue per car produced a 19% increase in revenue. Fertilizer volume increased 36% with export shipments accounting for two-thirds of that growth. With inventory levels more balanced than a year ago, improved demand resulting from the stronger economy translated into 11% growth in our Industrial Chemicals segment. The results were strong demand for both export and domestic soda ash, but a 35% increase in exports is what really drove the segment to 18% increase in volume.", "LPG volumes increased 13% and petroleum products shipments grew 11%, even as asphalt demand remains relatively weak.", "Energy revenue increased 13% as a 3% growth in volume combined with a 13% improvement in average revenue per car. First overall volume growth we've seen in our energy business since we saw the economy start to slide in late 2008 was driven by a 5% increase in tonnage out of the Southern Powder River Basin. The largest driver was a new coal-fired unit that came online in San Antonio, but shipments to other mid-western and southern utilities have picked up as stock piles reached near normal levels, economic activity picked up, and the summer burn kicked in. ", "Our Colorado/Utah tonnage was flat impacted by continued soft demand and production downtime associated with the mines relocating equipment to some new reserves. We expect that that process is going to continue well into 2011.", "Our industrial products revenue grew 30%, as a 25% increase in volume combined with the 4% improvement in average revenue per car. Drilling demand along with the recovery in the automotive industry are the major drivers of increased capacity utilization for U.S. steel mills, and that translated into stronger volumes in our steel and scrap business with shipments up 87% in the second quarter.", "Our short-haul movement of Uranium tailings from Moab, Utah for the Department of Energy drove the 157% increase in hazardous waste volume. And if we exclude the negative mix effect of the short-haul move, average revenue per unit in our Industrial Products business would have been up 9% for the second quarter.", "Increased drilling activity is also the driver behind a 49% increase in our non-metallic mineral volume, primarily frac sand and some of the other drilling related products. It also drove an 18% increase in rock, where road and related construction tied to oil drilling is growing.", "Unfortunately, we haven't seen much improvement in other construction, whether it's commercial, highway or housing. Our lumber was up 11% for the quarter, but that pace actually slowed following the expiration of the housing tax credits.", "Intermodal volumes grew 24%, which when combined with a 10% improvement in average revenue per unit drove revenue up 35%. Volume for our International Intermodal segment increased 23% as import growth starts to reflect the positive economic trends over the past year. ", "We were able to capitalize on the stronger economy in our Domestic Intermodal market as well, leveraging a strong value proposition for highway conversions in many of our major lands. Although we lapped last year's win with the Hub Group late in the quarter, growth in the -- their business also contributed to gains in our Domestic segment.", "Our streamline subsidiaries door-to-door product grew 67%, with half of that growth coming off the highway. And the new Pacer arrangement and the UMAX program improved price performance and provided better fuel surcharge recovery, helping to drive the increased average revenue per unit.", "So, let me wrap up with a look ahead of what we're seeing here in the second half. The economy began to recover during the second half of 2009. And it doesn't look like the slow improvement trajectory is going to change much over the last half of this year.", "From an overall perspective, low inventory to sales ratios throughout the supply chain are an encouraging sign for transportation demand. And the tightening truck and container availability that we're seeing today are encouraging signs for the rail industry.", "With the Powder River Basin coal stockpiles back essentially at normal levels, growth prospects have improved for our largest business segment. And if there is a dark cloud, it's the continued lack of recovery in housing and construction, which along with continued high unemployment is keeping alive the question of just how engaged the consumer is in this recovery. ", "Our growth opportunities over the next six months are most likely going to come from the same segments that posted gains in the first half. Those would include Ag, for instance. Ethanol growth should continue. Shipments into forward plant should boost domestic corn volumes. The fall crops are looking pretty good right now, however we did see strong feed grain and meal exports late last year and we don't expect those markets to be quite as strong for U.S. in 2010.", "While vehicle sales forecast for the year have been trimmed slightly, manufacturer inventories are still pretty well aligned with demand. And production is projected to be up from last year, so we're going to continue to see growth in this segment.", "As we started the third quarter, our Autos business has probably seen the greatest impact from the devastating rains from Hurricane Alex in Mexico and the bridge outages on the KCSM. While we don't expect a significant impact to the quarter, it's obviously affecting our customers. ", "Across all six of our businesses, it's kind of an all-hands-on-deck here working with our international customer service center in both Mexican rail rate -- railroads to identify rail re-routes, and alternative solutions like truck and the transloads or intermodal facilities north of the border, to keep our customers shipments moving and avoid plant shutdowns.", "Chemicals is benefiting from improved demand in downstream markets. Fertilizer inventories are still low and demand should be strong, including export potash. And we expect export soda ash to continue its current pace as well.", "Southern Powder River Basin coal prospects have brightened with the stockpiles down and the summer burn helping to drive demand. The Colorado/Utah stockpiles still remain relatively high and the opportunity is expected to be further dampened by production downtime.", "We're still waiting for signs of recovery in a number of our industrial products markets, but drilling activity should continue to drive growth in non-metallic minerals. And with the help from anticipated growth in autos, steel shipments should stay ahead of last year.", "We expect growth in our uranium tailings move, but we have now lapped the start-up of that business. So the year-over-year comparisons aren't going to be quite so strong.", "Stronger import levels should drive growth in International Intermodal. We're expecting a normal peak season this year. ", "Excellent service is attracting highway conversions in Domestic Intermodal, especially as truck supply tightens and our equipment supply improves, so we should see a strong second half with improving margins.", "So overall, l increased economic activity, strong value proposition that underpins our growth prospects across all six groups, and coal price improvement, should all combine with volume gains to drive revenue growth in the second half. With that, we\u2019ll turn it over to Dennis for the operations report.", "Dennis Duffy", "Thank you, Jack, and good morning. In the second quarter we continued to see overall improvement trends in safety, service and value. Even with an 18% increase in volume, we maintained a strong performance with our Service Delivery Index coming in at 92.1% in the quarter. We achieved over three points of SDI improvement versus the first quarter as this is the measure -- as this measure continues to be highly correlated with the record customer satisfaction Jack discussed earlier.", "Behind those results is the hard work we do in every facet of the operation to deliver consistent service to our customers. For example, Industry Spot & Pull was a record 93.2% in the quarter. This is one of the most visible measures for our customers as it represents their first and last events of each car cycle. ", "Car connection performance, which measures whether we put right cars in the right train, was maintained at very high level. Terminal operations remained fluid, enabling good execution of the transportation plan. And second quarter velocity was 26.4 miles per hour, up slightly from first quarter levels.", "We demonstrated great resiliency and recoverability in our operations during the quarter, which enabled us to achieve these strong results. In particular, our trains experienced significant weather-related delays, 15 out of 30 days in June. By comparison, last June operations were impacted by only one day. And in the face of those challenges, we improved our overall safety performance, setting a new second quarter mark for employee reportables, and an all-time best for reportable dynamics [ph] [21:49].", "Running a safe and resilient network also allows us to generate strong volume leverage. In the second quarter, with an 18% increase in car-lettings, total train starts only increased 7%.", "One source of our volume leverage is productivity. Across all of our asset classes, we are doing more with less. Employee productivity measured by gross ton miles per employees reached its higher level in nearly two years. Freight car utilization was a second quarter best at 8.4 days. And locomotive productivity improved 3%, year-over-year.", "Another source of leverage is our excess working resources. Today, we have roughly 2,300 employees per load; 39,000 stored freight cars; and 1,200 excess locomotives. Although every category is down from peak levels, we still have ample resources to handle current demand.", "We are, however, hiring and transferring some conductors over the next couple of months to supplement locations where the combination of volumes and attrition require it. We're also in the early phases of thinking about our 2011 capital plan, including the possibility of starting locomotive purchases next year, maybe around 100 units. Although our stored locomotives are functional, new units would improve fuel efficiency, reduce emissions, increase reliability, and expand our distributed power capability. It will also provide flexibility in advance of yet to be developed locomotive technology to meet Tier 4 EPA requirements.", "Increased productivity generates capacity in terms of throughput on our network. And one of those areas we've been concentrating intently on is train length. Compared to 2009, we've increased train length in almost every major train type, establishing new records with some. For example, our intermodal train length averaged nearly 164 boxes per train in the second quarter, an increase versus 2009 of more than 15 boxes per train. To illustrate the power of train size, the 1% improvement in coal doesn't sound like much, but one car more per train saves a 100 loaded coal trains per year.", "The Unified Plan continues to find opportunities to run longer trains more productively. We are also working with our customers to identify and eliminate length constraints. Beyond that, our increased use of distributed power and targeted capital investments give us the physical capability of running longer trains. This is further enhanced by the terminal performance improvement initiative that facilitates throughput and performance in major terminals.", "As we look ahead to the back half of 2010 and peak season, we will be ready and committed to exceed customer expectations with excellent service. We will also continue our efforts to operate in a volume variable manner, incurring additional expenses more slowly and volumes increase. Our robust capital programs are essential for maintaining both safety and service. And we are always working to increase our overall capital efficiency, completing more work with less dollars spent.", "Finally, we never take our eye off safety as we strive to make every decision have a safety component built into it. With that, let me turn it over to Rob to discuss the financials.", "Robert Knight", "Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. UP's second quarter financial performance was exceptional by almost every measure. Slide 19 summarizes second quarter revenues and expenses. While operating revenue grew 27% to $4.2 billion, operating expenses only increased 14% to $2.9 billion. An 18% increase in carloads, strong core pricing gains, and our ongoing commitment to cost efficiency help drive a 71% increase in operating income to a best ever $1.3 billion. Similar to the first quarter, the biggest driver of the expense increase was the rising price of diesel fuel which accounted for more than half of the year-over-year change. ", "Second quarter other income totaled $19 million compared to $135 million in 2009. As you'll recall, last year's results included $116 million pre-tax gain on a land sale in Colorado.", "Interest expense totaled $152 million, up only $2 million versus '09. Income taxes increased 62% to $435 million as a result of increased earnings and a higher tax rate. Our second quarter 2010 effective tax rate was 38% versus 36.6% a year -- in the year ago quarter. The result was a best ever quarterly net income of $711 million, or earnings per share of $1.40 per share. ", "On a reported basis, net income grew 53%. But if you strip out the 2009 land sale, earnings on a more comparable basis actually grew 81%.", "Turning now to price. Slide 20, we are reporting an almost 5% core price gain in the second quarter. As we discussed back in April, this sequential quarterly improvement was supported by our legacy renewals. Increased freight demand and consistent high-quality service contributed.", "Similar to the first quarter, the second quarter pricing gains included about a half point of fuel related increases associated with RCAF.", "Looking beyond the second quarter, we continue to feel very positive about the pricing opportunities we have over the rest of 2010 and beyond. Supported by UP's strong service in our remaining legacy contracts, we are committed to achieving real pricing gain that will drive higher returns.", "Moving on to operating expenses. We'll start with compensation and benefits at $1.1 billion in the second quarter, an 8% increase versus 2009. The storyline here continues to be strong employee productivity, which allowed us to grow volumes nearly 18% with a 3% year-over-year decrease in our workforce.", "As you heard from Dennis, we are driving efficiency gains by returning resources to the railroad more slowly than volumes. Offsetting productivity were several factors. Second quarter 2010 is the last quarter of the current labor agreement which provided a 4.5% wage hike. And as we discussed at the beginning of the year, higher agreement, health and welfare costs added roughly $25 million to the quarterly expense.", "Volume costs were higher as increased car loadings requires more train starts and greater fuel -- excuse me, greater crew expenses. In addition, equity and incentive compensation expense was somewhat higher year-over-year.", "Slide 22 helps illustrate how we think about employment levels over the remainder of 2010. As shown on the left, 7-day carload volumes have seen a slow, steady climb since the third quarter of 2009, up almost 8% over that period. And since the fourth quarter, we've also started to see a sequential increase in our workforce but at a slower pace. We look forward to putting more of our employees back to work as needed for volumes and attrition. But this won't be on a one-for-one basis, as we continue efforts to further improve employee productivity.", "Second quarter fuel expense totaled $608 million, a 64% increase versus 2009. Higher year-over-year fuel prices and increased volume were the drivers, adding $186 million and $48 million to the quarter respectively. A portion of these increases were offset, however, by continued improvement in our consumption rate. Our fuel conservation efforts produced a 1% savings in the quarter, achieving a second quarter best ever level.", "Slide 24, summarizes the year-over-year change in three of our expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased $73 million in the quarter or 18%. Growing business volumes resulted in greater use of contract services in the second quarter, particularly for purchase transportation associated with automotive and intermodal shipment.", "We also saw increased usage of joint facility operations in intermodal ramps. Second quarter equipment and other rents expense decrease 8% or $25 million. Roughly $14 million of the decline is associated with locomotive lease restructured in May of 2009, so we have now lapped that expense change.", "In addition, better asset utilization in the form of improved cycle times and lower lease expense for freight cars, intermodal containers and locomotives contributed to the year-over-year decline. Offsetting a portion of these savings was increased car hire expense associated with the strong demand for automotive and intermodal equipment.", "Other expense totaled $122 million, $31 million lower than in 2009. This expense line came in well below our expected range, primarily as a result of our continuous safety improvements which reduced casualty costs across-the-board. Although on a year-over-year basis the change in personal injury expense was minimal, ongoing progress in our safety efforts was reflected in a semiannual actuarial study. ", "Freight and property claims were also better in the quarter, saving roughly $15 million versus 2009. In addition, less bad debt expense and reduced costs for environmental remediation contributed to the year-over-year lower expense.", "Going forward, although there are several moving parts associated with this category, our current thinking is that other expense will be closer to $170 million or so in both the third and fourth quarters. This assumes some ongoing benefit from casualty performance, but not at the same level as we achieved in the second quarter.", "Although we are reporting a number of bests in the second quarter, and very strong earnings growth, if you want to take away just one number from the quarter, it should be 69.4%, UP's first ever sub-70% operating ratio. This was a full eight points of improvement versus 2009, despite the impact of higher diesel fuel prices. We are delivering on the goals established as part of Project Operating Ratio as we convert stronger volumes, better pricing, and greater efficiency into record bottom line results.", "The combination of carload growth returning to our railroad and the resulting strong cash flow supported our decision to resume share repurchases back in May. We are being opportunistic in our approach, and recent stock market volatility certainly gave us some attractive entry points. We bought back roughly 6.5 million shares for $466 million in the second quarter. And we have repurchased close to $200 million of additional shares in July.", "We also increased the quarterly dividend 22%. Our balance sheet remains strong with an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of 43.5%. The comparison to 2009 is somewhat skewed however, since last year's June 30 ratio was the high point for the year. This year it's likely the low point as our 2010 debt maturities were more front-end loaded.", "As a reminder, we finished 2009 at 46.1%. An adjusted debt-to-cap ratio that's in the mid-40%s range supports our solid investment grade credit rating, which we continue to believe is appropriate for our business.", "Let me wrap things up with a few thoughts on the third quarter. As we see the world today, volumes continue to be somewhat of a wildcard but they are also the key to earnings. And assuming volume growth continues, we expect to move the increased volumes in a highly leveraged manner.", "Volume comparisons do get slightly more difficult in the third quarter. But even if we run flat with second quarter's 7-day volumes, we'd still be in the range of 7% to 8% volume growth versus 2009.", "Expense comparisons will be tougher as well, you recall last year's third quarter operating ratio was 73.8%, a quarterly record at that time, as we achieve best in a number of our efficiency measures. For example, fuel costs are expected to be higher year-over-year. Our current spot price is about $2.20 per gallon, which is 18% above last year's third quarter price. Beyond the cost discipline, we\u2019ll achieve real pricing gains that support higher returns, creating a powerful combination that drives strong financial results for our company. ", "Of course, we can't control the economy, so we will have to remain flexible and play the hand that we are dealt. But we are looking forward to our next quarterly report, and the opportunity to build off of our record second quarter results. With that, let me turn it back to Jim.", "James Young", "Thanks, Rob. Before we open it up for questions, I'll make a quick comment on the future. Our second quarter results are an indicator of the true potential of the UP franchise when safety, great service, pricing, and productivity all come together. While many of our metrics reflect best ever results, we still have significant upside. Our network infrastructure is built to handle 190,000 to 200,000 weekly carloads. And we have the working resources needed to efficiently provide great customer service as volumes return. ", "Although, there is still uncertainty around the state of the economic recovery, we are encouraged by the current demand levels and see the potential for slow, steady growth in the months ahead. So with that, let's open it up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "This is Rob Salmon, on for Justin Yagerman. My first question is focused on the Intermodal segment. Could you give us a bit more color on how the UMAX agreement has impacted the Intermodal pricing and profitability for you guys? And could you also give us a sense of the type of benefits we should be thinking about as your Joliet Intermodal Terminal becomes operational in Q3, i.e. where should we see the biggest benefit? Will this be a network capacity asset productivity or network fluidity?", "James Young", "Rob, it's probably -- probably not going to talk a lot about the pricing associated with the UMAX program. I will tell you that it is improving our margin and doing what we had hoped for in terms of helping us to recover additional fuel surcharge. And so both of those are quite positive, and you saw the impact of that. Customers\u2019 activity to the UMAX program has been awesome. And it's growing in volumes and service has been great. So all around, we're quite happy with that.  The Joliet facility is going to do all those things. It's going to be a combination of fluidity. It's going to be asset utilization. It's going to improve schedules for our customers. It's going to give them closer access to the major consumption markets there in Chicago. And we will also have improved throughput in our interchange business with both Eastern carriers. So it's going to be the whole package from our customers\u2019 perspective.", "Robert Knight", "Rob, the key here, UMAX is a piece of an overall strategy in the Intermodal, but the bottom-line in Intermodal is great service. We\u2019ve got a lot of different products, all these corridors, and we're really seeing what can happen when you put great service products in the market.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "And should we still be thinking about kind of late third quarter this -- the Joliet coming on?", "James Young", "August 1.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "And I guess shifting gears a little bit to Dennis. Can you give a sense how much further you believe the train lengths can be expanded from current levels before you\u2019d need help from customers, or make structural changes like extending sliding across your network? And how much improvement on the train lengths do you believe is possible across your manifest network and unit trains by working with your customers longer term? And what sort of timing should we be thinking about the potential to get those trains extended?", "Dennis Duffy", "That's a continual focus for us. And we are already addressing those issues that you mentioned, working with our customers. And we have some strategic capital points record towards our sliding extensions. More in the CNW and then across the Southeast, from El Paso east. But to answer your question specifically, we expect continuous improvement in our train length. We took it up 6.5% quarter-over-quarter a year. 2Q versus 2Q. On the Intermodal side, you saw the numbers, we said $164 million, we\u2019re already up to $170 million currently. We think we can go well north of $200 million without taxing any additional locomotives on those particular trains. And the respective answer would rest on the commodity corridors and the commodity types. But you can rest assured that you are going to see continuous improvement in train length in all -- across all categories; the premium service, the manifest service, and the bulk service.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Edward Wolfe with Wolfe Trahan.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Is there any reason why a 69.4% can't be at least that good in third quarter? I mean normally seasonally third quarter is a better quarter than second. You mentioned the casualty one-time benefit. You didn't quantify that. Maybe if you could help with that, that would help. Is there any reason that you see right now why you shouldn't be operating at this going forward?", "James Young", "Well, Ed, if you looked historically, second half is generally our highest earnings potential, so you can extend that out. It's going to be a function to how we see business volumes moving. The personal injury accrual clearly helps some, but keep in mind the higher fuel cost also penalized us. So it\u2019s a pretty good performance rate. So I'm optimistic about third and fourth quarters, but again, just watch the volumes.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "When you think about headcount down three and volumes up 18, obviously volumes can't last like this much longer, the comps gets tougher. But when do you think about those two starting to converge where you start to have to grow heads again and volumes come down and they get more similar to each other? Is that a couple quarters out, or is that something that's further out than that?", "James Young", "I think you can -- potentially third quarter you might see it up a little bit. Again, we're -- we\u2019ve started some hiring, although the numbers are relatively small overall. And again, we're going to hire to support volume as we go forward. We clearly have the leverage, as Dennis was talking about, that we'll still see good leverage going forward here. But I think our numbers will not continue to pick up. Now that doesn\u2019t say we\u2019re not continuing to focus on productivity. We've got some great projects underway, technology, a lot of the process initiatives that are underway, that's there. But again, if we\u2019re hiring, that means our outlook and volume looks pretty darn good.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "And can you just break out the yield, the 7.7%, in terms of price, fuel and mix?", "James Young", "Well, I think what we said is -- both Jack and Rob, is that the pricing number when you take kind of fuel and everything out of it, it was about 5% overall. We have to kind of look at ARC crews [ph] [41:46] negative mix -- or Rob, you want to...", "Robert Knight", "The high level numbers would be, the price is just about 5%\u2019ish. Fuel, we\u2019ll call it 6%. And negative mix of about 3% on the ARC [ph] [41:58] line.", "Edward Wolfe - Bear Stearns", "Could you give us a number on the casualty impact?", "Robert Knight", "Yes, Ed, it was similar to last year's number, which is about a $40 million positive. So year-over-year, it was about a wash. I mean it was roughly in the $40 million range.", "Operator", "Our next question will be coming from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "I just wanted to zero in on pricing as we start to look out to 2011. Perhaps you can give us a little bit of a sense what your -- the tone is with your customers right now in terms rebounding economy, are they feeling a little bit better? And is pricing a little more easier to drive through than perhaps this time last year? And what percentage of your book in 2011 has already been negotiated, if you can give us that?", "James Young", "Yes, I'll start with the -- kind of the first part of that, Jack can handle it. The pricing environment is stronger today than it's been in a long time. And again, you look at what's happening on the truck side, but all this is a function, where we think volume in the economy\u2019s going here, so projecting out to 2011. So you've got some positive potential in the economy, but there's another factor here that -- don't underplay. Our service metrics have never been better. Our customers, when we do our -- we have a very robust customer satisfaction survey that value proposition has never been better. So when I think about that, I feel very good about the potential in the pricing side going forward. I\u2019ll let Jack talk on the legacy contract.", "John Koraleski", "Walter, first of all I have to tell you, it's never easy to get price. So, but the environment has changed. There are some markets, obviously. Market demand is really what dictates your ability to take price up, plus the contractual obligations. So I would tell you right now, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% of our pricing is contractually tied up right at the moment for next year, which is not unusual. We\u2019re only halfway through the year, so...", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "And is that at a rate that you -- sort of what you're getting in this quarter right now, is it, roughly?", "John Koraleski", "It is what it is. There's no reason to say that it would be going down, at least at this point in time.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Second question here is on -- perhaps you can talk a little bit about the capital return to shareholders. Obviously you\u2019ve bought your buyback back in the second quarter, and that\u2019s great to see. Is there -- can we look at, is this going to be sort of your average run rate for buyback? Perhaps you can also talk about the -- your dividend payout ratio and your target levels, sort of just on that capital structure side, what we\u2019re looking at going forward?", "Robert Knight", "Walter, as you\u2019ve heard us say before, that we take a balanced approach. I mean we\u2019re not giving guidance in terms of what the run rate\u2019s going to be on our share of buyback other than we\u2019re going to continue to be opportunistic as we have been up to this point. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do going forward.  And as we said on our dividend, as you know, earlier this year we increased it 22%. And we\u2019d like to get into a position and be in a position where we are competitive with our dividends, steadily increasing it and being opportunistic on the share buyback.  In terms of what\u2019s the right level of the debt-to-cap ratio, the way we looked at it is we want to maintain a solid investment grade rating, which we think is in that mid 40%s ratio when you look at it on a debt-to-cap.  So we\u2019re comfortable in that level.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "I understand you made some comments in the prepared remarks, or Dennis did, about getting ready for peak season. And I just wanted to ask Jack, I mean, Intermodal volumes have been so strong, is a reasonable to think that we\u2019re going to see a peak off the numbers that we've been getting more recently?", "John Koraleski", "Yes, Gary, I think the potential is it\u2019s going to go up.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "You\u2019re not really concerned about inventory or\u2026", "Robert Knight", "No. I think the indications that you\u2019re seeing in the international markets today with international ocean carriers wanting their boxes returned back as quickly possible and transloading into domestic, we have some containers coming on board that we will be able to utilize, even with our new container acquisitions there will still be stronger demand than what we\u2019ll have containers for. So I think for this particular year, the way things are shaping up right now, I think we will see a more traditional peak season and it will be up from where we are running today.", "James Young", "You have to throw in there the potential outlook on Ag, which could be an upside. You look at right now coal, comes to where we\u2019re at with the burn so far. So there\u2019s some real potential here to have a decent peak.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "And then, Rob, just quickly on that $170 million and other expenses that you're highlighting for the second half. There\u2019s nothing unusual on that. That's kind of a new run rate. I'm just looking at the $246 million from Q1 and wondering why it would've been that high, to come down to a $170 million run rate?", "Robert Knight", "Yes, I mean that category, as you know, has a lot of moving parts. But what we\u2019re saying is -- from Q1, remember we had the $45 million CSXI payment in there. If you\u2019re looking at Q1, yes. But the $170 million number is, again, a lot of moving parts, but we\u2019re looking at that as sort of a more normalized level than the $122 million this quarter. And of course, among other things, what impacts that other category is volume. There are some volume related expenses in there.  So people depend upon volume and other factors", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of FBR Capital Markets.", "Chris Wetherbee - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Maybe for Dennis, you mentioned some potential locomotive purchases as you look out over the course of the next year or so. And when you think about, from an asset perspective, is there anywhere else you need to maybe make some investments as we see kind of business running at a better rate than it has been over than, obviously, the last couple of quarters? And I know you\u2019ve bought a few boxes here and there on the container side. I\u2019m just kind of curious if there\u2019s anything else we should be thinking about from an investment standpoint?", "Dennis Duffy", "Well, Chris, I mentioned some part of our strategy was on our capital investment on the sliding links. We're continuing to press that issue here. We want to continue to grow our train lengths in these key corridors, I mentioned a couple of them, so we\u2019re after that. I think food grade covered hoppers, we\u2019re going to end up with a couple hundred of those here. So some -- there\u2019s some really targeted specific car types that we might augment the spend with. But other than that, we\u2019re into the core replacement spending and we really don\u2019t see it, other than as I mentioned, the locomotives. So we\u2019re working our infrastructure really hard to make sure that we\u2019re reducing, taking variability out, improving the slow orders, and providing for excellent run-through capability and train length.", "James Young", "Chris, and keep in mind the step back from the locomotive potential here. These are really strategic investments long-term. When we think about our network today, we\u2019re thinking about three, four, five years out. You've got long lead times in many of these projects. So when you hear us talk about our capital budget, which we\u2019re still putting together, you've got to put that in the context of how you think three, four, five years out.", "Chris Wetherbee - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And I think I missed it, you mentioned the locomotives that you currently have in your storage right now. What -- do you mind just reminding me what that number is?", "Robert Knight", "It's about 2,300, 2,200, right in there. Locomotives.", "Chris Wetherbee - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And then just thinking, I guess on kind of that capacity question, when you think about kind of the lengths, and I know you had asked about train length before, but when you think about specific lengths, particularly when you look at the Coal business and you mentioned the real leverage you get from adding additional cars onto existing trains, is there -- other than that, is there other areas that really you may see better opportunities than others within the commodity groups that you move for, for getting extra train length, you're doing a great job in the Intermodal side, I'm just curious about the other commodities right now?", "Dennis Duffy", "We're pretty well set. What we call the Red X, that\u2019s our central corridor where the coal route is, that\u2019s not needing of any train length opportunities there. But we are looking at the run-through capabilities. That would be at the major terminals, Kansas City North flats. The other corridors would be the Pacific North West, I mentioned that. That\u2019s again Intermodal growth, but that also facilitates grain, and our manifest business out of PNW. And we\u2019ll be looking at the Sunset again, and looking at opportunities there to -- can we improve our efficiencies in specific locations. It won\u2019t be any wholesale double-track effort, but there could be pinpoint efforts where we go in and look at, particularly in and around our terminals, to facilitate the through-put capabilities. And then as I mentioned also, El Paso East, that is also a mixed corridor, that we would look at this for some additional investment there.", "Chris Wetherbee - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "One final question just for Jim. From your perspective, anything you're seeing different from a customer standpoint, the way they\u2019re positioning themselves over the last four to six weeks with some of the choppiness we\u2019re seeing on the economic front?", "James Young", "Well, I think there's a concern about sustainability here on the economy, which we all have, whether you\u2019re -- regardless what business you\u2019re in. What we do see with customers, again, they really value the service. You think about managing inventories, and what the railroad\u2019s been able to do, we're in markets today that if you\u2019re going to try to run tight inventories, you may not have been in three years ago. So our job here is to make certain we really perform service-wise and sell that value proposition. And get ready, I\u2019ll tell you, still -- while there\u2019s a concern on the economy, we still have many customers asking us, \u201cAre you ready for peak?\u201d \u201cAre you ready to handle volume?\u201d So I'm looking forward to continued growth here.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jon Langenfeld with Robert W. Baird.", "Benjamin Hartford", "This is Ben Hartford in for John. I just wanted to first look at the leverage potential. And when we think about incremental margins going forward in the coming quarters, expect that to slow. But do you believe that the opportunity remains to continue to drive outsized incremental margins up to the previous peak, still down 10% to 15% below previous peak volumes? So how should we think about that margin potential here in the near term before we kind of set into a run rate where we're capturing roughly half of the inflation on an annual basis?", "James Young", "Well, Ben, I think the way to think about this is the core infrastructure, that\u2019s track, our terminals capacity. We're invested for that 190,000 to 200,000 carload level. So you're going to leverage that as you move up. Our working resources, I think we've said, were probably in that maybe 10% to 15% range or so out there. So we still have very good leverage. Now as I\u2019ve said consistently here, obviously, as you move up the curve you\u2019re going to have to do more hiring, when you look at it. But I think the numbers are very good. It -- the key for us is to stay ahead of this. Again, start thinking about 2011 and 2012 in terms of some incremental investment. But we\u2019re going to have good leverage.", "Benjamin Hartford", "And then on the Intermodal side. From a strategic level service is very good, obviously, you had mentioned tight truck and container capacity. So is that putting any pressure on some of your smaller Intermodal marketing partners from a pricing standpoint? And I guess when you look over the next 12 to 18 months and look at Domestic capacity shortages, does that alter your strategy from a volume versus price balance?", "John Koraleski", "We're always looking at the market implications and pricing, and particularly in the Intermodal world. I would say that it's not -- just because they\u2019re smaller, it probably does put a little more pressure on our smaller Intermodal but -- our IMCs. But actually everybody\u2019s short of equipment, the large IMCs as well as the small. And we\u2019re trying our very best to ensure that everybody gets equipment to meet their needs. So it's a tight market. A tight market like that always says there's some pricing opportunity for us. We still have some contractual obligations to work our way through here. But we do see that as an opportunity for us going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So in terms of I guess a couple things just on the expense side. And I understand you've got good operating leverage still going forward. How much do you think headcount goes up in third quarter? I guess if you look second versus first it was up, I think 400 or so. Is it kind of a similar step up the next couple quarters? And then on train length, just a sense of where you\u2019re at with carload train lengths and what that can get to?", "James Young", "Tom, it's not going to be anything significant on the headcount number. Again, part of this is -- as you think about it right now, any hiring we\u2019re doing today, much of that is looking probably fourth quarter, first half next year, you think about bringing new employees in. And we do have the furlough employees come back to work much quicker. But it will be up but nothing substantial, unless the volume really runs, we\u2019re going to accelerate our hiring. And don\u2019t confuse that with loss of margin here. We\u2019re going to have very good margins and leverage in our business here, at least for the foreseeable future.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then I guess, I think Dennis had talked about train lengths and Intermodal, 107 -- 170 containers can go to 200. What about in the carload network, is there any sense you can give in terms of average size of cars and what that could get to?", "Dennis Duffy", "Well, Tom, the only thing I can tell you is you can expect to see continuous improvement in all of our categories. The manifest side, we have plenty of room for growth, we\u2019re setting records on that now, with our DPU trains and our longer trains. We\u2019re doing the same thing with bulk, working with our customers and Jack\u2019s team to extend those out. That\u2019s not as rapid a growth rate, but you can expect to see manifest trains and Intermodal trains and auto trains continue to increase. When I quote those numbers, I\u2019m quoting you the scheduled network, and that is -- that has increases expected across-the-board.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "If I can slip one more in here for Jack. On the Intermodal revenue per unit, was up quite a bit sequentially, I think almost 5%. You've got the ramp with Pacer and I don't know how much the UMAX ramps but you think you could have peak season surcharges. Is it fair to think that, that absolute number for Intermodal keeps ramping up, Jack?", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Yes, Tom, I think that you\u2019re going to continue to see that improve over time.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Flower with Macquarie Securities[ph] [Macquarie Research] .", "Scott Flower - Banc of America Securities", "Tell me a little bit, with what you\u2019re seeing in Washington and where that stands, is rail reform just  sort of in holding pattern because there\u2019s so many other issues going on in Washington and they\u2019re just more focused on the politicians\u2019 minds? Or help me a little bit to where you see that going.", "James Young", "Well, I think the discussions have continued but you\u2019re at a phase right now that I think they\u2019re kind of reevaluating where they\u2019re at overall. And we're ready to work with -- we have been very active. I think again, the members I talked to involved with this, they know the stakes are very high in terms of any type of legislation, what it could mean. And nobody wants to get it wrong. There's one thing this industry\u2019s done, and we continue to show that, you've had more new investment going to the rail industry in the last six, seven years than in a long time. So we\u2019ll see what happens here. You've got a lot of things going on in Washington today, and I would argue this clearly isn't on the top of the priority list, but we take it serious and we\u2019re going to continue to be -- to work with them.", "Scott Flower - Banc of America Securities", "And then I know that Jack gave us some nice charts on stockpiles. Are we seeing sort of more normal movements out of the PRB, or is this going to be a lag effect to stockpiles coming down to more normal levels, or might they even go slightly below normal before you start to see a greater pickup in sort of the volumes out of the PRB on the coal side?", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Scott, we've already seen, I mean second quarter we ran about 30 trains out of the PRB, today we're running 33. Some demand pickup stockpiles, we're having a great summer right at the moment in terms of heat. So that all plays in our favor. So I think -- I don't really see any strange or out of seasonal pattern. I think we'll continue to see a nice run on coal for a while.", "Scott Flower - Banc of America Securities", "Do you think you're at normalcy now, or does it pick up from here?", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "For the time being we're at normalcy but as those stockpiles -- I mean for the last couple of\u2026", "Scott Flower - Banc of America Securities", "Trust me, the last six weeks.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Yes, the last six weeks are any indication of what's to come, I think you\u2019ll probably see it pick up.", "James Young", "Hold on here a minute. You\u2019ve got to be careful on normalcy. If you go back about three, four years ago, we were running 38 plus trains a day out of the PRB. We\u2019re invested for a number higher than that.  So we\u2019re sitting here running, what, 33, 34 right now, which is a huge amount of excess capacity up there. So we\u2019re a long ways away from what the production and investment capability is out of the mines. Again, I think that\u2019s a good example is coal, if you believe coal will pick up over time here, you\u2019re going to lever that business very nicely.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Jim, during the earlier part of the call, you mentioned, I guess, maybe at least four or five times kind of during the Q&A, you've got to watch out for volumes, watch out for volumes. But then you went -- I think Jack went through one of them and kind of highlighted all the stuff that's going on about building into peak. So I guess, are you anticipating a big peak, and then you\u2019re concerned with what drops off after? I'm just trying to get where you\u2019re -- or are you just being conservative overall? I\u2019m just trying to get a read on why the kind of repeated commentaries there?", "James Young", "Ken, I'm probably being a little conservative, but on the other hand the visibility is very tough right now. And Jack, in talking with the customers, we -- they\u2019re -- you can look at, as he talked to you, some of the positive areas that are out here. But we\u2019ve been surprised before. We have to be -- we kind of use the term very agile, in terms of the economy, where it\u2019s going. As Bernanke said yesterday, things are very uncertain going forward. So we\u2019re cautious in terms of our outlook. I would say today though, if you add up the positives right now, they lean a little more on the positive side in volume than the negative.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Jack, you guys have been really aggressive, I guess, in getting some of these legacy contracts done. Even some maybe even earlier than expected which was, I guess, a good move over the long-term for you. Things like UMAX and the Pacer contracts. Are there any of the big coal contracts or other legacy ones that are due in, I guess, 2012, 2013, that any discussions that have opened up ahead of time?", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Ken, we're always talking to our customers and without getting into specifics, if an opportunity opens itself up and the customer\u2019s interested and we can have a meeting of the minds, we would be more than happy to have those discussions with them. But that's an ongoing process for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "I just wanted to come back to the OR. So you sort of suggest that you feel pretty confident about the second half OR. And I think as a longer term target you've got for 2012 low 70%s. It seems in light of this performance and the way things are trending that, that would be conservative. Am I thinking about that the right way?", "James Young", "Well, at this point in time here, Bill, I mean I\u2019m -- hard to argue that logic. But we\u2019re not providing guidance going forward. Yes, the potential\u2019s here. We\u2019re -- again as I said, my conclusion, I think we\u2019re starting to see what the UP franchise can really do. And a key here, obviously, will be continued volume growth. But I feel good about our possibilities down the road.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "I want to also just ask about the Washington issues one more time. Just as you think about this stuff potentially not going through, because we're clearly running out of time left in this Congress, is there a risk that the rails end up sort of in the penalty box kind of for having been involved in this discussion? Where if you guys wanted to get something positive out of Congress, maybe the key legislators are going to say, sorry, you didn't play ball with us there, and we're not playing ball with you here?", "James Young", "I don't want to speculate any kind of the mindset, particularly when you have new members sitting up there next year. Our focus from day one is to work with the staff, help them understand our issues. We have spent a tremendous amount of time. And it's across-the-board. I mean the C.O.s have been very active in terms of helping people understand really a very complicated issue. And I tell you, Bill, I've not met a member yet that is not -- their goal is to figure out how you put more business on the freight railroad. And they don't want to screw it up, so we'll see. I think our industry, I don't think we've got a great story to tell you. Look at new investment. Think about the jobs potential. Last thing any member wants to hear up here is we\u2019re cutting capital and eliminating jobs. And that's what's at stake here if this -- if whatever comes out is wrong.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "I just wanted to make sure, I guess, that rails weren\u2019t being viewed as an obstructionist in this.", "James Young", "I suppose you could probably find somebody that says we are. But we are -- the stakes are too high.  I think overall, though, there is no question except, like I said, we\u2019ve been -- we have been at least cooperate in the discussion. We\u2019ve been very straight on the risks that are out there. And at the end of the day, though, the stakes are so high, we\u2019ve got to be -- take this very, very serious in terms of where we\u2019re going.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Larkin of Stifel Nicolaus.", "John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just following on the Washington line of questioning here. You\u2019ve mentioned that in your conversation with some of the members of Congress that they would like to see a larger market share shifting over to the railroads. Over the last couple of years there\u2019s been some talk of an investment tax credit, perhaps you could apply to incremental capacity investments and that sort of thing. Are there any other programs that have come up in those discussions that could be advantageous in facilitating a transfer of market share from say the highway over to rail?", "James Young", "Well, I would tell you one thing right now is to take the uncertainty off the table, in terms of when we think long-term investment. The only way you're going to grow here is you've got to think investment long-term. And one of the things I point out to members is when you create an environment that's uncertain in the long-term, you start to get cautious in capital. The investment tax credit is still on the table, that's out there. That's probably a long shot. The fact of the matter is if they let this industry continue to move forward as we have, they're going to see more investment, more volume going forward.", "John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just maybe a longer term question involving the coal business. I know the AAR is concerned that cap and trade light could get passed here perhaps even in a -- what would amount to a lame-duck session after election day. Is that something you're concerned about? It sounds to me like you feel like you've got huge upside in terms of the capacity that's available in the PRB, but could that be perhaps never utilized if some sort of legislation gets passed later in the year?", "James Young", "John, we paid cash into it. Obviously, what\u2019s at stake with coal, I'm not going to speculate what can happen in a lame-duck session. We take it serious. Lots of things can happen. I just have a tough time looking at this country walking away from coal when it generates half of the energy, electricity production in America. So we're involved. But we'll see what happens here. Our focus has been one coal\u2019s going to be part of the equation. Technology\u2019s got to be also part of the solution to help coal go forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Newcrest.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Newcrest Capital Inc.", "I wanted to ask a question about Slide 15, where you detail your volume variability. And I think if I've read this correctly, it looks like your yards and local starts were up only 1% versus that 18% gain in volume, which would seem like a pretty exceptional result. So I wonder if you could just speak about some of your local initiatives?", "John Koraleski", "Well, a good portion of that, it is related to the train length that we mentioned, Cherilyn. They -- across-the-board. We also have initiatives in all of our terminals. When you say the yard and local was only up 1%, we have huge terminal improvement initiatives using our continuous improvement group, our lean concepts, crossed all of our major terminals. We had mentioned previously, before we'd shut down about -- or severely curtailed about 30 yards, that\u2019s still in the 24 to 25 area. We've been all over, over time, curtailing that. So car repairs, mechanical, engineering on the transportation side, every one of them have productivity initiatives that help contribute to that and help us keep those crude starts and train starts down. But a big leverage item, and we\u2019re continuing to focus on, is that train length. Put that additional volume and existing trains.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Newcrest Capital Inc.", "And then last one for me, I believe you mentioned last quarter that you wouldn't feel totally confident in the recovery unless some of your industrial product categories started to participate more fully. And I just wonder if you could comment, with one more quarter of volume to look at, how you're feeling now versus at the end of last quarter?", "James Young", "Well, I\u2019m still -- I mean our volume\u2019s up 25% to a year ago. But again a year ago is the bottom. I'm still concerned. If you think about what's happening with housing, the housing numbers, obviously, have deteriorated in terms of new housing starts from where we were a quarter ago. But we're feeling better. We still have a long ways to go. And I\u2019ll give you an example. If you take peak lumber loading, I think it was 2005 in a quarter, we loaded about 70,000 loads of lumber. At the bottom we loaded 19,000. Now it has picked up some but it's a long ways away. And again, as Jack mentioned, overall construction just right now is not looking real strong. And we\u2019re -- again, I'm trying to predict the future here. I still believe that until you start seeing the hiring numbers improve, I think it's going to be a tough go for a while.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Kauffman from Sterne Agee.", "Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "This is Sal Vitale on for Jeff Kauffman. Just some quick questions on, first on the pricing side. So pricing x RCAF was up 4.5%. Last quarter I think it was up about 3.5%. What was there any -- what was the main driver of the ramp up? Any particular business segment?", "John Koraleski", "Probably the biggest change, if you recall in our first quarter, we actually had negative pricing in our total Intermodal business. And that\u2019s turned around in the second.", "Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And then on the expense side. Just looking at some of the items here, like equipment rent that was down year-on-year, and I think you mentioned that about $14 million was one-time\u2019ish in nature. What should we expect for the second half, should we -- should that pretty much grow with some relationship to volume? And what should be expect in terms of growth of that line?", "Robert Knight", "That's going to be -- equipment rents are going to follow volume. And that\u2019s direct correlation to how our business grows.", "Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And then just one last one, just a clarification on the other operating expense line, that you said going forward we should be looking at about $175 million or so?", "Robert Knight", "I said around $170 million or so per quarter, yes.", "Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "I think you remember it last -- or on the first quarter call, I think the number that was mentioned was about $200 million and -- per quarter. And you mentioned that about $40 million was due to this -- is it a true-up for the casualty line? And then I think you also mentioned that bad debt expense was -- was that a positive or a negative for the quarter? I'm just trying to reconcile from that $200 million to the reported $122 million.", "Robert Knight", "Yes, I got you. That was a slight positive. But the bigger driver when you compare the first quarter to second quarter was the CSXI payment that we made, which was roughly $45 million in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse Group.", "Allison Landry", "This is Allison Landry in for Chris. I was hoping to talk a little bit more about the productivity gains that you guys have seen, specifically in terms of the gap between volume growth and train starts and GTM. For example, over the past couple of quarters, you've seen train starts trending below volume growth in a range of about 11% to 12% and GTMs consistently at about 4% lower. But my question relates to sustainability. At what point will this gap narrow? And where do you see these spreads trending as volumes come back into the network?", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Well, obviously, as volume continues to increase, we are going to bring back our cost and our assets at a slower pace. And Rob said that, Jim said that, I said that. And it's essentially a process driven across-the-board. We try and leverage everything that we can in our existing service offerings. We use technology in our distributive power. I think we increased our DPU gross tons about like 12% again, quarter-over-quarter, we continue to do that. In the new service offerings, we emphasize with our customers productivity initiatives, putting the right equipment on the right trains. So obviously, the leverage will gradually diminish, but we see upside opportunities for us in the future here. We don't see anything that would stop that from us at this point.", "James Young", "One of the ways to think about this also is what mix can do. We've got a lot of -- the thing of our network, you can run unit trains, like a coal train. Obviously, if that grows, you get a pretty good correlation between train starts and volume there. On the manifest network, which is mixed rate, there's a lot of capacity there. As Dennis was saying, we've got yards, 24 to 25 of our 115 primary yards that are in his sense really shut down. You\u2019ve got freight cars stored. So mix can have a little bit of impact on this. But again, what you\u2019ve got to think here is as you move up that capacity curve, we're going to have great leverage but it will start to shrink some.", "Allison Landry", "And then my other question. We\u2019ve heard that Northeast Utilities stockpiles are actually closer to normal and the Southeastern ones are still pretty high. But just given the relentless heat wave that we've seen here in the Northeast, are you guys moving any of the PRB coal eastward to backfill some of the coal there?", "James Young", "We actually do have a couple of moves that move all the way into the Northeast. And those are moving quite strong, very strong demand for coal. So that's all good things for us.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have approached the end of our allotted time for Q&A session. We just have time for one last question. That question is coming from the line of John Mims of BB&T Capital Markets.", "John Mims - BB&T Capital Markets", "If we look back at kind of Intermodal and peak for -- and the peak levels, can you tell -- can you give me a sense of what your total container pool is now with Hub and Pacer and everybody included?", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "If you look at the entire shooting match, what we own plus what we have tied together with Hub and Pacer, we're probably in the 70,000 container range and -- at the moment. Maybe a tad higher.", "John Mims - BB&T Capital Markets", "And that's including the ones you have on order?", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "No. The ones we have on order -- as I look at it, John, by the time I get to the end of the year, we're going to have probably 57% of the container fleet tied to Union Pacific. And that container fleet is expected to be about 150,000 units in total.", "John Mims - BB&T Capital Markets", "And then one last question. The auto -- your auto industry, it\u2019s 8% of revenue, it\u2019s the smallest group. But when you look at steel, plastics and everything else, it\u2019s feeding in to auto production. What's your total exposure?", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I\u2019ve never -- we\u2019ve looked at it from time to time, it really varies. It\u2019s pretty hard for me to put my finger on that.", "James Young", "John, I think you ought to ask yourself a question, where do you think the auto -- how do you say the sector is going right now. We said, when we came into the area, we got kind of $11-plus million new vehicle sales. I think the forecasts have come down a little bit in terms of the outlook. So I would argue right now with I think you have more upside than you have downside on vehicle sales over the next couple of years.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments.", "James Young", "Well, again, thank you everybody for joining us. I hope you see the real potential year with the Union Pacific Railroad. And we look forward to talking with you with our third quarter earnings release. Thanks again.", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you Mr. Young, you may now begin.", "Jim Young", "Good morning everyone, welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales; Rob Knight, our CFO; and joining us for the first time is Lance Fritz our newly appointed Executive Vice President, Operations. As you all know, Dennis Duffy our Head of Operations since 1998 retired this month. Dennis was a great asset to the UP team helping transform our rail operations and we all wish him the best.", "Now for earnings, in the third quarter we are reporting record results starting with our earnings of $1.56 per share. That's a 54% increase versus the third quarter of 2009 and our most profitable quarter ever. Third quarter operating income was a record $1.4 billion, a 46% increase. Similarly to last quarter, we achieved volume growth across each of our six business teams.", "Total third quarter car loadings were up about 14% to more than $2.3 million, that's our highest level in two years but still 9% below our peak in 2007. As business levels on Union Pacific continue to grow, we're providing excellent service to our customers as recognized by a new best in quarterly customer satisfaction.", "We're utilizing proceessees, technology and our commitment to excellence to safely and efficiently deliver the service product customers expect from Union Pacific. We combined strong volume growth, pricing gains and great operating efficiency to produce a record operating ratio of 68.2%. This is 5.6 points better than last year's record performance and our second consecutive quarter under 70. It's very rewarding to report another record performance on behalf of Union Pacific who provide great service to our customers everyday.", "As business levels increased on our railroad, we are leveraging our capital investments and delivering on the customer commitments and potential of the UP franchise. So with that let me turn over to Jack to walk through the performance of our business gains. Jack?", "Jack Koraleski", "Thanks James and good morning. Well with excellent service in an improved economy our third quarter volume increased 14% as all six businesses again posted gains. Our core price came in at about 5.5% with improvement in each of the six groups. Those price gains combined with a boost from increased fuel surcharge revenue and offset by some negative mix produced a 6% increase in average revenue for car overall.", "Stronger volume and improved revenue for car drove freight revenue up 21% for the quarter, pushing itself up over the $4 billion mark for the first time since fourth quarter of 2008.", "The strength of our value proposition was reflected in our customer satisfaction scores where we set a new best ever quarterly mark of 90. Satisfaction actually improved as we moved through the quarter even as volume grew heading into peak season. In September, we scored a 91 setting our new best ever month.", "So with that let me walk you through the performance in each of our six businesses. Ag products revenue grew 16% of 7% volume growth combined with an 8% increase in average revenue per cost.", "Strong worldwide demand for US wheat, corn and soybeans drove over 47% increase in wholegrain exports. That strong pull of the export led to a slight reduction in our domestic shipments. Ethanol continues to be the most significant driver of growth in our green product segment with volume up 1500 cars or about 9%.", "Growth in DDGs also continued with volume up 4% including meal shipments were up 23%. Last but not least strong US demand for Mexican beer led to a 22% increase in import beer volumes.", "Our automotive revenue grew 36%, as an 18% increase in volume combined with a 16% improvement in average revenue per car which reflects some of the contracts that we have re-priced over the recent past.", "Volume gains were the result of a 32% increase in finished vehicle shipments as production levels in 2010 continue to closely match vehicle sale. With around 50% of our finished autos and parts business moving to and from Mexico, the flooding in Mexico and South Texas and the aftermath of Hurricane Alex resulted in supply chain disruptions that led to flat volume in our vehicle parts business.", "Our chemicals volume grew 9% which combined with a 5% improvement in average revenue per car produced a 14% increase in revenue. Fertilizer volume was up 26% largely on the strength of export potash. Continued strong demand for finished lubricant and fuels produced an 18% increase in petroleum shipment. The start-up of the unit train service as well as incremental manifest business to unloading terminal that St. James, Louisiana drove an 80% increase in volume in the emerging crude oil segment of this market.", "Plastics car loading were up 7% with growth and domestic shipments and movements to storage and transit more than offsetting a decline in export volumes and industrial chemical shipments grew 5% boosted by increased industrial production and a return to more normal inventory levels.", "Turning to coal, our energy revenue was up 11% as volume grew 1% and average revenue per car increased 10. The fourth hardest summer on record and the increased demand for electricity that comes with a stronger economy drove 4% growth in southern part of river basin tonnage.", "By the end of August the SPRB stockpiles were actually slightly below normal levels having declined to an estimated 53 days of burn, down from 75 days at the same time last year. Unfortunately, demand for Colorado and Utah coal continued to be weak, contributing to a 12% decline in volume.", "Coal stock piles remain above normal in this market, which faces strong competition not only from Eastern coal sources but also from natural gas conversions in the East. Additionally production downtime associated with relocating mining equipment to other reserves reduced coal supply and will most likely continue into 2011. Industrial products revenues grew 25% of the 20% increase in volume combined with a 4% improvement in average revenue per car.", "With a stronger auto industry and increased drilling activity driving demand for steel, our steel and scrapped car earnings grew 44%. Non-metallic mineral shipments were up 38% and that increased drilling activity also translates into demand for (frac) sands, ferrites and bentonite. Hazardous waste shipments were up 101%, again driven by year-over-year growth of uranium tailings for the Department of Energy. Despite solid profitability, this high volume low revenue per car short haul movement has a significant negative mix effect on overall industrial products where average revenue per car would actually have been 8% if we excluded the impact of the uranium tailings move.", "Last but not least, while there's been little improvement in construction related markets our rock shipments were up 20%, supported by drilling related construction. Our lumber and cement shipments were actually down year-over-year. A 24% increase in intermodal volume combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per unit to drive intermodal revenues up 34%. International intermodal volume grew 30% as improved consumer demand and some inventory replenishment led to a strong peak season.", "We also benefited from share gains by our largest ocean carrier. Excellent service, that's competitive with single driver truck in major lanes, continues to attract highway conversions, driving a 16% growth in our domestic intermodal segment. Our streamlined subsidiaries, door-to-door product grew 70% with about half of that growth coming off the highway. For our international segment, average revenue per unit was up 4% with price gains and fuel recovery partially offset by a combination of negative mix as more revenue moved back to the west coast to address the shortage of boxes in Asia and our last remaining international intermodal legacy contract continued to grow.", "A 17% improvement in average revenue per unit for domestic intermodal shipments reflects the improved price performance and better fuel surcharge recovery made possible by the elimination of our legacy contracts as well as the new product offerings in both our EMP and UMAX box programs.", "As we look to the rest of the year, the diversity of our business is again emerging as the strength. We should continue to see volume growth even if some markets are struggling to show some signs of recovery. With no indication of any dramatic change up or down in the economy our run rate should hold until we see the normal softening as peak season winds down and the end of year approaches.", "Tight truck supply will create opportunities not only in intermodal but our carload business as well and a strong value proposition built on great service will put us in a good position to capitalize on opportunities across all six businesses. Coal price improvements will combine with volume gains to drive our revenue growth.", "Let me just give a quick overview of some of the specific growth drivers that we expect to see in the fourth quarter. In our industrial products business they look to have the most upside with the best opportunities in markets that are benefiting from improved auto production, increased drilling activity and hazardous waste disposal.", "International and domestic intermodal segments will continue to drive growth with some indications that the international peak maybe slightly longer than we had originally thought. Fall demand for fertilizers is expected to be stronger than last year and petroleum should also post gains with growth in crude oil shipments to (St. James) and increased residual fuel oil moves. It also looks like industrial chemicals and soda ash are going to hold their current run rate so that will close the year stronger than a year ago.", "Increased electrical demand and the expectation of inventory replenishment following a hot summer are expected to keep our coals trains moving and while feed grain exports will likely not be able to match last year's near record levels; wheat exports should provide a nice boost to our Ag products businesses we closed the year and moved into next.", "Finally, we expect our automotive run rate to hold steady as sales are forecast to stay in the mid $11 million range through the end of the year with production slightly ahead of the fourth quarter of last year. So, that's how we see the quarter shaping up and with that, I'll turn it over to Lance for his report on operation planned.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you Jack and good morning. Let me start today with safety which is where our operating team starts everyday. Through the month of September, the employee reportable injury rate is at 1.36, a 6% improvement versus last year. With safety, we focus on continuous improvement towards the ultimate goal of zero incidents. We also emphasis severity to lessen the impact both to the employee and the company.", "In addition of the human and financial benefits running a safe operation enhances service and productivity. Training is especially important today in the onboarding process as we bring employees back from furlough who haven't worked for us for a year or more. And as our hiring efforts increase, our ability to put new employees in the train service with a safety mindset is crucial.", "Turning now to service. Our service score card for the quarter is illustrated on slide 15. As carloads grew almost 5% from July to September, our service delivery index remained near record levels and velocity increased through the quarter by applying the principals of the unified plan and utilizing available resources, we absorbed the increased workload on the network while maintaining excellent customer service.", "I'll talk more about productivity in a moment but we continue to see the benefits that volumes brings to our network. Our high service levels were challenged by Hurricane Alex and its impact on South Texas. Traffic was embargoed over the Laredo and Brownsville gateways for most of the month of July which normally handles nearly 50% of our north south Mexico traffic.", "In addition, Eagle Pass our second busiest crossing point was closed for a week before we were able to start using it as a relief valve for our customers. We demonstrated network resiliency as service improved from August to September once we put the Hurricane behind us.", "Dialing it down a level, the local operating teams are doing an outstanding job on the basic blocking and tackling of local service. They established operating plans that meet customer commitments, communicate with customers and then execute those plans. One of those blocking and tackling elements is captured by industry spot and pull which came in more than five percentage points better than last year even though we tightened the measure.", "Consistent with Jack's discussion on record customer satisfaction, local customer satisfaction is also at an all time best. Different from the broader customer satisfaction measure, this survey solicits its feedback from customers we interact with daily at the shipping and receiving docks where the accuracy and reliability of our industry cruise is critical.", "Quality services also cost efficient. In the third quarter we leveraged volume through our transportation plant, increasing car loadings faster than cruise starts as volumes grew 14% in the quarter versus only an 8% increase in total crew starts.", "Let me give you a few example. First, gross ton miles per employee increased 9% in the quarter as we utilized more employee resources to handle the increased volume, but not on a one-for-one basis. In fact this our strongest quarter of employee productivity in almost seven years. Train length increased for almost every train type with intermodal and auto up 8% and 6% respectively versus last year and with intermodal train length we hit both a quarterly record of 170 units and a monthly record of a 171. Increasing train length enables us to control train inventory levels which is critical to velocity and service.", "Freight car utilization also remains strong in a quarter despite a nearly 3% increase in the length of haul. Prudent use of our working resources enables us to leverage volume. This slide gives us a quick status update.", "In terms of employees, we still have 1100 on furlough. While recall rates have averaged better than 80% this year, the current furlough pool has been out of work since late 2008. So we expect only about half of these to return to service. Because of this, we are ramping up our hiring efforts system wide for 2011.", "Our locomotive resources are still in good supply although the average age of the remaining surplus fleet is about 26 years and we have fully deployed our DPU locomotives. And our freight car storage numbers currently around 30,000 a biggest change since the second quarter is demand for covered hoppers to support export grain demand. Although it's normal for us to have stored cars as a result of seasonality, we would expect the more normal storage number to be around 10,000 to 20,000.", "As we approach the end of 2010, I would like to update you on the progress of our capital program. We are still targeting approximately $2.6 billion spend this year but the allocation of that spend has changed the level. Replacement capital accounts for about 70% of the total with the bulk of that devoted to infrastructure.", "Those programs are basically on plan and we see the benefits of that in both our safety performance as well as in 20% reduction in slower to miles year-over-year.", "We successfully completed work on the new Joliet Intermodal Terminal which opens for business in August. We are purchasing 9,200 intermodal containers and the necessary chassis to support this growing business. And we are acquiring 625 new covered hoppers. Probably the biggest change from prior estimates is that our 2010 PTC spending will only be around $100 million versus in $200 million originally targeted.", "We remain committed to meeting the mandated installation dates but the deployment of this developing technology is a challenge. We have encountered delays in design work and material availability all related to the fact that this technology is not available off the shelf.", "Another changes that we recently resumed to working on our Sunset Corridor which with plans to lay about 16 more miles of double track by year end. When this is cut over, the 760 mile route will be about 63% complete with more to come in 2011. Our mission going forward is to continue executing on disciplined operating plan that delivers a high quality efficient service product for our customers.", "An important element in achieving that goal is to reduce variability in our network. Running a 3200 mile outdoor factory it means that Mother Nature and external forces can introduce any number of unplanned events on a daily basis. Because of that it's critical that we take the variability out of our operations and take charge of those things that we control. Along with increasing network reliability, we will continue our evergreen productivity initiatives, and of course everything we do to deliver efficient high quality service is done with a safety mindset making sure that everyone who works for does business with or interacts with us does so safely. So with that I will turn it over to Rob to take you through our financial performance.", "Rob Knight", "Thanks, Lance and good morning. Today we are following up our record second quarter results with an even stronger third quarter performance. Slide 22 provides a quick summary of third quarter revenues and expenses. Operating revenue increased 20% to $4.4 billion as operating expenses grew only 11% to $3 billion.", "This translated into 46% operating income growth through a record $1.4 billion. Over the course of 2010, we have demonstrated strong volume leverage which is driving higher profits and better margins. Increased year-over-year diesel fuel prices have been the biggest cost driver for the year and contributed roughly one-third of the quarter's operating expense increase. Third quarter other income increased $11 million versus 2009 to $25 million largely as a result of lower environmental costs as well as higher licensing and rental incomes.", "Interest expense totaled $153 million; down $3 million versus 2009 as average debt level were slightly lower year-over-year. Income taxes increased 62% to $495 million as a result of higher pre-tax earnings as well as a higher tax rate. Our third quarter 2010 effective tax rate was 38.9% which was 1.7 points higher than 2009. Net income was at quarterly best of $778 million up 51%.", "Earnings per share increased to 54% to a $1.56 per share. Resuming our share we purchase program in May, reduced our outstanding share balance 2% in the quarter, enabling our earnings growth to outpace the rate of net income increases. Of course a key component of these strong results is a focus on increasing our core rail transportation pricing. Consistent with our discussions about improving prices in 2010, third quarter core price came in around 5.5%.", "Our legacy renewals increased demand and quality service all support the strong value proposition of Union Pacific. Included in our core pricing gains is the impact of higher year-over-year fuel increases which contributed a little more than a half point in the quarter. This contribution level has been pretty steady throughout 2010. As we close out the year, we continue to feel very positive about our future pricing opportunities and are committed to achieving real pricing gains that will drive higher returns.", "Now let's discuss the expense details starting with compensation and benefits at $1.1 billion in the third quarter, a 9% increase versus last year. Roughly half of the higher year-over-year expense relates to wage and benefit inflation. We're also seeing higher costs as trains starts increase, generating more starts for employees as well as paying more for overtime and training expenses.", "In addition, equity and incentive compensation was a little higher year-over-year, driving about 10% of the increase. Offsetting a portion of these higher costs is our strong employee productivity. We handled a 14% increase in seven day car loadings with virtually no change in our total workforce levels. We did add about 9% to our train and engine ranks but that was largely offset by decreases in other areas.", "Through a combination of our capital investments, technology and unified planned initiatives, we are handling more volume more efficiently. As Lance mentioned, we plan to continue recalling furloughed employees as needed for volume and attrition. We also anticipate further hiring as volumes grow and we exhaust the furlough pools across the system. Third quarter fuel expense totaled $608 million, a 30% increase versus 2009. Increased year-over-year fuel prices were the primary driver of the higher expense adding $97 million for the quarter. Higher volumes were also a factor adding about $42 million.", "Our efforts to reduce overall fuel usage did help offset a portion of the quarterly cost as our consumption rate improved 1%. Slide 26 provides a summary of the third quarter expenses for three separate categories. Purchase services and material expense increased $52 million in the quarter or 13% to $465 million. Much of this increase relates to greater contract service expense associated with year-over-year volume gains. As our intermodal business continues to grow, trucking and lift costs are higher. And as we return more stored locomotives to service, both contract services and materials expense increased.", "Equipments and other rents expense increased just 1% or $2 million to $292 million. The biggest increase in the quarter was car hire expenses associated with increased finished vehicles and intermodal shipments, largely offsetting this lower lease expense for locomotives and freight cars.", "Other expense totaled $178 million consistent with the guidance that we previously gave you down $1 million versus the third quarter 2009. As we have discussed the last several quarters, this category continues to benefit from our strong safety performance. State and local taxes mostly driven by higher property taxes came in higher year-over-year.", "For the fourth quarter, we think that other expense will be around the third quarter levels. UP's third quarter operating ratio came in at a new best ever level of 68.2%, 5 points, 6 points better than last year. This is our second consecutive quarter with a sub 70 operating ratio as we continue to drive improvements across all aspects of our operations. Our ability to efficiently move growing business volumes at better pricing and better fuel surcharge recovery is driving greater profitability for Union Pacific. This is consistent with our commitment to improve overall returns in our business as well as achieving the goals of our private operating ratio initiative.", "Along with Union Pacific's increased profitability comes greater cash generation. Through the first nine months of 2010, cash from operations totaled $3.1 billion up more than $700 million compared to 2009. Free cash flow after dividends is up substantially as well, totaling over $1 billion even as we support our 2010 capital program and increased the dividend 22%.", "We're also continuing to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We are being opportunistic with our program, buying back more than 14 million shares year-to-date for a total of over a $1 billion. Through September, our average 2010 purchase price was around $72.50 per share and roughly $65 per share over the life of the program. Our commitments to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating are also still very much in focus. Our adjusted debt to cap ratio of 44% is in the range it supports the rating we believe is appropriate for our business. Let me rap things up with a few thoughts on the fourth quarter.", "As Jack discussed earlier, we see solid year-over-year volume growth opportunities to close out 2010 even against our toughest comparison of the year. Of course normal seasonal trends are expected to hold which would likely produce a seven day volume run rate in the fourth quarter that is below the third quarter level.", "With carload growth, we expect continued leverage although against a tough comparison as well. As you heard from Lance, we have largely depleted our furlough pools so it will be necessary to ramp up some of our hiring programs to handle more business as well as backfill for attrition. We also have the additional cost in more locomotives and freight cars and service as well as slightly higher fuel costs. Against those cost headwinds, we believe we can still achieve strong productivity as well as see the benefit of ongoing pricing gains.", "Overall, we're looking forward to wrapping up 2010 with a strong fourth quarter performance. We're keeping an eye on the economy, particularly as we start putting together our plans for 2011. And while car loading activity certainly drives the direction of our earnings, cash flows and returns, we are committed to creating value for our shareholders. With that I'll turn it back to Jim.", "Jim Young", "Thanks, Rob. With just a couple of months remaining this year, it's probably safe to say that we are on pace to make this our best area for our railroad. As the economy continues to grow, we are ready to safely and reliably call more freight. The infrastructure investments we've made over the last several years enable us to operate more productively and with greater reliability.", "With that comes better service for our customers which increases UP's value preposition and financial returns. The men and women of Union Pacific are dedicated to serving our customers, delivering the goods that are vital to our nation. It's been our business for almost 150 years and we look forward to continuing that success in the future. So with that let's open it up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Soon I will be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Just wanted to get a little feel for the financial impact of Hurricane Alex it sounds like it was pretty disruptive down on the Mexican border, could you share with us how much that may have impacted the operating ratio?", "Jim Young ", "Clearly there was an impact on the numbers but it was relatively minor on the cost I mean the bigger issue for me was maintaining the customer service and commitments to our customers or when you have that border closed we had many of our auto facilities who were at risk closing down because of parts and now our team did a good job of keeping things moving. We got a great feedback back from our customers.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "So the profitability was perhaps shifted from July into August and September?", "Jim Young", "There is probably some shift as Jack had mentioned on the auto parts if you look at it, auto parts were flat year-over-year and some of that may have gone highway when you look at it but again it was relatively minor.", "John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus", "Then maybe as a follow on perhaps for Jack. Jack had mentioned that the intermodal peak seems to be less than perhaps a little longer than you originally talked about. There has been a lot written in the press about the peak being pulled forward. Any thoughts as to when that's going to be tailing off and whether or not the retailers perhaps ordered a bit too much and will end up with overstock inventories which could potentially slow intermodal down as we get into the early part of next year?", "Jack Koraleski", "You know John, it's pretty early to tell the jury still out and whether or not they've ordered too much. What our intermodal ocean carriers have told us is at least some of them have told us they expect their ships to be relatively full for as much as another 60 days which usually by now you are starting to see the percentage of capacity starting to look down a bit, so that's pretty good news for us and we are watching very carefully in terms of the inventory sales ratios and things like that there is certainly nothing better that alarms us and tells us that we are going to be heading on a downturn here. So we are feeling pretty optimistic right now.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Edward Wolfe with Wolfe Trahan & Company. Please proceed with your question, sir.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Company ", "It's Scott Group in for Ed. If I look at margins of the past five or six years or so, fourth quarter tends to be a little bit better than third quarter. Rob, you talked about some cost headwinds coming in fourth quarter, do you think that dynamic place that differently this year and fourth quarter margins are worse than third quarter?", "Rob Knight ", "I mean a lot of things can happen in the fourth quarter to us whether in volume is obviously will be a key driver. So, it's not always true that the fourth quarter is better, I mean in fact I think it's probably 50-50 to be honest if you kind of looked at a longer historical and recall that last year, we had a fairly sizeable, favorable adjustment on the PI, personal injury and asbestos So, we're not making projections in terms of how that's going to play out this year but just keep that in mind as you look at (inaudible) versus last year's fourth quarter.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Company", "And then, Rob, I didn't hear the breakout of fuel and mix and overall on the business and I'm wondering if there was any negative mix impact in intermodal. I guess we were just a little surprised that yields or revenue per car was flattish from second quarter despite putting in some rate increases and some peak surcharges.", "Rob Knight", "Yeah, overall we said that fuel contributed to our overall arc about five points and there was overall negative mix of about three or four points which is a result of the strong growth in overall and intermodal and some of the mixed impact that Jack talked about in our industrial products line. Jack, if you want to talk about the intermodal specifics.", "Jim Young ", "This is Jim. I think you need to look at the charge Jack had in there to join the core price numbers and that really takes the mix out of the equation. The fact of the matter is our core pricing numbers were up compared to second quarter. You really do have to watch with the mix on an average revenue per car basis as we committed our core price was up.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Company", "And anything specific in intermodal?", "Jim Young ", "If you just looked at intermodal, Scott, the only thing that was a mix impact is the strength of the international business where we still have a legacy contract impact there and that grew quite well in the third quarter which created some negative mix but we still had positive price in both our domestic and our international business.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Company", "So that's stronger international is masking some of the strength that in the domestic rate increases you put out?", "Jim Young ", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with question.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "First question is on, you guys are doing a great job obviously on the operating leverage side with excellent productivity, I think Lance you mentioned best since seven years on the employee productivity, my question is on the sustainability of that and obviously you've run through your furloughs pool, you are going to be hiring, potentially hiring new employees that presumably need a little bit more training, what is the sustainability of your, of this operating leverage trend and do you think that productivity level gets worse with more volumes or stays the same or might even get better with higher volume.", "Rob Knight", "Sure, as we look forward, Walter, we don't see any reason why productivity can't be sustained now that doesn't mean that's fairly sustained at the same rate as we've seen through this year as volume first started returning. For the long run we anticipate we going to continue to be able to use our assets productively, both employees as well fixed assets.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "But some of those ratios could come down as we continue with higher volumes.", "Rob Knight", "It's reasonable to expect that the ratios start slowing down a little bit.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay", "Jim Young", "Its still going to be, Walter, there are still good ratios and I will give you an example, we are hiring now for next year. You are going to see more people in the classroom getting trained, its all assumption next year but and its not a linear relationship, the cost in this business are kind of the step function out here but even though you will see some of those cost increases we are still going to have very good leverage.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "Second question here, I guess Jim on regulation, obviously this is an election year, it's not going to be the re-reg Surface Transportation Board or Reauthorization Act is not going to be top of mind until this done. When you look out to 2011 and we know your positive view on rail and all the benefits of that offers, but what is your strategy when this starts to creep back up gain in 2011 and listen to what Rockefeller is saying about using regulation that supports the legislation. Can you talk about the railroad industry strategy in 2011 when this starts to re-surface again?", "Jim Young", "Well, it's really no different from where we have been the last couple of years. We are engaged with center to Rockefeller and the main item is tell a story. By any measure when you look at the success of deregulating the industry, it's an absolute great story. You look at new investment that's going into the industry. The private sector and if you agree, the country has an infrastructure problem; there's a lot of private money that's gone into new investments. So keep them engaged, provide great service, keep our customers engaged in terms of where investment is going and also point out if they get it wrong. We'll go backwards in investment; we'll go backwards in job, so\u2026", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets", "So, are you worried about the regulation strategy that he's talked about?", "Jim Young", "I have to tell you, when I think about the problems in this country, I have a hard time seeing where the issues in the railroad are in the top 50 list. It doesn't mean we don't pay attention to it and we stay focus and engaged.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase", "Wanted to ask you a little bit about I guess train lengths, I think you've seen some nice expansion in train lengths particularly in intermodal this year and maybe where you're added you are going to next year, is there still a big opportunity to run longer trains and have a good ratio of volume growth to train starts. Or how would you think about that as a driver of leverage in 2011?", "Lance Fritz", "Tom our train length opportunities still exist as we go into 2011, specific to intermodal, we still have a upside, it depends on where the business comes in terms of the lanes in the quarter that those trains run in, but across the board, across all our product mix, we still have train length opportunities and it still will be an important part of our productivity and business.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase", "Okay and lets see as a follow-up question, on the cost side when I look at comp and benefit, you had pretty good increases on a per worker basis this year. I think a lot of that is incentive comp but you also have transitioned to half year impact from a strong wage increase to this colder period while you're negotiating. How should we think about per worker cost next year when you consider wage and inflation? Is it kind of 2% to 3%, is it a little more than that? Presumably it's a lot lower than what you've seen this year.", "Jim Young", "Hey Tom, first of all, the increase is not a function of incentive comps a big driver. As Rob mentioned, it was of the increase third quarter about 10% of that growth. So take it off the table, yeah obviously we're finally recycling we had 4.5% percent increase on the labor agreement that's out here. We had a lot of overtime and we have been pushing the overtime curve here in terms of absorbing some of the volume that's out of here. Our healthcare cost have jumped up pretty substantially here in third quarter. You look out to the future; our inflation number that we look at it in that 3.5% to 4% range, that's the way you ought to think about. Now that again we still have productivity in our targets when you work in the railroad and your leading department is you offset inflation in terms of productivity, that's obvious.", "Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase", "But you are seeing 3.5% to 4% per worker.", "Jim Young", "It's going to vary of minx. Give an example, it looks what Rob was talking about earlier, we increased our hiring in terms and numbers on [TE&Y] train and engine crew employees. They have a tendency to have the highest average earnings, if you are out running on the railroads, then you can get a mix impact there that will drive that cost up also.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question is from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "Hi, good morning gentlemen. This is actually Brandon Oglenski. Can we talk a little bit about export grains? I know the Russian moratorium came into effect around mid August. I was wondering if you know looking in the 4Q, if there is any equipment or port availability that's really going to limit the growth there. And then secondly, we've seen some activity in your grain tariff. I was wondering if you'll comment a little bit further about that.", "Jack Koraleski", "The second part of your question Brandon, I wasn't clear on.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "We've seen a little bit of activity in the grain tariff and I was wondering if you guys are expecting to monetize a little bit more on the Ag side in the fourth quarter?", "Jack Koraleski", "Yes, okay. You know at this point in time, in terms of equipments supply those kinds of things, we're pretty well equipped and ready to run as Lance said we pulled the C5's and some C4's out of storage. We still have a few more that we could if we need to.", "In terms of overall port disruption, it tends to be episodic actually. There was a problem at the Port of Houston with an electrical outage for four days, some of those kinds of things but overall, ports seem to be running pretty well. So, I don't really see any major obstacles there. Probably Jack it did impact the velocity and if you look at the customer queuing piece in terms of grains.", "Jim Young", "But it is an episodic, its not something fundamental or from an infrastructure perspective that I think will be causing us to miss a forecast or not take advantage of the market opportunity and in terms of the tear up, we're watching that very carefully and we're taking opportunities to increase our rates as necessary and as available to us and being very careful as we think through our commitments to customers and also what the market's done.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "And then, maybe just a little bit further on the labor side, I know you guys said you are going to be looking to hiring a few more people next year. I was wondering if you could balance that against the attrition level that you guys are expressing and maybe give us an idea of how headcounts should be trending.", "Jim Young", "We're going to loose our hiring this year; we're going to end up with about 1700 new hirers into the company. I would expect our fourth quarter employment levels probably to be up a little bit from where we were. We are flat year-over-year. Next year, our attrition numbers are going to run around 3,500 to 4,000.", "We clearly are going to keep. Again, let's assume what are we thinking the economy next year, still pretty cloudy but I still believe we are going to continue kind of slightly positive as you think. So we're going to have a pretty strong hiring program and again, if volume's up and we're probably see our employment numbers up a little bit.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital", "So, somewhat of a one-for-one match there on the attrition rate then?", "Jim Young", "Well, it depends with in some cases we are taking advantage of the attrition in terms of the productivity initiatives when you look at it, we won't hire again if you think what we are telling on the train side and productivity there you won't have a one-for-one with volume there. But again what your assessment, I am not going to make a prediction of volume other than I think its going to be positive and we will be up a little bit next year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jon Langenfeld with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird", "Have you seen any change in the ocean liners attitude as far as sending their international boxes inland and any signal on the horizon that they may or may not change as we go into 2011?", "Jack Koraleski", "Jon, the fundamental change that took place was early in the year when some of the ocean carriers decided the best course of business was to trans load at the port and then turn around and send the boxes back. So that happened nothing really substantive has changed as we have gone through the years, some ocean carriers allow their freight to move inland, others are preferring to trans load on the west coast.", "We did notice particularly this quarter a stronger move of empty boxes back the revenue empties that we move to the west coast was much stronger we said basically they weren't willing to allow the containers to sit and look for a back haul load they would rather export that to Asia so they can turn the box again. But other than that there really hasn't been anything substantive change as we gone through the year.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird", "And then if you think about the intermodal investment you guys have obviously made a number of investments there with the Joliet facility and the further investment in the Sunset Corridor but as you think about the next three to five years what are the incremental in growth investments that you look to make on the intermodal side?", "Jack Koraleski", "Well, Jon in many ways other than an intermodal facility, it's all interrelated. When we look at for example our Sunset Corridor that Lance had talked about that we have started backup are going to do about 16 miles new rail this year. Other products moving that line, so you step back in that network and when we think the next three to five years you have to think that holistically how will all six businesses grow?", "How do you manage the network in terms of the choke points? I'm pretty bullish when I think about the next five years for this business that rail is going to grow each share of total intercity business and we are going to invest accordingly. The key in this business is service and we want to stay ahead of that curve to provide great service, we see value in terms of our yield force and great growth.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird", "And indeed, that you see again on that horizon for the significant terminal build out beyond what you have already done adding on to existing facility?", "Jack Koraleski", "Well, if you are talking intermodal we have some targeted areas, we are looking at I mean we are out right now looking at property for the long-term and we think about what's happened with property values right now. Now is a great time to be in that market when you think strategically.", "You can acquire property and send these vocations at $0.50 on the dollar from where it was three years ago. So we are making acquisitions today that we are looking three, four, five, six years out that we would need.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Allison Landry - Credit Suisse", "Good morning, this is Allison Landry in for Chris. I just had a question regarding the international intermodal you mentioned that you should be seeing continued strengths but the inbound container data for the ports of LA and Long Beach actually declined pretty significantly sequentially in September from August and I was wondering if you could kind of comment on that inconsistency?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes. You know I have not seen that in our numbers.", "Jack Koraleski", "Well, the only issue was in, but this would be in early October, the impact of the typhoon, the three day impact of the typhoon in Asia and then also the Golden Holiday in China but in the September timeframe I didn't see a significant impact on our numbers at all.", "Allison Landry - Credit Suisse", "Okay and then can you remind us when the legacy contract in international intermodal rose over?", "Jack Koraleski", "We don't get into individual contract discussions. ", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with you question.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "I just want to follow up on the incremental margin question, it seems like there's an assumption that they will sort of come down from the 60% rate but you still have more business to re-price and arguably you could theoretically get more productive so is there a case for arguing that they actually stay or even accelerate from here, how do you think about the trajectory of incremental margin?", "Jim Young", "Bill, our comments on that margin were more related to what you think about the productivity levels. We certainly have our facilities on legacy pricing. We have opportunities in terms of when you look at demand but the discussion I was thinking about and as we are talking through is if you are holding pricing firm, how do you think about productivity expanding or contracting the margin and as we've talked earlier as you move up that capacity curve you are going to start to add a few more to costing. And then taking into account what will happen with the pricing numbers, I mean that possibility is clearly there.", "Rob Knight", "Just one of the points to keep in mind as we performed well throughout as the economy turned down the comparisons get more difficult through each quarter. That's just something else that there's a factor in that.", "Jim Young", "Well, and there's another piece there, as you think about we start to push up in that 190000 car range or 195000 what is that thing about overall demand which should say that the better pricing environment overall for capabilities so. Jack in his team have, you know Lance has the challenge of continuing productivity. Jack and his team has the challenge of continuing to drive prices up the reflect demand.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So that actually leads to that second question which is, you've talked for a while now about accelerating pricing and we saw that again this quarter. When does it sort of peak out. Are we there, is there more to go, given the legacy re-pricing and whatnot to come.", "Rob Knight", "Yeah. Bill let me, we just to kind of reset the table here, when we talk about accelerating pricing, that was when we had a 3.5% core price in the first quarter but we said at that point in time which is the only guidance we gave on pricing is that we expected throughout 2010 for that to increase and in fact that's -- in fact what we have seen 5.5% core price in the third quarter I think is evidence of in fact that expectation.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "And you are not saying any things beyond that.", "Rob Knight", "No, that's right.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America", "Let me jump on the coal comments you made earlier. It sounds like you are noting some mining downtimes, some inventory levels being low, any chance for increasing coal export on the West Coast first and then second, it just seems like you're setting yourself up for some pretty improving demand on the coal side, is that what you'd anticipate?", "Jack Koraleski", "Ken we're probably going to do about a million and a half tons in export coal this year but we are working diligently with potential developers of port capacity which is kind of our biggest choke point to move off the West Coast and we're getting some bites there that we think are pretty attractive and pretty interesting. So we're hopeful that we're going to see export coal improve from the Union Pacific franchise perspective. So that will be a good thing and yeah secondly, we saw the impact that weather could have last winter when we went from 75 days, down to basically on plan from a stockpile perspective but right now the way things are shaping up through the first quarter, our coal demand looks pretty solid, much better than where we were a year ago and hopefully that will continue. I hate to say this, everybody in the room will throw daggers at me but I hope we have a nice cold long winter and that will help us again.", "Ken Hoexter - Bank of America", "Let me just get a follow up with Lance on the equipment side. You gave numbers for employees furloughed and cars, what about locomotives still in storage? Just wanted to understand how much you have left and then it sounded like you were reducing your spend on PTC. Is that I guess maybe for Jim, I'll throw it out there, I mean, is it something you are still working with the regulators to say, hey, the technology is just not there, we can't yet meet those deadlines or you would just keep pushing it back and hope things get developed in time for the 2015 deadline.", "Lance Fritz", "In terms of locomotives and storage we've got somewhere between 850 to 900. I'll remind you that those are older locomotives I mentioned in my comments. The average age is 26 years. We've got all of the DPU capable and high efficiency units out and running but we do have 850 plus that are available for that.", "Jim Young", "We did talk about; we are looking at maybe acquiring a 100 new locomotives next year, efficiency emissions requirements long-term that's out of here. On the PTC question, it's a combination of several things in terms of going from $200 to about $100 million, design resources just overall, the complexity of this system, has wounded deployment down a little bit. We are doing everything we can in terms of getting this thing to reality. The regulatory discussion or political discussion will I think happen more next year when (inaudible) is going to be required to kind of meet, we are going to also look at certain checkpoints and you'll look at the feasibility of technology that, unfortunately we're spending a lot of money to try to get it there.", "Rob Knight", "Our expectation is still in that $1.4 billion capital spend for us over the next several years.", "Operator", "Thank you our next question is from the line Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Newcrest. Please proceed with your question.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Newcrest", "I was hoping you could comment on the degree to which you got price visibility for 2011 as we sit today based on contracts that you have rolled?", "Jim Young", "Cherilyn we are not giving guidance on future pricing other than, we think we have the capability to get real price. We are seeing very good yields on new products reporting in the marketplace that directly reflect the service that we put in. I am feeling pretty good about our capability. We have to perform service wise and we need to get the pricing up and returns up if we're going to justify the capital we are putting in.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Newcrest", "Okay my next question was whether you could just comment briefly on your new ad campaign and what you are hoping to achieve with that and whether you've made any sort of accompanying changes organizational to sort of deal with the historical criticism that rails are inflexible and difficult to deal with particularly for customers who aren't big users of rail and small customers.", "Jim Young", "We did quite a bit of research before we kicked the campaign off and guess what, we confirmed what you just said that in a lot of cases, customers have to believe that they don't have a track outside the warehouse, they can do business with railroad or if they don't think they are big enough in terms of doing business with railroad. Or we are tough to deal with.", "The goal of the campaign, there is three objectives. One to really help a very large addressable market, understand that they do have an option for rail and that's a complete logistic solution. So we feel that there is a lot of capability there.", "Second, I want to increase the awareness from the local mayor to state senator about how important rail is in terms of the business we do. As it probably would surprise you, many folks, their experience with rail is they are sitting out of sightings and they don't really see the clarity of how important we are.", "And third for us is employee pride. We've got a lot of leverage going with service and lot of our employees are interested in how do we grow and add jobs into the company long-term.", "So, those three factors come in and play. We have changed the organization, we have got an on boarding team, we have got a new website, terms call it micro site, terms what we are doing. Jack and his team have added resources. The worst thing you do is you put an ad campaign out and customer makes the call and you are frustrated. That's the easiest way to failure. So we are pretty pumped up at, in fact some of the earlier calls, a lot of this is not just intermodal when you think about the capability. There are some of the earlier calls where opportunities in the carload network.", "Operator", "Thank you our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman, Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Kauffman - Sterne Agee ", "Most of our questions have been answered already but we need a quick question on equipment run. On a GTM basis it looks like it was down double digit and 1Q and 2Q and mid single digit in 3Q. Kind of curious is that supposed to grow more in line with volume soon or how should we think about that?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, it should go with volume and you can have a mix effect depending on what equipment it is moving whether its equipment that in fact has rent associated with it or whether its something doesn't. And of course we are always focused on offsetting any increase in equipment risk with productivity. Bottom line is, it will grow with volume but there is a mix effect in there.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.", "Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo", "I guess it's a two part question that I'll count as two questions. Operating margins are 780 basis points better than they were in the third quarter of 2007. I think you said carloads are about 8% or 9% below that level. So if you can bridge us where we are today and then look ahead, price productivity costs were key components of the margin improvement over the last couple of years. How might that mix of those factors change going forward and would you care to bucket then for us historically?", "Jim Young", "I am not going to give specific guidance on the pricing, although clearly you go back two, three years ago we had a bigger book of legacy opportunity. So legacy in terms of driving some of the price was greater then than it is today. But again we still have a nice look at legacy business out there and as I said it earlier, we are seeing very good price capability for the service and value and products we are putting in.", "So, it will be part of the equation going forward here may be a little less than we were in '07. But part of that is your assumption is where volumes are going. You get out there two, three years from now. If you believe as I do that rails got to have a greater share of intercity freight in the demand of growth. I think the pricing number could be pretty strong.", "Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo", "Okay. And then on the productivity side is it fair to say that it wasn't meaningful in '07, '08 whereas right now its very meaningful, how do you want us to think about the productivity piece of it going forward?", "Jim Young", "As you may recall, we've launched an efforts called project operating ratio and in fact one of the things we think service extremely well if we launch that effort prior to the economic downturn, what that effort was as we lifted all 40000 plus of our employees to tackle everything they do from productivity to adding value to customer which we know is important to improve our service and add value on the pricing front.", "So, we felt good coming into that economic downturn certainly by the time of later half of '08 came around. That was well underway and had a lot of momentum. So, yes we have made progress compared to that '07 timeframe but I wouldn't characterize that was the debt of our productivity either.", "Lance Fritz ", "Can I have one thing, the other thing I noticed you look at our key measures from the operating perspective; we have been demonstrating productivity improvement steadily since 2007.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "This is Rob on for Justin. You guys have talked a lot in the past and on this conference call about the improvements you've made on the service front which have driven market conversion on intermodal in particular. How do you think about guaranteeing service levels in an environment where the ocean liners may no longer provide the chassis on intermodal and how do you think about that potential change affecting the intermodal landscape and the ability to provide the service.", "Jim Young", "Your call was breaking up, what was it, is it Rob.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, its Rob, sorry I will repeat it. I guess you guys have talked a lot about the improvements you've made on the service front which has driven market conversion on intermodal in particular, how should we think about your ability to kind of guarantee service levels in an environment where the ocean liners may no longer provide chassis? And how do you think about that kind of impacting the overall network?", "Jim Young", "To the extent that it's necessary we are investing both in boxes and chassis and creating universal chassis pools to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the utilization of that asset. So I think we're covered.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "Sounds good on that front and then if I look at the productivity measures, you guys drove some solid improvement on the gross ton mile per employee, even sequentially from Q2, could you give us a sense, if there is anything incremental that was implemented from Q2 or is it primarily the benefit of the volume leverage?", "Jim Young", "Well, I think the big piece of it is the volume leverage but if you step back a minute, it had also point it goes to things like our unified plan, it goes to our infrastructure investments we made over the years. It goes to coronation between marking operation and the products we're putting in. I mean this is a business that (levers) with volume to a point but you can also reach a point that you start to see negative productivity if you overload the network but the key is managing that network to its maximum efficiency point on the capacity curve.", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "I appreciate the time, I guess the final piece to the question, the tax rate was a little bit higher than we were expecting in the quarter, could you guys comment what we should be thinking about for Q3?", "Rob Knight", "From Q3", "Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank", "From Q3 to Q4 rather.", "Rob Knight", "Yeah, and by the way in the third quarter it was a little higher when it was related to state taxes and the timing issues within some of the states, so looking forward I would bank on around a 38% rate.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question is from the line of George Pickral of Stephens Incorporated. Please proceed with your question sir.", "George Pickral - Stephens Incorporated", "Lance one question for you. Of the 30,000 containers, cars that are still parked, is there any one specific type that you may have more of the part versus another, I think you mentioned you are actually buying covered hoppers and intermodal container so I imagine you've got little to none of those parked right now.", "Lance Fritz", "Yeah the mix of what's stored right now in terms of freight cars varies of course you know with lumber down we've got a fair amount of cars that are used for transporting lumber. With the automotive finished goods down, we've got a fair number of auto racks that are stored. So you are right there is a definitely a differentiation in the type of cars that we've get stored.", "George Pickral - Stephens Incorporated", "What about coal.", "Lance Fritz", "Pretty de minimis at this point some but that's not a majority.", "Jim Young", "Hey George I think that's a good example when we start to think about productivity in the future. I think it's a good example where depending on where the growth comes if you have more leverage in other areas. Look at lumber, which as Lance mentioned we have had some of the flat cars our lumber loadings are only about 20% to 25% of where they were in the peak back in '06-'07. So, if you see your lumber business pick up, you should see pretty nice leverage on that particular group, you got excess equipment sitting around, we have capacity in our yards we still have our 111 principal yards, we got about 23, 24 that are very much under utilized so we got good upside there.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments.", "Jim Young", "Well, thank you for joining us today. I hope you are happy with the results. We are going to continue to focus on improvement in this company and now look forward to talking to you in early January.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Young. You may begin.", "James Young", "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today in Omaha are Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our CFO. ", "We wrapped up a record 2010 with a strong quarterly performance, reporting earnings of $1.56 per share, a 44% increase compared to the $1.08 per share reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter operating income totaled $1.3 billion. That's up 31% versus last year. This is the third consecutive quarter that UP's operating income has topped the $1 billion level. It's also the third quarter in a row we achieved volume gains in all six business groups.", "Quarterly carloads increased 9%, with roughly 2/3 of that growth coming from Intermodal and Industrial Products. In addition, Ag products produced its best quarterly carload level in 14 years. ", "Another best for UP in the fourth quarter was our customer satisfaction rating, which matched our record third quarter. As density in our network increased year-over-year, we continue to provide safe, excellent service to our customers. Along with the great value proposition we offer customers, we are also improving yields as demand strengthens, better pricing, combined with improved efficiency to produce a record fourth quarter operating ratio of 70.2, 3.2 points of improvement versus 2009. ", "UP's strong fourth quarter results are indicative of the great performance we achieved throughout 2010, setting numerous records as we report the most profitable year in our 150-year history. Now with that, we'll turn over to Jack to talk about our business team's performance. Jack?", "John Koraleski", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Well, I thought I'd start this morning with a look at customer satisfaction. It's one of our best indicators of how customers view the Union Pacific value proposition. Our customer satisfaction remained at record levels in the fourth quarter, equaling our best-ever quarter at 90, with November and December equaling our monthly record of 91. That strong showing capped off a record year as we came in at 89, one point better than the previous record that we set, back in 2009. ", "Our strong value proposition and an improved economy combined to drive fourth quarter volume growth in all six of our businesses, with overall volume up 9%. Core price improved about 5\u00bd% of each of the group's posted gains. Those price gains, along with increased fuel surcharge revenue and offset by a little negative mix, produced an 8% increase in average revenue per car. So with stronger volume and increased revenue per car, total freight revenue was up 18% for the quarter to $4.2 billion. ", "So let's take a closer look now at each of our six businesses. Starting with Ag products, our Agricultural Products revenue grew 14%, as a 6% increase in volume combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car. Export whole grains were up 8%, driven by a 29% increase in wheat exports. Export feed grains faced a tough comp against last year's strong market but still posted a 1% gain. ", "New business helped drive a 10% increase in soybean meal, and ethanol increased 4% as the market continued to grow. Food and refrigerated volume was up 7%. We had a late start to the tomato canning season, which pushed some volume into the fourth quarter, and that resulted in a 15% growth in canned goods. We also saw a strong demand which drove a 16% increase in import beer shipments. Working together with the CSX, our improved service schedule for our produce rail express service helped grow that volume 8%.", "Our Automotive revenue grew 7% as contract price increases drove a 5% improvement in average revenue per car and volume was up 3%. The volume growth rate moderated as we lapped the start of the auto industry's recovery in the latter part of 2009. ", "Increased production as the industry ramps up for anticipated 2011 sales levels drove a 7% increase in auto parts volume, which more than offset the continued negative impact of the closing of the Toyota General Motors NUMMI plant earlier in the year. Finished vehicle shipments were down \u00bd% compared to last year when manufacturers were pushing to build inventory levels in the wake of Cash for Clunkers.", "Chemicals volume was up 10%, which combined with a 4% improvement in average revenue per car to produce a 14% increase in revenue. Petroleum products volume increased 41% with strength in a wide range of products, including crude oil to St. James, lube oils, residual fuels from Mexico and asphalt. Strong seasonal demand drove fertilizer volume up 20%, with export potash accounting for most of that growth. Industrial chemical shipments grew 6%, benefiting from an increased demand and better inventory alignment. Our plastics volume was also up 6% as was soda ash, driven by a strong export demand.", "Energy revenues grew 16%, as a 4% increase in volume combined with an 11% improvement in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was up 8%, driven by increased electrical demand as the economy has improved and stockpiles were replenished following the fourth hottest summer on record. November stockpiles were estimated to still be 15 days below 2009 levels. Colorado/Utah tonnage declined 14% as one mine shut down its longwall to move to an entirely new reserve and as demand continued to be impacted by competition from Eastern coal sources.", "Our Industrial Products volume grew 23%, which combined with a 3% improvement in average revenue per car to drive a 27% increase in revenue. Demand in the Energy sector was, once again, the underlying driver of the strongest-growing segments of our Industrial Products business. Nonmetallic minerals volume was up 45% as increased drilling activity requires frac sand, barite and bentonite. Our rock shipments, which increased 23%, remained heavily tied to strong drilling activity in Louisiana and Texas. Energy-related shipments of line and drill pipe, as well as steel coils for pipe production, helped drive a 36% increase in steel and scrap, which also benefited from increased metal production.  ", "Year-over-year growth in our Short-Haul Uranium Tailings Group for the Department of Energy drove a 66% increase in hazardous waste shipments. And last, but certainly not least, Intermodal volume grew 10%, which combined with a 13% improvement in average revenue per unit to produce revenue growth of 25%. ", "International Intermodal volume was up 15% as higher consumer demand drove increased imports on a more traditional peak season. Truck-like service in our major Intermodal lanes allowed us to convert highway business to rail and drove Domestic Intermodal up 4%. ", "Slow delivery of new containers served to constrain what could have been an even stronger growth for us in the quarter. Our Streamline subsidiary\u2019s door-to-door product grew 42%, with just over half of that growth coming off the highway. Domestic average revenue per unit increased 21%, reflecting the improved pricing and fuel surcharge coverage resulting from the previous renegotiation of legacy contracts, as well as new product offerings in both of our UMAX and EMP box programs. ", "International revenue per unit was up 6%, impacted by negative mix resulting from increased revenue empties moving back to the West Coast and growth on our last remaining legacy International Intermodal contract. ", "Solid performance by each of our six businesses wrapped up the fourth quarter and closes out 2010, a year where we strengthened our value proposition even as our volumes grew. So let me turn your attention to 2011 and start with Global Insight's most recent economic projections, which actually reflect a stronger outlook for 2011 than we saw just a few months ago.", "GDP is expected to post stronger growth than 2010, while industrial production will be a little softer. December\u2019s seasonally-adjusted auto sales rate of $12.5 million was the highest non-Cash for Clunkers monthly level since September of 2008, so a projection of $13.1 million for 2011 seems pretty reasonable. ", "A couple of dark clouds hang over the 2011 forecast. The first is housing starts, which continues to weigh heavily on the economic recovery. The other, of course, is continued high unemployment rate, because without jobs, it's hard to see anything other than a slow recovery.", "That being the case, here's how we see 2011 volume growth shaping up in our major markets. With the diversity of our business mix being a real franchise strength, we have a number of markets where we're expecting relatively strong growth. Right at the top of that list is Domestic Intermodal, fueled by great service and more highway conversions. Improved consumer demand should support import volumes to drive our International Intermodal business. Prospects for growth in Southern Powder River Basin coal look good, while continued recovery in the automotive industry should keep our Vehicle and Parts business growing. ", "Metals and minerals, supported by Energy-related markets, are expected to continue to grow, and the roughly 15% expected increase in housing starts, while it's relatively a small increase, should give lumber a boost. Export grain and petroleum products also look good at this time. You can see the markets where we expect more moderate growth and those where we expect slow growth at best, led by our Colorado/Utah coal business, which will likely face some of the same hurdles that we saw in 2010. ", "Underpinning our growth prospects for 2011 will be our strong value proposition, providing a solid foundation for business development efforts and our price plan. And as I highlighted at our conference in November, legacy contract expirations in 2011 represent about 4% of our revenue base, but they're mostly loaded in the last part of the year. Nonetheless, we expect that increases in volume will combine with price gains to drive solid revenue growth in 2011. With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Safety is a foundation of UP's business, and in 2010 our safety results were very good. We achieved the best-ever employee safety, with a 6% reduction in reportable injury rate. The continued development in penetration of the peer-to-peer safety process that we call Total Safety Culture or TSC and enhanced training drove the improvement. ", "In terms of customer safety or derailments, we improved 6% to a best-ever reportable incident rate, delivering freight more safely even as volumes increased on the network. We removed risks and created a safer environment through investments in infrastructure, technology and training. Unfortunately, increases in rail and highway traffic during the year contributed to a greater number of crossing accidents. We continue to focus on risk reduction, closing over 280 grade crossings, and eliminating or mitigating risks in local communities that include driver behavior and short-stage crossings.", "Turning now to Service. Coming off of our best-ever year in 2009, the operating challenge for 2010 were to move growing volumes while maintaining and further improving excellent service. In 2010, we operated a fluid reliable network even as volume increased 13% year-over-year. Average velocity of 26.2 miles per hour was the second highest in UP's history, down just slightly from the record set in 2009 when volumes were at recessionary lows. ", "We enhanced service reliability through a variety of activities, beginning with an achievable transportation plan that we call the Unified Plan and supported by reduced slow orders, increased terminal throughput and managed inventory.", "Train inventory grew more slowly than volume as the train length increased, which minimized congestion. Maintaining efficient interchanges and implementing lean processes kept terminal fluid and asset utilization high. The end result was a strong and improving value proposition, supporting the corporate objectives of driving business growth with higher financial returns.", "Another key enabler of great service is the availability and use of our working resources. From an availability standpoint, year end 2010 furlough and asset storage numbers are up slightly from the third quarter, consistent with seasonal fourth quarter volume declines. However, year-end active train crew and locomotive resources increased 12% and 4%, respectively, versus 2009, which reflects significant volume growth through last year. ", "We efficiently deployed incremental resources as volumes grew, reflected in the near-record gross ton miles per employee. And locomotive productivity improved, up 2% in 2010. Use of distributed power locomotives and our efforts to increase train length were key contributors. From a freight car standpoint, our rigorous approach to inventory control is evident as we matched 2009, the best-ever freight car utilization.", "Turning cars faster reduces short-term rents and ultimately capital, both for ourselves and for our customers. Our productivity starts with leveraging the key plan to run a volume variable operation. In 2010, we moved 13% more carloads, with only a 5% increase in total starts. ", "The first step in handling the increased volume as the economy picked up was filling the existing train slots. Enabled in part by increased use of distributed power, we achieved all-time records for manifest, Intermodal, grain and coal train sizes. ", "For the full year, Intermodal train size increased 8%, while manifest was up 5%. In the fourth quarter, volumes were up 9% versus 2009, with total crew starts up 7%, as we continued to increase train sizes. Even so, fourth quarter volume variability was slightly less than our 2010 run rate, as mix shifts created a 2% headwind in crew freight starts. The mix impact was driven by an increase in manifest traffic, which generates more crew starts per car load than our bulk or Intermodal networks, and by increased length of haul in grain and in coal.", "Moving into 2011, we expect volume leverage to be strong. One reason is the growth we expect in the SPRB coal franchise. In 2010, we set new annual SPRB record for cars per train, tons per car and tons per train. Our coal network is very efficient, and when coupled with strong volume growth, it can drive excellent productivity. There's also room to leverage volume through the manifest network, with 23 of our 114 major terminals still essentially mothballed.", "As we continue to drive for best-in-class safety, service and productivity, we are pursuing codependent, not competing goals. Making improvements in all three boiled down to three key tenets: predictability, consistency and repeatability. An operation that delivers excellent customer service is the most predictable and best maintained, which also makes it the safest operation. A safe, predictable operation with low variability is also the most productive. ", "These codependent goals form the cornerstone of our business strategy to use safety, service and productivity to drive customer satisfaction and demand for Union Pacific. As these results illustrate, UP has never run a safer, more reliable, or more productive network in its history. ", "For 2011, we expect improvement in each of the three focus areas. With safety, the goal is continuous improvement toward becoming the safest railroad in North America, an operation with no safety incident. For service, the chart on this slide illustrates the service volume equation, which I discussed at the November analyst meeting. The chart plots service results versus volume throughput each month over the last 12 years. As you can see, 2010 was a breakout year. For 2011, we're targeting new frontier points, moving that trend line up and to the right. And with productivity, we look to make gains in all areas, utilizing resources more efficiently and investing capital more productively. So with that, let me turn it over to Rob.", "Robert Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. UP's earnings continued on a record pace in the fourth quarter, helping us put a solid finish on an exceptional financial performance in 2010. Slide 22 summarizes our fourth quarter results. ", "Operating revenue grew 17% to $4.4 billion on the strength of a 9% increase in our business volumes. Operating expense totaled $3.1 billion and increased 12% or $342 million versus the fourth quarter of 2009. ", "We maintained solid cost control, especially when you factor in that higher diesel fuel prices added $111 million of expense to the quarter. Operating income totaled $1.3 billion, a 31% increase and a fourth quarter record. Incremental margins remained historically high, coming in at nearly 50% for the quarter. Other income totaled $9 million in the fourth quarter, $14 million less year-over-year. Quarterly interest expense declined 7% or $11 million versus the fourth quarter of 2009 to $142 million.", "Fourth quarter income tax expense increased to $405 million despite the impact of a lower effective tax rate. Higher pretax earnings more than offset the year-over-year tax rate reduction of 2\u00bd points, which mostly related to changes associated with deferred taxes. Net income totaled $775 million, a fourth quarter best and a 41% increase versus 2009. Earnings per share increased 44% to $1.56, as the outstanding share balance declined 2% versus 2009 with our share repurchase activity.", "UP's pricing efforts continued to be an important part of our record financial results. In the fourth quarter, core pricing gains totaled 5\u00bd%. Solid demand for rail transportation, improved service and legacy contract renewals all contributed to the increase. Included in this core pricing number is about a half point of higher year-over-year RCAF fuel.", "Turning now to the expense side. Fourth quarter compensation and benefits totaled $1.1 billion, up 9% versus 2009. Breaking down the yearly change, roughly 1/3 of the increased expense could be attributed to wage and benefit inflation. Another third or so of the increase relates to volume growth. ", "Fourth quarter workforce levels were 3% higher year-over-year as we staffed for more train starts. In addition, hiring and training costs were higher in the quarter as new employees were brought on to prepare for expected 2011 attrition and volume growth. Conductor and engineering training costs increased $12 million year-over-year. ", "Offsetting some of the higher costs was strong employee productivity. As Lance just discussed, gross ton miles per employee increased 6% to the third highest quarterly measure on record. In addition, support-function staffing levels remained lower year-over-year. ", "Going forward, we expect to deliver continued productivity gains as a result of our disciplined train plan execution, capital investments and technology. As a result, although workforce levels will generally increase with higher volumes, it will not be at a one-for-one rate. ", "Fourth quarter fuel expense reached the highest quarterly level of the year at $687 million. The increased average diesel fuel price, which gained 20% year-over-year, was the primary driver of the quarterly change. In fact, as illustrated on Slide 25, the $2.46 per gallon of diesel fuel paid in the fourth quarter is our highest quarterly price in two years. Expenses also were up as a result of a 9% increase in gross ton miles, partially offset by a 3% improvement in our quarterly consumption rate. ", "Slide 26 summarizes fourth quarter expenses for three separate categories. Purchased Services & Materials expense increased 9% or $39 million to $467 million. Similar to the third quarter, the biggest driver of the quarterly increase was greater use of contract services associated with higher volumes. A good example of this is increased trucking and lift costs related to our Intermodal operation. Locomotive maintenance costs were also up year-over-year as we returned stored assets to active service.", "Fourth quarter Equipment & Other Rents expense totaled $278 million, up 5%. Car hire expense associated with growth in Automotive, Intermodal and Industrial Products shipments was the biggest contributor to the year-over-year increase. Container lease expense was higher in the quarter as we increased our container fleet, while lease expense for locomotives and freight cars declined. Other expense came in at $173 million, up $44 million or 34% versus 2009, and in line with the outlook that we provided you in October.", "One of the biggest factors in the quarter was a $25 million year-over-year change related to our asbestos liability. In addition, casualty-related costs increased roughly $14 million versus 2009. Although our fourth quarter study, again, reflected positive experience from our ongoing safety gains, the level of reduction in 2010 was less than the past couple of years. ", "Also pressuring other expense higher in the quarter were increased operating taxes, joint facility costs and other general expenses. Together, these items totaled nearly $35 million, offsetting the $30 million payment we had in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to the Pacer agreement. ", "As we look ahead to 2011, the other expense category is expected to be around $225 million per quarter. With so many ins and outs in this line, it's not unusual to see quarterly fluctuations. But similar to the fourth quarter, we believe that positive news from actuarial studies will be a little less. We also expect higher costs from increased operating taxes and volume-related items.", "Bringing both the revenue and expense sides together, UP's record 2010 operating ratio illustrates the great improvements in profitability we achieved over the last several years. Although higher diesel fuel prices added nearly one point to our fourth quarter operating ratio, pushing it back over 70, we still achieved 3.2 points of improvement to a new fourth quarter best level of 70.2% in the quarter. ", "On a full year basis, we made even greater strides, taking 5\u00bd points off the 2009 operating ratio to report an all-time mark of 70.6% for the full year. When we launched project operating ratio back in 2007, we dedicated ourselves to attaining a low-70s operating ratio. Through our focus on moving the right business at the right price, running a safe and fluid operation and providing excellent service to our customers, we have accomplished that goal. ", "While it's evident that the math of today's higher fuel prices can inflate the operating ratio as we just saw in the fourth quarter, we are focused on achieving our new target of 65% to 67% full year operating ratio by 2015. ", "Slide 28 provides a wrap-up to our 2010 earnings with a full year income statement. Driven by 13% carloading growth, core pricing gains and increased fuel surcharge revenue, operating revenue increased 20% to almost $17 billion. Operating expenses increased 11% to nearly $12 million. Although we did experience higher costs associated with moving more volume, a 31% increase in average diesel fuel prices contributed nearly half of the added costs in 2010. ", "Operating income was our best-ever at nearly $5 billion, a 47% increase. 2010 other income of $54 million declined $141 million. As you may recall, second quarter land sale in 2009 added $116 million to this line item.", "Income tax increased 52% versus 2009 to almost $1.7 billion as a result of higher pretax earnings and a slightly higher effective tax rate. Our 2010 tax rate was 37.3% versus 36.4% in 2009. Net income was another all-time record for UP, up 47% to $2.8 billion. Full year 2010 earnings per share was $5.53, a 48% increase compared to 2009 and our best-ever annual performance. ", "UP's record profitability in 2010 also drove record free cash flow and returns. For the year, free cash flow after dividends more than doubled versus 2009 to $1.4 billion. Growth in net income more than offset 2010 capital spending and increased dividend payments. ", "And as you know, bonus depreciation contributed positively to cash flows in both 2009 and 2010 and will, again, be a contributor to 2011. UP's balance sheet is in excellent condition, consistent with the goal of maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. At year end 2010, the adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 3.6 points lower than 2009, in part because of the $400 million debt maturity that we accelerated from 2011 into 2010. ", "We also achieved a record return on invested capital in 2010 at 10.8%, 2.6 points of improvement versus 2009. Returns must continue to move up to support the significant capital investments required to achieve our safety, service and growth initiatives. Full year 2010 capital investments totaled roughly $2.5 billion, slightly below our target investment of $2.6 billion. ", "As we announced back at our November analysts meeting, our preliminary capital budget for 2011 is around $3.2 billion. Included in this amount is the purchase of 100 new road locomotives and select capacity projects, such as continuing the double track work on our Sunset Corridor and the Blair project. ", "Also included in our 2011 plan is roughly $250 million for positive train control. As you'll recall, our total estimated spend for positive train control continues to be around $1.4 billion, of which a little more than $100 million has already been invested. ", "As the profitability of Union Pacific increased through 2010, we returned more cash to our shareholders in the form of dividend increases and share repurchases. In May, we announced a 22% dividend increase, followed by a second increase of 15% in November. UP's quarterly dividend now stands at $0.38 per share, a 41% increase in 2010. ", "Also in May, we resumed our share repurchase program, buying back nearly 17 million shares over the following eight months. The total spend on repurchases in 2010 was nearly $1.25 billion. We are committed to improving shareholder value going forward as we take a balanced approach to our allocation of cash for the long-term benefit of the company. ", "As we turn our attention now to the year ahead, we see great opportunities to grow and improve. As Jack discussed, we are optimistic about the prospects for solid volume and pricing gains in 2011. Of course, this assumes that the economy continues to cooperate.", "We remain committed to achieving real pricing gains in 2011 plus continuing to realize the increased value of UP's service, strong market demand and the added benefit of competing for and repricing our legacy business. As we described at our analyst meeting, the impact of legacy pricing in 2011 will be less than we've seen over the last couple of years as the bulk of these renewals are later in the year. ", "Our pipeline of productivity and service initiatives continues to be full as we use innovation, technology and lean management principles to drive continuous improvement. The combination of stronger revenue growth and our ongoing productivity initiatives should produce a new record operating ratio in 2011 and drive returns higher. Achieving this will not be without its challenges, however, as we face increasing cost headwinds in a number of areas. ", "For example, after almost two years without any meaningful expense for hiring and training, we expect it to ramp up in 2011. Our current plan calls for roughly 4,000 new hires, primarily to backfill for attrition, but also to support volume growth. Of course, as the year develops, we have the ability to adjust those plans up or down. ", "It's also important to separate hiring plans from workforce levels. Attrition is the primary driver of hiring. So while we expect our 2011 workforce to grow with volume, it will not be at a one-to-one rate. While the overall rate of increase in compensation and benefit expense for employees should be less in 2011 than it was in 2010, total costs in the category are expected to be up year-over-year. Increased hiring and training costs will be reflected in this line item, as well as the normal inflationary items such as wages and health and welfare expenses. ", "Pension-related expenses and unemployment taxes associated with our 2009 furloughs are also pushing costs higher. Our ability to drive continued volume leverage and employee productivity in this area will be critical to minimizing the inflation impact. Depreciation cost will likely be pressed higher in 2011 as a result of increased capital spending, as well as higher depreciation associated with hauling more gross ton miles over our network. ", "At this point, we expect the quarterly increases to be in the neighborhood of 8% to 10%. While these cost challenges are significant, let me reiterate that we consider these issues to be headwinds, not roadblocks. We expect Union Pacific to be more profitable in 2011.", "Turning to the first quarter in particular, we are expecting a return to more normal seasonal trends in our carload volumes, service metric and operating ratio. As you know, the first quarter operating ratio is typically higher versus the fourth quarter sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we expect to report operating ratio improvement. We believe 2011 will be another record-setting year for our company, which will allow us to reward our shareholders with greater return. With that, let me turn it back to Jim.", "James Young", "Thanks, Rob. As we look ahead into the new year, we're encouraged by the signs of a fully strengthening economy. Economic indicators all generally point to growth in 2011. And if the jobs picture starts to improve, that could drive even greater strength through a more confident consumer base. ", "Union Pacific is well positioned to serve the total transportation needs of our customers as we focus on becoming a more fully integrated part of their supply chain. Excellent service is a key to our future success, supporting our pricing initiatives and helping us improve asset utilization. Our capital investment strategy will be another key part of UP's success going forward. We're making investments today, building capacity for tomorrow. We believe very strongly in the opportunities for improving financial returns, and the roughly $3.2 billion in capital investment we plan for 2011 is really a down payment on our ability to keep driving returns higher in the future. ", "Following 2010's record performance, it is clear that the bar is raised in terms of future expectations. What we achieved last year is now the floor, and we're setting our sights higher. We're confident in our ability to make continuous improvement in all facets of our business. So with that, let's open it up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Robert outlined a number of cost pressures looking at 2011, and it's helpful to run through that. He didn't quantify each of them, but I'm wondering if you can give a kind of a higher level look at the pace of growth in operating expenses that you think is kind of reasonable if you look at your budget or your plan and if you take out fuel, which is obviously tougher to forecast. Are you looking at kind of 3% increase in your OpEx x fuel? Or what's the right ballpark to be in, given some of the cost pressures you outlined?", "James Young", "We don't give guidance on the spending other than there are some items there that as Rob outlined are under pressure. But the key to me is that's what's so important about our productivity initiatives. And I'm confident. We committed long term to a very good improvement in our operating ratio. And we've got to offset those. So while you're seeing a little pressure in there, I'm very confident. Our efficiency, it also reinforces the need in terms of our pricing, in terms of offsetting some of these costs that we\u2019ve got to more than offset them in terms of moving our margins in the right direction.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "If you think about net price then, so factoring in your pace of cost inflation maybe a little bit higher, do you think your net price changes a whole lot, or you perhaps get some cyclical benefits to your pricing, maybe a tighter truck market and some other factors that would enable you to have kind of a similar pace of net price in 2011 even if your cost pressures are a little higher?", "James Young", "Well, remember our commitment is real price long term. So that says we have to offset the inflation and other factors in here. Also keep in mind that many of our agreements are tied to escalators. So if you see a little pickup in inflation, you're going to recoup some of that to your escalators. So again, we've got some challenges there, but the task for our team is more than offset them. I mean, Rob...", "Robert Knight", "One of the points, Tom, as you know, remember that the legacy renewals are kind of back-end loaded this year. So you can't really straight-line the pricing assumptions if you look year-over-year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Newcrest.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Newcrest Capital Inc.", "I noticed that you have both Domestic and International Intermodal in the strong category in terms of your volume outlook for next year. Wondering if you could just contrast one versus the other and comment on what extent the availability of containers has influenced your thinking about the growth potential in each.", "James Young", "Jack, do you want to take that?", "John Koraleski", "Sure. Cherilyn, if you look at the International side, we saw a nice pickup year-over-year in the International because that business was down. And when you look at the Domestic comparison, it doesn't look quite as large, but last year, actually, our Domestic Intermodal business actually improved year-over-year. So if you look at the numbers, they kind of look like that. Going forward into 2011, right now, our International business is actually a little stronger than what we thought it would be. If the consumer demand stays with us and the economic activity stays in a positive framework, we think we'll see another year of continued improvement on the International Intermodal side, and that'll be good for us. On the Domestic side, box availability was an issue in 2010. It will be less of an issue in 2011. We believe we're going to add a little bit to our fleet. And we should see solid improvement. Our highway conversions are going well. Our new sales efforts with some of the customers that primarily rely on truck have been going great guns for us. So with some additional boxes available for our Intermodal fleet, we should see solid progress in 2011. We think it'll be probably one of our strongest growth avenue.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Newcrest Capital Inc.", "As you look at some of the regulatory pressures that seem to be coming to bear on the trucking industry in particular, do you see that as having a potential impact on your Intermodal demand and pricing in 2011? Or is that going to be more of a 2012 phenomenon, do you think?", "John Koraleski", "Yes, I think the jury\u2019s really still out on some of that. You look at CFA 2010, if you look at the impacts, what it says is -- what it's going to do is eventually drive the poor-performing drivers out of the market. Some people have estimated that could be as high as 400,000 drivers. That would be a real plus for us. One of the other issues, it does is it'll pinpoint which companies are the poorer performers, which will no doubt drive their insurance costs higher. And the other odd kind of a thing if you stop and think about it, some of the best drivers will probably be more in demand, which could mean they get paid more. So all of those things, trucking costs go up, capacity gets tighter, and all of those with our great service performance, the value proposition we have for our customers, says we should see solid growth. It's kind of hard to see when for sure it's going to hit, but it certainly does strengthen our outlook as opposed to causing concern.", "James Young", "Cheryl, there's another factor to think about when you think about moving product on the highway. I think most folks believe diesel fuel prices will be higher next year. I mean, if you look at the curve, they are. So that brings added pressure on the cost to move it on the highway. Our discussion with many of our trucking partners indicates they have a very strong interest in improving the amount of business they move intermodaly. So again, the key for our industry and for UP in particular is to provide great service.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc", "I was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit about the percent of your business when you look at 2011 that may be contracted at this point, and then maybe what the types of increases you may be seeing in that business as you look out.", "John Koraleski", "Chris, at any one point in time, we have about 70% to 75% of our business under either single-year or multiyear contracts, and the escalations are set in place. We're probably not going to tell you specifically how those escalations line up in terms of pricing. But I would tell you that some of them include legacy renewals, so you'll see some pretty significant price increases. Others, more or less inflationary adjustments and things like that. But it's typically, at any point in time, about 70% to 75% of our business under contract.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc", "Just switching gears to the fuel side. I don't know if I caught a breakout between what fuel and mix was in the quarter. We obviously got the coal price side of that. And then just the thought about, was there any lag impact of fuel in the fourth quarter, as fuel seems to be increasing sequentially as we progress through the quarter?", "Robert Knight", "Chris, we didn't break out the mix to the fuel, but there was a slight lag on the earnings in the fourth quarter as a result of the rising fuel price. And of course, as you know, just the sheer math of that had a drag of about a point on our operating ratio as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy, Susquehanna Financial.", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "Yields looked pretty good this quarter, specifically in Intermodal, which was up, I think, 13% versus a run rate earlier in the year of high-single digits. I was wondering if you could just provide some color in terms of what was going on there, particularly in light of the fact that carloads were up of, I think, 5% more than RTMs. So some pretty good yield growth with carload growth exceeding the RTM growth and Intermodal. If you could just help me with what's going on there in the quarter?", "James Young", "Matt, there's no secret when you look at our Intermodal business line. It was one that had pretty substantial impact from old legacy contracts, and as we've moved forward, we've been able to really take more of the market price into those deals. So that drives one. But secondly, our service. When you look at the new products we've put in place and the Customer Satisfaction Index, it reflects value that customers are willing to pay. There's no question in that market about the equation between service, price and value to the customer. So I think again, it reflects what we've been talking about for a long time and our ability in terms of both legacy and getting service improved.", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "So that is not a fuel surcharge issue, that's real sticky pricing, as you've alluded to in the past?", "James Young", "Well, fuel surcharge clearly is part of that, but that was also part of the issue before, that we were unable to really recover changes in fuel price. So all that comes into the equation. Again, the most important thing to me is really to provide great service and new products into that market that the customers really value.", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "And a follow-up would be on the capital front, I think you guys ended the year a little bit north of $1 billion, with capital. Pre-meltdown, you used to run at something like $700 million of cash and investments on the balance sheet. I know your CapEx budget ex-PTC is up about $500 million. But just in thinking of returning capital to shareholders, you upped the dividend twice last year. Your payout, so your yield is in line with the industry at about a point and a half. I'm wondering in terms of returning capital to shareholders, what are your plans or what are your hurdles for 2011? Is it going to be more weighted towards share repurchases? Or do we continue to see a more balanced approach to returning capital to shareholders?", "James Young", "Matt, you said capital, but I think the $1 billion -- but you're talking about cash on the books?", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "Yes.", "James Young", "Rob, go ahead.", "Robert Knight", "Just to clarify, our total capital spending in 2010 was just above $2.5 billion. Cash on the books as, Matt, you pointed out was over $1 billion, and our plan for capital spending in 2011 is somewhere around that $3.2 billion. So you're right, we're increasing the capital. And our approach beyond the capital spend is to continue, as we have, to have a balanced approach. We're going to seed where the returns are there, make the right investments in the business in that capital program. We like to have a continuous dividend increase, and with cash available beyond that, continue to be opportunistic as we have been on share repurchases. So no shift in our thinking in that line.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Flower of Macquarie Bank.", "Scott Flower - Macquarie Research", "Just wondering, Jim, if you could give us some color on how you see some of the hearings playing out at the STB. Obviously, they're being a bit more active now that it seems that the legislative front is quieting down. I just wanted to get your color on how you see the sets of hearings coming up and what you think may come out of those?", "James Young", "Well, Scott, I think it's going to be a great opportunity for our industry to tell a very positive story. If you look at what the first hearing is, I think, looking at exemptions. The second one is also related to looking at access. To me, it's, again, a capability to look at an industry that, as the financial returns have improved, the industry has returned a significant amount of profits, put it back into new investments long term. So I'm looking forward to that discussion that's out here. I think the issue in exemptions and competition, there's just no question. There's very strong competition in this industry. Look, I'll give you an example. If you look at what's happening with all water moves around through the canal, that market share on the East Coast, I think, went from about 4% or 5%. Today, it's 20%. That's hundreds of millions of dollars of business that used to move on railroads that now moves on water. So I think the STB -- and it may be appropriate at this point in time, you're saying record returns and financial results, they have a discussion. But I will also tell you a part of this is they have to be very careful. When you bring in and you know the story, when you look at the replacement cost issue this industry has, there's very little room to get it wrong. So we're prepared. Again, I think you've got a hugely successful story to tell, and you don't see what happens.", "Scott Flower - Macquarie Research", "And just a second one for Jack. I know that on two things you mentioned, inventories on coal are below nine, but where do you think they are versus normal? And then related or secondly, you mentioned the empty issue on Intermodal, is that normalizing on the International or do you expect that to continue in '11?", "John Koraleski", "The Intermodal question, I think we're going to continue to see an improvement in International business in 2011. I don't think it's normalizing or flattening out. I think we'll see that.", "Scott Flower - Macquarie Research", "When is normalizing versus the number of empties? Those seem to be quite high because of the box shortage as opposed to overall volume levels.", "John Koraleski", "Yes. It's kind of hard to tell how the ocean carriers will view that, Scott. It really will enter into the marketplace in terms of what do they have for back haul opportunities, how tight the market is. Typically, their view of the world is if the International business coming into the United States is really tight, they'll unload right at the port into a domestic box, and then they'll shoot their boxes back without getting a backload. The other opportunity, as you know, we're seeing a lot of stuffing with things like backhauls for DDGS. And there's even some more interesting products, scrap paper, somebody even was discussing some heavier materials than that. So I think it will depend a lot on the market, but I think we'll be okay.", "Scott Flower - Macquarie Research", "And then coal inventories, I know you said versus '09, but where do you think they are versus normal? Because '09 seemed like an atypically high year.", "John Koraleski", "I would say they're about on target to maybe a day or two ahead, but not -- they're about where they should be on a normal range.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Jim, if we look at the puts and takes for 2011, you talked about sort of the legacy repricing being at the end, we've got some cost pressures. Do you think it's realistic we can sustain incremental margins even at the fourth quarter level? Is that possible, do you think?", "James Young", "Well, Bill, I'm not going to give you a specific number, but I think the margins will continue to be very good in this industry at UP. As Lance mentioned, we still have assets out there that are not deployed at this point, so any incremental revenue del [ph] you bring in those should have nice margins. And we've said consistently, if you recall, you look back at last year when we had so many excess assets, that probably wasn't sustainable. But I feel pretty good, in fact, I feel real good where we're at in terms of margins this year.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "And how do you think about the labor line? I mean, can headcount stay below volume growth, given that volume growth inevitably will be lower, I think, in 2011? I guess you've also got some incentive comp pressures, too, I would think, picking up?", "James Young", "Well, to me, the productivity piece is the most important focus here, and I do expect that. And Rob actually had said that, that as our employee count grows, we should be able to lever that and see our productivity continue to improve.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "On inventory levels, in the Industrial Products side, do you have a sense for where those are, Jack? Can you just give us a little bit of help? Do we have an inventory restock to come, or are we pretty much at normal?", "John Koraleski", "Bill, I think we're still below what would be historically considered normal. If you look at the retail to inventory ratios, we're still tracking below what would have been the historical levels prior to the 2008 meltdown. So I think we still have some inventory replenishment upside. I think customers are being very careful before taking on a load of inventory. They want to make sure that they see that the economic recovery is sustainable and improving, but I still think we do have upside.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I just want to follow up, Jim, on the hearings, just on the pricing. I guess if your ROI is over 10\u00bd%, where do you need to get to on a replacement cost basis? I just want to understand how their thinking might be in terms of replacement or added revenue adequacy versus the need to get replacement costs covered?", "James Young", "Ken, you can do the math, and Rob and his team would cut it a lot of different ways on replacement costs. But even on a depreciated new kind of methodology says that if you take our returns today at about half, you take that 10.8 and cut in half. So again, we continue to try to educate Washington on the replacement cost issue. I also like to think about cash flow returns. I think in this industry, with the capital intensity, you've got to look at cash flows, so we'll reiterate that story. But the fact of the matter is we've got a $3.2 billion capital investment this year which will be a record investment for us. We will reduce -- I will cut that budget if we see our ability to grow these returns from where we are today in terms of regulations. You just can't justify that spend on where you're at today with return on capital. We're making an investment for where we think the returns can be out here two, three, four, five years from now.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "If I can just shift over to Jack, on the coal opportunity, I just want to think about what's going on with the multiple storms we've seen, with the flooding in Australia. I guess maybe the eastern guys may be a bit focused on moving some met coal. Have you seen any increased demand to get any coal moving east? Or can you give us an update on that, knowing that inventories right now are about normal in your region?", "John Koraleski", "Ken, we've seen an increase in discussion. I haven't actually seen an increase in the movement of coal yet. We're watching it pretty carefully. Still a lot of discussion and activity about port capacity on the west that would allow us, actually, to potentially move some coal off the West Coast. But we really not have seen a lot of activities in the form of real orders yet to significantly increase western coal into the east.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "In the past, I think you've stated that the current network has something on the order of maybe 10% to 15% of excess capacity that could be filled up over time as the economy improves and you gain market share, without making dramatic incremental capital expenditures and incremental capacity. Is that range still holding at this point? Has that changed, moved around, have you eaten up some of that capacity?", "James Young", "Lance, do you want to take that?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, we do have excess capacity remaining. You recall, if you look backwards, we've handled in the neighborhood of 195,000 to 200,070 carloads for a relatively extended period. But the real important thing to note is the service levels that we're performing at now and that the business plan is predicated on are very different from the service levels that we had back in that time frame. So yes, there is more capacity to handle incremental volume, but equally, yes, we do have to continue to invest carefully and effectively and also improve our throughput through lean manufacturing initiatives, for instance, in order to maintain high service levels as volume comes back.", "James Young", "And John, as we talked about, we're making investments, so we're trying to look at it two, three, four years from now. We've got a project here in Nebraska called the Blair project, which is replacing some bridges, expanding some double track. There's a long lead time there. That's a two-, three-year type of project. And the bottom line there, you reduce miles, you improve service. We've got a project we're looking at -- the bridge at the Mississippi River, Clinton, Iowa. That's a four-year kind of project. Now there's not much money in this year, but again, what we are -- because the lead times, unfortunately, when you think about capacity expansion, are a lot of cases a couple of years at a minimum.", "John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Maybe as a follow-on, I've read quite a few articles about the project to upgrade the line between St. Louis and Chicago to accommodate either high-speed or higher-speed passenger service. Can you talk a little bit about how the economics of that kind of project work for the UP in terms of the capital investment, the ongoing maintenance to maintain the track to accommodate a higher-speed operation? And then who gets priority on the line and whether that impacts your operation adversely at all?", "James Young", "Well, when you think about -- let's talk about the priorities in place here. Our position has been from day one, if you're going to mix high-speed passenger -- now keep in mind, we're talking about a 110 mile an hour Class 6 kind of railroad when you talk about high-speed, that you've got to serve both. We've got to protect freight. You've got to protect the passenger operation. That's been a tenet of the planning from day one. In terms of investment and maintenance, the cost of running the operations can be borne by the user, which, in this case, is the federal government and the state government, both in the initial investment and long term.", "John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So long term, does that actually help you net-net in terms of being able to provide maybe a higher level of service on the freight side?", "James Young", "No. John, at the end of the day, I would prefer not to mix passenger and freight. I think when you think about where the philosophy in this country of how we deal with infrastructure problems, how you move more business from highway to rail long term. But we've got a project. There\u2019s been very good negotiations, and at the end of the day, I don't think I'm confident we can make it work.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the hiring plans. I think you said 4,000 new hires. What's the timing for that throughout the year? And then what are you budgeting for in terms of attrition? Just trying to get a sense of net new hiring.", "Robert Knight", "Scott, what we said is around, and it's an estimate at this point in time, around 4,000 mostly for attrition and some assumption for volume growth. And the attrition is pretty much throughout the year, I mean there's no particular time frame when all that occurs. It's pretty steady throughout the year. And that's an attrition rate of 7%, 8%-ish, in terms of what our historical run rate has been on attrition, and we'll see if that plays out. That's our assumption at this point in time. And as I pointed out, the piece that\u2019s related to volume growth, we do expect as volume returns that headcount will increase, but not at the same rate. So we'll have productivity in there as volume comes back.", "James Young", "Scott, I think keep in mind there's no assurance that the economy's going to grow and continue on the positive, although again, our view of the economy is slow growth. But if this thing turns down, we take advantage of the attritions. I think if you look backwards from where we were, when you're treading 3,000 to 4,000 people a year, you can manage your force counts much better.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "And an attrition rate of about 7\u00bd%, that's a little over 3,000 people? So 1,000 net increase? Does that sound about right?", "James Young", "Yes. When you look out to over the next three, four years, let's assume the economy stays in a positive line, we're going to be hiring anywhere between 3,500 and 4,500 employees a year.", "Robert Knight", "But just to reiterate, whether or not our total workforce count number is higher in 2011, will be dependent on volumes.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Rob, I think I heard you say that other expense should be about $225 million a quarter? That's up 25% versus 2010. What's going on there? Can you give a little bit more color? And is that specific to you guys, or is that related to some industry-wide cost pressures?", "Robert Knight", "A little bit of both, but I'm not speaking to the other rails, but we've got -- there's lots of ins and outs in that category. And as I mentioned, our casualty line item, while we continue to make progress on our safety, for example, and we will, we have had great progress, and as Lance pointed out, that's a focus, clearly, we'll continue to focus on. But given the way the actuarial study adjustments work, we would expect that in 2011, the good news coming from those studies will be less than the good news that we've seen over the last couple of years, as an example. And I pointed out operating taxes. We fully expect those to go up, and the reason for that is generally speaking, the way operating taxes work within our territory is based on five years of earnings. And because we're earning more, if you lop off an earlier period when we were earning less, and now we're adding a year where you're earning more, so that drives our operating taxes higher. Volume, of course, is also in that category, volume-related expenses, and those we fully anticipate and hope will be on the positive side.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jon Langenfeld with Robert W. Baird.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "On the pricing side, I know we repriced the Intermodal, some of those Intermodal contracts in late '09, early '10, but was that more of an event, or is that more of a process by which those rates come up to market through the end of this year? So is there some legacy tailwind still associated with those?", "John Koraleski", "It's more of a process, Jon.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then on the 4%, that\u2019s this year, can you give us some visibility on which commodity groups those fall in? I know Intermodal is a piece of it. Is there anything else in there?", "Lance Fritz", "Intermodal is a piece of it and Energy. Those are really the two largest components.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Rob, for you, can you give us some idea of the magnitude of the bonus depreciation in the last couple of years and then how that relates? Would it be similar in 2011?", "Robert Knight", "In 2010, the benefit from bonus depreciation was around $100 million. 2011 might be a little stronger because A, a higher capital spend, and B, we got 100% depreciation for 2011. So we expect that to be stronger in 2011.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse Group.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I noticed that the revenue per car in Industrial Products and Chemicals was quite a bit lower than some of the other categories even though fuel was up. Is this weaker pricing, or was it mix issues within the category?", "John Koraleski", "A lot of it was mix and in particular, in the Industrial Products side. Chris, that Moab short-haul 35 mile uranium tailings move that we had was up 66%. And so that does tend to take a couple of percentage points off of the average revenue per unit.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then is there any chance that with the administration talking more about possibly dialing back on regulations that are hurting business, any chance that PTC gets reviewed or changed or canceled? Do you have any view on that?", "James Young", "That's a great question, Chris. In fact, next week, we've got a meeting at the White House, the CEOs in our industry, and on the agenda will be how we see regulations that are impacting growth and investment, and positive train control, I think, is poster child. And as you know, the math, the FRA alone did their own cost benefit and said, \"For every $22 we spend, we get $1 worth of benefits. That makes no sense.\" So we are looking forward to the discussion in terms of the impact of regulations on our industry.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "If I could sneak in just one housekeeping item, what do we expect for the tax rate in 2011? You've had a little bit of a dip here in the recent quarter.", "Robert Knight", "This is Rob. I would assume around 38%.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.", "H. Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just on nonmetallic minerals, how long do you expect that to sustain at kind of 40% to 50% type growth levels?", "John Koraleski", "It's tied so much to the drilling activity in the different shale formations and things like that. So we're expecting another great year. Of course, to say that you can keep up a 40% rate as your base gets larger is a pretty tall order, but it\u2019ll still be solid growth.", "H. Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Only other question was on velocity. It looked like 4Q was very strong. Has that carried over into January? We\u2019ve had a lot of bad weather across the country this month.", "Lance Fritz", "We have had a few headwinds to velocity at the start of the year in 2011. We've shown signs of being able to meet or exceed the kind of velocity we exited last year at, and we anticipate that this year is going to be another solid year of service as reflected in velocity.", "H. Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So January is looking pretty similar to 4Q?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Just looking, you guys are doing a great job here, free cash flow rising, you did raise your CapEx, but still sort of paying down debt, increasing dividends and doing your share buyback. Just want to -- interesting in your outlook, you mentioned how you wanted to become more of a fully integrated part of your customers\u2019 supply chain and so on. Is there any thought toward allocating capital outside of sort of your core rail network, perhaps into the logistics, into trucking, into that sort of last mile aspect? And how would you do that? Do you think you could grow that organically if that is indeed an option? Or would you look to acquire to get there?", "James Young", "Well, Walter, we're not going to buy a truck company. But we do focus some of our capital in terms of the full logistics chain. Examples would be technology development that's out here. Other examples could be where you look at the acquisition even of equipment, where you think about being a full-service provider for our customer. You've probably seen the ads we've been running. And if you look backwards, we did a lot of market research before we ran those ads, and it wouldn't surprise you that talking with potential customers or folks that would use rail, we had a lot of perspective that -- I'll give you an example. In many cases, logistics managers had a thought that if they didn't have a rail outside their warehouse, they couldn't use railroads, and we clearly -- that reinforced for us our push on trying to be a full-service provider. Our subsidiary called EP Distribution Services can provide the full-service to a customer where they want to do rail, they want to do intermodal, they want to do trucking, they want to do warehousing. So it's not a huge investment, capitalwise, that's out here, but it's clearly something we're focused on and are having some very good success.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "So that focus is built into your current capital plan?", "James Young", "That's correct.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "This is sort of a follow-on on sort of your capital allocation and dividend and buyback. Obviously, there's an increasing focus on yield and the importance of that. And again, your free cash flow is rising. You did a great job through the recession. Rob, what's your view -- if you think about a payout ratio for this business on a longer-term basis, what is that payout ratio even if it's not this year or next year? What kind of target payout ratio do you consider?", "Robert Knight", "You know, Walter, we haven't established a set payout ratio. We want it to be competitive. High-30s in the industry is kind of on the high-end, and -- high-20s, excuse me, nearly 30. And we want to have a consistent dividend increase, and we have a competitive dividend, and as I mentioned earlier, continue to be opportunistic with other cash that we generate for the business in terms of share buyback.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "I've heard the competitive answer before, but that's really just saying we're going to see what everybody else does and set it accordingly. But isn\u2019t it something you kind of look at and say this is the type of business that we've learned a lot from the recession, we've got a lot of free cash flow coming in, wouldn\u2019t you drive it based on your own kind of capital allocation needs and so on and sort of drive it that way as opposed to competitive? Just throwing it out there, just curious as to how you look at it.", "Robert Knight", "Those are all factors that we consider, but we don't have a set target that we're going to play out there.", "James Young", "Walter, I think what we're focused on internally is generating the cash. I mean, making certain we're putting the right investment balance for growth, and it's a disciplined process in terms of our capital, the way we look at it. Generate the cash, and then that gives us that flexibility in terms of listening to our shareholders how that balance works. I mean, where we -- clearly, in talking with shareholders, given what's happened the last two, three years, some of the perspectives are changing. And again, my goal here and the goal of this team is to generate that cash and put us in that position that we've got to make those decisions.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.", "Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "My question is around Intermodal. If I heard correctly, I thought I heard you say there were positive developments around the Customer Direct business and Streamline. So I guess I want to understand the mix between Customer Direct and the use of intermediaries, and then how that naturally drifts over time?", "John Koraleski", "Our Streamline business is through intermediaries. It is not a direct Union Pacific relationship with customers. So what the Streamline product does, though, is it offers the intermediaries the capability to offer a door-to-door product provided by a railroad. So we are not going direct. We are not retailing through the subsidiary, the Streamline subsidiary, but simply offering a different kind of a rail product to the third parties.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Malat of Goldman Sachs.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just a follow-up on the employees, the comp for employees that won't be up as much as 2010. Can you help us just think through the puts and takes to the outlook there?", "Robert Knight", "Yes, Scott, the challenges that we have on the comp and benefit line, as I pointed out, we don't expect it to be as great as in 2010, but we do have some pressures. For example, in addition to the normal wage and health and welfare, and I'd characterize those as being normal inflationary pressures, we have, as you pointed out, we have pension expense and unemployment tax hurdles that will hit that line item. And that's why we think there'll be pressure on that line item.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then you talked a little bit about the export coal from the PRB. But just longer term, and I know at the analyst day, you talked about potentially hitting 5 million tons in five years. It seemed like we've seen some activity in investments in the ports. And Arch Coal came out and said they think they can do 5 million tons of export coal at a long view by 2012. I heard some similar things out of Peabody. Does this kind of investment, and I don't think any of us expected this earlier, but does it pull up some of the benefit you were expecting over the next five years, and can you help frame the opportunity?", "John Koraleski", "Yes, I actually do think if they're successful \u2013 it\u2019s like two steps forward and three steps back in some respects because they got the investment through, and now we've got the environmentalists that are trying to protest shipping Powder River Basin coal to Asia. So that's now going to delay that probably into 2012 as opposed to accelerate it for us. But all of those investments, the way it's playing itself out, are an opportunity for us, and should they accelerate those development projects, that would be good news for us, and it would bring forward some of those opportunities. We could look at the possibility of 1 million tons of export coal this year being 2, 2\u00bd or something like that, if we got some traction on some of those projects.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Just a quick one on Intermodal. You were talking earlier about the CSA and the trucking. Who knows what's going to happen, but let's pretend for a second that there is a real capacity reduction in the trucking market, and you have a lot of folks coming to you who have not traditionally been customers, maybe through the IMCs that are saying, \"Can you help us out? Can we get on the railroad?\" What would be the bottleneck? How much excess capacity could you throw at that if the volume came? And would the benefit to you be mostly a volume benefit this year, with the chance to get pricing next year? Or would you be able to up price as the volume came online?", "John Koraleski", "I would say the immediate bottleneck, if it comes in a big way, would be the number of containers. Container capacity is pretty much sold out. Right now, we've got an order in place, but it was tight last year, and if it surged, it could be tight this year as well. And in terms of the opportunity for us, it would be both the volume side, but also the price side.", "Lance Fritz", "And also, Jeff, that bottleneck question has to do with where the volume shows up, what quarter it's in.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "Stripping out legacy, guys, when you think about the way that Intermodal pricing should trend this year, there's a lot of exuberance, I think, in the truckload market. How much of that do you think can flow through when you think about the Intermodal opportunity and the pricing side and your over-the-road conversions in the Intermodal business?", "John Koraleski", "Well, how big is that?", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "Well, depending on who you talk to, it's anywhere from 5% to 30%, right?", "John Koraleski", "We would be in a position with a significant improvement, a significant opportunity on the price side to take advantage of that. Even though we have a legacy tail that we're working through, we still have plenty of upside opportunity if the market got incredibly hot, and we have a lot more customers knocking on our door. And I think the key, though, in this is really to reinforce how important it is to keep your service metrics, net value proposition there. I think again, you provide great service, there\u2019s a value equation there. And then again, if it's accelerated with tight trucking capacity, we should have good upside.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "Along those lines, I guess, then, when you think about train speed, you guys commented that things are looking good in January relative to the fourth quarter. How do you think about that, and I guess how should we think about that as volumes return to the network? Is the current speed sustainable as we move throughout the year on average? And then I guess when I think about that, is there a speed that you think of as being in the green zone in terms of kind of a variance that we could look at? And then if we saw speeds really dipping, where\u2019s that threshold where you guys start getting worried about network fluidity?", "Lance Fritz", "The first answer, Justin, is that we are comfortable with our velocity right now. The second part of the answer is there are many impacts to velocity when we run on an outdoor network like we do, one of which is volume. We've demonstrated, if you look backwards in 2010, the ability to handle substantial increases in volume with really minor impacts on velocity, and only one of those impacts in 2010 was a volume increase. And then if you look a little further ahead, I won't answer specifically whether or not we have a threshold that gets us concerned, but we are very confident in our ability to handle the kind of volumes we anticipate in 2011 and then beyond, given both the capacity that we currently have, our plan for improving throughput through management activity and the capital budget that we've got for this year and anticipate for future years.", "James Young", "And I think the other thing to keep in mind here is we obviously learned what happens if you're not prepared when you look back at 2003 or '04. But we learned a lot from that. That's why we -- the importance of understanding your surge capacity that's out here, why hiring in advance and training, while that may seem obvious to you. You're hiring people today, that it takes a minimum six months to get an employee on the ground, so we've got to keep ahead of that. The other thing is we've never been in a better position, I think, to control our volume and the impact in the network, a lot of the technology tools we have, the contracts we have, so I feel -- I won't say we won't have some challenges if you get a surge, but we're nowhere near it when you think about where it would really be detrimental to the network.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.", "Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC", "You gave the guidance for PTC for 2010. Assuming there was no changes on the governmental side in PTC plans, would that have to be going up for 2011, just directionally? Or could that kind of maintain that $250 million run rate?", "James Young", "Well, again, we spent -- if you look at 2010, we spent about $90 million. We're at $250 million this year. So there's a substantial increase. We've got a very programmed approach in terms of how we make these investments by corridor. It would likely kick up a little bit next year going forward here, but there's a lot of ground that needs to be covered here in terms of the effectiveness of technology, the footprint that comes into play and how you think about what corridor. So let's use $250 million this year with some upside next year on PTC.", "Operator", "Our final question today is coming from the line of Gary Chase with Barclays Capital.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "Lance, when you were going through your prepared remarks, I guess one of the things that caught me a little bit by surprise was that you noted the potential for leverage in the coal business first. And typically, we think of that being much more of a factor in kind of the manifest networks than the bulk networks. So I wondered if you could just elaborate on what you're seeing there and how you're seeing that upside.", "Lance Fritz", "Sure. I think what I was speaking to is that compared to the average in the network, as coal grows, it has wonderful leverage on productivity because it's such an efficient network on its own. There are incremental opportunities within the coal network, but in comparison on average, it is a highly efficient network. The other thing to note is that we do have plenty of upside opportunity on productivity and leverage in Intermodal, which Jack mentioned. He expects to see some pretty strong growth in 2011. And clearly, in the manifest network, we've still got plenty of opportunity as well.", "James Young", "Gary, the other thing when you think about leverage here, think about this. We have capacity investments up into the Powder River Basin that's set between UP and [indiscernible] to handle over 400 million tons a year, 425 million tons a year. And if you look at what -- UP handled about 250 million tons this year, which is far below where we were at the peak, which I think was around 270 million, 275 million. So you've got not only -- when you think about the operational opportunity, we've got a huge investment that we're depreciating on the books today that we're levered as we add volume.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments.", "James Young", "Well, thanks for joining us today. We look forward to our call here three months out, and I hope you heard we're feeling pretty good about this year. Again, I think the economy is showing some positive signs for us, and we're prepared to handle it and perform for our shareholders.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Young, you may begin.", "James Young", "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me in Omaha today are Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President, Operation; and Rob Knight, CFO. Union Pacific achieved another strong quarter despite continued weather challenges. We delivered an all-time quarterly earnings record of $1.59 per share, a 14% increase compared to 2010. In addition, we achieved a record second quarter in operating income, up 9% from last year. Cash from operations also hit a best-ever mark for the second quarter. The benefits of our diverse franchise really paid off this quarter. We saw volume gains in 5 of our 6 business groups with strong growth in Ag products and chemical shipments. As I mentioned, we continue to battle massive flooding in the Midwest. Lance will provide more details on this in few minutes. But I just want to comment on the tremendous job our team has done to protect the majority of our network while maintaining very strong customer service level. They really have accomplished an incredible feat. When we look at the financial impact of the flood, we estimate an earnings hit of about $0.04 a share, roughly $20 million of missed coal revenue and around $14 million in flood-related operating cost. Despite these challenges, we remain focused in delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that guarantees -- that generates value for our customers. As Jack will show, these efforts were recognized with record customer satisfaction results. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jack.", "John Koraleski", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Well Jim said, we've been on a great streak with our customer satisfaction scores over the past several quarters. And the second quarter of 2011 is no exception. Satisfaction for the quarter came in at 92, up 3 points from last year and topping our previous best set earlier this year. Along the way, we also set a new best-ever monthly mark receiving a score of 93 from our customers in April. ", "That strong value proposition and a diverse business mix produced volume growth of 3% in the second quarter as the overall economy continued its slow improvement. We saw real strength in our Ag products and Chemical businesses, helping us to offset some of the impacts of flooding, which primarily affected our energy volumes. Core price improved 4.5% with each of the groups posting gains. Those price gains, along with increased fuel surcharge revenue and a couple of points positive mix from the strong growth in Ag and Chemical combined to produce a 13% increase in average revenue per car. The stronger volume and the improved average revenue per car growth rate revenue up 16% to a near record $4.6 billion. ", "So let's take a look at the drivers of each of those businesses. Given the slight decline in our Intermodal volumes, I figured that's probably the one you're most interested in, so I thought we'd actually start there this morning. Our Intermodal revenue increased 13% of the 14% improvement and average revenue per unit was partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. The actual volume decline was driven by a contract loss in our International business, which was down 2% overall. Although international would have posted a small gain without that loss, the market slowed significantly as the quarter progressed. In fact, the most recent data showed softer import volumes in both May and June with West Coast ports seeing year-over-year decline while the East edged up a bit. That's a pretty sharp contrast to the solid growth numbers posted in the first 4 months. Uncertain signals on consumer demand has led to a more cautious inventory replenishment strategy, with inventories remaining at historically low levels relative to sales even as the retailers posted so much stronger sales year-over-year. Domestic Intermodal was flat versus last year's second quarter volume. The renegotiation of the last domestic Intermodal legacy contracts gave us the flexibility to take a totally new approach to the market. Early in 2011, we introduced our mutual commitment program where we're asking beneficial owners to commit off-peak volume in return for guaranteed price and box commitments during peak season. We wanted to ensure we got it right from the get-go, so our implementation wasn't quite as fast as what we had planned. This program represents a significant change for those customers, so we had to work really hard to build their understanding and also to assure them of our commitment to this new approach. ", "Second factor for the flat volume was our continued focus on moving our Domestic Intermodal rates up to re-investable levels. Core price improvement in our Domestic Intermodal business was significantly higher than our 4.5% overall average for the quarter. This price improvement combined with the incremental fuel surcharge we now collect helped drive average revenue per unit up 16% for our -- Domestic Intermodal business, so we're making some pretty good progress here. Overall, we're offering a strong value proposition in this market, and we anticipate we'll see stronger growth as demand picks up here in the second half. Agricultural products volume grew 11%, which combined with a 9% improvement in average revenue per car to drive revenue growth of 22%. Export whole grain shipments increased 58% with strong worldwide demand driving a 59% increase in wheat exports and feed grain exports climbing 50% from 2010s relatively soft volumes. New business and increased production drove a 28% increase in import beer volumes, and export opportunities and solid margins for producers boosted ethanol shipments 9% while meals and oil volume were also up 9%. Our Automotive revenue climbed 14% as volume grew 4% and the average revenue per car increased 11%. The pace of recovery in the auto industry slowed a little in the second quarter, impacted both by the Japanese tsunami, and some degree of consumer hesitancy in the face of uncertain economic signals and higher gas prices. Despite those headwinds, U.S. vehicle sales still posted year-over-year gains. That translated into a 4% growth in our finished vehicle shipments, driven by the Detroit Three, and our parts shipments increased 2%. Chemical volume increased 11%, which combined with a 7% improvement in average revenue per car, drove revenue up 19%. Increased crude oil volume was again the primary driver of growth in our Petroleum Product segment, which increased 31% with asphalt and lubricants also continuing to show strength. With export potash shipments up 36% and strong seasonal demand for all nutrients, fertilizer grew 22%, and our industrial chemicals volume grew 6% reflecting a somewhat stronger economy. ", "Despite the impact of the Mississippi River flooding early in the quarter and the Midwest flooding toward the end, energy posted a 14% increase in revenue, the result of an 11% improvement in average revenue per car and a 2% growth in volume. We're estimating that the floods reduced volume by about 14,000 cars or about 3 percentage points of volume growth during the quarter. Our Southern Powder River Basin tonnage increased 3%, again driven by new business to the Wisconsin utility. Colorado, Utah, which is competing in the Eastern market for both Eastern and SPRB coal and natural gas, saw tonnage decline 4%. This segment did see a boost from an improved international market with export volume to River terminals and West Coast ports up 700,000 tons. We often talk about the diversity of our business mix as being a franchise strength of Union Pacific. Nowhere is that more evident than in our Industrial Products business in the second quarter where volumes grew 4% even with no improvement in construction related markets. The combination of volume growth and an 11% improvement in average revenue per car drove revenue up 16%. Metallic mineral shipments increased 106% as our new iron ore unit train business from Utah to California for export to China ramped up. Energy demand and increased horizontal drilling continues to drive demand for frac sand, barites, and bentonite, resulting in a 34% growth in our nonmetallic mineral car loadings. Energy-related demand along with recovering auto industry is also boosting fuel and ferrous scrap shipments, which were up 5%. Highway conversions drove our 12% growth in paperboard, and in construction, our lumber posted a small gain, but cement and rock both declined for the quarter. ", "We already talked about Intermodal so let me wrap up here with a look at what's ahead for the rest in 2011. The economy sent some mixed signals in the second quarter, but the general consensus is for stronger growth in the second half of the year and we actually share that view. While flood conditions continue unless the situation worsens unexpectedly, the volume impact should be pretty minimal for us. Here are some of the specific growth opportunities that we see for each of the 6 businesses. Our Ag products business faces a tough comp against last year's whole grain and meals volumes but ethanol growth should continue, and we expect to launch our new plant-to-rail service where we'll be moving both DDGS for transload and the containers for exports. Food and refrigerated shipments should also continue to grow. Auto sales are forecasted to strengthen, especially in the fourth quarter and the markets will get a boost from the continued recovery of the Japanese manufacturers. Along those lines, Toyota has told us that they're going to be back to 100% in North America by September, so that's some good news for us. ", "Chemicals led our growth in the first half, and that solid performance should continue with shale development, and seasonal fertilizer demand, expected to lead the way. Energy is going to continue to benefit from the new Wisconsin Utility business, as well as the new coal-fired facility near Waco that started shipments earlier this month. Increased export interest is an encouraging trend especially for our Colorado, Utah business where output should increase as the mine that had been undergoing a longwall move is now returning back to full production. And the record heat that we're seeing together with the potential to make up some of the tons [ph] we missed due to the second quarter floodings should all be positives for us here in the second half. ", "While housing and construction activity remain a question mark, energy-related demand and the ramp up of our iron ore export move, should lead for growth in Industrial Products. And in the Intermodal despite recent softening on the international side, we still anticipate a peak season, which should drive stronger Intermodal volume. The expectation is this year's peak will be somewhat compressed compared to last year when volumes were ramping up late in the second quarter. So overall, we've got a strong value proposition -- it's underpinned by excellent service, positions us to take advantage of these and other opportunities across our diverse portfolio. Expected growth in volume should continue with anticipated price gains to drive continued record revenue growth through the end of this year. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thanks, Jack, and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance, which is the foundation of our operations. In the second quarter of 2011, we achieved another best-ever quarterly performance in employee safety. The continued maturation of our total safety culture and risk identification in mitigation processes, along with enhanced training drove the improvement. Our safety culture is especially important today as we've ramped up our hiring of new employees to cover both attrition and volume increases. We're also recalling employees back from furloughed status who haven't worked for us in more than 2 years. In terms of customer safety or derailments, we improved 10% to a record second quarter reportable incident rate. Investments in infrastructure, technology and training, all helped reduce the risk in our workplace. And despite increases in rail and highway traffic during the quarter, our crossing accident rate declined 14% versus 2010. We're turning to a long-term improvement trend. We continue to help communities address risky driver behavior and to close grade crossings. Overall, we're making great progress towards our ultimate goal of 0 incidents. Now, before reviewing our network performance, I want to spend a minute recapping how we're managing the flood here in the Midwest.", "A record amount of snow melt from the Rockies and the Northern Plains combined with June rainfall in the Midwest that averaged 200% to 300% above normal has generated massive flooding that we're currently seeing. Despite the widespread flooding, our team has done a tremendous job keeping tracks in service and managing around the disruptions. We successfully preserved our critical central quarter from North Platte through Omaha and into Iowa by raising tracks up to 5 feet, increasing drainage and building protected berm to prevent washouts. We are working with many federal, state and local agencies to keep this most critical rail line open. Unfortunately, we've lost our direct route between Omaha and Kansas City, and 1 of 2 routes between Kansas City and St. Louis. We are managing through these outages by employing surge resources and alternative routes, while helping customers with their contingency plans. In spite of the flooding, service levels and network performance for the second quarter remained relatively strong, demonstrating our resiliency and recoverability in the face of major weather disruptions. Our ability to handle both growing volumes and weather challenges is reflected on this chart. By applying the principles of the unified plan and utilizing our surge resources, we have sustained the network's service reliability and efficiency. ", "As you can see, our network velocity remains strong averaging 26.1 miles per hour for the second quarter. However, we did see about a 1 mile per hour decline in June from May due to additional maintenance curfews, flood-related outages and congestion related to the flood. We continue to monitor network efficiency closely given all the route and schedule changes we've made due to the track outages. But the cost maintained excellent service as we battled the flood, resulted in mix productivity as indicated on the next slide.", "Gross ton miles per employee declined about 1% from 5.36 million to 5.32 million gross ton miles per employee. The addition of nearly 1,000 new hires in the training pipeline and increase in employees working on capital projects and the surge resources used to combat the flood completely offset our productivity initiatives in the quarter. We made this trade off to keep the network fluid, to keep trains moving efficiently and to build additional capacity for future growth. In the second half of 2011, we expect to return to the long-term trend of increasing GTMs per employee as we continue to implement productivity initiatives. Shown here are train sizes for our Intermodal and Manifest businesses, which improved again in the second quarter helping to offset some of the headwinds I mentioned earlier. Other productivity good news items in the quarter included leveraging first crew starts versus carload growth in our scheduled networks and improved fuel efficiency. Our service performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our resource and service planning as the growing value proposition that Union Pacific provides to our customers. Our service scorecard on Slide 18 illustrates UP's customer value proposition. As carloads grew 3%, our Service Delivery Index remained strong and improved from first quarter results. We absorbed the increased workload while maintaining solid customer service. Diving down a level, the local operating teams are building the fundamental elements of great service. One of those fundamental elements is captured by industry spot and poll, which set an all-time best quarterly record at 95%. And consistent with Jack's discussion on record customer satisfaction, our local customer satisfaction is also at an all-time best. This survey solicits feedback from customers the operating team interacts with daily at the shipping and receiving docks, where the accuracy and reliability of our industry crews is critical. So while the floods are certainly having an impact, we are largely overcoming the worst of it to provide customers with reliable, valuable service. The endgame is delivering the full potential of UP's franchise, translated into these deliverables. First, world-class safety results as we build a Total Safety Culture. Minimizing flood impacts through proactive measures and contingency planning, leveraging growth to the bottom line with network productivity and growing the value proposition for our customers and positioning for growth as we provide excellent service. So going forward, the key for the operating team is agility in delivering on UP's value proposition. We'll continue to work to meet customer expectations, while enhancing shareholder returns regardless of the circumstances. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for the financial review.", "Robert Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start by summarizing our second quarter results. Operating revenue grew 16% to a record $4.9 billion on the strength of core pricing gains, fuel surcharge recoveries and volume growth. Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, increasing 19% or $563 million compared to the second quarter of 2010. Higher fuel prices accounted for roughly half of this increase. Operating income totaled $1.4 billion, a 9% increase and a second quarter record for us. Other income totaled $26 million in the second quarter, $7 million higher compared to last year. Quarterly interest expense declined 3% versus second quarter 2010 to $148 million driven by lower average debt levels. Second quarter income tax expense increased to $485 million, higher pretax earnings drove this increase. Net income totaled $785 million, increasing 10% compared to 2010. The outstanding share balance declined 3% versus last year reflecting our share repurchase activities. These results drove an all-time quarterly record in the earnings-per-share of $1.59, a 14% increase versus last year. ", "Turning now to our top line. We achieved 16% freight revenue growth to a second quarter record of $4.6 billion. This slide provides a walk across of the second quarter growth drivers. Second quarter car loadings were up 3%. We also saw a positive mix impact, driven by strong growth and higher average revenue per car moves. We saw price improvement of 4.5% in the second quarter. Core pricing gains were driven by solid demand, our value proposition and RCAF fuel escalators. As we have stated before, the majority of business in our legacy portfolio that we will compete for and reprice this year does not come up for renewal until mid-fourth quarter of this year. Fuel surcharge revenue added 6% to the top line, reflecting higher fuel prices in the second quarter compared to 2010. If you look at our incremental margin for the second quarter after adjusting for higher fuel prices and the flood impact, revenues were up 10.5%, while costs grew 9.5%. That relationship equates to an incremental margin of about 36%. As we noted in April, we've taken the necessary steps to prepare for future volume growth in the second half of this year. That being said, we believe 36% incremental margins will be the low mark for the year. As you know, our long-term guidance includes an operating ratio of 65% to 67% by 2015. In order to achieve this, we are focusing on incremental margins in the neighborhood of about 50% over the next several years. Of course, this depends upon volume level and fuel prices. ", "Now let's turn to expenses. Slide 24, summarizes our year-over-year increases in operating expense by category. As I mentioned, higher fuel prices contributed to roughly half of the $563 million increase in expense. Other more normalized year-over-year increases include: Inflationary cost and volume-related expenses, and as we saw increases in casualty expense, TE&Y training costs and flood-related expenses. ", "With that, let's spend a minute and walk through each of these categories. Second quarter fuel expense totaled $904 million, increasing $296 million compared to last year. The average diesel fuel price, which increased 44% year-over-year was the biggest driver of this quarterly change. Two factors drove the increase. First, the average barrel price of $103 rose 32% compared to last year. And secondly, conversion spread, which cover the cost to convert crude oil to diesel fuel, more than doubled to an average of $27 per barrel in the second quarter compared to last year. Although our fuel surcharge mechanisms enabled us to recover the majority of the higher fuel prices, the resulting increase in expense and revenue had a negative impact on our operating ratio. The effect was a 2-point increase in our operating ratio and $0.02 reduction in our earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2010. ", "Fuel expense was also higher as a result of a 5% increase in gross ton miles. A portion of these expenses were offset by improvements in our consumption rate. Our fuel conservation efforts produced a 2% savings in the quarter. ", "Slide 26, summarizes second quarter expenses for compensation and benefits. Breaking down the year-over-year change, about half of the increase in expense can be attributed to inflationary pressures that we have discussed with you and we did it back in April, health and welfare, unemployment taxes, wage increases and pension costs. The remainder was driven by volume growth, higher training costs and expenses associated with flood-related activities. Productivity was somewhat masked by additional resources needed for rerouting and curfews caused by the flooding as Lance just described. Training costs were up $26 million in the quarter, as new employees were hired for expected second half 2011 attrition and volume growth. ", "Slide 27, takes a closer look at the change in our workforce levels. Workforce levels increased 6% in the second quarter compared to 2010. Higher volumes in the quarter drove 2.5% increase. We had more employees in the training pipeline during the quarter, driving another 2.5% increase. In addition, there were more individuals working on capital projects including Positive Train Control, which added another 1%. That's a net add of about 2,400 employees. ", "Looking at our full year projections, we would expect our workforce to be up around 1,500 employees, of course, this is dependent upon volumes. Walking through the numbers. We have expected attrition of roughly 4,000 employees this year. We will hire around 4,500 new employees, and we'll continue to recall our furloughed employees, which should add another 1,000 or so to our workforce by yearend. That being said, these projections are dependent upon volume assumptions, and we will adjust accordingly. ", "Now turning to our other expense categories. Other expenses came in at $196 million. We beat our guidance of $225 million primarily due to lower-than-expected personal injury expense reflecting favorable results from our actuarial study. Our continued safety gains drove this positive experience. Versus 2010, the other expense category was up $74 million. Although lower than expected, personal injury and other casualty-related costs were still higher in the quarter compared to last year. Going forward, we still expect continued safety gains. Other cost pressures including increased operating taxes also drove expenses up in the quarter versus 2010. Barring any unusual items, we expect the other expense category to end up around $215 million to $225 million a quarter for the balance of the year. We remain committed in our efforts to offset cost pressures. Purchased services and materials expense increased 9% or $44 million to $516 million. The biggest driver of the increase was greater use of contract services associated with higher volumes and flood prevention efforts. Crew lodging and transportation costs also increased with the growth in volume levels. Locomotive and freight car maintenance costs were also up year-over-year, as we returned stored assets to active service, not only to cover volume growth, but also as additional resources to help mitigate the impact of rerouting caused by the flooding. ", "In total, we incurred $14 million of flood-related expenses, $10 million is reflected in the purchased services line and the remaining $4 million hit our labor expense line. Slide 29, summarizes second quarter expenses for the remaining 2 categories. Depreciation expense increased 9% or $33 million to $401 million, which is in line with the previous guidance that we gave. Increased capital spending and higher depreciation associated with hauling more gross ton miles drove this increase.", "Looking at the second half of 2011, we expect depreciation expense to increase at about the same rate on a year-over-year basis that we saw in the first half of this year. Second quarter equipment and other rent expense totaled $283 million, flat with last year. Increases in other rental expenses were offset by lower freight car and locomotive lease expenses. Bringing both the revenue and expense sides together, Union Pacific's operating ratio illustrate the substantial improvements in profitability that we achieved over the last several years. On a reported basis, our operating ratio was 71.3% for the second quarter of 2011. Ongoing productivity efforts, core pricing gains and volume growth all contributed to this mark. Higher fuel prices continue to put pressure on our operating ratio creating a 2-point headwind in the second quarter and for the first half of this year compared to 2010. If fuel prices stay at current levels, and with 6 months already behind us, it will be difficult to make full year improvement versus last year's record of 70.6%. However, if you adjust for fuel prices, we fully expect to see real improvement in this year's core operating ratio versus last year's record mark. ", "Union Pacific's profitability in the second quarter of 2011 also drove record free cash flow after dividends, growth in cash from operations more than offset increased capital spending and higher dividend payments. Cash dividends paid in the year-to-date period of 2011 were up 38% from 2010's level. Similar to the first quarter, bonus depreciation contributed positively to cash flows in both years. Union Pacific's balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape consistent with the goal of maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. At the end of the second quarter, the adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 40.9%. There's some timing in this entry year number and we'd expect that 2011 year end ratio to be slightly higher. ", "Our performance continues to generate strong cash flow, and we've returned that to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In May, we increased our second quarter dividend by 25%. This was a significant step toward achieving our targeted payout ratio of 30%. During the second quarter, we bought back 3.6 million shares, totaling $360 million. These shares were purchased under our new authorization program of 40 million shares. Dividend growth and opportunistic share repurchases continue to be key components of our balanced approach to cash allocation for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.", "Looking ahead, we see continued opportunities to grow and improve our profitability. As Jack discussed, we're focusing on continued volume growth in the second half of 2011. Of course, this assumes that the economy cooperates. We remain committed to achieving real pricing gains in 2011, driven by the increased value of our service, solid market demand and the added benefit of competing for and repricing our legacy business later this year. As we look at the second half of the year, the combination of stronger revenue growth our ongoing productivity efforts and current resource investments should produce record earnings, allowing us to reward our shareholders with even greater returns. With that, I'd turn it back to Jim.", "James Young", "Thanks, Rob. With the first half behind us, we delivered record financials. Looking into the second half, we expect stronger performance despite some economic uncertainties and ongoing flood challenges. Union Pacific's strong value proposition, our diverse franchise and record service performance, all position us to deliver volume gain, price, and increased productivity over the balance of the year. These efforts will translate into increased value for our customers and stronger cash flows and financial returns for our shareholders. So with that, let's open it up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "I was curious -- your outlook for the second half of the year sounded fairly solid from a volume standpoint despite the challenges that have been facing the economy. Can you give us a sense of what your customers are telling you especially on the Intermodal side? Curious what your thoughts are from a peak season standpoint? And maybe if you could go into a little bit of what happened on the international customer side, and how that will play out this peak season for you guys?", "John Koraleski", "Sure. Overall, our customer base is expecting that we still are going to have a peak season. And overall, they're saying it's probably going to be more compressed than what we've normally seen start a little later, more in the August timeframe instead of July. And actually, it could be higher in intensity given the shorter duration of it. I think combination of higher fuel prices as we got into the second quarter here and a lot of uncertainty about what's going on with the debt ceiling and what that impact that'll have on the economy on taxes and things like that has resulted in consumers kind of pulling in a bit. And I think basically a lot of retailers are going to wait and see that resolution before we start shipping before the holiday season. So we're not -- we're kind of staying with what our customers are saying, which is, it's going to be more compressed. It's going to be stronger in intensity, and we're prepared for that. We feel good about that. In terms of the international contract, Justin we're not going to really get into details of that. It was not surprising for us. It is obviously disappointing; you always hate to lose some business. But we're good, and we're moving on.", "James Young", "Hey, Justin. I'd tell you. When you think about the second half, there's probably 4 things when you're saying what's the difference second half versus first, just as Jack said. You will have a fall harvest, and even though you've got some massive flooding out here. It's pretty minor in terms of the harvest. And right now, when you look at rain and heat, we should have pretty good harvest. Our coal business should be stronger second half versus first year. Obviously the big part of the flood's behind us. But if you look at the heating days, and you all should be experiencing the weather, we think we've got some real potential on growth there. As Jack said, we do expect a peak season. Christmas will come. It maybe a little bit tighter that's out here. But again, that is a potential upside. And another one, that I think gets missed is, auto production should be stronger, not only new model year coming in, but you have the Japan impact from first -- second quarter that we should say it's still a bit stronger, so I think if you look at the last 5, 6 years, we've always had stronger second half versus first. The only difference was when 2008 and the recession hit. So we -- I'm pretty confident, you're going to see stronger volumes through second half.", "Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG", "Thanks, Jim. And, I guess, for Rob, you've spoken earlier this year to the fact that you thought first quarter core pricing was going to be the trough for the year. This obviously came in in-line with where first quarter was. Curious, from an outlook standpoint, if you still have confidence that the second half should be higher from a core pricing standpoint and what gives you that confidence as you look out?", "James Young", "Yes, Justin. This is Jim. Our pricing is that, it was very good in the quarter. And I want you to think about this here. Our areas that we have had the biggest upside from legacy in this business, which is coal and Intermodal had this lowest growth. So when you look at it, we had some negative mix in our business in second quarter. And I'm very confident in our pricing going forward. We're adding a lot of value. We're going to -- when you look at -- again this will be a punch when we look at demand the second half. If demand gets stronger than what we expect, we'll see higher pricing. But I feel good about our pricing plan.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jon Langenfeld Robert W. Baird.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "On the Intermodal -- Domestic Intermodal side. Can you talk through -- you talked about the strategy of getting full year commitments from the shippers. How much of it is that versus -- we're simply raising our rates to a more market prices and therefore you have some shippers that have sought other alternatives whether be in or whether back to the trough because the rates were unsustainably low from many years.", "James Young", "John, that's always really hard to discern which is which, because they kind of go hand and glove. The mutual commitment program actually has price increases associated with it as well. So it's a change. It's something very different than anything we've ever done before. A lot of customers are testing our commitment and I resolve to follow through with that. I would guess -- that affects probably 65% of my Domestic Intermodal business. I think that was probably a somewhat bigger factor than the pricing.", "Jon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And ultimately, is this something you get through 1 cycle here, 1 season and you show the commitment on the back-end and then they're comfortable with it. And by the time you get into 2012, it should be more normalized growth relative to the market on the domestic side?", "James Young", "Yes, that's my fondest hope. Jon, as we think about it, getting through this first year is critical. Last year, we disappointed customers. We didn't have enough boxes. They're really watching us very carefully in terms of when we make the commitment for the boxes, will they actually be there. Lance and his team are delivering on that. We're going to be there without a doubt. And when they see that we really can do what we're promising and the commitment we're making, I think 2012 will be a much better opportunity. We'll be more in line with the market.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch", "If I could just dig into the -- that shift on the Intermodal. Maybe, Jack, can you just kind of roll that out a little bit more. What are you doing to smooth the demand by the pricing shifts? Can you kind of just go over that a little bit deeper.", "John Koraleski", "Sure, Ken. What we're asking customers -- the beneficial cargo owners to do is to make a commitment for off-peak volume. And whatever they are willing to commit to us in the off-peak period, we will make a commitment to them to protect in terms of box availability up to 110% of that volume during peak. So the more they commit to us during the off-peak, the greater they'll have a commitment of a fixed box availability for them during the peak season. And...", "John Mims - BB&T Capital Markets", "So it's a capacity guarantee not -- is the price built into that?", "John Koraleski", "Yes, there is a price built into that, and the price is protected up to the 110%. If they go over the 110%, then it starts to change.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "When we think about the key pillars or real pieces [ph], we had pricing volume productivity, and now here in 2011 obviously, we had the flooding challenges and what not. But there's obviously questions at the macro level on the volume growth rate. And the cost inflation is starting to kick up. So you think it's fair to sort of say that the opportunity from those buckets is more diminished, and now it's really kind of hinges on pricing from here on out?", "Robert Knight", "Well, Bill, I don't think so. You've got to -- obviously, the economy is still relatively weak. So again, when we went into the year we said slow growth. And that's pretty much what we're seeing. We're actually getting a little bit different in the second quarter than we expected. But you will level -- we will leverage growth going forward here. So I'm not quite certain what your question is. Again, sure, I'd like to have a hot economy that's out here, but we will see very good leverage second half. The pricing stories there and in fact, I think, again, if the economy picks up strong, you've got upside with the value proposition. In the productivity side, we obviously are resourced for more volume right now. When you look at the second quarter results, it should be our low point this second quarter in terms of efficiency, in terms of the amount of resources we have at second quarter. But I would tell you this, if the volume doesn't materialize, we will respond. Keep in mind, we're going to lose 4,000 employees this year in terms of attrition. And as we showed in the last couple of years, you get a downturn in the economy here. We can take some cost off it. All 3 of them are going to be necessary for us to get to our long-term commitment on the operating ratio.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. So there's a bit of a timing mismatch here in terms of the resources or in the volumes weren't there. But assuming that that's all right, then you feel pretty good about your productivity.", "Robert Knight", "Absolutely, Bill. And again, it's difficult to see the economy going forward here today. You do have issues. And then -- we'd asked about the question about how our customers are feeling. I mean there is an uncertainty, whether it's customers or employees out here when they read in the media that because of issues in D.C., we're going to have a meltdown in this country. And my concern is that people stop spending. That's out here. We're not seeing that yet. And I do believe, again, we'll see volume growth the second half of the year. But there's probably more uncertainty right now. There's no question. There's more uncertainty right now in the economy today than when we came in at the start of the year.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "That's fair. Just one clarification on pricing. Once we're through the legacy repricing, how will the contracts work? What's the average age where we think of we can touch this percent of the business each year on pricing once we're sort of through all that?", "James Young", "Yes. Bill, overall, we have probably about 40% to 45% of our business tied up in multiyear contracts. So some portion of that will come up every year because obviously, those are staggered over different time periods. The remaining 55% to 60% of our business is either in tariff or in one-year deals. And that pricing comes up on an ongoing basis. So you guys are always asking us the question how much of our business is locked-in -- regardless of when you ask that question, it's usually about 70%. And those deals are coming up, either the one-year deals, the tariff deals or the renegotiation of contract rates as we go through the year.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "And are they staggered in a way where they're heavy in the single quarter or it's just normal throughout the year?", "John Koraleski", "Probably just because of historical practice, many of them kind of expire and renew at the end of the year. But over time, that's kind of been changing. And it really is dependent upon the business, the customers' views. In a lot of cases, if you look at, for instance, the Intermodal world where the commitments are really made in the May, June timeframe, that's kind of shifted away from year-end contract renegotiations. So it's evolving over time.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Let's see. I'll start with a question on the broader coal topic. I'm just trying to figure out how to look at coal volumes in second half. It seems like you've got a number of moving parts. When do you think that the flooding impact will abate? And we'll see a more normal run rate, just in terms of being able to run the railroad and handle the coal? And then how would you anticipate that what would appear to be a pretty material decline in stockpiles, how do think that affects your potential? Does that mean you can grow coal in fourth quarter 5%? Or -- I'm just trying to get a sense of how to model because it's tricky given the kind of various weather effects.", "James Young", "Okay, Lance, why don't you take the comment on operations.", "Lance Fritz", "Sure. Yes, Tom, as we're looking forward on the floods, we could be fortunate and start returning to a normal railroad sometime in early August or a more pessimistic view could be late August and into September. It's really very dependent on what happens with rain event in this basin that's draining into Missouri River. But right now, I would say on balance, we'll probably be returning to a normal railroad sometime in August.", "James Young", "Okay, Lance. Tom, the only caveat here though, we do have the network more stable. I mean, there are 2 pieces of the flood it's when you've got it and you've got your lines out, and we're not moving anything. Lance and his team have done a great job to where it's stable. That means we still have out-of-route moves that will impact your velocity. But right now, it's pretty stable. If you look at our coal loadings for the last several days, we're starting to see some pickup here. So I think operationally, again, being stable. We can handle the volume if it's there. Jack, you want to comment on the market?", "John Koraleski", "Yes, Tom. I think in the second quarter, I would have been up 5% without the floods anyway. So to say that we'll be at 5% in the second half, it looks to me 5% is a conservative number. I actually think we can do better than that.", "Thomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then the follow-up question. When we look at 2012, I think there's a recognition that you've got this big chunk of legacy business, $750 million in fourth quarter this year and then $300 million next year, so very large potential impact from legacy. And the different scenarios, you can model, you can say while you typically would step it all up at once and get a large impact or I think there've been cases where you said, \"Well the customer doesn't want to take the step-up all at once, and so we'll ramp it over a couple of years.\" And obviously, that makes a material difference on how you model the legacy impact. So can you provide any framework for what's kind of a more likely outcome on that legacy book? Do you get a lot of it at once? Or is it kind of more natural to get that step-up over a couple of years?", "John Koraleski", "Tom, at the end of the day here, there are some cases where it might be stepped up. But even in those cases, there was a substantial increase in year one. I mean, some of these contracts are so far off of market and basic economics that you can't afford to walk in without a pretty big increase. So 2012 I think has very good potential for us. And the issue of whether it's walked up is really minimal.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "So the first question is essentially on the pricing side. You've always talked about real pricing gains in excess of inflation and one of your competitors, obviously, came out with a third-party report saying that they were looking at real inflation trending at 4.6%. How do you look at that? When you look at your own business, when we listen to you saying inflation plus, should we wrap our head around inflation of 4.5%? Or -- I had in the back of my mind something lower but perhaps, you can weigh in on your thoughts there.", "James Young", "Rob, you want to take that?", "Robert Knight", "Yes, when we look at that, at least here in the midterm, Walter, we're looking at more in the 3.5% kind of range for all inflation.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay, perfect. Okay, and just a clarification, you mentioned a stronger back half, but obviously, and you also mentioned, you're always stronger in the back half. Do you mean that you're going to do better in the back half compared to what -- that improvement year-over-year that you've done on a seasonal basis in past?", "James Young", "I'm not certain...", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Just to clarify there. You've always had a better back half. Saying that you're going to have a better back half, I'm just wondering is it going to be better than normal, if you're to look at a seasonal, through the year? Or is it just, yes, we expected to do better like we always do better?", "John Koraleski", "Yes, part of it is we expect to do better, like we always do better. But what we've been saying is that, recall what we've been doing in both the first and the second quarter, is preparing for the anticipated growth in volumes in the beginning of the third quarter. And so when we've been saying that, we pretty much admit sequentially. But year-over-year, we expect to see volume growth. We expect to see gains on most of our measures. So it's both sequential and year-over-year.", "James Young", "Now, Walter, the only caveat that you'll run into there and I'm not -- we are always dealing with weather in this business, in fact hurricane season is now starting. We have been hit pretty hard here in the first half when you look at the weather. And that's a wildcard for us, second half. So assuming maybe a normal timeline here and whatever that might mean, I'd say there's a little bit upside there. The real lever to me on second half is going to be what happens with the economy. Really consumer demand will be the big or the main factor.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Could that be offset at all by some push quarter [ph] volumes? Or where those volumes that you lost, lost for good in the first half?", "John Koraleski", "The coal clearly is there for us over the next 6 months. It's whether the whole chain -- you've got a couple of different drivers of demand here. You've got what's happening with stockpiles as we've seen from the flood. So there should be some potential there. The heating season right now is when you look at what's going on with weather that should be a positive. It's really a question whether the whole logistics chain can handle it. But we clearly will see more coal volumes second half than we had first half. No question in my mind.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc", "Maybe one for Rob on headcount. You mentioned that you should expect I think in the neighborhood of about 1,500 year-over-year employee growth. When you think about the attrition, do you see that more -- it seems like that's more back half weighted. Do you think you'll start to see some of that benefit in the third quarter? Or does it stretch out a little bit to fourth quarter? Just trying to get some sense of the sequential run rate of that employee count going forward.", "Robert Knight", "Yes, a couple of points I wanted to make there is, as you know, we were up about 2,400 in the second quarter. And the point is, again depending on volumes, we expect that to come down to only being up, call it, 1,500 or so by the time the year ends -- finishes out. We have attrition throughout the year. There's probably a slight increase in the attrition rate in the third and fourth quarters from the first half. But we see attrition throughout the year. And we are still believing, at this point, that by the time the full year wraps up, that we'll have around 4,000 folks to train.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. So that is basically balanced would be your view in third and fourth quarter, depending obviously on the total volumes?", "Robert Knight", "Yes.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, that's helpful. And then follow-up on the Intermodal, the commitment from your customers. I guess, Jack, when you think about peak season being a little bit compressed here, I guess, do you feel like some customers are maybe playing a little bit of chicken depending on how they feel about the peak season and whether or not they want to provide a commitment? And I guess, if the peak season turns out to be a little bit less than expected, does that mean that maybe you push off another year or so the full implementation or getting through this process? I know you commented on that a little bit earlier but just your thoughts around that.", "John Koraleski", "If we have a compressed peak with kind of a higher, more intense center, that will work quite well for us. And we'll prove to our customers that we will stand by those commitments, deliver the boxes, and they'll be protected. And I think that sets the stage well for us. If peak is a little softer than that, I think they'll still see our performance, and I still think they'll see the first year of this program as being a plus. And we'll be fine going forward.", "Lance Fritz", "Chris, I think one of the things we want to be careful on is coming out of a quarter here where our volume is flat. When you think long-term Intermodal, there's no question on my mind that Intermodal offers us the highest growth rate in the future. We are going to have some aberrations. We're doing some things in the market that's new to us. But the value propositions there, we see customers today that are managing their inventory. I mean the whole rail industry, when you look at Intermodal's providing great service, that changes customers' mindset and how they think about inventories and may push it tighter. But we're backing it up with our investments. I really do see the Intermodal -- really all of our businesses have growth opportunity but Intermodal has the highest potential for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Malat of Goldman Sachs.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I think I was a little surprised by was just the fuel consumption rate improvement just given the flooding. Was that affected by the flooding? And then what can you expect out of fuel efficiency going forward?", "James Young", "Lance?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, absolutely. Not surprising to us, Scott. There's a number of underlying initiatives that are driving that fuel efficiency. We've got Fuel Masters Program, which gets the engineers engaged in managing their trains so that they consume less fuel. Our training tools, we're using the technology of our simulators to help engineers understand the perfect run so that they can manage the train for fuel consumption purposes. As we add new locomotives, that automatically improves sea rate as we more deeply penetrate DPU, that's a sea rate improvement. So the go-forward look is that those continued programs plus new ones that we're implementing like top-of-rail treatments are going to continue to drive improved sea rate.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Did the flooding have an impact this quarter so the run rate's even better than this?", "Lance Fritz", "Flooding would have some impact. When we're putting trains on reroutes, that might have an impact. But I would say, largely speaking, you set aside the fact that the flood is impacting dwell and delay, which is deleterious to sea rate, I bet that's rounding.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And then the other thing I was looking for is just on petroleum products, the 31% growth. Can you talk about that a little bit? What are you seeing out there in terms of opportunities for moving oil?", "James Young", "Jack?", "John Koraleski", "Last year, Scott, we moved about $10 million of petroleum products overall. We'll probably quadruple that amount this year in terms of moving from the Bakken down to St. James and elsewhere. We're seeing just a lot of interest overall. One of the unique things that rail gives to customers is the opportunity to go to various places and to play to the extent they can -- the market advantages for themselves. So we see a lot of interest in that. The infrastructure is being built-out by developers. We're focusing exclusively on our own rail infrastructure to support it. And everything that we see, even as pipelines develop, tells us there's going to be a continued opportunity for rail in this marketplace going forward for a long time.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then you said that they're ramping up, can you talk about the capacity, what they have ramped up to this year?", "John Koraleski", "I don't have a clear picture of entirely all that is in terms of all the things that they've done. But new facilities certainly are on the development side at this point in time. So there's additional capacity coming onstream that we can handle more and more business. And now we're looking not only at the Bakken, but at the Eagle Ford and some of the other shale developments that are taking place.", "Scott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "That's helpful.", "John Koraleski", "Scott, I said $10 million, that's 10,000 moves. And it was 4,000 moves, 16,000 is what we're ramping up to. But I do think actually it will be closer to $40 million compared to the $10 million also.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Over the last few months, we've seen a couple of cases where the Eastern railroads, particularly Norfolk Southern, has been using the strategy of overhauling locomotives at close to the end of their useful life as an alternative to buying new ones. And that seems to be a way to save somewhere on the order of $1 million a copy. Have you done that? Are you doing that? Are you looking into it? Is that a viable alternative for Union Pacific?", "James Young", "Yes, I'll let Lance handle that. But we've had a strategy for some time in terms of our overhaul project here in terms of trying to get to one overall versus 2 on a cycle. But go ahead, Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, that's exactly right. Jim is exactly right. For some time and as we look forward, part of our locomotive strategy -- asset strategy, overall, is to overhaul locomotives. Our game plan is to try to make that overhaul happen once in the full lifetime of our use of the locomotive. And we use some fairly sophisticated, statistical modeling and maintenance modeling to figure that out. But we're overhauling locomotives this year as part of our normal strategy. We did it in previous years, and we'll do it in the future years as well.", "James Young", "The key, which you have to think about through here, John, is with fuel at $3.40 a gallon, if you start looking at a locomotive that's pushing that 15-year age limit, you do an overhaul, but you better make certain you understand fuel efficiency, one, and emissions, two, and reliability, three, going forward. So all that comes into the equation there. But we've been doing this for a long time.", "John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. And then I was intrigued by Jack's comment that you recently started up an iron ore exporting unit train, it sounded like. Could you give us a little more color that? And then does that have any growth opportunities embedded in it? And are there other bulk materials that perhaps could be exported as well that you perhaps could play a role in handling?", "John Koraleski", "Sure. The iron ore move, it originates in Utah. We take it to Richmond, California where it's loaded on the vessels for delivery to Asia, to China. And it's a growing opportunity. I mean, there are lots of opportunities out there to move iron ore and any steel-related products over to China at this point in time. Probably one of the bigger hurdles for us is port capacity, kind of like the export coal situation as well. But we're continuing to work with customers and exploring ports, not only domestically within the U.S., but also in Mexico because the demand is growing for us. And then so that's kind of on the steel side. Our DDGS, our port-to-rail facility at Yuma, California, it's scheduled to start in September. We hope we'll bring that online. I think we're through all of our permitting and got all of the things done that we need to do. So starting in September, we'll start moving unit trains of DDGS to Yuma, California. We'll bring boxes. We will either intercept boxes on the way to the port or actually just bring boxes out of the port -- containers and stuff them and then take them back for delivery from there. So a lot of export opportunities actually overall.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse Group.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I have one follow-up question on the previous one about headcount. If I'm understanding you right, are we going to have a net decline in the number of heads in the second half relative to the first half to get to that plus 1,500 for the year.", "Robert Knight", "Chris, this is Rob. What we're saying is that year-over-year, the gap will be narrower than it was in second quarter and the big driver of that, by the way, is what happened last year. If you recall last year, basically in the first half, we were doing -- had very few people in the training pipeline. And in the back half of last year, that number ramped up.", "James Young", "Chris, keep in mind, that also, as Rob said, it's a function of volume.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then you talked about the incremental margin was 36%. If you strip out fuel and the flood effect in the second quarter, longer term, you target is in the 50s. Is it fair to assume then in the second half of this year, let's say fuel goes sideways, that we can be in the 40s?", "Robert Knight", "Chris, it's Rob. Yes, that's possible. Again, there are a lot of factors in there. But you're right. If fuel goes sideways, that's a plus. And as I pointed out, we would expect that, that 36% will be the low mark for the year. So a lot of moving parts there. But we certainly expect to improve upon that.", "James Young", "Yes, you will see improved margins second half.", "Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And just one quick housekeeping, what was the core price x the RCAF adjustment?", "Robert Knight", "The RCAF -- this is Rob. The RCAF fuel component in the 4.5 was roughly 1%.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Just real quick, Rob, can you quantify the actuarial gain in the quarter?", "Robert Knight", "Personal injury was about, well, little over $20 million, which, as I pointed out, was lower. Substantially lower than last year's second quarter actuarial number, which is, so again, the complete story on that, great safety performance is going to continue. We are real proud of what we've accomplished. But year-over-year, that expense line was up because last year's second quarter accrual adjustment was substantially higher.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Okay, that's helpful. Just at a higher level, fuel was lower today than it was last quarter, but the comments on margins are a bit more cautious. I'm just trying to understand that, is that really just the weather impact? Or is this cost inflation more than you originally thought? Is it maybe changes in your assumptions on volume or pricing? Just any color there would be helpful and just what's driving the more cautious commentary on margins.", "James Young", "Scott, are you talking about second half expectations or...", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Well, I guess, last quarter, the commentary was we'd see full year margin improvement, and now it's margin improvement x fuel.", "James Young", "So on the operating ratio?", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Yes.", "Robert Knight", "Yes, Scott, it really is just the math, I mean, if you look at the impact of fuel even if you're recovering most of it, and we're not at a point where we're recovering all of it in the marketplace by the way, but even if you are doing a substantially higher job of recovering the rising fuel price in the marketplace, just the math on your operating ratio is a headwind. And the first half of the year, that headwind was about 2 points. So to your points, even if fuel stays sideways, but still high, that will put a headwind on our overall operating ratio improvement.", "James Young", "I think that now, from where we were at last quarter, our expectations now is fuel is going to be higher than what we maybe had assumed a quarter ago. But it's anybody's guess with the volatility.", "Scott Group - Wolfe Research", "Okay, that's helpful. And just the last question is on Intermodal. I understand that the contract loss, but if I look at your volumes, they're flattish. Your western competitor's up 10. I'm guessing there's more than just a contract loss driving that spread. Any additional color you can give would be great on why you are seeing kind of flattish Intermodal volumes, particularly on the domestic side, given the strength we're seeing from J.B. Hunt and Hub.", "John Koraleski", "Yes, well again, Scott, as I explained, there's actually 2 components to that. The first is our push to get pricing back up to reinvestable levels in the second. And I think, what's probably a somewhat bigger factor, is our new mutual commitment program that we're asking all beneficial cargo owners to commit to volume levels during the off-peak season in order for us to offer them and protect them service and pricing levels in the peak season. And that's a change. That's a fairly significant change from anything they've seen from Union Pacific before. And for some of them, I think they were more comfortable taking an alternative that they were familiar with and waiting to see just how that played itself out.", "James Young", "Scott, we need to let this play a cycle, which is this year, to see how this will work for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy of Susquehanna Financial.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "I wanted to return to the topic of peak shipping season. It does look like you data [ph] coming across multiple modes. It's coming in a little bit light. We're hearing the same thing from everyone, everyone is crossing their fingers and hoping that there's a delay in dramatic peak. I'm just wondering, one, since it seems to be fairly broad based, could you provide any color? Are we talking about any pocket of retail or low-end [ph] technologies? Is it localized to a particular part of the economy? And secondly, what are your customers telling you about inventory levels? I mean, are they at where they need to be on the Intermodal side, of the Intermodal feeds such that we could go through back to school actually without that pickup?", "John Koraleski", "Matt, it's pretty hard. If you just look at the overall sales to the inventory ratios right now, they are as low as they've been. I mean they are at 30-year lows and have stayed there consistently. And so there is not a lot of in -- and our customers will tell us. They are not building inventories right at the moment. They are being cautious. They are kind of waiting to see what's going to unfold here with the economy. But certainly, when you look at the inventory levels that retailers are holding, and as I've said earlier, even compared to the fact that their sales were up a bit, there's not much room in the supply chain. If there is going to be a Christmas season, if there's going to a back-to-school kind of movement effort, they're going to have to increase shipments.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Okay. And second question, given that we're kind of on the doorstep here of the legacy pricing story practically actually playing out, I was wondering strategically from a negotiating perspective, have you been conditioning these customers to expect these dramatic price increases. Do they know they're coming? Just if you could provide some just perspective around how you're dealing with these customers and what their reaction has been given the fact that they face substantial price increases in the coming quarters and years?", "John Koraleski", "Matt, we have worked very hard with our customers to help them understand what's happening in the market, what's happened with our legacy pricing. There's no surprises in terms of these deals. Now what we try to reinforce though also, is the value proposition, which is one, great service; and two, substantial investment going forward. Many of our customers are -- listen, I haven't met a customer that's ever going to say thanks for the price increase. But I will tell you this. At the [ph] level, when you talk with them, we get through that and they want to immediately get into where you're putting capacity for my growth in the future because they see the value propositions. So there are no surprises there. There are tough negotiations. But we have to change some of these legacy deals or we won't hold the business, I mean, the spreads are so far off of anything that's reasonable on return, on invested capital, we would walk. And in some cases, we have.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "And just to follow-on, it may be difficult or you may not want to answer. But if you analyze that $2 billion in revenues that is so far disconnected from market, is there a percentage that is vulnerable to diversion, i.e. that might be able to move to Burlington or over-the-road carriage?", "John Koraleski", "There is a significant piece of it, that -- that has competitive options in terms of where it will go.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Garrett Chase with Barclays Capital.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "I know that you've gotten a lot of questions on the Intermodal shipment. Just wondering, if we take a step back maybe, could you explain a little bit about what you're trying to affect? I mean, it sounds like maybe you're trying to just get better utilization out of the assets and if that's the case, how might we expect to see that play out in terms of the financials? I mean, could we see maybe a bit less pricing gain than we might normally expect but because you're getting better utilization that is going to drive the same profitability? Or how should we think about how that will play out?", "James Young", "Jack?", "John Koraleski", "I think, Garett, when you stop and think about it, it really involves a lot of different components. One of which is, we absolutely need to get to build the business up to reinvestable levels. Number two, we want to continue to invest in the service products. I think the earlier question about, as we renegotiate these legacy deals, what's at risk. The whole thing is at risk if we don't provide outstanding service. And we have done a great job of ramping up service into the 5-year period, particularly in our Intermodal world. So that today, when customers look at the opportunities, when they look at our performance, when they look at the number of places we can take them on our network, and they see our commitment, both to the box program but also in facilities and all those, they know that we're serious about this, and that we will stand by those commitments. And some of them will test them, but I think overall, that's one of the things that is good for us. So I think getting it up to reinvestability is a key part of the pricing side of it. Great equipment utilization is all about our return on the investment that we're making on those boxes and the facilities and that's got to be part and parcel of it as well. So it's going to be multifaceted and it includes all of it.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "And just a tiny one for Lance. When do you think we'll start to see the number of employees in training start to decline, just the raw number?", "Lance Fritz", "The raw number of employees in training kind of is a little bit sine wave through a year, right? Right now, we have almost 1,000 in the training pipeline that probably attenuates a bit as you go through the second half. The thing that Rob had pointed out though, is in terms of comparison to prior year, the pipeline probably looks similar as we move forward because of attrition and volume expectations. Does that answer your question?", "James Young", "Okay, here let me add one more thing though. Keep in mind, last year at this time, we didn't have many people in training. So it will be around fourth quarter -- third to fourth quarter that you're going to start to see the year-over-year comps are much more balanced because our training program really started to pick up. It actually started, I mean, we weren't doing much training towards the latter part of the year.", "Garrett Chase - Barclays Capital", "So it sounds like we are more or less leveling off now. I mean, is that fair with just the normal variation?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, absolutely.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Peter Nesvold with Jefferies & Company.", "H. Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just a question for Rob. When I look at the operating expenses x fuel, operating expenses x fuel up 11.6% in the quarter. Year-over-year carloads up 3.1%. And even if I strip out the $14 million of flooding-related cost, you still get the cost up 11%. That was kind of like the first time we've seen a big divergence between the 2. And, I guess, number one, based on the comments that the incremental margins bottom here at 36%, how soon do you anticipate that the expense line item and the carload line item converge again? Number one. And number two, you talked about holding back on hiring if the volumes don't recover. Are there other levers that you can pull? And if you're able to quantify it, that's great.", "Robert Knight", "There's a lot there. In my comments, you may recall that when you make the flood and the fuel adjustment, our revenues were up 10.5%-ish and expenses were up 9.5%-ish, a slightly better performance on the expense side than on revenue side, still not where we would like to see it in the long term. Similar drivers in, when you strip away the flood and the fuel, below that, you have personal injury was a big delta, as we pointed out year-over-year. As we talk, we've been getting ahead in the entire first half, ahead of anticipated volumes in the back half on our hiring and training, we just talked about that in the pipeline of bringing on, ramping up cost, if you will. And just the size of that, that was roughly $30 million in the second quarter alone, and you may recall in the first quarter, it was about $35 million of non-productive assets as we ramp up for those volumes. So those are some of the big drivers that account for that increase in expense that we would not anticipate seeing going forward. So your second question is when do we see the margins start to improve and when do we start to leverage that? We'd expect to see that in the third quarter. Again, assuming the economy cooperates, we're well positioned, as we've discussed here today, to lever that volume, continue to be confident in our ability to get price going forward. So we would expect the improvement from here on the margins, and you'll -- we expect to see that.", "H. Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just to make sure I understand that because the year-over-year decline in carloads has accelerated in the first couple of weeks here of third quarter. A lot of it is flooding. I would anticipate and we will probably cycle through it. Maybe some of it is macro, I'm not quite sure. But you're comfortable that the margins improved sequentially 2Q to 3Q even despite the fact that carloads are actually getting worse at an accelerating rate to begin the quarter.", "John Koraleski", "Yes, but as we discussed here this morning, we do expect carloadings to pick up for all the reasons we've been discussing here.", "James Young", "Hey, Peter, now if they don't, as we said earlier here, with 4,000 attrition this year, we can scale back the cost numbers pretty quickly. We show that back in '08, '09 when we had a short falloff. I'm not betting on that, when you look at it. But I will tell you, we're going to keep a very close look at what has happened with our business volume. And we do have the flexibility to cut back pretty quick. And it's not only on the labor side. It could be your locomotive overhaul program that you look at. I don't think that is going to happen. But we're prepared if this thing goes the wrong way for us to do some things pretty substantial in the cost side.", "Operator", "Our next question this morning is coming from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.", "Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "It sounds like the risk to peak season is actually that it materializes, I mean, you're being cautious, the truckers are being cautious. It doesn't sound like they can grow even if they wanted to. The retailers are holding back. So, I guess, I want to make sure I understand exactly. If we do have a compressed peak, what kind of capacity do you have? And when do we need or when would those support loading -- when would those numbers start to come in to tell us that you're going to be able to handle the peak if it does come in?", "Robert Knight", "Anthony, the bottleneck will not be the Union Pacific railroad. Again, just think about what we've talked about here. We've got a substantial amount of costs that are built into the second quarter, in terms of resources training. We're getting 100 new locomotives in place. We've got additional containers still to be delivered. We are -- I hope you're right that this peak is greater than what we expect. We are a long way from having a capacity issue on this railroad right now.", "Operator", "Our last question is coming from the line of David [ph] of Bernstein [ph].", "Unknown Analyst - ", "It's actually Bernstein Research [ph]. A quick question on the restructuring and the Domestic Intermodal contract. Is that having an impact on the rate? Are you guys sort of moving some of the -- what you've may be price up in the peak season and trying to smooth that across the years, as well as kind of with the capacity commitments and things like that?", "John Koraleski", "Yes, I think when you look at the program, David, we're making a price commitment during the off peak, as well as the peak. So obviously, we aren't sending customers to give us off-peak volume but the rates are still going up.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. But I mean, is it sort of pulling forward some of that later-year rate? Or is that just a general rate increase?", "John Koraleski", "It does pull some of it forward into the off-peak period.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. And then the second question on the International Intermodal side, there's a little bit of a supply, demand inbalance. It seems to be forming in the container-shipping market. And I guess, I wanted to get your guys' perspective on the impact of that on legacy repricing. So if their rates are going to be constrained, how do you think that's going to impact your ability to price into some of the legacy business?", "James Young", "Well, David, what we have done is we've set where we believe the rates need to be to recover return on invested capital. And we look at it in somewhat of a replacement context. And if we can't get those kind of rates, again, I've said that earlier, we will walk from the business. We've put a lot of investment in long term. And again, you're right. When you look at what's happened capacity-wise in the water right now, it's not very good. But I can't let that drive our decision when we think long term and what's required for our business right now. Now what you might see is more volatility. Maybe the more it goes the little bit all water. But long term, I still think the value proposition is here. And I've got to get these returns here. It's pretty darn tough to justify the amount of capital we're putting in this business.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments.", "James Young", "Well, thanks for joining us this morning. I am confident when we talk in third quarter, you're going to see improved performance from what we've had at this quarter. Again, if something the economy cooperates a little bit. So again, we look forward to talking with you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me in Omaha today are Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President, Operations; and Rob Knight, our CFO. ", "The Union Pacific team delivered solid financial results across the board this quarter, achieving an all-time quarterly earnings record of $1.85 per share. That's a 19% increase compared to 2010. We also set best-ever quarterly marks in operating revenue, operating income, driving record year-to-date free cash flow. We're clearly delivering on the benefits of our diverse franchise. Volumes increased in 4 of our 6 business groups. The downside was weak International Intermodal and lower export grain.", "Overall, we're pleased with these results in light of the fragile economy and operational challenges related to the severe drought in Texas. Although we deal with weather every day, the extent and duration of the drought did impact network operations during the quarter. Lance will provide more details on this in a few minutes. Despite these challenges, we remain focused in delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that generates value for our customers and translates into improved financial return for our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jack.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. So let's lead out this morning with a look at customer satisfaction. We've set a new third quarter record coming in at 91. That's up 1 point from last year and reflects a continued strong value proposition, even as our operating team battled lingering Midwest flooding and the effects of the severe drought in the South during the quarter. ", "Our volume increased 1% with the International Intermodal peak season weighing heavily on our growth in the third quarter, but interestingly enough, if you excluded Intermodal, our other 5 businesses grew 6% during the quarter even with the softer export grain market. Our core price improved 4.5%, with each of the 6 groups posting gains. Those price gains, combined with increased fuel surcharge revenue and some positive mix from the decline in Intermodal and growth in Carload business, drove average revenue per car up 14%. The end result was a 16% improvement in freight revenue to a best-ever $4.8 billion. ", "So let me walk you through each of the 6 groups in a little more detail. Our Ag products revenue grew 9%, as a 12% improvement in average revenue per car, more than offset a 3% decline in volume. During third quarter last year, UP's grain exports hit their third highest volume ever. So against that tough comparison and with increased world production this year, exports were down 31%, driving the group's overall decline in carloading. A 7% increase in domestic feed grain shipments helped to offset at least some of the export softness, and we also saw a strength in Grain products, where shipments climbed 5%, with solid gains in ethanol, biodiesel and meals. ", "Despite shaky consumer confidence and a weak economic indicators, the U.S. vehicle sales were up 6% versus last year for the quarter, supporting a 10% increase in our Automotive shipments. The growth in volume, combined with a 12% improvement in average revenue per car, drove a 23% increase in revenue. ", "Our finished vehicle shipments increased 5% despite the lingering impact of the Japanese tsunami. But the good news going forward is that by the quarter's end, U.S. production had returned to normal for all manufacturers, setting the stage for a stronger fourth quarter. As production increased in anticipation of improving sales, our part shipments were up 18%.", "Our Chemicals volume grew 5%, which combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car to produce a 14% increase in revenue. ", "The Petroleum Products business led our Chemicals growth as shipments increased 35%. Most of that growth came from crude oil originating primarily in the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale regions, although we also saw a solid growth in asphalt shipments. Elsewhere, the solid performance that we've seen across the major Chemical segments continued in the third quarter. The one exception was fertilizer, where volumes slipped 5% because of reduced export demands. ", "Energy revenue grew 21%, as a 13% improvement in average revenue per car combined with volume growth of 7%. Weather, again, played a role as the impact of the Midwest flooding continued in July. However, almost all of that business was made up during the quarter, as was about 60% of the loads that we missed during the second quarter. New business to the Wisconsin utilities, along with the new coal-fired plant coming online near Waco, Texas produced most of the 5% increase in Southern Powder River Basin tonnage, although volume actually was up to most of our utilities year-over-year. ", "Colorado/Utah tonnage was up 9%, its first year-over-year quarterly growth since early 2008. Supporting that volume growth was relatively strong international market demand and also the return to production of one of the mines that had been relocating to new reserves. ", "Our Industrial Products volume grew 8%, which, combined with a 15% improvement in average revenue per car, drove a 24% increase in revenue. Metallic mineral shipments doubled as our iron ore unit train business for export to China continued to ramp up. Drilling demand in the energy market once again drove a 39% increase in nonmetallic minerals, primarily frac sands, and a 13% increase in steel. ", "Our Intermodal revenue grew 8%, as a 15% improvement in average revenue per unit, more than offset a 6% decline in volume. The volume decrease resulted from a 12% reduction in our International Intermodal shipments, primarily the result of weak West Coast imports, but also impacted by the contract loss that we talked about in the second quarter, which cost us about 12,000 units. ", "  ", "The news is a little brighter in our Domestic Intermodal business, where volume was up 2% and strengthening through the quarter. We set a new 7-day volume record of 29,500 units during the last week of September, topping the old record set last November by 8%.  ", "You'll recall in the second quarter, we talked to you about MCP, our Mutual Commitment Program, that was boosting margins but also was holding down our domestic volume. Well, in the third quarter, that commitment program was paying big benefits for our customers as we've had near-perfect delivery on our box availability commitments. ", "We're proving that we can keep our commitments, effectively providing MCP customers with needed capacity and reliable service, even as our domestic business tracks 6% to 7% ahead of last year's record volumes. ", "So as we look to the end of the year, I have to admit that I've been disappointed by the weakness on our International Intermodal peak season, but the good news is that the diversity of our franchise should continue to provide opportunities to more than offset the challenges that we face in the fourth quarter. First of all, in terms of challenges, the better world crop production and plentiful storage available for a smaller-than-expected U.S. corn crop shows that whole grain export shipments are still going to be soft in contrast to last year's record volume. We're also not expecting International Intermodal to get any stronger. ", "But here's where we do expect to see the offset. September auto sales were at their highest seasonally adjusted levels since April, supporting the expectation that pent-up demand will sustain our Auto's momentum despite the economic headwinds. The new Wisconsin Utility business, the new plant in Texas should keep our coal volumes strong, together with improved Colorado/Utah production and the lower SPRB inventories, which right now still trail what would be considered normal stockpiles by about 7 days. ", "Energy-related drilling should continue to drive growth in nonmetallic minerals and steel in our Industrial Products group. And steel should also benefit from the continued recovery in the auto industry, and our export iron ore should also be a growth driver for Industrial Products. ", "Petroleum products should again lead the way, and fertilizer will rebound with seasonal demand, so we expect our Chemicals business to stay strong. And the recent strength in Domestic Intermodal should continue as well because retailers will be pulling inventory from West Coast distribution centers ahead of the holidays. ", "And I know many of you are already thinking beyond the fourth quarter, and we are, too. Barring any sort of unusual or unexpected event like a Japanese tsunami or a total U.S. or global economic meltdown, we're thinking that the slow growth trajectory that we're seeing today continues on for the foreseeable future. And as we look at that, that spells real opportunity for Union Pacific. ", "Energy demand should remain strong and be a solid growth driver in terms of frac sand, pipe, petroleum, ethanol and biodiesel. Strong world demand for metallic minerals and other U.S. natural resources, like soda ash, support a strong growth outlook in those fast-growing markets for us. Our Ag business will continue to pace with population growth, which provides a solid base load and also allows us to take advantage of global export opportunities should they develop it. ", "So with that foundation and a recovering auto industry, we're delivering record results in the year, where products like lumber, cement, rock and appliances are tracking anywhere from 30% to 60% below previous record volumes. So as we think about the future, even the smallest improvement in consumer confidence and consumer spending really offers Union Pacific additional upside opportunity. So overall, our strong value proposition, underpinned by excellent service, positions us to take advantage of the opportunities offered by our diverse franchise. The resulting volume growth, combined with expected pricing gains, should continue to drive record revenue, not only in the fourth quarter but for the foreseeable future as well. So with, that I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thanks, Jack, and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance. In employee safety, we achieved a record third quarter reportable personal injury rate and best-ever year-to-date results. The continued maturation of our Total Safety Culture, our risk identification and mitigation and training and education efforts drove the improvement. Our safety culture is especially important as we hired  to cover attrition and volume. ", "In terms of rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date FRA reportable rate increased 7%, driven largely by low-cost yard and industry-lead incidents. In the third quarter, human factor and truck-related incidents increased compared to the prior year. We continue to accelerate investments in our yards and our terminals to get our exposure back on the right trend line. Most encouraging, despite increases in rail and highway traffic during the year, our crossing accident rate improved 6% year-to-date versus 2010. We continue to help communities address risky driver behavior and to close grade crossings. In fact, since 2001, we've closed over 4,000 at-grade crossings on the UP system in addition to educating the public about grade crossing safety. We remain committed to improving our safety performance on the way to operating an incident-free network. ", "Before getting into our service performance, I want to spend a minute on how we have managed the weather challenges you've heard us talk about. Operations improved substantially during the third quarter in the flood-impacted areas, and we are getting closer to normal business operations in that region. Our team worked tirelessly and successfully to protect our service product through the floods. The South was a completely different challenge this quarter. Extreme drought in Central Texas created unstable soil conditions and, when combined with record heat, generated a sharp increase in slow orders. These speed restrictions reduced capacity and velocity, requiring additional resources like crews and locomotives. At the same time, our volume in the area grew by about 10%, putting even more pressure on the strained network. We reacted by applying surge resources and increasing track maintenance in Texas. Slow orders turned the corner in September and improved another 17% so far in October. I anticipate continued improvement during the fourth quarter as we return to normal operations in Texas. ", "Network performance for the third quarter remained relatively strong despite these challenges, demonstrating our resiliency and recoverability. As carloads grew almost 5% from July to September, our network performance remains solid. However, we did see about a 1 mile per hour impact on our quarterly velocity due to weather-related challenges. We gained momentum in September and continue to see improvement in October. By applying the principles of the unified plan and utilizing our surge resources, we sustained the network's service reliability and demonstrated its resiliency. As Jack discussed, we continue to provide solid customer service at the local level. Our industry spot-and-pull measure was 94% for the quarter, which nears the all-time record -- quarterly record of 95% set in the second quarter of this year. This is the first move and last move for our customer, and it's critical to overall customer satisfaction. This performance reflects our continued focus on the fundamentals: improving network performance, service reliability and operational efficiency.", "Slide 17 illustrates some of those efficiencies. Gross ton miles per employee were essentially flat with 2010 despite the addition of over 1,000 new hires in the training pipeline and an increase in employees working on capital projects and positive train control. Surge resources added to combat the impact of slow orders and speed restrictions that I discussed earlier also masked productivity gains during the quarter. Those productivity gains included our work to improve train sizes. Train lengths for our manifest and intermodal traffic continued to increase. The growth in intermodal train size this quarter is particularly noteworthy, considering intermodal volumes were down 6% in the quarter compared to 2010. And we continue to balance manpower with demand, with an average of nearly 500 employees per load during the third quarter. If you look at current levels, we have roughly 700 or more employees on furlough status.", "The endgame is to realize the full potential of the UP franchise translated into these deliverables. World-class safety results on the way to an incident-free network, growing the value proposition for our customers by recovering to record levels of service, continuing to generate network productivity for bottom line results and positioning for growth resulting from our solid service performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start by summarizing our third quarter results. Operating revenue grew 16% to a record $5.1 billion on the strength of fuel surcharge recoveries, core pricing gains and volume growth. Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, increasing 17% or $516 million compared to the third quarter of 2010. Higher fuel prices accounted for over half of the cost increase. ", "Operating income totaled $1.6 billion, a 13% increase and an all-time record quarter. Other income totaled $17 million in the third quarter, $8 million lower compared to last year. Quarterly  interest expense declined 7% versus the third quarter of 2010 to $142 million, driven by lower average debt levels. ", "Third quarter income tax expense increased to $549 million. Higher pretax earnings drove this increase. Net income totaled $904 million, increasing 16% compared to 2010. The outstanding share balance declined 2% versus last year, reflecting our share repurchase activity. These results drove an all-time quarterly earnings record of $1.85 per share, increasing 19% versus last year.", "Turning to our top line, we achieved 16% freight revenue growth to an all-time record of $4.8 billion. Slide 21 provides a walk across of the third quarter growth drivers. Carloadings were up 1%. We also saw a positive mix impact driven by strong growth in higher average revenue per car moves. We achieved core pricing gains of 4.5% in the third quarter, which includes RCAF fuel escalators. As you know, we calculate pricing gains as a percent of our total book of business, and with the bulk of our 2011 legacy portfolio coming up for renewal in the fourth quarter, it is not a major driver of our 2011 core pricing gains. Fuel surcharge revenue added 7 points to the top line, driven by higher fuel prices in the third quarter versus 2010 and a slight tailwind on the surcharge recovery lag. In addition to solid core pricing gains, we saw improvements in our incremental margins this quarter. Of course, there are many moving parts impacting this number, including revenues and costs associated with weather-related challenges. So adjusting only for higher fuel prices, our incremental margin was 41% in the third quarter. ", "As we said in July, our second quarter adjusted incremental margin of 36% would be the low mark for the year. This still holds true even with the lower volume growth that we've seen in the back half of the year thus far. ", "Now let's turn to expenses. Slide 23 summarizes our year-over-year increase in operating expense by category. As I mentioned, higher fuel prices contributed to over half of the $516 million increase in expense. Other year-over-year increases include inflationary costs and volume-related expenses. We also saw additional labor increases driven by higher TE&Y training costs and drought-related expenses, as Lance just described. ", "With that, let's spend a minute and walk through each of these categories. Third quarter fuel expense totaled $916 million, increasing $308 million compared to 2010. The average diesel fuel price, which increased 42% year-over-year, was the biggest driver of the quarterly change. The average barrel price of $90 rose 18% compared to last year. In addition, conversion spreads, which cover the costs to convert crude oil to diesel fuel, tripled from 2010 levels to an average of $37 per barrel in the third quarter. Although our improving fuel surcharge mechanisms enable us to recover the majority of higher fuel prices, the resulting increase in expense and revenue created a negative impact of 1.7 points on our third quarter operating ratio versus 2010. Fuel expense was also higher as a result of a 5% increase in gross ton miles and a 1% increase in our fuel consumption rate.", "Slide 25 summarizes third quarter expenses for compensation and benefits. Comp and benefits expense is up 9% compared to 2010. Over half of the increase in expense can be attributed to inflationary pressures that we have discussed with you before, including health and welfare, unemployment taxes, wage increases and pension costs. Looking forward, our initial planning for 2012 would indicate that labor inflation should moderate somewhat from 2011 levels. ", "Training costs were up $17 million in the quarter as we continue to hire new employees to cover expected attrition and volume growth, and additional crews needed to manage through the slow orders and speed restrictions in the South drove expenses up $18 million in the quarter. Lastly, the unusually large mix shift and growth in manifest traffic this quarter drove a higher volume impact on labor expenses. Carload growth of 1% and a gross ton mile increase of 5% resulted in a volume growth impact on expense of 2% to 2.5%. Productivity gains of about 1.5% mostly offset this increase. ", "Slide 26 takes a closer look at the change in our workforce levels. Workforce levels increased 5% in the third quarter compared to last year. We again had more employees in the training pipeline and more individuals working on capital projects, including positive train control. Base workforce levels also increased, driven by volume growth and the impact of additional crews needed to manage through the drought-related speed restrictions in the South. In July, we indicated that our full year workforce would be up roughly 1,500 employees depending on second half volume levels. Currently, we still are on track with those projections.", "Now turning to other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 9% or $41 million to $506 million. Higher contract service expense was the biggest year-over-year driver. ", "Locomotive and freight car maintenance costs were also up compared to 2010. In addition, crew lodging and transportation costs increased with the growth in volume levels and weather-related challenges. Other expenses came in at $207 million, slightly better than our guidance of $215 million to $225 million primarily due to lower personal injury expense. Versus 2010, other expenses were up $29 million. Higher property taxes and increased costs for damage equipment and freight drove expenses up in the quarter versus 2010. ", "Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect the other expense category to be similar to the third quarter results, again, assuming no unusual items.", "Slide 28 summarizes third quarter expenses for the remaining 2 categories. Depreciation expense increased 10% or $36 million to $408 million, which is in line with our previous guidance. Increased capital spending and higher depreciation associated with hauling more gross ton miles drove the increase. We should expect a similar rate of increase in the fourth quarter as well. Third quarter equipment and other rents expense totaled $293 million, essentially flat with last year. Higher container lease and short-term freight car rental expenses were offset by lower locomotive lease expense. Bringing revenue and expenses together, Union Pacific's operating ratio illustrates the substantial improvements in profitability that we've achieved over the last several years. On a reported basis, our operating ratio was 69.1% for the third quarter of 2011. Ongoing productivity efforts, core pricing gains and volume growth all contributed to this mark.", "Higher fuel prices continue to put pressure on our operating ratio, creating a 1.7 point headwind in the third quarter and 2 points of headwind year-to-date compared to 2010. However, if you adjust for fuel prices, we still expect to see real improvement this year in our core operating ratio performance versus last year's all-time record. Union Pacific's profitability in the third quarter of 2011 also drove record free cash flow after dividends. Growth in cash from operations more than offset increased capital spending and higher dividend payments. Cash dividends paid in the year-to-date period of 2011 were up 39% from 2010 levels. We continue to see the benefits of bonus depreciation, which had a more positive impact on our cash flows in 2011 than in 2010. ", "Union Pacific's balance sheet remains at excellent shape, supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At the end of the third quarter, the adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 41.4%. This positions us well in a wide range of economic scenarios. Our performance is generating strong cash flow, and we are returning that to our shareholders. ", "During the third quarter, we bought back 4.7 million shares totaling $428 million, up from the second quarter purchases. Year-to-date, this takes our total repurchases to over $1 billion. Looking forward, we have nearly 32 million shares remaining under our current authorization. When you combine our dividend payments and share repurchases this year, we've returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders. Dividend growth and opportunistic share repurchases continue to be key components of our balanced approach to cash allocation for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. ", "Looking ahead, we see continued opportunities to grow and improve our profitability. As Jack discussed, we're focused on continued year-over-year volume growth in the fourth quarter. Of course, this assumes that the economy cooperates. We remain committed to achieving real pricing gains, driven by the increased value of our service, market demand and added benefit of competing for and repricing our legacy business. We believe that continued revenue growth and our ongoing productivity efforts should produce record earnings in 2011, allowing us to reward our shareholders with even greater returns. So with that, let me turn it back over to Jim.", "James R. Young", "Thanks, Rob. Now before we open up to questions, I wanted to provide a quick update on the national labor negotiations. As you know, the United Transportation Union, which is the industry's largest union, ratified a new contract earlier this year. We think the agreement is fair and equitable to both parties. The remaining unions were released from mediation, which led to the creation of the Presidential Emergency Board. The PEB is scheduled to submit their recommendations by November 7. In the meantime, the industry remains committed to achieving a negotiated settlement that reflects the patterns of the UTU agreement.", "Our employees are critical to the success of this company. We currently enjoy good working relationships, and we expect that to continue as we move forward through the negotiation process there. So with that, let's open it up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Our first question is from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jim, so if we're looking at this, if it weren't for fuel and the weather stuff, you had an OR below 68, and I realize the third quarter is typically your best. But I've got to think that this kind of performance gives you a much greater conviction in your ability to hit the long-term goals regardless of kind of how the macro plays out. Is that sort of fair?", "James R. Young", "I think that's very fair.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So we've got a big legacy reprice next year. How does Union Pacific sort of think about updating that long-term guidance then? Do you have to get there, and then you'll address it, or? We can sort of see these trends. It's a big year next year?", "James R. Young", "Well, Bill, yes, to me, the real wild card is where do we think the economy is going. If you get some upside in the economy, obviously, we have a greater potential going forward here. We'll stick with our current guidance, we said 65 to 67 OR, and see how things go. But we're feeling pretty good about the markets, the pricing we're able to get for the value we're providing and then efficiency.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, no it makes sense. And then just on pricing, fourth quarter pricing, we've been flat all year. Given that the legacy is way at the end of the quarter, is that safe to say, for 4.5%, that there shouldn't be a big step-up, or we will actually see the legacy in the fourth quarter?", "James R. Young", "Not in fourth quarter. You'll see the impact of legacies next year.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So the acceleration comes next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Coal volumes were unusually strong in the context of the other Class 1s for the quarter, particularly Burlington. I'm just curious if there's any thoughts on the out-performance, whether just kind of where the relative flooding was geographically and you just kind of got the long straw? Or was there some kind of market share gains or anything else that sort of impacted the flows during the quarter?", "James R. Young", "Peter, the prime difference there was flooding. Clearly, BN got hit much harder than we did. Look at their announcement they had in their capital. That gives you an indication what kind of hit they had. There wasn't much in terms of share shift at all.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then a follow-up, with the reprice coming up at the end of fourth quarter, any perspective on how volume-dependent the potential for yields are as you negotiate that -- or as that new contract goes into effect?", "James R. Young", "Well, again, the legacy deals that we have negotiated and are currently still negotiating will carryover, and really, you'll see the impact in 2012. I mean, the big spreads in some of these, obviously, are you look at what happened here with our falloff in Intermodal versus the other groups this year, but we've got very good opportunity next year.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "But you don't feel disadvantaged at all going into that process, the fact that volumes are much -- I mean, the volume growth has really slowed here in the last 3 years or so?", "James R. Young", "No. These are long-term propositions when you look at them. You're making deals that are many years out, so the assessment is one on what is the value proposition that the UP franchise can offer.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse Group.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones. First, on the wage and benefit front, can you give us a feel for what kind of inflation you're looking at over the term of the next contract?", "James R. Young", "Rob, go ahead.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. We're not going to get into the specifics on the contract, Chris, but one thing, just to comment on the overall inflation on the comp and benefits line, we said it's about 5.5% this year. We expect that to moderate as we head into 2012, somewhere more in the, call it, 4%-ish range rather than 5.5%.", "James R. Young", "Chris, I mean, the UTU deal, if you look at it, it's 17% over 5.5 years. So you can kind of get a feel there in terms of the math. The real key is healthcare costs, which is -- if you look at our contract, what was put on the table of contents, there's very little in there in terms of work rules, where we see the biggest opportunity long-term is, again, as most businesses in America is struggling with, is rising healthcare costs.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one your Automotive business. Can you give us an idea of how much of your Auto franchise is with the Japanese OEMs?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "We have about 30% with the domestic Big 3 and -- so about 70% with GM, Ford, Chrysler and then about 30% with everybody else.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.", "Michael Weinz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Michael Weinz in for Tom. I guess to start with on coal, could you give us the actual stockpile levels? You said that it was down 7 days year-over-year and that you guys had made up 60% of what you had lost in the second quarter. And is that expected to -- is the remainder expected to be made up in fourth?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "We'll probably make up the rest of that in the fourth quarter, I would expect. And the other thing, Mike, I don't have the exact numbers in terms of 59 days versus 52 days, those kinds of deals, but there is a 7-day differential. I would expect, as you look at those numbers -- that is the Powder River Basin stockpile situation. I would expect those tend to probably be more reflective of what's happening with the BN customers given that they were more severely impacted. But we should still see fairly solid coal volumes here in the fourth quarter.", "Michael Weinz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And for the second question, related to headcount, you had said that you're still expecting the 1,500 increase year-over-year. Is that an end-of-quarter fourth quarter number or an average fourth quarter number?", "James R. Young", "End of quarter.", "Robert M. Knight", "End-of-quarter but fourth quarter projection.", "Michael Weinz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So that kind of implies a slight decline from third quarter. Is that related to Texas?", "Robert M. Knight", "It is a slight decline, but it's just based on our projection of where volumes -- basically, it's what volumes have done here at the back half of the year.", "James R. Young", "Typically, we reduce headcount late in the fourth quarter for seasonal purposes.", "John J. Koraleski", "Some of your capital projects.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Rob, you mentioned the incremental margins and the ability to kind of get a little bit of an acceleration potentially. Do you need to see the legacy contract start to roll through, or is this the type of progress that you might be able to make in 4Q, assuming that you don't necessarily get hit with another type of weather interruption?", "Robert M. Knight", "It's kind of all of the above, but again, reminder for the fourth quarter alone, we don't expect to get much additional uptick yield from the legacy. That's mostly going to carry over into 2012. So as we look in the fourth quarter, it's going to be volume, productivity, ongoing pricing initiatives that are under way. And just, again, a reminder, for us to hit our long-term guidance of that 65 to 67 full year operating ratio by 2015, that implies, on an annualized basis, as we look forward, that we'll be in that incremental margin neighborhood of about 50%. And that's taking into consideration the legacy repricing as we look forward.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Sure. Now that's helpful. When we think about furloughs, you take a look at the average number than what you ended the quarter with. Obviously, it picked up a little bit while volumes were starting to accelerate. How do you think about that number for the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense of what's driving the furloughs. Is it just timing issues, or is there something else behind it?", "James R. Young", "Lance, you're on.", "Lance M. Fritz", "When you think about the fourth quarter in furloughs, what's going to happen is as peak season starts bleeding off, typically, on the TE&Y side, our furloughs will increase. And likewise, as we start getting frozen out of some parts of the network from a maintenance away and capital project perspective, we start furloughing also on the maintenance-away side.", "James R. Young", "And, Chris, the big driver here, I mean, the surprise to us was one on International Intermodal. And if you look across our regions, North, South and West, the biggest brunt to the furloughs was out West, simply because there was very -- really no decrease in International business this year.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, no, that's helpful. One final quick one. Just, Jim, from a process perspective, we get the PEB recommendations in the beginning in November. What's the process after that, and what do you think about the timeline going forward after recommendations come in?", "James R. Young", "Well, you've got really another 30-day cooling off. I mean, the key date is around December 7 in terms of when the potential would be there for some actionable parties. So as I said, November 7 is the date that the PEB recommendations come out, and both parties have to take a look at those recommendation and negotiate from there.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Lance, that was a great overview on the handling of the drought and kind of goes back to the middle of the 2000s when you kind of sat there going through El Paso and Phoenix, when you had problems, but it's great to see how smooth things bounce back now. But when you think about the equipment status, you kind of give the employee furloughs, can you talk about the equipment side? What have you done on the locomotives part there? What do you need to do in terms of CapEx? It sounded like you added a bunch of locomotives. What do you need to do now to get that back reset to ongoing operations?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. So on the locomotive side is the South continues to come back to normal. You'll see us being able to bleed off some of that locomotive count, put those back in storage. We're at about 600 units right now, and as the South gets normal and as volumes from the peak season start dropping off, you'll see that storage number grow. Now the reason why we're buying locomotives next year isn't just a volume story. We've got locomotives in the capital budget next year for a number of reasons. We get a pretty decent return off of them, driven by fuel efficiency, the fact that they're DPU-enabled, and that helps us on the train size productivity side of the story. And then I think we've talked to you before about Tier 4 requirements, another federal mandate that takes effect in 2015. And purchasing locomotives now is a little bit of a hedge against the fact that the manufacturers of locomotives do not have yet purchasable locomotive that meets those 2015 guidelines. So there's a little bit of a risk hedge in that purchase as well.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And also can you talk about how the progress, I guess maybe Rob, also, on the progress of the UMAX domestic network? What have you done in terms of containers, and how has that progressed with CSX since you rolled that out?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "We're having great success with UMAX. We're feeling good about it. Like I said, our Domestic Intermodal volumes right now -- last year, we actually hit a record in terms of Domestic Intermodal during kind of the second phase of peak season. So if you think about peak season in terms of international phase goes first and then domestic, so now we're in the domestic side, we're 6% to 7% stronger than we were a year ago. And it looks like that's going to probably continue on, at least for the next several weeks. So we've made some great product offerings with the CSX. We've been running really well in terms of our on-time delivery despite things like the floods and some of those kinds of things. So we're well positioned.", "James R. Young", "Yes, we've got good programs with both, NS and CSX. There are no domestic container stored today in the UP side. I think the other thing you want to keep in mind on demand here, the sales-inventory ratios are still very, very tight. And as you see in the domestic trucking sector, capacity grew tight. So it'll be interesting to see how the rest of this year plays out given tight inventories.", "John J. Koraleski", "And we're pretty balanced in terms of the number of containers that we have in both programs. So it's a nice opportunity for us.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So, Jack, how should we read that, though? If you said that domestic, obviously, nothing in storage and that we've moved into the second part of peak and you're seeing that used, but yet the International remains so weak because of the short and brief peak season. Is that just still all truck conversion that's still going on out West, or how do you read the differential?", "John J. Koraleski", "That's a really good question because when you look at what's happening in inventory levels -- if you look at inventory-to-sales ratios, you're not really seeing any improvement there, still historically low. So you're seeing a lot of product that's moving distribution centers to stores, a lot of what I would describe as more like spot purchases of retails, and we are seeing a lot of truck conversion in that process. So that's been a very strong growth arm for us in terms of that highway conversion.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.", "Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to see if I could ask a couple of Jack on the expert side. First, I saw recently that Russia was, and not a formal ban like last time, but limiting some of the exports. I wondered if what your thoughts were on that if it was factored into your thought process about volume declines, continued volume declines in the grain export business in the fourth quarter.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, Gary. We are looking -- last year, we had a record fourth quarter. We had all kinds of good things happening. We had the Russian drought. We had the Ukraine banning the export of their grain and other problems around the world. The whole situation has turned around differently for us now. So Russia is very strong in terms of their production capability. We have tough comps. So we're actually expecting that we're going to see somewhere in the neighborhood of like a 5% to 6% decline in our export grain movements in the fourth quarter.", "Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then I wondered, too, if the iron ore exports that you were referring to were higher-rated business than what you might see in the rest of the industrial book, because pricing there looked solid. And there are some who are wondering if maybe some of the exports to China of iron ore will cool off a little bit looking forward.", "John J. Koraleski", "Our book of business for export iron ore is priced well. We're very comfortable with our profitability and the re-investability of that business, but that's also true of our other business in our Industrial Products world.", "Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You've got some pretty good visibility on those exports for the fourth quarter?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes. We think it's going to continue to be strong. Or we're going to continue to move. It's always kind of one of those deals where you have to watch China very carefully because they consume, I think, about half of the world trade in iron ore today. So should they decide to change course here relatively quickly, we've seen how that can happen, but right now, we're looking for a solid fourth quarter.", "James R. Young", "Gary, the other thing you have to keep in mind, while we've got some of our international markets still pretty hot right now, as Jack mentioned, you have -- within the Industrial Products group, on the domestic side, we have markets there that are still 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% lower than they were in the peak. Anything related to construction is 40%, 50% below. So while we've got some markets that are hot, that could cool off a little bit. You've got others that are barely alive, I guess, is maybe the best description, so...", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "So with the upcoming legacy opportunities, I'm wondering how much of that business is already locked in with new contracts. I guess I'm trying to understand if there's a rough percent of the business you feel confident that you're going to keep.", "James R. Young", "Jack, you want to take that one?", "John J. Koraleski", "We're making good progress on all of our legacy negotiations as it stands right now. And we're very comfortable that we're working hard to retain all of that business.", "James R. Young", "Scott, we have lost some of our business. If you look at repricing these legacy deals. I mean, we're competing with the other guys, and in some cases, we've lost some of the business. And the key is we're setting some minimum returns that we look at, and if we can't get it, I'm willing to walk.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "So in the cases in the past where you've lost a legacy deal, obviously, there's a volume and a revenue hit. But does there tend to be much of an operating income loss from losing a legacy deal?", "James R. Young", "Well, in short term, anytime you take out a pretty good chunk of revenue, we can't get cost out fast enough, so you do take some pressure in your operating income. On the other hand, though, we can redeploy some assets. If you think about locomotives, some of the -- our track capacity is pretty generic when you look at the way products move. We also were able to take advantage -- we have a continuing attrition on the workforce side. We're going to lose about 4,000 employees a year for the foreseeable future, so you can fairly quickly adjust your workforce. But I've got to tell you, the first quarter you lose that revenue, it usually has a negative impact on the bottom line.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Right. I guess I was just thinking that these are probably lower-margin, if any margin, business.", "James R. Young", "Well, they're clearly -- and some of these, we're losing money in every carload we handle from a long-term variable cost perspective. So I mean, that's why this sense of urgency and why it's so important that we've got to get this margins up in this business. So you're right in that context. Longer-term, it isn't quite a big of a hit, but it's still a little bit of hit.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Great, that's helpful. And just second question, as you prepare for a continued slow growth, if that's what happens, what should that mean for headcount next year? I'm wondering when you expect the headcount growth and the volume growth to come more in line. Is that an early 2012 event or not until late 2012?", "James R. Young", "Well, long term, what we would expect to see is -- again, let's assume you've got positive growth year-over-year. You will see headcount increase, but not at the same rates. We got ourselves caught a little bit this year that we have a lot of people in hiring. The International Intermodal was much -- came in negative. So we got caught a little bit with surplus resources, but again, long term you won't see the same kind of growth in volume in headcount.", "John J. Koraleski", "And Jim, I mean, the other thing that's going to normalize is the delta, just the pure delta in the training pipeline, which we've talked about several quarters, and the pure delta in the capital headcount there.", "James R. Young", "Now keep in mind, we're also hiring for PTC right now. That doesn't have anything to do with volume. So you've got to separate out a little bit, and at the end of the day, we've got to recover that cost in the business. There's no excuses. But where you look at kind of the pure volume-related numbers, we should continue to see productivity every year.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "When do you think we normalize?", "James R. Young", "I think you're going to see that probably fourth quarter or first quarter next year. It'll be better comps on our labor and our force levels.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Larkin of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "There's been a lot of talk about natural gas substitution at power plants in the East and also the impact of the new EPA regulations that are going into effect next year. Is there any risk to your Coal business next year or the year after from these 2 sources?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, John, there's always some risk to that because of the grid and how it plays. Most of our utilities, our utilities are fairly modern productive, so in the overall distribution of things, we don't have that many that we see as potentially shutting down. But anytime that any new utility is being constructed or things like that certainly with natural gas hanging in there in the $3 to $4 range, it's a pretty attractive alternative to building a coal plant. And I think we're going to be okay next year in our Coal business.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then just on the NIT League's proposed reciprocal switching idea that is now sitting before the STB, do you think that gets any traction at all even as a test case?", "James R. Young", "Well, we'll have to see. I mean, we have we're obviously made our comments in terms of -- I mean, it's access. You can call it whatever you want to, and I think we've been consistent in our message that anytime you introduce some kind of artificial competition, which it is, there could be a consequence in our growth in capital. So we'll see what happens in terms of ultimately what comes out of STB.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I was curious, just an update given the backtrack in volume growth that we've seen here, where do you feel you are right now with the network capacity? Given the operating leverage you guys were able to generate in the quarter even with low volumes, I'm curious what a nice uptick in volumes would look like and how you'd be able to handle that.", "James R. Young", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. We feel very good about the amount of capacity we've gotten in fixed infrastructure. Once again, our peak carloading month was north of 200,000 7-day carloads. Now as we've continued to invest in the right areas in the network, we've substantially improved the service product that we have in comparison to what we delivered during that 200,000-plus month. But as we look forward with a capital program that we've got in place or planned for and the way that the network is operating, we feel very good about the amount of capacity that we've got in fixed assets right now.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Are we talking 10 to 15, 15 to 20 in terms of being able to handle additional room?", "Lance M. Fritz", "John -- or Justin, I'm sorry. It's very dependent on where that growth occurs and how quickly it comes on, but in terms of any reasonable estimate of what we think is going to be happening as we look forward, we are very well situated to be able to continue to provide excellent service and handle the growth.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And just a follow-up question, I was curious, you called out on the Chemicals side the great growth that you guys are seeing off a small base in terms of crude opportunity in the Bakken and Eagle shales. Can you give us a sense of what kind of indications you're getting? I'm assuming unit train business is pretty profitable stuff. Where is the growth there for that business, and how long of a ramp do we have in front of us for that?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "Overall, Justin, I think the growth potential for the business is excellent. I mean, the primary play we're seeing right now is Bakken, but Eagle Ford is just starting to come in on our railroad. And so we're right and positioned well where from a profitability point of view. Rail actually provides some great flexibility for those customers that basically doesn't tie them into a single destination on a pipeline. So even as pipelines get built and developed, we continue to think that for the foreseeable future, rail is going to have a play in this marketplace, and it's going to be a solid growth opportunity for Union Pacific.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "How does the profitability of that business compare to coal unit trains?", "John J. Koraleski", "It depends on contract to contract, but it's solid, profitable. It meets our re-investable criteria, and we're very happy with it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Newcrest.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Newcrest Capital Inc., Research Division", "As we sit here, we're sort of in uncertain economic outlook, I wonder if you could just talk about the cost levers that you could pull in the event that volumes came in slower than expected. And just comment in the extent to which it's more difficult to adjust to a small volume decline versus the kind of big declines we saw during the financial crisis.", "James R. Young", "Well, if you look back at the -- I think a good model to look at what happened when we had in 2008, early 2009 when we had a falloff in the business, and that was pretty substantial. If you recall, I think second quarter of '09, we're down almost 20%, 25% in volume. We have the opportunity, as I've said earlier, that we're losing about 4,000 employees a year through attrition. What happens -- and even in a small falloff in volume, we'll try to take advantage of, where we can, that attrition. If that means we slow down hiring, which is what we have done here on the western part of our region, we can try to respond as quickly as possible. When it gets into locomotives and capacity, things like that, obviously, in the short term, you're not going to be able to do much other than put some in storage. But again, a short-term blip, either down or up, you're not going to get as much response. The question is if you see this thing turning down here and you start looking 2, 3, 4 or 5 quarters, you'll see us being able to take more advantage of taking costs out.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Newcrest Capital Inc., Research Division", "And what indicators are you guys relying on to assess the business at this stage?", "James R. Young", "Well, we start with our customers' perspectives. We're very close to our customers, trying to understand where they're making investments, where they're putting capacity, and there's long lead times in that. And so far, it's still very strong when we look in several of these groups here. At the end of the day, though, we look every morning at what were loadings yesterday and it's pretty intense running the business daily. And if we see things turn off sharply, we will respond. You try to be as proactive as you can, but nobody has perfect vision to the future here.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Vernon of Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Could we maybe talk a little bit about the Domestic Intermodal yield management efforts, kind of what kind of business is actually leaving the network and how that pricing discussion is going and what kind of a runway you look at on that Intermodal repricing?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "Any business that you see right now leaving the network is being replaced on a fairly strong basis bases by truck conversions. So for instance, if you think about our little streamline subsidiary did 80,000 moves last year, it's growing 20%. 84% of that business in the third quarter is coming off the highway. So highway conversion is more than making up for anything that we lose for us in terms of our yield diversions. And we're particularly seeing that now in the third quarter. Originally, in the early part of the year, we were having a little bit of a startup issue with our MCP program just because it was something new and different, and the idea of making a commitment was something that some customers weren't all that excited about. But I think what they're seeing right now is we're doing such a great job of that. And they're already starting to talk about signing up for next year and giving us some strong indications with our service performance and the way we are meeting our commitments. It'll be a solid path forward for us, so we're actually feeling quite good about that.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So does that mean that the full 6% year-over-year decline was International import/export then?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, actually...", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Was it actually a little worse then, there was a domestic offset then?", "John J. Koraleski", "When you see our third quarter results -- so if you looked into our third quarter results, our International business was down 12%. Our Domestic business was up 2%, but that 2% is a weak start to the quarter that built to a relatively strong end to the quarter. So the 2% isn't really -- like I said, right now, we're running 6%, 7%, 8% better than a year ago.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So my first question here is just for Lance, perhaps. On your train sizes trending very nicely here, ticking up each year, can you talk to us a bit about what you see average train lengths being ultimately once you reequip your fleet with your current targets, both on manifest, I guess, and to put into context intermodal train lengths as well? And touch a little bit on DP and what percentage your fleet is currently equipped DP compared to where you want to -- where your current targets are for percentage of your fleet equipped with the distributed power.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Okay. First, on train sizes. The short answer is we've got plenty of opportunity to keep growing. I think that Intermodal number this quarter was something like 170-plus. Depending on the intermodal lane, that can easily reach 200, 250, and we've probably got some lanes where it could go north of 250. So we've got plenty of upside there. On the manifest side of the world, we've got upside from the high 80s number that we are recording right now. And when it comes to DPU strategy, every incremental road unit that we're purchasing at this point forward is DPU-equipped, and all of our current DPU locomotives are fully utilized. I want to say somewhere in the 60% ballpark of our traffic right now is DPU-ed, and that's just going to grow as we look forward. And in terms of the total percentage of road fleet that's DPU-ed, I can't answer that off the top of my head, but it's a fair portion. It's a pretty substantial portion.", "James R. Young", "Walter, keep something in mind here, though. We could significantly drive train size up if we sacrifice service. I mean, the challenge that the operating team has is to run as efficient a train size as they can but meet aggressive service targets. So that's the balance you have to wrestle with here. I'm telling you service pays off big time. We're seeing that in the market when we're redoing these deals and the value that's there, so we've got to always keep both of those in mind, train size and the service commitment.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And that is an interesting point in terms of that being the bottleneck. Your infrastructure is not the bottleneck. Your sightings are long enough now to handle 200 to 250 car length trains. Is that a fair statement?", "James R. Young", "No. We still have opportunities on capital, particularly you look down in the South that we're struggling with today that we can improve the productivity and efficiency there. Lance, you want to add anything?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure, yes. It's just very dependent again on the quarter and the specific route you're talking about. Although, again, our current capital plan long-term and near-term takes that into account where we anticipate growth is going to be happening. And we've got a solid capital plan to enable continued productivity and service improvements.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that great. Second question here is just sort of a minor one. Jack, would you be able to quantify for us the percentage of your book that is currently legacy? How much you think of that is going to get repriced in the fourth quarter of 2011? And the estimated lift, you've talked about, about 100 basis point opportunity in average core pricing lift. Is that still the case?", "John J. Koraleski", "I'm trying to look at my choices here.", "James R. Young", "Walter, you've stumped us here. Go ahead, Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Walter, I would refer you back to the slide that you've seen us present in the past, we didn't have it in our deck today, that shows the breakout of legacy by year. In 2012, as a reminder, we said there's about $300 million worth of business up for renegotiation in our legacy book in 2012. I mean, we break it out in multiple years beyond that. But we haven't provided specific guidance in terms of what the uplift will be other than if you look backwards, we've said we've gotten about 2 points of yield annually from the benefit of repricing legacy. We haven't given guidance as to what that uplift's going to be going forward.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And if I remember correctly, I think 2011 was the bulk -- was the biggest year out of the next 3 or 4 years.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, 2011 was about $750 million, which was the back-end loaded comments that we've made.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy of Susquehanna Financial.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "The export coal story has primarily been one dominated by the Eastern rails. We've recently seen some concerns about cooling export demand, which, I think, any sane person would expect off this year's peak, but we continue to think it's a multi-secular, multiyear secular run. You've got a couple of terminals that have been announced or proposed on the West Coast. I'm just wondering, Gateway Pacific, Millennium Bulk, Port of Morrow, St. Helens, Grays Harbor, Coos Bay, which projects have you been approached about or are you in discussions with? And when do you see them potentially coming to fruition, so you guys can move some export coal off the West Coast?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "Matt, we're interested particularly in the ones up in the Longview, Washington area, the one -- I think it's called Ambre Energy, the Australian company. That one has some real opportunity for us, and virtually, any of the ones that we can access. We're also looking at some Gulf Coast opportunities and even some possibilities moving down to Mexico. So I think the big question for us, particularly on the West Coast in the domestic U.S. marketplace, is whether or not those construction projects will actually take place and whether the EPA and the environmentalists and things, I mean, they have put a lot of roadblocks up in terms of getting those projects approved and under construction. So that's the thing we're watching most right at the moment.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Got it. Second question was -- and my last question would be just on the exports again. Obviously, imports were disappointing this peak season. I was thinking more on the export side. You've seen some fairly robust numbers out of the Port of L.A. I think in the last 3 months, up north of 20% in terms of full box exports out of L.A. Are you seeing any of that business, and can you just maybe clarify if you are -- what is it that you're moving to port that's going the other way?", "John J. Koraleski", "We're moving the iron ore business. We're moving a lot of export soda ash, export fertilizers. And then in the boxes themselves, we're seeing everything from DDGS to grain. There's been some proposals -- well, scrap paper is also a big item. There's been some proposals for commodities even like iron ore as a potential to go back, just about anything that will fit in a box and that's reasonably possible are things that a lot of the companies are looking at to take advantage of that excess capacity.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So fair to say that it's a lot of the different businesses and a lot of active discussions at present?", "John J. Koraleski", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Two quick questions. In terms of -- maybe not a legacy business left to be repriced, but what percent of your book of business was repriced, say, from December 2008 through maybe the first quarter of 2009?", "John J. Koraleski", "Jason, when you look at it, there's 60% or 70% of our business -- no, there's about 60% of our business that either moves under tariff or moves in one-year letter quotes, so all of that gets repriced every year. And then on an ongoing basis, when you look at our multiyear contracts, this year is a little bit of a larger group than what we've seen, but the number just right off the top of my head is something -- in the past 12 months is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "$2.6 billion, okay. That's good color.", "James R. Young", "That would include both the legacy and the non-legacy.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, fantastic. Well, I'm looking at, obviously, your Domestic Utility business. The question was asked if any of the regulations actually could hurt you. I'm going to ask it the other way. Can any of them actually help you? Because obviously, the CSAPR regulations, they've changed a little bit over time, but we've been hearing that some of the utility buyers might have held off a little bit buying some thermal. Do you think they could actually start changing the bases they purchase from going forward?", "James R. Young", "It could. It could be a positive for us. It just depends on how quickly the evolution takes place and what is playing. One of the things we're seeing right now is actually kind of the side benefit of some of those regulations is the potential for moving either limestone or trona as a scrubbing agent to help meet some of those. So when faced with kind of a long-term decision, the quickest and most immediate thing might be to just put in a quick scrubbing solution that doesn't cost quite as much like the trona manufacturers offer to the utilities, and that turns out to be a nice piece of business for us.", "Operator", "Our last question is coming from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "It's actually [indiscernible] in for Jeff. Just had a question if you could talk about some of the changes that you're seeing at the ports of call on the West Coast and if you're seeing a net benefit from increased containers being dropped off in Oakland versus Los Angeles and Long Beach?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "We're not really seeing any major shifts or changes, actually. And they probably -- this isn't a good time for us to really see a lot of those because there's plenty of capacity everywhere. Volume levels are below what they were a year ago in the third quarter. So we're not seeing any dramatic shift taking place.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "And then one more question. Of the 7% increase in derailments per train miles, how much of that was related to weather and the heat and the drought?", "John J. Koraleski", "Some was related to the heat and the drought in Texas, clearly, a lot of very low value train derailments track caused in yards and terminals. And so there was a little bit of an impact there as well.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments.", "James R. Young", "Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. I hope one of the things you recognized -- I think this quarter really reinforces the value of the diversity of the UP network, and we had some surprises in some of the areas on volumes. But once again, the diversity paid off for us. So we look forward to talking to you again with our fourth quarter earnings.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Young, you may begin.", "James R. Young", "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me in Omaha today are Rob Knight, our CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "As you can see, we finished 2011 with an all-time record quarter, achieving a quarterly earnings milestone of $1.99 per share, that's a 28% increase compared to 2010. Our outstanding fourth quarter results demonstrate the capabilities of this diverse franchise and contributed to the most profitable year in Union Pacific's 150-year history. ", "Record top and bottom line results achieved historic marks and generated record financial returns and investments. Rob will provide the details here in the financials in a minute. We remain focused on delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that generates value for our customers and translates into record financial returns for our shareholders. These efforts were recognized with best ever 2011 marks in customer satisfaction and employee safety. ", "So with that, we'll turn it over to Jack to cover the marketing details.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We will start this morning with a recap of our record-setting customer satisfaction scores. ", "For the quarter, customer satisfaction came in at 92. That equals our best ever mark set in the second quarter. And along the way, October tied our best month at 93. So in terms of how our customers view the value proposition that Union Pacific brought to them in 2011, we closed the year with a record-setting score of 92, 3 full points better than the previous record set last year at 89. ", "And while we still have plenty of room for improvement, faced with growing volumes, the Union Pacific team delivered even while our operating team was out there battling blizzards, flooding and droughts. ", "The advantage of a diverse franchise was again, evident in the fourth quarter as volumes grew 3% despite our declines in Ag products and Intermodal. Core pricing improved 5% with gains in all 6 of our businesses. Those price gains, higher fuel surcharge revenue, and some positive mix as our carload business grew while Intermodal is a little soft, drove average revenue per car up 13%. The growth in volume and improved revenue per car produced a 16% increase in freight revenue to $4.8 billion.", "So let me take you through each of our 6 groups in a little more detail. On Slide 4, you can see -- well, Slide 6. Slide 6, you can see Ag products revenue grew 2% as a 7% improvement in average revenue per car more than offset a 5% decline in carloadings. Softer volume wasn't unexpected as increased world crop production, high U.S. corn prices and plentiful crop storage reduced U.S. grain exports. ", "Against 2010's record levels, our export grain shipments actually declined 43%. That decline was partially offset by a 22% growth in domestic grain, boosted by drought damage to crops in West Texas and forward ethanol plants that reopened earlier in the year. ", "Our biofuels volume grew 18% in the fourth quarter. We saw a record number of ethanol unit train shipped in December, and biodiesel shipments surged as customers ramped up production to take advantage of the tax credits that expired at the end of the year.", "With pent-up demand, improving inventory levels, aging vehicles across the country and improving credit terms, the automotive industry continued to gain momentum, pushing U.S. vehicle sales to their highest level since the second quarter of 2008. That strengthening was reflected in a 10% increase in our automotive volume, which combined with a 13% improvement in average revenue per car, to produce a 26% increase in revenue. Our finished vehicle carloadings grew 14%, and our part shipments were up about 7%.", "Our Chemical business continued the strength we saw throughout the year with volume up 10%, which along with a 7% improvement in average revenue per car, produced an 18% increase in revenue. Petroleum volume increased 46%, driven primarily by increased crude oil shipments from the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale regions. Supporting that growth was our strong delivery network that combines geographic reach with flexible service options. ", "Increased shipments of polypropylene and polyethylene produced a 7% growth in plastics, and all other segments of our Chemical business also saw volume increases, including a near doubling of phos rock shipments as favorable weather and strong demand extended the shipping season.", "Energy volume was up 8%, which combined with a 12% improvement in average revenue per car to drive revenue up 21%. The volume gains included some small makeup of missed loads from the second quarter of flooding, and that pretty much completes the recovery of that business.", "Tonnage from the Southern Powder River Basin increased 7% with the new business to the Wisconsin utilities, again being the primary driver. With few production issues and strong growth in international shipments, Colorado, Utah tonnage posted its second consecutive growth quarter, up 10%. That capped solid improvement in the export coal market in 2011. Our export tons totaled 5.2 million for the year, which was up from 1.4 million tons in 2010. ", "Industrial Products volume was up 7%, combined with a 16% improvement in average revenue per car and drove a 24% revenue increase. Just as our Chemicals business benefits from growth in the shale plays by offering outbound transportation solutions for crude oil, our Industrial Products group is well positioned to provide reliable transportation for inbound materials used in drilling like frac sand and steel pipe. ", "In the fourth quarter, that was reflected in 40% growth in nonmetallic mineral shipments, which is primarily frac sand and a 9% increase in our steel volume with growth in pipe and steel coils. Steel also got a boost from continued strengthening of the auto industry.", "Metallic mineral shipments increased 73%, driven by growth in our iron ore unit train business from Utah to California forts for export to China. Offsetting some of the strength was a 36 -- 38% decline in hazardous waste volume, driven by a reduction in our short haul uranium tailings move for the Department of Energy as government funding was reduced after the stimulus money ran out.", "On Slide 11, our Intermodal volume grew 13%, as the 16% improvement in average revenue per unit more than offset a 3% decline in volume. The lower volume was driven by the international segment, where soft import levels produced a 7% decline. Also contributing was the continued impact of the contract loss that we won't wrap until May 1. While the weak international peak season was disappointing, the news was better in the domestic segment where highway conversions drove 3% growth. That topped the previous quarterly volume record that we set at the end of last year. ", "Last, but not least, we closed the year with strong performance in our Mutual Commitment Program. As we discussed last quarter, we were able to provide customers participating in the program with all their needed box capacity throughout the domestic peak.", "So that pretty much wraps up 2011. I'm going to turn focus here now to 2012 starting with Global Insight's most recent economic projections, which reflect the continuation of a relatively slow growing economy. GDP is expected to be a little stronger in 2011, but industrial production growth will be a little slower. Vehicle sales are pegged at $13.5 million, which is about where they came in, in the fourth quarter, so that seems pretty reasonable to us. We entered 2012, once again, looking for some signs of recovery in the housing industry. And time will tell whether this is the year where we finally start to see some signs of life there. ", "Imports and exports are expected to grow more slowly this year. And even with some projected improvement, continued high unemployment adds uncertainty to the economic outlook.", "So with that as a starting point, here's how we see 2012 volume growth shaping up in our major markets on Slide 13. Our diverse franchise gives us a number of markets where we're expecting solid growth. The top of the list are minerals and petroleum, which should continue to outpace the economy, driven by the opportunity in shale energy to move both inbound materials and outbound products. ", "We continue to see Intermodal as a long-term growth driver, and in 2012, great service should bring new highway conversions in the domestic segment. Automotive volume should continue to grow as the industry's recovery continues. Prospects for growth in non-Powder River Basin coal look good, with improved production in international demand boosting the Colorado, Utah segment. ", "Metals opportunities also look good in 2012. While the expected increase in housing starts, small though it is, should also give a boost to our lumber business. We also think that fertilizer and LPG should see solid growth. You can also see the markets where we expect more moderate growth, and those where we actually expect slow growth at best, with the latter top by the Southern Powder River Basin coal and International Intermodal. ", "The SPRB outlook is dampened by a couple of contract losses in 2011, including one small legacy deal that went to the competition. We'll lap the startup of the Wisconsin utility that fueled this year's growth, and we have a few utilities that are telling us they're going to have somewhat softer demand this year. ", "Of course, with our Energy business, a lot really depends on the summer burn. So we could have some upside if the summer really heats up. For International Intermodal, with an uncertain economy, we're actually taken pretty conservative approach to the volume prospects in 2012. ", "So as we look out over the coming year, our strong value proposition's going to, again, support our business development and underpin our growth. I mentioned the one legacy energy contract loss in 2011, but we successfully repriced over 90% of the $1 billion of legacy business we competed for. So that provides a solid foundation for our 2012 pricing plan. As a result, we expect increases in volume will combine with pricing gains to drive profitable revenue growth. ", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thank you, Jack. I'll start with safety. Our reportable personal injury rate was a record low in 2011. Training, process improvements and capital investments combined to reduce our environmental and behavioral risks. I'm particularly encouraged by a steep reduction in severe injuries that have the greatest human and financial impact. ", "Regarding rail equipment incidents or derailments, our full year reportable rate increased 10%. Increases in mainline track incidents, which were driven by weather and human factor derailments, were partly offset by a decrease in yard and industry-lead derailments. ", "In public safety, the grade crossing accident rate improved 9% versus 2010, and tied 2009's best ever performance. We closed 269 at-grade crossings on the UP system during the year, and our community and driver-focused approach to grade crossing safety continued to generate long-term improvement.", "While I am very pleased to report 2 of 3 safety measures at all-time record lows, our ultimate goal is to eliminate all safety incidents. ", "Moving onto UP's network performance. Last quarter, I noted the negative impact that Midwest flooding and the Texas drought had on our operation. We forecasted a return to normal by the end of the year, which is exactly what happened. We fully recovered our service capability by using a mix of surge resources, alternative routes and aggressive maintenance work. As a result, velocity climbed to average 25.6 miles per hour in the fourth quarter, 25.9 miles per hour in December, and is well over 26.5 miles an hour so far in January. ", "We're well positioned for growth with about 1,000 employees furloughed and around 600 locomotives in long-term storage, which includes about 250 units ready for surge utilization. The value of surge resources was demonstrated yet again in 2011, helping us maintain fluidity and service in the face of major network disruptions.", "Slide 17 illustrates our fourth quarter service and efficiency performance. Starting at the upper left. The condition of our network has literally never been better. In 3 years, we've reduced slow order miles by over 60%, enhancing customer service and generating capacity to support volume growth. Gross ton-miles per employee accelerated from the first 3 quarters to finish 2% better than 2010, despite the impact of more than 700 additional employees working on capital projects or positive train control. ", "Moving to the lower left, train size improved in the fourth quarter with record fourth quarter manifest and Intermodal train lengths. Intermodal train size grew despite a decrease in the fourth quarter intermodal volumes compared to 2010. ", "In the lower right, our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. We absorbed the 3% carload increase, and weather disruptions, while maintaining a solid Service Delivery Index. The local operating teams continue to build the fundamental elements of great service, as reflected by industry spot and pull, which tied for an all-time best fourth quarter at 94%.", "As Jack discussed, manifest traffic grew dramatically in 2011, driven by increased industrial products and chemical shipments. While all regions experienced an increase in manifest volume, the southern region absorbed about half the growth. The Union Pacific franchise is well suited for this business with excellent route density and terminal infrastructure. We've leveraged our terminal assets while absorbing the new volume, which is reflected here as an increase in the number of cars switched per man day. The ability to handle the current shift in traffic emphasizes our network strength. It's a shared resource, it's well positioned to support each of the 6 business groups. Capital investment keeps the network strong and adds new capacity where we can generate attractive returns on the new volume.", "For 2012, our capital plan totals around $3.6 billion. More than half of that is replacement spending to harden the infrastructure, making the network safe and resilient. Spending for service, growth and productivity will total over $1.3 billion. Capacity, commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers. Major projects include additional double track on the Sunset Corridor as well as the Blair project, work on the Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility and various projects in the south to support our diverse book of business, including the growth in energy exploration and production that Jack mentioned. ", "We're acquiring 200 new road locomotives and close to 1,800 freight cars, which includes covered hoppers, gondolas and new AutoFlex auto racks, which were designed and are being built by a UP car shop. These equipment acquisitions not only serve as replacements for older assets, but also to meet expected business growth. ", "In addition to our investments for growth and efficiency, we plan to spend about $335 million on positive train control this year. We originally estimated a capital spend of $1.4 billion through 2015 when PTC was first mandated. After 3 years into the project and with significant software, hardware and systems development remaining, we now think the price tag for Union Pacific could be in the $2 billion range. Through 2011, we've invested nearly $400 million of the $2 billion projected spend. The 2015 implementation date poses some pretty big challenges for us and the industry. That being said, we are making a good faith effort to meet the 2015 deadline, while pacing capital based on proven technology.", "In summary, I feel very good about the outlook for 2012. We are well positioned for another record safety year as we continue to mature our total safety culture, strengthen our relationships with local communities and harden the infrastructure. The network is ready to provide excellent service as volumes grow, and we should leverage that growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. And we are going to invest a record amount of capital to support the new volume and to alleviate network constraints across the system. ", "In summary, we'll use the 6 critical operating initiatives, including the UP way, to drive our business up into the right, growth with service excellence. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. We'll start by summarizing our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue grew 16% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.1 billion, driven by fuel surcharge recoveries, core pricing gains and volume growth. ", "Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, increasing 13% compared to 2010. Higher fuel prices drove over half of the expense increase. Operating income totaled $1.6 billion, a 23% increase and a best-ever quarterly record. Other income totaled $54 million in the quarter, up $45 million compared to 2010. Higher income from real estate sales and increased cost in 2010 due to a settlement on an environmental site, drove the year-over-year increase. ", "Interest expense of $141 million was essentially flat versus the previous year. Income tax expense increased $566 million. Higher pretax earnings, and an unusually low income tax rate in 2010, drove the increase.", "Net income totaled $964 million, a quarterly best, up 24% versus 2010. Earnings per share grew 28% to an all-time record of $1.99 per share. The outstanding share balance declined 2%, reflecting our share repurchase activity.", "Turning to our top line. Freight revenue grew 16% to a fourth quarter record of $4.8 billion. Carloadings were up 3%. We also saw a positive mix impact driven by strong growth in higher average revenue per car moves. We achieved core pricing gains of 5%, which includes RCAF fuel escalators. ", "And as Jack just mentioned, we've been successful with the legacy renewals, which drove a small uptick in our pricing numbers in the fourth quarter. Fuel surcharge revenue added 6% to the top line, driven by higher fuel prices in the quarter versus 2010. ", "Slide 24 illustrates our solid pricing and productivity gains in 2011. We closed out the year on a high note, with an incremental margin of 59%, after adjusting for higher fuel prices. Our reported number of 44% also topped previous quarters in 2011, generated by strong core business operation. ", "As Slide 25 shows, our compensation and benefits expense was up 4% compared to 2010, another good news story for us. Inflationary pressures, that we previously discussed, drove a 4.5% increase in cost. Volume-related expenses were offset with solid productivity gains. And as Lance mentioned, we leveraged the volume growth very efficiently in the quarter. Other factors also worked in our favor, including a very mild weather condition. And as expected, the number of new hires in the training pipeline was flat compared to 2010, thus not a driver of our year-over-year expense increase in the quarter.", "Consistent with our previous guidance, workforce levels increased 3% in the quarter compared to 2010. Base business activity contributed to about half of the growth, while increased capital work, including positive train control, drove the remaining increase.", "In 2012, we expect another year of attrition in the 8% to 10% range. We'll continue to hire new employees to backfill for attrition and to support volume growth. And as volumes grow, we expect our overall workforce levels to increase, but not at a one-for-one rate. Compensation and benefits expense will also increase in 2012, but will depend upon volume growth. ", "On the positive side, labor inflation should moderate from the 4% to 5% range that we saw last year, and training costs should not be a year-over-year driver as it was in 2011.", "Slide 26 shows fuel expense, which totaled $935 million, increasing $248 million versus 2010. The average diesel fuel price was $3.16 per gallon, which increased 28% year-over-year. Drivers included an average barrel price of $94, which increased 10%, and a $17 per barrel increase in the conversion spread. A 5% increase in gross ton-miles and a 1% increase in our fuel consumption rate also drove higher fuel expense.", "Purchased Services & Materials expense increased 9% or $41 million to $508 million. Higher cost for contract services and equipment maintenance were the primary drivers. Also, crew lodging and transportation costs increased with the growth in volume. Other expense came in at $191 million, which was better than our previous guidance. We, again, saw lower-than-expected personal injury expense, reflecting positive experience from our continued safety gain. Versus 2010, other expenses were up $18 million, resulting from higher property taxes and lease buyout expenses.", "In 2012, the other expense line will continue to be challenged with higher property taxes and volume-related expenses. We're also facing tough year-over-year comps in our personal injury expense.", "Slide 28 summarizes fourth quarter expenses for the remaining 2 categories. Depreciation expense increased 9% to $413 million, in line with our guidance. Increased capital spending and volume growth drove the increase. ", "Looking at 2012, we expect depreciation expense to grow at a rate similar to the 2011 levels. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $289 million, up from 2010 due to increased short-term freight car rental expense and higher contract lease costs. Lower locomotive lease expense partially offset this increase. ", "Union Pacific's operating ratio on Slide 29 reflects the substantial improvements in profitability that we've achieved over the last several years. On a reported basis, our operating ratio was a fourth quarter record of 68.3%. Ongoing productivity efforts, core pricing gains and volume growth all contributed to this mark, more than offsetting the negative fuel price impact of nearly 1 point versus 2010. ", "On a full year basis, our operating ratio was 70.7%, only slightly behind our all-time 2010 record of 70.6%. We achieved real improvement this year, nearly offsetting the negative year-over-year fuel price impact of about 1.7 point.", "Looking forward, we remain committed to achieving our operating ratio target of 65% to 67% by 2015. Slide 30 provides a summary of our 2011 earnings and a full year income statement. I'll walk through a few of the highlights from our record setting year. ", "Operating revenue achieved an all-time record of $19.6 billion. Operating income also set a new best-ever mark of over $5.7 billion, topping 2010's record by 15%. And net income of $3.3 billion and earnings of $6.72 per share also set new historic annual record. Union Pacific's profitability in 2011 also drove record free cash flow after dividends. Increased cash from operations more than offset the higher capital spending of nearly $700 million, and increased cash dividends of $235 million. ", "We continue to see the benefits of bonus depreciation, which created a $450 million tailwind in 2011 versus 2010. This year, that benefit will be significantly lower due to the catch-up of prior year's program and a reduced rate of 50% bonus depreciation in 2012 from the 100% mark in 2011.", "Our balance sheet remains strong supporting our investment grade credit rating. At year end 2011, the adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 40.7%. There's some timing in this number since we accelerated around $475 million of debt maturities from the first part of 2012 into 2011, which we will likely refinance sometime this year.", "Slide 32 shows our full year 2011 capital investment of $3.2 billion, slightly below our targeted investment of $3.3 billion. And as Lance discussed, our preliminary capital plan for 2012 is around $3.6 billion, up from 2011, but consistent with our guidance of 17% to 18% of revenue over the next several years. Increased spending on locomotives and positive train control are the major drivers. We'll also be spending more on capacity projects, but less on equipment purchases, given that we're not planning on buying any containers this year.", "Slide 32 also reflects our achievements in generating returns on these investments. Return on invested capital was a record 12.4% in 2011, up 1.6 points versus 2010. Returns must continue to improve to support the significantly higher asset replacement costs and investments required to achieve our safety, service and growth initiatives. ", "Our performance in 2011 generated record cash, and we're returning that to our shareholders. For 2011, dividends per share increased a total of 58%, a significant step toward achieving our target declared payout ratio of 30%.", "In the fourth quarter, we bought back close to 3.9 million shares, totaling $381 million. For 2011, our share repurchases totaled $1.4 billion. Looking forward, we have nearly 28 million shares remaining under our current authorization. ", "So with that, we've wrapped up a record-breaking year in 2011. But now, we're focused on 2012 and the tremendous opportunities that we see before us. For 2012, we're targeting record full year operating ratio performance. We believe there are continued opportunities for volume growth and pricing gains, as Jack highlighted earlier. Of course, the economy will play a determining role. And we remain focused on continued productivity gains, which will provide additional leverage capabilities and further drive operating efficiencies. Our prospects for 2012, supported by Union Pacific's strong value proposition, position us to take advantage of the unique opportunities offered by our diverse franchise. 2012 should also be another record year for earnings, allowing us to reward our shareholders with even greater returns. ", "With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.", "James R. Young", "Thanks, Rob. And before I wrap up, I want to provide a quick update on National Labor negotiations. As many of you know, 10 of the 13 unions have ratified agreements, and 2 of the 3 remaining unions have tentative agreements out to their members for vote. The Brotherhood of Maintenance Way Employees is the only union without an agreement. The industry is making every effort to reach an agreement before the cooling-off period ends in February 8. We're making progress and are committed to getting a deal done. ", "Now, when you think about our financial outlook for this year, our outstanding 2011 performance clearly sets the stage. The bar has been raised in terms of future expectations, and I believe our prospects have never looked better. Economic indicators generally point to slow continued growth in 2012. ", "Excellent service though is the key to our future success, supporting our customer value proposition and helping us drive increased productivity. Our capital investment strategy will be another key part of UP's success, making investments today, building capacity for tomorrow. We believe very strongly in the opportunities to grow our financial returns in the future. ", "So with that, let's open it up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jason Seidl, Dahlman Rose.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of quick questions. When you break down your volume growth potential, you have solid, moderate and slow to negative, can you give us sort of a range, what you consider a moderate growth is at sort of the 2% to 3%, and solids, 3% or above?", "James R. Young", "Yes, Jason. We've -- we're obviously not giving specific numbers on those. And -- I mean if you look back in time, you can kind of get some feel for the way some of these commodities grow. And we'll -- I think you're going to continue to see in growth, kind of what we've seen this year, good, consistent growth, but on a slow basis.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And when I look at your 5% growth on the core pricing, obviously. There is some of that RCAF in there. Could you talk what it would look like x RCAF, and what was the timing like in terms of the renewals on your legacy business? Did they happen earlier in the quarter or later in the quarter or they're evenly spread out?", "James R. Young", "Jack, do you want to take that or Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Let me start with the, maybe the first part of that question, Jason, in terms of the RCAF impact. It's about 0.5 point on our pricing, and that's been fairly consistent throughout 2011.", "John J. Koraleski", "I would also say, Jason, as we go through the process of continuing to renegotiate and renew and compete for these legacy deals, that RCAF component becomes a lesser piece of the pie for us in terms of how it influences our escalations.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And the timing of the legacy?", "John J. Koraleski", "Go ahead again, Jason. What was your question?", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "No, I'm saying that the timing of the legacy for the quarter, was it evenly spread out as you renegotiate the legacy deals in 4Q? Or was it sort of more in the beginning of the quarter?", "John J. Koraleski", "We have some of the $1 billion from last year, included some for this year. So we've got that completed, and it's behind us. The remainder of our legacy deals for 2013 are going to be at the end of this year.", "Robert M. Knight", "Jason, this is Rob, again. In the fourth quarter, most of what you saw on the renewals were back-end loaded in the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan Chase.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "On the pricing, as a point of a lot of interest in 2012. I guess I look at -- and I think simple logic could be core price that you had in first 3 quarters of this year without much legacy with 4.5%. I think that you've commented in the past that kind of strong legacy pricing, maybe you can get 2 points a year in a relatively good year. So if I look at 2012, I think you fairly easily get to 6.5 as kind of a low end. And maybe above that in terms of the core price, I'm sure you don't want to be specific, but is that appropriate logic or am I missing something in terms of thinking about core price in 2012?", "James R. Young", "Well, Tom, we're not going to confirm your numbers. I would be a little bit careful on how high you move it up here. Remember, some of these agreements have pricing phased in over time. You get some mix effect in here, but it will be a good year for us. I mean we said we were legacy light in 2011. We have been successful, as Jack said, renegotiating about 90% of the legacy deals. So it should be a pretty good year for us this year.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of the follow-up. Rob, if I recall, on your fourth quarter 2010 conference call, you had -- I think it was probably 5 or 6 discrete items, training costs, state taxes, depreciation, accrue -- casualty accrual, a bunch of different things that were cost headwinds in 2011. It sounds like maybe depreciation's still at a -- growing at a fairly strong rate. But is it fair to think that your inflation is at a pretty -- a lot lower rate in your cost side in 2012? And I guess other than depreciation, are there other things to be aware of?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, a couple of points I would make, Tom. Recall that labor inflation coming into the year, we said for 2011 would be -- and it was in that 4% to 5% range. We think the labor inflation will moderate below that, as I said earlier. You're right, depreciation is a bit of a headwind, as you point out. The other item I would call to your attention is other expense. And as you know, there's a lot of items in there. But one cost pressure we know we're going to face in 2012 in the other line is going to be our property taxes, which again are driven by higher earnings and volume-related costs, or some volume-related cost are in that category as well. Plus, we do face some fairly challenging comps year-over-year in our personal injury expense line. So those will be the challenges that I would point out at this point.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "But it -- but you think it's fair to say cost inflation overall is less of an issue than 2011?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, that's a fair statement.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just curious on the legacy repricing in terms of retention. Obviously, some of this was as competitive business. Can you give us a sense of how much of that legacy that you did in November, December was successfully retained by you guys?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, what we said was over 90% has been repriced, and I don't think we're going to get into very specific deals, but I think that's a fairly good number for you.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, now that's great. Just looking at your capital structure. I think you've been trending down to about a 40% adjusted debt-to-total cap. And just curious, I know you're going to refi a little bit this year. How are you looking at that? I mean, can give us a sense of what your target level is? And presumably, you'll use your share buyback for any excess cash that you're generating now. You're getting really north of 12% on your ROIC? Any extra cash that you're generating, assuming outside of the dividends, would be going into that share buyback. Is that a fair statement?", "James R. Young", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Walter, a couple of things. One, as we've said before and as you point out, there was some timing in our -- because we're full ahead on the financing item. But we are comfortable being in that low 40s debt-to-cap ratio. So we don't have a specific set number target that I would share with you other than to say we are comfortable in that range. In terms of what we're going to do with cash, I think it's similar to what you saw us do this year. As you heard Lance talk, number one, we're increasing our capital spend, and we've increased our dividend. We want to continue to stay in that 30% payout ratio, and continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases going forward. And that's how we're approaching it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I wanted to dig in a little bit. I know that petroleum was one of the high-growth areas. Could you talk a little bit about the experiences that you're seeing in these shale projects right now? How much of it is being served by unit trains? And besides Eagle Ford and Bakken, are there others behind that, that are starting to be developed, that we should be aware of?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, Justin, when you look at it, only about, I would say 25% to 30% of our business is moving in unit trains today, but we're still actually in that start-up mode. So moving a lot in manifest, and we're shifting more towards unit trains, and you'll see that trend continue as we work our way here through 2012. Clearly, the Bakken was the largest proportion of our business this year in terms of the crude oil. Eagle Ford started up, which was nice for us. We'll also, this year, be moving Permian Basin, and hopefully, out of the Niobrara as kind of the big ones.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. It seems like it's a nice piece of growth business for you guys. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the Powder River Basin and International Intermodal. Calling those out as areas of softness, is it just the legacy contract in Southern Powder River Basin that gives you any kind of concern in terms of your growth rates this year, or are there other environmental issues that you're worried about? We had a stay with Casper, but we'll find out more, I guess, later this year. And then, on the international side, you called out being a little cautious on the weak or the uncertain economy. As we look out at that, you lapped the customer loss, as you said in May, is there a reason to believe that the back half could be better there than the first half?", "James R. Young", "Yes. In terms of coal, Powder River Basin, in particular, kind of the way I think about it that might be helpful for you, Justin, is I take what I -- with the contracts that I lost, and I lay that against the contracts that I've gained, the new business and also some incremental international business, that's about a wash. That's about a breakeven for me. So when I look at coal business going forward, I'm looking right now at a very, very mild winter. I'm looking at stockpiles that are growing in November. The Powder River Basin stockpiles matched where they should be for normal. And since then, the winter weather has been relatively mild. So there's not much burn going on. So I see a stockpile issue burning or building for us that we need to work our way through. And then, we have a couple of customers that have told us to expect somewhat lower demand, and that was tied to some of the environmental regulations. Although now with staying of Casper, I think the jury is out as to just how much that will play. I think the bigger factor for us, hands down, is how hot is it going be this summer. So if the mild winter translates into a very, very hot summer, we should be okay. The other one is the low natural gas prices that are out there. That's not a real big impact for us right at the moment. But of course, you could always watch that and just see -- I mean if you saw -- I suppose if you saw natural gas prices go down to $2 and actually stay there, we could see some of the merchant plants lose some business to the grid. But typically, gas is not a big negative factor for us in our served territory.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And on the International Intermodal?", "James R. Young", "On the International Intermodal, we had no peak season to speak of this year. And we've watched inventory ratios, the inventory-to-sales ratios, we kept expecting them to see some build, it never happened. There's the potential there, but there's also some questions as to just how aggressive will the retail sales be and how does that all play itself out. So we're just looking at it and saying, we're going to plan for something that's kind of a repeat of what we saw last year. Yes, it could be a little stronger for us in the second half. We will wrap that contract loss on May 1. So we'll see kind of a stronger second half, but we're not just seeing a lot of enthusiasm for a real, real strong international peak season again next year. So that's kind of how we forecasted it.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And there's nothing related to the APL contract, or is there?", "James R. Young", "Not that I can say.", "John J. Koraleski", "Justin, the real wildcard here is where do you think the consumer will come play out next year? Housing actually has, can have a pretty big impact on International Intermodal. There's some positive signs there. So we're -- it's really bet on how you think the economy consumer will play during the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just following up on the coal for a minute. You mentioned on the domestic, the softness on -- you're seeing on the PRB. You also threw in there on the export side, you went from 1 million to 5 million tons. Can you talk about your expectations for coal demand on a global basis and where are you moving that and your growth plans for that?", "John J. Koraleski", "I think overall, Ken, we're looking at the world demand and saying, \"It's going to continue.\" It could be choppy. You see prices ebb and flow from time to time that might cause some. But overall, we still see world demand growing and creating a great export opportunity for us. We had 5.2 million tons, up from, I think, what did I say, 1.4 million last year. We'll do better than that, again, this year. We'll continue to see growth in that marketplace for us, and it will -- our primary focus right out of the box is for the bituminous coal out in Colorado and Utah, because that's where the world demand seems -- the higher energy coal is more in demand than the SPRB. But we're all over SPRB opportunities as well. We're scouring every port potential, every opportunity that we get, we're working with the mines. And we see that as a continuing to develop as a good opportunity for us.", "James R. Young", "And Ken, keep in mind though, UP shipped total tonnage last year was about 250 million tons. So we're talking about an export market of 5 million. It's again, it's not a huge base for us. It will again as we think to the future, will also offer some consistent growth. But it is not the main driver of our coal business.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "No, I recognize that, but it's just, we've been seeing obviously some metcoal cutback announcements lately. And it's a positive sign that you're expecting that to grow into 2012.", "James R. Young", "Well, we're in different markets.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Meaning who you're serving?", "James R. Young", "Well, the metcoal, that's not a big player for us.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you provide any thoughts on the magnitude? You noted you kept 90% on the repricing. Can you provide any thoughts on the magnitude? Somebody threw out before -- you've noted in the past, it could add about 2% to pricing. Is that -- can you comment on the magnitude of what we would expect? Or at this point, just based on what you've already renewed?", "James R. Young", "Ken, we're not going to get into specifics. We feel good about what we're able to accomplish. We lost some business. I said we're out of the box if we couldn't get the kind of returns we're looking for. We wouldn't handle it. And what really helped reinforce it for us is the great service and value we're providing to customers. There's no surprise that there are substantial price increases in many of those, but we also heard very clearly about the value proposition coming through. So again, we don't get individual discussions on them. It was -- feel pretty darn good about what we accomplished this year.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "One last one. Just Rob, threw out that he expected the injury expenses to climb. Is there some driver of that because Lance started off talking about how safety had improved so much, just wondering why the conflicting statements?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, this is Rob. We don't expect the injury expenses to climb. What I was pointing out is that year-over-year, because of the sizable reductions in expenses in 2011, that just creates a difficult comp for us. We have every expectation that we'll continue to improve our safety performance and continue to improve the expense, perhaps just not at the same rate.", "Lance M. Fritz", "It won't be a negative.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe if I could start just on a question on PTC. What's the key driver primarily of the increase that you're seeing over your last projection? And kind of how should we think about layering that in from a timing perspective? You've given us the run rate through 2012, but how do we think about beyond that through 2015?", "James R. Young", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. Let's start with the drivers. So recall that PTC, when it was mandated, was not an off-the-shelf technology. So what you're seeing reflected is exactly what I mentioned in my comments. And that is, as we develop both the hardware, the software and the overall systems technology, we're discovering more complexity, more interactions, and it's more costly. So the reflection of going from $1.4 billion to $2 billion is mostly about technology development and getting a more finite cost on that. So then looking forward, by the mandate, we've accelerated spending in 2012 to this anticipated $335 million. I anticipate there could be modest acceleration from that point in future years. But it'll be predicated on having developed technology to implement. So spending is going to be paced somewhat by making sure the technology's developed.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Sure. And I guess that kind of goes into the idea of ultimate timing for 2015 implementation, I mean any sense of leeway around the timing? I mean, there has to be some discussions? I'm guessing you guys are working towards the '15 goal, but how do you think about that from a realistic perspective?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Well, Chris, the industry, you have a key report due to Congress on March 1. That -- obviously, the FRA will be required to report on the status. I'll be very honest with you, I just -- I don't see it happening in 2015, the complexity that we're faced with here, the requirements. I mean, keep in mind, if the system doesn't work, you don't move product. And that's why when we look at implementing this thing, it's got to have a very, very high degree of reliability. And you have no room to get it wrong. So keep your eye out on the report that goes to Congress here on March 1.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great, that's very, very helpful. And then, just one final follow-up. Just on the headcount side when you think about kind of the inflationary rate. I know you said it was going to step down, Rob, when you think about it for 2012? And what's the order of magnitude we should expect? Is it somewhere in the neighborhood of kind of 3-ish percent or is it a little harder to tell?", "Robert M. Knight", "At this point in time, it's harder to tell, just less than that 4% that I indicated. Yes, and that's -- if I can, just, Chris, on that, that's on inflation. The inflation rate in our labor line, I'm saying, is going to less than 4%. The headcount net-net, that will depend upon where volumes end up. And as I said, we expect volumes to be a steady slow growth. So we'd expect headcount to increase, but at a less than one-for-one rate.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna International Group.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow-up on the Casper issue. Obviously, it was stayed, but it's something that's not going away. We can all track the weather, I guess, for the next coming months and keep our fingers crossed. But I was wondering the longer-term implications of this environmental regulation, you kind of see the chessboard shaping up. Is it a net positive for UNP, or let's call it, an immediate term in the PRB coal can bridge some of the less viable Central App coal? Are you getting inquiries to that effect? Or just help me think about the impact to your franchise specifically as you sketch out the roadmap over the next 3 to 5 years of the Casper rig?", "John J. Koraleski", "Matt, when you look at it, I do actually look at it as a potential opportunity for UP and Southern Powder River Basin coal because the coal will be more amenable to meeting those standards. I think we probably were getting some inquiries about moving coal, particularly to the east with the stay. It's probably dead right at the moment. And I think the other question in a lot of our customers' minds is just the emission credits and what value will be assessed to them by the market, and how does that play itself out. So a lot of questions that are out there, but it does present an opportunity, I think, for UP. And the other side of it is, both in terms of moving limestone and also trona, as a couple of different approaches towards reaching those requirement levels would also be a good business opportunity for us.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "All right, thanks. And my second question or follow-up would be just the earlier timing of the Chinese New Year, kind of in a rough patch here, we've been destocking for several months. And now, everything shuts down for 2 weeks. You get about a 3-week lag before things can get here from Asia. So you were talking about the end of March before you could see a noticeable pick-up just from an economic perspective. Always interested in your guys' economic read. You cited some numbers, but everyone seems to be basing a lot of their hopes on just, I guess, just that hope. But are you actually hearing from customers and any pocket of the business you serve and intentions to restock? Or is it just more hope that we've bottomed and hope that things get better? Or is the rubber actually hitting the proverbial road?", "James R. Young", "Yes Matt, this is Jim. Maybe it's the new year, you always have more hope coming into it. But I'd say our perspective in meeting with customers, we're just with one of our very large customers here a couple days ago. They're a little more bullish. Now it varies by industry. The auto industry today, they're feeling much better than they were. There's still long ways from where they were in the peak, but that could be a pretty good year. You look at some of the areas where you're still significantly off from recession. Take the -- anything related to construction. In fact, I don't -- I can't remember if we said it or not. Well we had a little bit of an increase in our lumber shipments this year. Or in 2011, we're still 60% below where we were in the peak. So when you think about housing, some of the construction, it's a little more positive this year. So again though, I think it still all fits into the perspective of we will see positive growth, it will be something kind of the slow side.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Rob, I just want clarification on -- you reiterated your long-term margin guidance, the OR targets. Just to clarify, those are not the adjusted numbers that you're referring to, right? These include fuel and everything, not sort of the adjusted for fuel numbers?", "Robert M. Knight", "That's right. The 65% to 67% operating ratio full year all in by 2015.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then, the fourth quarter obviously seasonally weak, but a really good OR nonetheless. Can we -- is there a way we should think about -- while the weather maybe was a little bit easier this quarter or was a little bit harder last quarter or last year, is there anything to keep that in mind that sort of -- not really onetime, but sort of unusual?", "Robert M. Knight", "I don't think -- we were still dealing with issues down south at the beginning of the quarter. You bet it was a little bit better weather wise for us, but that wasn't the difference maker. And at the end of day here, we really -- a couple of things to keep in mind. We cycled some of the cost. Remember, Rob, we're talking about training -- we got to employ  productivity. We've been telling you all year that we had really kind of a one-off deal where we're building our training forces. That leveled out fourth quarter, and you had decent volume that came through. We managed our costs very well. Our pricing came in strong. You put those all those together, and boy, it can really lever that operating ratio.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, absolutely. Jim or Jack, just I'm curious your perspective on what's going on when we see contracts go back and forth between the competition. It sort of suggests there's more horsetrading that goes on in the west than perhaps other regions? And I'm not quite sure why. If you guys are willing to walk, but the competition isn't, does that suggest a more aggressive pricing dynamic from them? How do we think about this?", "James R. Young", "Bill, we compete, we compete hard. And a lot of factors come into play when you look at your decision points. It can be the routes, the capability you have, the efficiency by corridor or long-term relationships you have. I don't like that word horsetrading, because it really is one we compete hard. And I'm sure the other guys would tell you the same thing that they have some internal dynamics. They look at where's the point to walk from. So again, we've had some very tough discussions with our customers in some cases. But the key for us, Jack just said, we renegotiated successfully 90% this year of those legacy deals. An absolute key is how the customer views value from its provider. And I will tell you, I've felt very good that we're in the legacy discussions -- negotiations when you also look at we have the best customer service in the history of our company.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Larkin of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Rob talked about the incremental margins looking very, very good in the quarter. And that sort of raised the question in my mind of how sustainable that is in terms of how much capacity you think you have on your existing manifest trains and the Intermodal trains where you can fill those trains out and really drive that strong incremental margin going forward.", "James R. Young", "Well, at the end of the day, for us to continue to improve the operating ratio, we've got to improve our margins, right, on the incremental side. I would be careful on a quarterly number. I mean I kind of go round and round with my CFO on this in terms of -- I know you guys like to look at the quarterly numbers. But there are a lot of factors that come into play. But the bottom line, if we are going to get to the operating ratio targets that we've provided, those margins have to improve. Rob, go ahead?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, just a comment I would make on that, John. What we've said, if that 65% to 67% target implies we've got to do about a 50% incremental margin improvement, and it will be lumpy, as Jim says. I think one point I would make is remember, our first quarter generally is our toughest, most challenged from an operating ratio standpoint. And second and third tend to be our best. So you get lumpiness within the quarter, but on an annualized basis, it's at 50% is our expectation. And that's what we have to do to hit that target.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then as a follow-on, we talked about earlier the notion of labor inflation may be coming in a little bit below 4. I'm guessing the overall cost inflation isn't going be too much different than that x fuel. I've heard Jim before talk about how much he challenges the managers at UP to sort of offset that inflation with productivity. Is there any kind of guidance you can give us in terms of what the objective is there? How much of that 4% plus or minus can be offset with additional productivity in technology applications?", "James R. Young", "Well, John, I believe -- we talked before. I mean, we set a goal offsetting all of inflation. Now realistically, about half of it, I think, you can sustain over time. And it's going be a function of  technology, it's going to be a function of process improvement. It's going be a function of leveraging volume and operations. So I don't think that's unrealistic, at a minimum offset half of your inflation number.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "A lot of questions have already been asked, so I'm just going to ask one. Your Mutual Commitment Program was a pretty big change in terms of your go-to-market approach. And you commented that your own performance has been very good. Could you just comment on customer receptivity, and how that's evolved through the year?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure. We started off the year, customers kind of were -- kind of looking at it and looking at the change and trying to determine whether or not they should or shouldn't participate. So we kind of got off to a slow start. As we got into peak season though, we were right on with every commitment that we made during peak. We offered customers 110% of their committed volumes, and we were able to meet every commitment. So we came out of the peak season with some very favorable comments from customers and a lot more receptivity to the program. So we're anxious. We will definitely stay the course here and continue to work the program for 2012 and beyond.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.", "Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to see if I could get Lance or Rob or both to just help us think a little bit about the leverage you obviously saw in the comp and ben line for 4Q. It's pretty unusual for that to be down sequentially in dollars and also on a per head basis, and both of those things happened this time. Just wondering if you could help us think through what some of the key drivers? And I know you mentioned a few possibilities, things like the training cost falling out. I was wondering if that had already started? Also, Lance, the growth you pointed to in the manifest network, perhaps, that's where you're really getting the leverage and that was an enabler. And I guess, of course, most important is about the sustainability of those trends. Should we expect to see favorable comparisons on that cost per head basis as we look forward?", "James R. Young", "Rob, why don't you start and Lance, you can...", "Robert M. Knight", "Let me just give you -- kind of size the numbers, and then maybe Lance can give some technicolor on some of the initiatives. Remember, coming into 2011, particularly in the back half, we said that, that was going to be unusually high. And it was unusually high as we had more people in the pipeline, if you will, in terms of training. So we had that comp. And as we came in to 2000 -- back half of 2011, we said that we thought the fourth quarter would be a catch-up, if you will. So we experienced that. So we had fewer people in the hiring and training pipeline in the fourth quarter, particularly when you look at it year-over-year. And I'd say that was really what drove the financial variance that you're pointing out. In terms of some of the great initiatives that we were doing on the ground or in operation productivity, Jack should talk about that.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, let's talk about it. And it kind of gets to the earlier question about train size and other -- what we can think about going forward in terms of incremental productivity. So we did have a good quarter on train size growth. We also had a good quarter in terms of improvement in the fluidity of the network. You saw in one of my charts, I showed you improvement in cars switched per man day. That's pure productivity through our terminals. And we've got, what we call, the UP way and downtime initiatives that are using process improvement and direct involvement by the people doing the work to design the work, standardize it, take out risk and take out waste. And all of that is helping us drive, not only productivity, but safety and service at the same time. And there is plenty more of that left in the network.", "Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Is there anyway to sort of parse out the magnitude of contribution maybe for both of those with the training the more significant of the 2. It sounds like that would carry all the way through at least to the comps where you hit 4Q next year.", "John J. Koraleski", "I think when you look at the employee count spreads, the training piece was a pretty big number year-over-year, but they all interplay. I mean, I think one of the keys, Lance mentioned, we start to see our velocity pick up, the fluidity of the network. I think it just shows you how sensitive these networks are, the challenges you have. So you had a little bit less issues with weather. You had some of the routes, the mix comes into play. They all really contribute. And what I think you need to understand, we were saying that for 3 quarters. What you were seeing in the prior quarters was more unusual. That wasn't the norm. And when you're looking at a 9% and 10% increase in labor cost year-over-year, that isn't sustainable in a business. And this is an area where I think it's more of a sustainable level that they're seeing in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "So it seems like mix was a nice positive in 2011, and when we think about the initial volume outlook for this year, losing some of the legacy business, I guess muted expectations for International Intermodal and what seems like stronger carload expectations, is it fair to think about mix as being a similar positive in 2012 like it was last year?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "I think that overall, that's what I would expect. I think mix should favor us this year.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the domestic intermodal outlook and no plans to add containers this year, how much volume growth do you think you can get without adding containers? And then I guess it sounds like the plan is to keep capacity tighter, it sounds good for pricing. How do you think about pricing in 2012 on the domestic intermodal side relative to what seemed like pretty healthy increases in 2011?", "James R. Young", "Jack?", "John J. Koraleski", "I think we're continuing our focus on increasing our pricing. I don't think that's going to change in 2012. And I think that with great service, we have added capacity or available capacity in our box fleet that gets us through the year just fine.", "James R. Young", "But Scott, I think there are other factors, external factors. What do you think is going to happen with capacity in the truckload sector? What's our perspective here in terms of the economy? All those come into play. We've achieved pretty darn good pricing with really a relatively weak economy. All those can come into play. So I would -- when I look at 2000 -- this year, if anything, there could be potential upside if the economy comes a little bit stronger going forward.", "John J. Koraleski", "And we're also sometimes -- Scott, it wasn't a prolonged period of time, but we were sold out on our containers even this year with a relatively weak peak. So we'll see that happen again next year, but we think that the throughput and the better service -- you're not dealing with floods and things like that hopefully. We'll get a greater turn on that equipment, and so we can handle more freight.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "That's helpful. And just last thing real quick, what's the latest thoughts on timing to finish Sunset?", "James R. Young", "Well, we've got 2/3 finished right now. We'll do another, what do you think, Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "5%.", "James R. Young", "About 5% this year. We're going -- it's really a function of how we're looking at volume and the economy in the next 4 or 5 years. So again, it's still years out. I'd like to accelerate it. If I accelerates, that says the economy is much stronger, and we're much more bullish on the outlook. But right now, when you look at kind of the slow growth economy, we're in pretty good shape down there and  want to keep ahead of the curve.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Are you seeing incremental benefits along the way, or is it more of a once it's done 4 years from now, it's kind of a step-function improvement in productivity?", "James R. Young", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, we do see incremental benefits along the way. One of them that we don't talk about too much is we're cutting over double-track segments in areas where we have to perform maintenance on the existing single track. So we've talked historically about this investing for maintainability, and that's paying off in spades on the Sunset route.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.", "Benjamin Hartford", "Real quick, Rob, as we think about pension expense in 2012, where did the expense fall out in 2011? I think the expectation was close to $80 million, $79 million versus $51 million in '10. What was the final number for '11? And what should we be thinking about for '12 preliminarily?", "Robert M. Knight", "We would think that the pension expense will be up slightly from 2011's levels.", "Benjamin Hartford", "That $79 million, $80 million was in the ballpark?", "Robert M. Knight", "I think that's in the ballpark of what it was. I don't have the exact number, but I think that's in the ballpark.", "Benjamin Hartford", "Good. And then, I guess, Jack, just thinking about coal volumes. I know that in 2010, about 18% of your volumes were destined for Eastern U.S. customers in some form. How did that trend in 2011? And is that expected to change meaningfully in 2012?", "John J. Koraleski", "Ben, I don't think it changed meaningfully in 2011. And staying the Casper rules and things like that, I don't think we'll see a significant change in 2012 either.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse Group.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "A couple of items, it may be for Jim. Is there any concern, Jim, that as your returns improve and you posted a record here in the quarter that, that starts to impede or weigh on your ability to raise price with customers? Or is there a level at which your returns get so high that you have to start thinking about that?", "James R. Young", "Well, I think we're a long ways from that. Here's my point, and you know we spent a lot of time up in Washington talking to members of Congress. I spent time in front of my customers. Here's the key, we just reported the greatest financial in the history of UP in 2011. And we just came out and said, we announced the single largest capital spend in the history of our company. They are connected. And when you think about the replacement cost of assets in the railroad industry, the returns have to grow. And I will tell you if we get into a situation where somebody wants to cap us at the level we're at right now, return of capital, you will see capital shrink. The math is pretty simple. So we're making bets on capital investment today under the assumption that I can continue to grow the return on invested capital. The other thing is provide great service and value to the customer. All those things are important. And I mean I'm not going to kid you, we obviously think about it. But my board has supported me in terms of the capital we're putting in, and I think we have a good story to talk with our customers.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then to follow-up on headcount, you mentioned the high attrition rate still, but hiring to backfill that, and then keep up with growth, although not on a one-for-one. Can you give us any numbers on what the net increase in heads you expect for 2012? Is it 1%, 2%, 3%? What's the net headcount?", "James R. Young", "We came up this year up about 3%, 1,500. We finished about 45,000. Keep in mind though, you got a split -- that 1,500 increase was split about 50/50 between capital, which includes positive train control and OE. So as our cap, you got 2 things that will drive it. Volume will drive the OE number next year, offset by some productivity. It won't be 100% offset, but the capital spend including PTC should grow that. So I would tell you at the end of the year, assuming our economic outlook plays out, you're going to see more people working at railroad this time next year than we did the year earlier.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we're nearing the end of our allotted time for question and answers. And we have time for one final question. That question will be coming from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Maybe a question for Jack. On the Intermodal side, are you getting a little bit of a positive benefit from the faster growth in domestic relative to international? I guess I'm thinking that empty repositioning is a little bit less than the domestic business. And I just wanted to check and see if that was consistent with your kind of view of the business?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, the domestic side, we had a great fourth quarter on the domestic business, record setting, so that was good. It reduces the repositioning. It would be nice to have the stronger international side as well, because there's some nice dovetailing that takes place, particularly, when they stuff the domestic containers on the West Coast. But overall, yes, your assumption is correct.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on weather. I think Jim, you mentioned that the weather wasn't a great impact on the record fourth quarter OR. And I guess I just wanted to kind of make sure I had heard that correctly, because I would've thought that the positive impacts on network fluidity, slow orders, all that kind of fun stuff would have actually kind of, been a benefit in the quarter.", "James R. Young", "Well, I didn't say it was a major driver. Although remember, we were still battling issues in Texas starting in the beginning of the first -- of the fourth quarter when you look at...", "Lance M. Fritz", "The Texas drought didn't really go away until October.", "James R. Young", "Well, my only point is there are a lot of factors that drove the operating ratio in the fourth quarter. The fundamental ones toward -- to me are business, our volume, our pricing and our productivity.", "Operator", "I will now turn the floor back to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments.", "James R. Young", "Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We're looking forward to talking to you again in April. I hope what you see today with our results is the real capability and potential for the UP network. So thanks again for joining us.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski. You may begin.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me in Omaha today are Rob Knight, our CFO; Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and I also want to introduce Eric Butler in his new role as our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales. ", "Now before we get started, I want to quickly thank all of you for the support you've expressed for Jim and his family during this time. I know Jim and the entire company greatly appreciate your thoughts and well-wishes.", "So turning to the quarter, you can see that Union Pacific delivered record financial results across the board this quarter, generating a first quarter earnings milestone of $1.79 per share, an increase of 39% compared to 2011. First quarter record operating revenue, operating income and operating ratio performance drove our improved bottom line results. We're clearly delivering on the benefits of our diverse franchise, even as we saw the current coal headwinds start to build in the quarter. We remain focused on delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that creates value for our customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders. These efforts were recognized with record marks in customer satisfaction and employee safety. So let's get started this morning, and I'll turn it over to Eric Butler.", "Eric L. Butler", "Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start up with a look at customer satisfaction. For the quarter, customer satisfaction came in at 93, a new best-ever mark and up 2 points from first quarter last year. Along the way, we also set a new monthly record as well when he hit 94, both in January and March. We appreciate this continuing recognition from our customers, and our focus in the future is to continue our passion for service and strengthen our value proposition.", "This strong value proposition and strengthening in some markets produced volume growth of 1%, even as a weak coal market drove a large decline in Energy carloadings. If you excluded Energy, our other 5 businesses grew 5% -- grew 4% during the quarter, even with lower demand for grain exports. Note that with a Leap Day this year, buying comparisons got a boost from an extra day of loadings.", "Core price improved 5%, with all 6 businesses posting gains. Those price gains, combined with an increased fuel coverage and some positive mix, resulted in a 12% increase in average revenue per car. Volume growth and the improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 14% to a first quarter record of $4.8 billion.", "Let's take a look at each of the groups in a little more detail and heading off with Energy. Although Energy volume declined 8%, a 14% improvement in average revenue per car produced revenue growth of 5%. We indicated, going into this year, that with a couple of contract losses, growth for the Southern Powder River Basin was expected to be slow to negative. Our expectation was that new business across our Energy portfolio would help offset those losses.", "While business wins and losses play a role, volume decline in our Energy business during the quarter was largely the result of a dramatic weakening of demand for coal, driven by a near-perfect storm of a very mild winter weather and low natural gas prices that, together, lowered electrical use in the U.S. by 4% and electricity generated from coal by 16% during the quarter.", "You could see from the chart on the upper left how softening demand has played out in our weekly coal car loadings, with the volume shortfall growing as the quarter progressed, coming down 19% in March. The most significant impact has been in the Southern Powder River Basin, where tonnage declined for the quarter 8%. The rapidly changing market conditions are reflected in rising coal stockpiles for which the Powder River Basin were an estimated 17 days above normal in February, quite a swing from the level several days below normal as recently as October.", "Colorado/Utah tonnage fared better, declining 3% as strong international demand and new business helped offset the impacts of utility outages, increased use of fuels other than coal by utilities in the Southeast and the mild weather.", "Ag Products revenue grew 6% as an 8% improvement in average revenue per car more than offset a 2% decline in volumes. Ag faces a tough comp against strong export grain volumes through the first half of last year. As expected, with increased world production and higher U.S. corn and wheat prices, our grain exports declined 39% from last year's record first quarter levels.", "Growth in other Ag markets helped to partially offset the weakened exports. Drought damaged crops in the south, and shipments to reopen forward ethanol plants contributed to the increased domestic shipments of grain, which were up 15%.", "Biofuels volume increased 13% as the rising mandate in exports spurned ethanol shipments. Biodiesel growth continued with strong market demand despite last year's expiration of the tax credit.", "Our Food & Refrigerated segment grew 7% with the new business in barley and flour, along with growth in import beer leading the way.", "Automotive volume increased 15% with the combined 10% improvement in average revenue per car, drove up 26% -- drove revenue up 26%. With the nation's vehicles aging and numerous new models available, consumers are driving sales levels higher, with the SARs rate hitting $14.5 million for the quarter, the highest level since first quarter 2008. The industry gains came despite rising gas prices, which appear to be shifting the mix towards more fuel-efficient vehicles, but not deterring overall sales levels. The auto industry's continued momentum translated into 16% growth in our finished vehicle shipments, while parts volume to support the growing production and sales level was up 12%.", "Chemicals volume grew 8%, which, combined with the 7% improvement in average revenue per car, produced a 16% revenue increase. Petroleum products loadings increased 63%, driven primarily by the rapid growth in crude oil shipments, mostly from the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale plays to the UP-served terminals at St. James, Louisiana. A slowly strengthening economy was reflected in improved demand for industrial chemicals, which grew 8%; while plastic shipments increased 4%. Partially offsetting overall strength in Chemicals was the 22% decline in fertilizer, driven by soft potash demand that led to temporary shutdowns or reductions at several mines during the quarter.", "In industrial products, a 10% increase in volume and the 13% improvement in average revenue per car drove revenue growth up 25%. Energy-related drilling continues to drive strength in Industrial Products, with new frac sand origin and destination facilities coming online to support shale development, resulting in 36% growth in nonmetallic minerals. Energy markets, along with the auto industry, were the key drivers of a 14% increase in steel. Favorable weather during the quarter allowed unseasonably high construction activity, boosting rock shipments 16%, and the ramp-up of our iron ore move for export to China drove metallic mineral volume up 48%.", "Construction-related volumes are still well below what we would consider normalized. Once again, this quarter, some of the strength in other segments was offset by a 51% decline in hazardous waste shipments, which have softened as government funded ramped down -- government funding ramped down after the stimulus money ran out.", "Intermodal revenue grew 15% as the 13% improvement in average revenue per car -- average revenue per unit combined with a 1% increase in volume. International Intermodal volume declined 3% with the soft import market and the continued impact of a contract loss, which we won't wrap until May 1. The international volume decline was more than offset by gains in domestic Intermodal, where continued growth in high-rate conversions drove volume up 6%.", "Let me wrap up with a look ahead at 2012. External forecasts for the U.S. economy have improved slightly since the start of the year, but the overall outlook still points to a continued slow recovery. Clearly, the biggest challenge to our growth is the significant weakening of coal demand. With coal stockpiles well above normal, near-term prospects for improvement in the domestic market seem low without unseasonably hot weather or a higher price for natural gas. As a result, coal volumes are expected to be down throughout the year. With normal softening of demand in the mild spring months, our second quarter decline is expected to be in the low to mid-teens. The good news is that our diverse franchise provides a wide range of opportunities for growth that help offset the weakened demand for coal.", "Here's a look at what we see across the other groups. The booming shale Energy market was reflected in the strong growth of our Industrial Products and Chemicals groups during the first quarter, and the opportunity should continue to grow. Shale development and the resulting low natural gas prices also makes U.S. chemical producers more competitive in the global market. This should be good news both in 2012 and in the future.", "Low feedstock prices have been a significant factor in recently announced expansions by U.S. plastics producers. In addition, our fertilizer business and potash production are expected to ramp back up. A number of our construction-related markets also got off to a fast start in Industrial Products, but we'll have to see if that momentum carries over into the construction season.", "Global Insight is up, near full year SARs estimates of 14.2 million vehicles compared to a 13.5 million outlook at the start of the year, which should be good news for our Automotive business. We expect domestic Intermodal growth from continued highway conversions, supported by expected market growth and the pricing and capacity benefits of our Mutual Commitment Program.", "In International Intermodal, we're still cautious and, as a result, only expect slow growth. Ag faces a tough comp, driven by last year's strong export wheat market. But as in the first quarter, they'll look to offset at least most of that shortfall with opportunities in other markets.", "Across all of our businesses, our strong value proposition positions us to win new business and grow with existing customers. Expected increases in volume should combine with price gains to drive revenue growth despite the headwinds in Energy.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thank you, Eric. Starting with safety, our reportable personal injury rate set an all-time record low in the first quarter of 2012, improving 10% from last year. Training, process improvements and capital investments combined to reduce both environmental and behavioral risks. I'm particularly encouraged by a steep reduction in severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact.", "Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments. Our first quarter reportable rate was a record, down 1% from 2011. An increase in derailments caused by grade-crossing accidents and weather was fully offset by a decrease in most other categories, notably those caused by track condition and human factors.", "In public safety, the grade-crossing accident rate was 28% higher than the first quarter of 2011 despite continued focus on community and driver behavior related to grade-crossing safety. I remain confident our activities will result in improvement in this measure as the year progresses. While I'm very pleased to report 2 of 3 safety measures at record lows, our ultimate goal is to eliminate all safety incidents.", "Before we move on to UP's network performance, I want to spend a moment talking about the market shifts we experienced this quarter. We continued to see a shift in traffic mix towards our manifest and premium business, up 5% and 3%, respectively, with most of the growth occurring in the southern region. Pulp volumes declined only 4% as an increase in crude oil unit trains partially offset the 8% decline in coal. We've realigned resources to accommodate these shifting traffic flows.", "Car routings were adjusted to leverage available capacity at terminals, and we modified train starts to maintain fluid operations and increase local service frequency. During the quarter, we also realigned our employee base and our hiring patterns and repositioned about 200 locomotives from our coal network into other parts of the system. Our team leveraged the growing manifest business well, using the UP's excellent route density and terminal infrastructure to generate a 3% improvement in the number of cars switched per employee day. And because our network is a shared resource, the capital investments we're making in the south to support current growth patterns support other service products like grain shipped to the Gulf ports and premium Intermodal to and from Mexico. Our agility is reflected in our network performance measures.", "Starting in the upper left on Slide 16, train size improved with record first quarter manifest and Intermodal train lengths. Intermodal train size grew 2% despite a modest 1% increase in Intermodal volumes compared to 2011. Gross ton-miles per employee declined 1% versus 2011, which includes the productivity headwind of 800 additional employees working on capital projects and PTC. Excluding those employees, GTMs per employee improved about 0.5%, with gains in terminals and train size partially offset by increased manifest in local train starts.", "Moving to the lower left, slow order miles were down almost 30% from last year, which was a best-ever record for any quarter. Our network has significantly improved over the last few years and is in excellent shape. In the lower right, our fuel consumption rate improved by about 2% compared to last year, driven by targeted operating practices, reduced network variability and a rewards program we call, Fuel Masters.", "Overall, our network is operating well. Mild weather contributed to more favorable operating conditions this quarter, but that is not the complete story behind our solid network performance. The operating team demonstrated agility by successfully adapting the T-plan locomotives and crews to a rapid shift in mix towards manifest and the south. In Texas and Louisiana, there has been a complete team effort to effectively utilize the existing infrastructure while we build new capacity.", "In other areas of the network, we took advantage of the warmer climate to continue work on capital projects when we normally would have throttled back, creating a modest headwind to network velocity. Even so, velocity remains in that consistent range of 26-plus miles an hour, increasing 1% compared to last year. Compared to 2010, average speed was essentially flat despite a 5% growth in system 7-Day carload volumes.", "Our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. The local operating teams continued to build the fundamental elements of great service, as reflected by Industry Spot & Pull, which hit an all-time best first quarter at 95%. The first quarter Service Delivery Index, which is a measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, improved from 2011. Even as we meet the challenge of handling a carload surge in the south, we continue to have capacity for growth. We have plenty of network capacity in other parts of the system, with about 600 employees per load and around 800 locomotives in storage.", "To sum it up, we remain positive on our operating outlook for 2012 and our ability to achieve continued network improvements on various fronts. We are well positioned for another record year in safety as we continue to mature our Total Safety Culture, strengthen our relationships with local communities and harden the infrastructure. We continue to provide excellent service, providing customers with a value proposition that will enable growth as the economy recovers. We are well positioned to react to dynamic shifts in volume while generating productivity, and we are investing a record amount of capital to alleviate network constraints across the system on projects that generate attractive returns.", "In summary, we will use the 6 critical operating initiatives, including the UP way, to achieve growth with service excellence.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Before I get started, I'd like to make everyone aware that the 2011 Fact Book will be available tomorrow morning on the Union Pacific website, under the Investors tab.", "So with that, let's start by summarizing our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 14% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.1 billion, driven by core pricing gains, fuel surcharge recoveries, positive mix and volume growth. Operating expense totaled $3.6 billion, increasing 7% compared to last year. Higher fuel prices contributed to over 1/3 of this increase.", "Operating income totaled $1.5 billion, a 33% increase and a best-ever first quarter performance. Other income totaled $16 million, up $1 million compared to 2011. Interest expense of $135 million was down 4% versus last year. Income tax expense increased to $528 million. Higher pretax earnings and a higher income tax rate in 2012 drove the 42% increase.", "Net income totaled $863 million, a first quarter best, up 35% versus 2011. Earnings grew 39% to a first quarter record of $1.79 per share. The outstanding share balance declined 3%, reflecting our share repurchase activity.", "Turning to our top line. Revenue grew 14% to a first quarter record of $4.8 billion. Carloadings drove a 1% increase. And we saw an unusually large positive mix impact, driven by stronger growth in higher average revenue per car move, such as the shale-related shipments versus Intermodal traffic. Fuel surcharge revenue added nearly 5% to our top line growth, driven by higher fuel prices and improved fuel surcharge coverage. Our focus on improving fuel recovery in recently negotiated legacy contracts generated a meaningful step up in fuel recovery, contributing over 1% in freight revenue growth and roughly $0.05 in earnings per share compared to 2011. In addition, we achieved solid core pricing gains of 5%.", "Slide 22 provides more detail on our core pricing and fuel coverage gains for the quarter. As I mentioned, fuel coverage improved this quarter, largely driven by recent legacy negotiations, adding over a full point to revenue growth. Overall, we feel very good about the progress that we've made moving these contracts more to market.", "We also achieved strong core pricing of 5%. However, our pricing gains were somewhat mitigated by declines in coal in International Intermodal volumes this quarter. That said, the combination of solid core pricing and fuel coverage gains reflect the value of Union Pacific's service offerings and contributed to a record profitability this quarter.", "Moving on to the expense side. Slide 23 provides a look at our compensation and benefits expense, which was up 4% compared to 2011. Consistent with our previous guidance, more moderate inflation drove a 2% increase in costs. Workforce levels increased 4% in the quarter compared to 2011. Increased capital activity, including positive train control, contributed about 1/2 of this growth. Base business activity drove the remaining increase, which was also impacted by the mix shift and additional resources that we deployed to the south.", "In 2012, we still anticipate attrition in the 8% to 10% range. We'll continue to hire new employees to backfill for attrition and to support volume growth. Excluding growth on the capital side, we expect workforce levels to increase but not at a one-for-one rate with volume growth.", "Slide 24 shows fuel expense, which totaled $926 million, increasing $100 million versus last year. The average diesel price -- fuel price was $3.23 per gallon, which increased 12% year-over-year. Drivers included the average barrel price of $103, which increased 11%, and a $5-per-barrel increase in the conversion spread. Fuel expense was also up as a result of a 2% increase in gross ton-miles, but this was mostly offset by a 2% improvement in our fuel consumption rate.", "Purchased services and materials expense increased 11% to $526 million, driven in part by higher subsidiary contract expenses. Of course, you need to match the higher subsidiary expense with a 20% growth in subsidiary revenue, which is reflected in the Other revenue line.", "We also saw higher locomotive and freight car repair expense this quarter, driven by increased material usage and inflation costs. Other expenses came in at $216 million, up $28 million, resulting from higher property taxes and personal injury expense.", "As we said in January, the Other expense line will be challenged to 2012 with higher property taxes and personal injury expense. As Lance just showed you, we continued to see improvement in our safety performance, which drove a lower current-year accrual. But remember, our comp was more difficult due to a large favorable prior year adjustment in 2011. Going forward, we expect Other expenses to be in this neighborhood for the remaining quarters of the year, barring any unusual items.", "Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Depreciation expense increased 8% to $427 million, driven by increased capital spending and volume growth. Looking at the full year 2012, we expect depreciation expense to be up around 9% compared to last year. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $296 million, down 2% from 2011. Lower locomotive lease expense was the primary driver due to the early buyout of equipment under long-term leases.", "Bringing it all together, Slide 27 reflects our operating ratio performance, highlighting the improvements in profitability that we've achieved over the last several years. Despite higher fuel prices in the quarter, we achieved a record first quarter operating ratio of 70.5%, improving over 4 points compared to last year's first quarter record. Core pricing gains improved fuel surcharge coverage, and modest volume growth all contributed to this improvement. For 2012, we continue to target a record full year operating ratio performance.", "Union Pacific's record earnings drove strong free cash flow in the first quarter. While cash from operations increased compared to last year, free cash flow was lower due to increased capital spending and a 55% increase in cash dividend payments. And as we discussed in January, we still expect bonus depreciation to be a net benefit to cash flow this year, but it will result in a headwind compared to 2011 due to the catch up of prior years' programs and a 50% bonus depreciation rate in 2012 compared to a 100% rate in 2011.", "Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment grade credit rating. At March 31, 2012, the adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 40.1%.", "Opportunistic share repurchases continue to play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. Union Pacific's increasing returns over the last several years have enabled us to drive greater shareholder value.", "In the first quarter, we bought back 3.9 million shares totaling $433 million, up $185 million compared to last year. Since 2007, we purchased nearly 83 million shares at an average price of around $74. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $720 million to our shareholders in the first quarter of 2012, up more than 65% versus last year. Looking forward, we have 23.9 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.", "That's a recap of our first quarter results. Solid pricing gains, the improved fuel coverage and volume growth drove a 39% increase in earnings. In addition, favorable weather conditions this year and a large fuel headwind in the first quarter of 2011 also contributed to year-over-year earnings growth.", "Looking ahead, we still expect record earnings in 2012, but our quarterly comps will get a little bit tougher, particularly in the second quarter. We expect second quarter earnings to improve sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, but not at the same rate that we saw in the first quarter. And as Eric just discussed, softer coal demand will pose an even greater challenge for us in the second quarter.", "That being said, we still expect volumes to be on the positive side of the ledger for the full year. Continued growth in domestic Intermodal, energy-related shale moves of crude oil, frac sand and pipe in addition to strong Automotive and Chemical shipments should offset the coal decline. Again, this clearly highlights the benefits of our diverse franchise. And our prospects for 2012, supported by Union Pacific's strong value proposition, should allow us to reward our shareholders with even greater returns.", "So with that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thanks, Rob. With the strong first quarter behind us, we are totally focused on the prospects that lie ahead. Although coal volumes remain a challenge, we expect that continued opportunities in other areas of our business are going to allow us to drive financial -- record financial results for the year.", "We're moving forward with our capital investment strategies. We're investing today to strengthen the network and build capacity that will drive improved customer service and shareholder returns for tomorrow. We believe very strongly in the opportunities for growing our financial returns for the future.", "So with that, let's open up the phone and take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Maybe if we can just come back to that comment on the second quarter, I'm sure a lot of people are wondering here. When you said that earnings growth isn't going to be as great as the first quarter, are we thinking on an EPS level? Is that what you're guiding to?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. What I'm saying there is -- yes, on an earnings basis, the rate of improvement won't be as great as the rate of improvement that we saw in the first quarter. However, as I pointed out, we do expect it to be sequentially stronger and still grow year-over-year, which is not quite at the same rate. Again, the main challenge is the coal that we talked about.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then obviously, there's going to be a lot of questions on coal today, and I think I'll open it up with this. But a lot of people are asking, in the West, transportation costs are a much larger piece of delivered cost to utilities. And with gas prices as low as they are, if they stay here for a while, some people are connecting the dots and saying, \"Well, the rails could actually cut the rates to keep coal moving.\" Is that a fair statement? And how would you address that?", "John J. Koraleski", "Brandon, I would tell you that, for the most part, transportation rates are not going to make or break the productivity and the efficiency of coal electric utility generation. If there is a utility that is so close to the edge that the transportation rates are making the difference, we'll probably not going to be in a position of being able to save that utility, nor would we go down that path with our pricing strategies.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Wanted to ask another question on, I guess, the demand side. How much -- on the coal, how much visibility and conviction do you have in that kind of low- to mid-teens decline in second quarter? I think, through first quarter, as you talked about coal, it seemed to get worse at a couple of times when you talked about it. I think you had said down 5, down 7, and it ended up down a little bit more than that. So are you -- you feel like you have good visibility that it's not going to be down more than, say, 15%? And then I don't know if you have any thoughts on second half, how we might look at that as well?", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, at some point in time, Tom, we're predicting the weather here. So that makes it a little bit iffy on our part. When we look at our coal situation right now, here's how we think about it: The gas capabilities in our served territory have already played their cards. So there's not really a lot more opportunity in the utility that we serve to shift anymore production to gas. So that's really running full out at this point in time. We've seen the fall off now in volumes. We think that's going to stay. And so we think that low to mid-teens is probably a fairly solid number. If you have a normal summer, by the time we get to the end of the second quarter, we should start to see our volume kind of pick up and then it will grow in the third and fourth quarter, and you'll start to see overall coal volumes come back. And in the meantime, we think we've got enough upside on our other business, like the shale plays, the Automotive business, the domestic Intermodal side, that, by the time we get to the end of the year, we should still be in positive territory for total volumes.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Let's see. The second question, just in terms of the thinking about margins and incremental margins in second quarter. You had some coal headwind already in first quarter, and you had the 400, over 400 basis points margin improvement. I know you're saying be a little more cautious on a difficult comparison in second quarter. But given the mix of business, I would think your incrementals could still be quite strong in terms of where you're growing in the merchandise network, maybe running longer trains and getting good pricing on that shale-related business. Is that kind of a fair way to look at it to say, all right, be a little careful, but incrementals should still be pretty strong in second quarter?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob, you want to take that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Tom, in the first quarter, let me just kind of set the stage there. You're right, incremental volume were -- margins were outstanding in the first quarter at over 60%, which was driven by all the positives that we spoke about. How it will play out, I would expect that incremental margins will continue to be very positive. Exactly how it will play out will be as dependent as anything on the mix effect. We expect, as Eric walked through, positive strength to continue and things like the new shale-related activities. We expect international -- or excuse me, domestic Intermodal to continue to strengthen. So the mix will play a fact in that. But I would expect that incremental margins will continue to be strong.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Jack, I just wanted to follow up on the first question on coal. I mean, it sounded like you pretty much were saying that you guys wouldn't use price as a way to stimulate growth in volume on the thermal coal side. I mean, is that the way to read that? I mean, it doesn't sound like it makes economic sense for you guys to do that, and I just wanted to follow-up and get clarification there.", "John J. Koraleski", "Again, Justin, you've been with us a long time, and you know that our strategy has been to ensure that every piece of business that moves on our railroad is re-investable. So we're going to continue to go down that path. We don't think the transportation rates -- if you have a utility that is on the edge of economic viability, we don't believe transportation rates is going to save that utility, and it has further implications for us in all of our other customers. So we don't want people trading on the basis of transportation contracts. We want them trading on the basis of their own productivity, efficiency and manufacturing capabilities. So we would stay with my earlier answer.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, that makes a lot of sense. When I look at the 4-week moving average and kind of economically sensitive carloads, if I strip out Ag and coal, it feels like you've seen maybe a little bit of deceleration in growth rates here in April. And I just wanted to see how that jives with what we've seen from some of the other economic data out there. We had extremely strong West Coast port imports in March, and I was wondering if you've seen follow-through in terms of that in your network here in April. Maybe if have any color on whether or not those strong imports were some of the customers getting ahead of steamship line GRIs. I was curious to see if you had any color on what's going on, on that end of things.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay. Eric, you want to take a shot at that?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. As we look at the ramp up in April, clearly, April started off soft from a trend standpoint. Part of that is due to the holiday weekend that we saw. But we are seeing a good ramp up here in the latter part of April, and we feel pretty good about our outlook for the demand and the other businesses, as we've discussed earlier, both the domestic businesses and our opportunities on the import side. So we still are pretty confident looking at our outlook and looking at our current rate and run rate and ramp up.", "John J. Koraleski", "My finance team would tell me that April is historically our lowest month of the year.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Oh, interesting.", "John J. Koraleski", "And we're hoping that's the truth this year, too.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Why don't you ask on the legacy contracts first? What percent of the repricing in '12 is reflected in first quarter? I'm wondering if some of it gets layered in throughout the year or even over the next couple of years. And then can you talk about the timing? I know it's early, but talk about the timing for the contracts in '13. And does the situation in coal, in your mind, kind of limit the upside for future legacy repricings on the coal side?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure, Scott. Eric, you want to take a first shot? And I can help you out if you...", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. As has been said in the past, we expected to see a 1- to 2-point percent benefit from our legacy pricing, and that's what we're seeing this year. Certainly, the volume mix or the volume shortfall in coal and some of the volume shortfall in our International Intermodal business has had a negative impact on our legacy pricing mix. But we are seeing it still in that 1% to 2% range that we had expected. We do not have any layered pricing plans in our late -- in our legacy contracts throughout the year, but we are firmly committed and looking forward to meeting, exceeding the price expectations that we had out there.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "But it sounds like if the coal volumes come back next year, that the impact to the legacy will kind of fill a second leg to that. Is that fair?", "Robert M. Knight", "If I can just add, this is Rob, Scott. As Eric pointed out, yes, if the coal volumes came back. Because what we experienced in the first quarter, both on coal and also on International Intermodal, is some of the repriced business didn't move. So, yes, if that volume came back, that would be a positive for us if that repriced business came back. The other thing I wanted to respond to you, Scott, was your question on the legacy in 2013. The bulk of that is front-end loaded.", "John J. Koraleski", "So again, Scott, if you just think about it, we have one of probably the most conservative assessments of core price. Because if the car doesn't move, regardless of how high we raise the price, we don't get credit for it. And so the core price of 5% is a solid number for us. The mix did hurt us, as everybody pointed out, in terms of coal and International Intermodal, because that is where the bulk of our -- where all of our legacy renewals from last year were housed. So hopefully, we'll see those volumes improve as we get through the year and we'll start to see a greater contribution from. I think the best assessment of it though, the total impact, you just to go back to the operating ratio and see that 70.5 to 4 points of improvement.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Sure. And just second question, it's a newer market for us, so we don't have the history. How should we think about the yields in margins in the frac and the crude oil business relative to the overall book of business?", "John J. Koraleski", "Overall, when you look at the frac sand and the crude oil, it's re-investable. It's at market rates, and we're very, very happy to have as much of it as we can bring on the railroad.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jack and Rob, when we -- when you first gave your long-term guidance on OR, I guess it was in 2010, I think a lot of us on the Street sort of viewed it as being conservative. And you cautioned us at the time and said, \"Listen, these are long-term numbers, and so a lot can change.\" And obviously, natural gas changed. So if natural gas stays at 2, and I know there's a lot of people that'll say, \"Well, that isn't going to be the case,\" but just as an assumption, do you still feel comfortable about that long-term guidance that the coal franchise is materially smaller?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Bill. We're staying with that 65% to 67% operating ratio target, full year operating ratio target by 2015. And you hit the nail in the head. When we gave that guidance, a lot of things have changed. But we have not changed in our conviction, in our commitment. We may get there a different way, and I think we're walking our talk in terms of making the kind of progress we did, even without the benefit of coal in the first quarter with that 4-point improvement. And as I've said all along, and I said this when we set the original 75% target, in the low 70s operating ratio target, we're going to get there as efficiently as we can, as quickly as we can. It's not an endpoint. It's just a next step along the game here. And so we're not changing our conviction. We're going to get there as soon as we can, but we still feel confident about that, even though it may come in a different way.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, good. Good. The other question that comes up a fair amount is just trying to understand the dynamics of take or pay contracts in the coal industry. I mean, that is, sorry, for you guys on the utility side for coal. So first of all, do you have any utilities sort of paying you for sort of take or pay, i.e., they're not taking the coal but they're paying anyway? Is that something that happens now? How did that manifest itself? And when we see these -- when we see these sort of announcements of cuts from coal mines like BTU today, do we have to take that into account when we think about your volumes? Is that sort of a leading indicator or a lagging indicator?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "We do have a small percent of our coal customers that are running at minimums, but it's a very small percent of our coal customers that are doing that. So we typically don't have a large portion of take or pay contracts.", "John J. Koraleski", "So we have customers that are operating at their minimum, but they're not falling below and then paying us the economic penalty.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So when we see a mine is announcing cuts because they expect lower shipments, does that -- how does that play out for you? Is that an indicator we need to keep in mind? Or are your volumes already ahead of what they're cutting?", "John J. Koraleski", "I think our volumes are already ahead of what they're cutting. And customers, many times, have multiple mine sources, so they can move between mines.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wonder if you could give a little bit more color on the negative mix impact within the legacy business, just looking at kind of the year-over-year core price build. Just want to get a rough sense if you can, kind of what that impact was, the softening on the growth there?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure, Chris. Rob, you want to handle that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. And again, just to make sure everybody's following what Chris is asking, the way we calculate price, and I would say, again, the financial organization, our conservative looks at it, it's all in yield, and we calculate it across our entire book of business. So as Jack pointed out, if something doesn't move, it doesn't get counted, obviously. And also, what doesn't get counted in our price is if there's new business that comes on board, which we've seen a lot of that. So you see that positive mix in our operating ratio, but you don't see that in the price. But specific to your question on the negative impact that we saw in the first quarter from price, I would say it was about 0.5 point. And what that is, is a result of the repriced, mostly coal and International Intermodal business that made up the bulk of that billion dollar legacy end of fourth -- or end of 2011, beginning in 2012 that we talked about. That did not move. So the volume wasn't there, we didn't get credit for it in the way we calculated the price. And that was about 0.5 point, if you will, from a core price impact.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And did the delta between that and the 3 percentage points of mix, favorable mix, is, to your point, the new business that's coming on, which is likely the crude-by-rail, frac sand, those kinds of things, which are coming in at a higher revenue per carload?", "Robert M. Knight", "Chris, that's exactly right. The other thing I would point out that was a real plus in -- shows up in our operating ratio improvement, but also shows up in our legacy renewal success is the improvement in our fuel recovery mechanism. We're still not where we want to be as a company. We're not going to be at 100% until we finish off all of the legacy renewals. But we did make a nice step forward with improving our lot and recovering fuel.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the headcount side. Just want to get a sense roughly, assuming we hit your target for coal in the low to mid-teens for the second quarter and we see how it plays out going forward. But how do you think about kind of headcount and where your staffed? I mean, should it be basically flat from where we are as average employee per quarter going forward? Or do you think you need to do anymore furloughing or anything like that going forward?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "I'll kind of address the overall, and there's a mix impact here, as Lance pointed out, in terms of the growth in the south versus less growth in the other parts of the region. So we're dealing with that, and Lance and his team are addressing that. But at a macro level, just reiterating, we would expect that headcount will grow with volume. So with volumes on the positive side of the ledger, which we expect it will be for the full year, we would expect headcount to actually be up net-net as a result of the hiring that we will do for both attrition and hiring for growth, but not at a one-for-one level. In addition to that, headcount likely will grow as we continue to increase our capital spending, which is again a $3.6 billion spend this year and the impact of positive train control. So net-net, I would expect that if volume plays out the way we expect it to on the positive side of the ledger, that headcount would be exactly up.", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance, you and your team have been working at those headcount levels and kind of making adjustments as we see volume changes. Do you have anything to add do that?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, sure. So we're at a furlough number of about 600 right now, something like that. And we have been adjusting both our hiring and our existing headcount numbers. I expect those will continue to adjust. I think hiring is, of course, going to be pretty healthy for mostly attrition, and mix is going to be driving some of that headcount decision as well as we see manifest absorbing more of the business and requiring more headcount than some of the coal business, for instance.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. It's fair to assume that you're going to have a slightly higher headcount per carload because of that mix shift that we're seeing into manifest?", "John J. Koraleski", "That's fair.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "The first question I wanted to ask was on International intermodal. You're still striking a fairly cautious tone there, so I wonder if you could just give us a bit more color on what you're hearing from customers? And comment on the potential for East Coast labor negotiations to influence flows to the West Coast?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Well, as you know, we have a tough comp in the first quarter, first half of this year. Intermodal volumes -- International Intermodal volumes last year were very strong, and they're off compared to last year. And then we also have a tough comp throughout the first half of the year with the contract loss that we discussed in the past. So we have those 2 factors that are putting some caution in our outlook for some early part of this year. In terms of your question about East Coast issues, there are a lot of factors that impact whether a steamship carrier decides to land on the West Coast and use a land bridge or go through the East Coast. We think that our value proposition and the strength of our franchise still allows the West Coast option land bridge to be a very strong option, and we still see a very competitive outlook in our business from that factor, vis-a-vis East Coast ports.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "And in terms of your crude business, obviously it's still probably a small fraction of the business, but a lot of interest in just how big that might be. Just wondering if you could quantify that and talk about how that may grow over the short term and what the constraints are there. Is it terminal capacity? Is it tank cars? If you could just elaborate a bit.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, I'll give you just a couple of benchmark points for you. Last year, our shale crude oil was about 3,900 carloads. And in the first quarter this year, it was 20,400. So that's order of magnitude, just kind of where we saw the volume growth. We think it's going to continue to grow as we go through the year. We were something like 26 trains, as I recall, last September, 72 trains in March, moving forward to 100 and beyond that as we go through the year. So it's growing nicely for us.", "Lance M. Fritz", "And Jack, you can see the constraints, if any. It's basically being paced right now by facilities.", "John J. Koraleski", "Right.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "Meaning the terminals?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, meaning the terminals. There was a press release yesterday or the day before, that our partner, US Development, down at St. James, just opened up, added capacity that will allow 2 trains a day. So as we talked earlier about some of the ramp up we're seeing here, April and beyond, that's kind of a good news piece of the factor for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So earlier, you talked about how you're still committed to getting to the 65% to 67% OR, even if PRB does go into secular decline, and there other things that you can do. Are there a few things that you point to? What actions, what changes would you make to the network in order to continue to improve the OR if that business does continue to shrink from here?", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure, yes, let's get started. So let's say coal does shrink over the long run going forward. Well, some of the first things we do is we reallocate resources, we right size the business, which we have been doing in the first quarter. We'll continue to do. On the upside of productivity, as we've talked about before, we've got just a target-rich environment for improvement, whether it's train size improvement, process improvement in terminals, process improvement over the road and the benefits, the productivity benefits of our capital spend. So we've got ample opportunity in the operating side to continue to improve productivity and efficiency.", "Robert M. Knight", "If I can just add to that, in addition to all the operating ships and improvements that Lance just walked through at a macro level, what will continue to also drive our operating ratio improvement are: continue to focus on adding the capacity and the changes that Lance talked about; providing great service to our customers, which enables us to continue to get price in the marketplace; continue to improve our surcharge recovery mechanisms. All of that adds up into our operating ratio target.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "But is there capital that you typically would allocate to the coal business that you might reallocate to other businesses in order to get those productivity improvements or the benefits? Because I would suspect that you would be doing these productivity benefits regardless of whether coal is growing or not growing. And so is it redeploying the resources to other parts of the business so those businesses can grow faster than what they would do in a base case scenario?", "John J. Koraleski", "For sure, reallocation of fungible assets happens, and that will benefit, as Rob mentioned, both growth rates and service. And from the standpoint of capital, in the current outlook, there's just not a lot of capital that we've got planned for coal-specific operations. I mean, I just don't think there's a lot of adjustment there.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then a quick follow-up. You talked about inflation moderating. If the contracts are all structured as inflation plus, does that mean that, that core pricing, at least nominally, will start to level off or maybe come down a little bit as the year progresses? Of course, maintaining a positive spread. But does the headline number start to come down a bit?", "John J. Koraleski", "I really don't see that happening, Peter. Rob, do you have any...", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, I would just add that -- Peter, while we've talked about sort of our general view of inflation plus sort of philosophy, it's not like the contract spells out inflation plus in the terms of the contract. So the fact that inflation is high one year like it was last year, and as we pointed out in the Labor line alone, last year, inflation was in the 4% to 5% range. This quarter, we turned in 2%. We expect the full year to be somewhere in the 2.5% range. We are not -- that does not impact our pricing decisions that we're making currently.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse Group.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "A couple of follow-up items on coal and then one other, just your comment about low to mid-teens volume growth. Does that assume that weather gets better? Because currently, it's running down in kind of the high teens. So how do you get there? It looks like once we get into the second half of the quarter, the comps start to get quite a bit harder, too.", "Eric L. Butler", "As Jack said earlier, we're not capable of predicting the weather, but our assumption is that we're going to have a normal outlook for the second quarter. Again, second quarter is typically a shelf month where there is a normal downturn in the second quarter, just because of the mild weather. But we're expecting a -- our low to mid-teens outlook assumes normal weather patterns.", "Robert M. Knight", "If I can just make one comment on that. Remember, and Eric showed it on his slide earlier, that there was a little bit of uniqueness in terms of the comps last year. Remember, we had the flood last year that hit in the second quarter, then we came out of that strong, and it strengthened throughout the balance of the year. So just keep in mind, as you look year-over-year, that there was that unusual activity last year.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Right. And second, you've commented on this a couple of times, about pricing in the market and staying the course. But to the extent that pricing is market-based, some of your -- or your main competitor in the West has made some public comments about trying to work with customers and lowering price. Does that not factor into your plans on pricing?", "John J. Koraleski", "Chris, our commitment is to make every carload on this railroad re-investible over time and get to that level. And if we can't achieve those kinds, where we can re-invest in the locomotives, the track capacity and things like that, we will probably pass on the business.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just one housekeeping one. The other revenue was up pretty strongly, and you did make a comment about some liquidated damages. Is that where that would show up?", "Robert M. Knight", "No, that's not what that is, Chris. The driver of the other revenue was relatively small, but our subsidiary rev, what we call subsidiary revenue, was up nicely this quarter for us. Not anything to do with any kind of liquidated damages discussion.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "You talked a bit about your coal contracts. Rob, are you seeing any kind of minimum commitments decrease in the renewed contracts that can dramatically lower the kind of commitment of those utilities to obtaining coal?", "John J. Koraleski", "Ken, why don't we let Eric have a shot at that?", "Eric L. Butler", "No, no, no. We don't see that. As I mentioned earlier, a very small percent of our coal customers currently are operating at their minimum commitments, and we don't see any contract changes in the future that would address that or lower that.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So as you went through the negotiations at the end of last year, as they were seeing the low nat gas prices, you didn't see a kind of sizable push to get those minimums reduced?", "Eric L. Butler", "We did not have any significant contract changes that we implemented.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's encouraging. And a follow-up would be kind of, I guess, if you can maybe just walk through how much the weather aided your kind of costs when you think about operations that -- maybe that's a Lance question in terms of the quarter, just what kind of tougher comps do you anticipate if we were to have a normal weather come next year, just as we move forward through the year?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure, Ken. Now you know we're used to operating outside, so the weather did have some favorable impact, right, where we're typically going to spend on snow removal or, perhaps, face some tough operating conditions during very inclement weather. We didn't have much of that repeat across the system the first quarter this year. That's really kind of minor in the grand scheme of things. What I would have much preferred is a cold winter and good coal demand, and I would have traded that in a heartbeat.", "John J. Koraleski", "Amen.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "First question here is a follow-up on the Intermodel question on the International Intermodal. Rather than discuss your demand, can you talk a little bit about the market share on your -- on the ports you serve? It seems that we could see some shifts into Canadian northern ports, especially -- even into Mexico. Are you seeing that occur? And could you also tie that into your view on Panama when that starts to fully open up and what that could mean to your International Intermodal franchise?", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay. Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, that's -- well, that's a good question. Certainly, from a Canadian standpoint, everyone's familiar with Prince Rupert. And Prince Rupert is certainly looking to position itself as an alternative port. And if you look at the U.S. West Coast ports, particularly the Port of L.A. Long Beach, that is, and we foresee for the foreseeable future, to be the predominant port for imports onto the West Coast from a value standpoint, from a cost standpoint, from a productivity standpoint, from a size standpoint. And we don't really see a lot of risk to that, the Port of L.A. Long Beach position or the other U.S. West Coast ports. Certainly, there are ports in Mexico that are also attempting to position themselves as options, but we really don't see that. ", "In terms of the Panama Canal, lots of points of view out there. I think some of the experts would suggest that if you look at the expense of the Canal and what is already happening with the Canal fees, if you look at the fact that there are not many current U.S. East Coast ports that could handle the larger ships, and there would be an expense that would be required to do dredging and decks expansion to handle those ships, we think the Canal might have a minor impact. I think the market numbers today, roughly about 30% of the freight goes all water. That may increase a couple of percentage points as you look at the opening of the Panama Canal. But we're not expecting it to be, at this point in time, a significant impact on our going-forward strategic plans.", "John J. Koraleski", "The key thing for us, Walter, as Eric said, we haven't seen that shift taking place. And one of the reasons is because we are doing everything we possibly can to deliver great service to our customers. And as long as our service package is excellent and stays excellent, that's our best defense. It's our best defense against port shifting on the West Coast, it's also our best defense against a new port capacity in Mexico, although we may actually benefit from that, I guess, depending on which port it would come across in the border. But also, the shift to the Panama Canal. That's largely -- we can influence that greatly by the kind of service, and we are up to that challenge.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That's great color. I appreciate that. And keeping on the port theme here, if I remember correctly, your last investor day, there was -- you were eluding a little bit to the potential for coal port expansion that you would be able to service but weren't in a position at that time to really elaborate on it. Can you give us any update on that if you can?", "John J. Koraleski", "Right now -- so the one that we were probably most excited about was the one up in Longview, Washington. That's kind of run afoul of some of the EPA concerns. We're actually kind of watching that whole decision for the EPA to be kind of taking a more broad or blanket look at potential environmental situations. But certainly, the one at Longview was important us. We've been moving quite a bit of export coal now down through Houston, and we think there's some additional capacity there. We've been working with mines and the Ferromex railroad and looking at the Port of Guaymas down in Mexico. All of those things are still in play. The newly added challenge or wrinkle for us is what happens with the EPA reviews.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. To add to what Jack said, I think the current list of proposed projects, some of which multi-year duration and all of which, certainly, will be subject to various environmental, permitting review processes, but -- the list of projects really would expand export coal capacity to over 100 million tons annually. That's a huge number.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think you nailed it on the head there with the -- the permitting is being a big problem. But if that can go through, you could see a lot of opening capacity. Just a final, here, clarification. You mentioned if you get a good, nice, warm summer, you could see growth in the back half. Did you mean growth sequentially? Or growth year-over-year in your coal shipments?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sequentially.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "First, Jim, if you're listening, hang in there. We're all pulling for you. Back to business. I promise, no coal questions from me. I think that's been beaten to death here, and I think you guys will be probably happy with that as well. I want to actually turn back to one of your responses to a question. You mentioned that some of the potential new ports in Mexico that you might be able to win some of that business, I'm assuming you're talking about APM's expansion down there in L\u00e1zaro. Are you guys in talks with them? Is there a big opportunity to start bringing some of that business into the U.S. through your Mexican ports? And then I have a follow-on in a different segment.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, I think most of those comments were referred to the ports on the west coast of Mexico. We are actually having in-depth conversations with a number of port officials and with our partner railroads in Mexico, to look at product and service offerings, both export and import and not just Intermodal, but also bulk products, export and import in a variety of ports down there. So we think there is some upside. There are some capacity things we're working through, but we believe there is an upside.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Does that bulk include coal?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, that includes coal. Coal and other exports, yes.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "My last question is also going to be in response. You said there were no capacity constraints for your crude-to-rail projects, which I found interesting. Everyone I seem to talk to right now can't seem to find any tank cars, and I'm even including some of the larger shippers out there as well. Is this just because there's enough tank cars on backorder that you expect to come through for the remainder of the year? And then maybe if you could just touch on sort of hopper car demand right now and where we sit with that compared for frac sand?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. I'm not sure we said there were no capacity constraints. Lance will talk a little bit about our principal capacity. There are significant -- perhaps a record number of tank cars coming online, as you may know. I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but there is almost a record number of tank cars. So that it a significant investment that customers are making, third parties are making. And I think enough tank cars will be coming online to align with the demand that is out there. There's also significant investment in covered hoppers that are coming online that handle the drilling materials for -- like frac sand for the drilling market. So I think the car -- there's some headwinds there, but there are enough cars coming online to address the capacity issues, I think, over the midterm. In terms of the physical capacity issues, I'm going to let Lance address that.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. Jason, you might be referring to -- I think what we said was the volume on crude was largely being throttled by destination facilities. But that's not to say that there aren't other capacity constraints or challenges. On the railroad side, we're largely overcoming those with incremental resources, and we're building capacity rapidly as we speak.", "Robert M. Knight", "If I can just add? Yes. Jason, you probably know this, but the investment in the tank car itself is not our investment. That's the investment of the producer, of course. Yes.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "So in other words, I guess, the way I should read this is there might be some maybe near-term potential constraints, but you guys are helping improve throughput, which will help run existing equipment that's out there right now. And as we move throughout the year on the crude-to-rail, the stuff that's on backlog right now that's coming in the market should help alleviate some of the constraints that are out there?", "John J. Koraleski", "Absolutely. And we have very, very excellent cooperation with our customers. I mean, it's not just us. It takes the entire team, the customers, the destination facilities, the railroad, everybody working together to keep this thing moving on a fluid basis. And it's very, very heartwarming to see it happen.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna International Group.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just give an updated sense of the landscape on pending and existing EPA regulations. It certainly seems to be a problem, more localized for Appalachian production. But to the extent there might be potential risks as you it or as identified in your network, maybe you could shed some light on that? And then I think, more importantly, are you still getting inquiry from either southeast utilities, new utilities in the East or even increased inquiry from Asian-based coal buyers about thermal coal in the PRB and what those opportunities might be; have they picked up? Are they about the same? Are they less than they were a year ago?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure, Matt. Overall, the EPA, we're just all over that. We're working with the utilities, with the mines and watching very carefully as to what might happen with the EPA reviews and those kinds of things. So I don't know that we could add any particular insight at this point in time, other than we're watching carefully, doing the things that we can to support our coal customers in the coal industry. And moving forward, it's a lot of jobs for this country. It's a lot of opportunity for us and for our shareholders, and we don't want to see that go astray. In terms of the contacts on export, Eric, do you want to talk about what's happening?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So I mentioned earlier the port development projects that we referred to in the West Coast and also in Mexico, those are really being driven by the inquiries for coal for -- [ph] coal for Asia. So we are still seeing a significant amount of potential demand for export coal.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Right. But I mean, if I look at the list of proposed projects, be it the Millennium Bulk, Port of Morrow, Port of St. Helens, Grays Harbor, Port of Coos, Pacific Terminal, the list hasn't changed. Some of the permitting -- we've gone from 200 to 400 to 500 tons -- excuse me, 20, 40, 50 tons at some. So the permitting seems to be going in the right direction. I'm just wondering, has there been a cooling from the folks that actually will consume the coal, not actually have to build the terminal on the other side of the Pacific or in the Southeast. Or is the dialogue consistent, i.e., are people looking past this year in coal?", "Eric L. Butler", "We have not seen any cooling, and I would say, perhaps, the opposite. We've seen some real time higher level of interest for export coal out of Mexican ports that do not seem to have the same permitting process requirements, perhaps, that we have in the Pacific Northwest ports.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman, Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick -- a couple of detailed questions. On your coal franchise, can you give me an idea what the length of haul on the utility businesses is this year versus last year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "I don't think there's a substantial significant difference in length of haul this year versus last year.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. How does your length of haul compare in your coal franchise out of PRB relative to the Bakken franchise? Because you mentioned that, that is offsetting some of the bulk business to some degree. I just want to get a sense of difference in distance.", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "I can probably answer that. It's in the ballpark, on average. In a normal demand scenario, coal might be marginally longer.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes. I would say coal is probably longer. We're -- the interchanges for us on the crude oil out of the Bakken would be Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, St. Paul. So -- and then you would add beyond that the coal. So I would say, the oil transfer, a little shorter in terms of length of haul. Maybe 100, a couple of hundred miles max.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "All right. And just what is the domestic utility length of haul across your network right now?", "Lance M. Fritz", "I mean, we can get back with an answer on that. Historically, it's in the 900 to 1,000 miles.", "John J. Koraleski", "I would have told you 1,000 miles would be my best guess, but we could clarify that. We could have Michelle or someone.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Vernon of Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Within Industrial Products, can you talk a little bit about how the mix change within that might have affected the average revenue per car that was reported? It was a very strong number for the segment.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay. Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. Industrial Products had very, very strong growth in terms of the drilling-related things as we [indiscernible] as we mentioned. So frac sand, steel. Very, very strong growth. Moderate growth in some of the other base of construction products like our rock business, our lumber business. And we actually saw a significant decline in volume, as I referred to in some of our hazardous waste business. We had a very short-haul contract that we've talked about in the past where the stimulus funding ran out, and so there was a significant reduction in that business.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one short follow-up. In terms of pulling forward CapEx, Rob, are you -- are we going to keep the same guidance for the full year?", "Robert M. Knight", "We are. $3.6 billion. No change.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tyler Brown of Raymond James.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I had just a question on your crude-by-rail franchise. Have you guys really seen any noticeable change in the interest for rail transportation, given kind of the Seaway reversal and the potential of a WTI Brent spread narrowing? And do -- or do you think that those rail transportation decisions really are made just given a simple lack of pipe capacity in place such as the Bakken?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric.", "Eric L. Butler", "We are still seeing a strong interest in crude-by-rail. And one of the things that we have seen is that we are providing a very strong value proposition, not only in terms of the value in terms of cost, but also the time. There's some assessment that suggests crude by rail is faster to market and certainly has the ability to change markets vis-a-vis crude by pipeline. We do not forever foresee taking over the haul market, but we do see, for a long-term play, the opportunity to have markets move crude by rail, as long as we continue our value proposition.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So you think there is a pretty good longevity to this business?", "Robert M. Knight", "That's our assessment.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Rob, I just have a quick cash flow modeling question, but can you help us bracket the magnitude of the bonus depreciation step down this year? And then would it also step down again in 2013 if it goes to 0?", "Robert M. Knight", "Let me take the second part of that first. Yes, it would continue to step down as it goes to 0 because you got to pay back a portion of the prior years and, of course, the current year fall off. I think the order of magnitude of the change is in the couple of hundred million range year-over-year.", "Operator", "Our final question today is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Impressive 60% incremental margins. Noting train length improved even with velocity and service both up, I wanted to ask, can you envision Intermodal trains longer than 170 units or manifest longer than about 90 cars? Can this be accomplished without compromising speed?", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, both can be. Again, we -- typically, when we respond to train size questions, we remind you that it's very specific by quarter. But there is equal opportunity on both and without any negative impact on service parameters.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And at the present business level, can you speak broadly, and I recognize this is going to be lane-by-lane, but -- about the relationship of train starts and incremental volume? That is, can crew starts move in line with volume additions? Or will be there -- or will there be an opportunity to improve or maintain the current incremental margin?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, we can all -- I'm going to speak to the train starts as volume increases. We always have the opportunity to leverage volume through train starts via size and with key plan changes. Mix does have an impact, but in the global sense, as we grow, we would expect we should be able to generate some productivity out of train starts.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. Clearly, our 150th anniversary year is off to a great start. We do have some challenges ahead as we manage through a soft coal environment, but our franchise diversity has given us a lot of opportunities to help us do just that. So we're going to keep doing what we know how to do: We're going to stay agile in a changing environment, we're going to stay focused on providing great service for our customers, and we're going to continue to improve returns for our shareholders. And we look forward to being back with you again in July, at the end of another strong quarter for Union Pacific. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski. You may begin.", "John J. Koraleski", "Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me here in Omaha today are Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Union Pacific achieved an all-time record quarter, generating an earnings milestone of $2.10 per share, an increase of 32% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Best-ever quarterly operating revenue and operating income drove our record operating ratio performance and bottom line results. We're clearly delivering on the strength of our diverse franchise. Volume growth across many of our market sectors allowed us to offset the 17% decline in coal volumes.", "When combined with solid pricing, efficient network operations and continued productivity gains, the net result was our best-ever quarter by nearly every financial measure. We're continuing to focus on providing safe, efficient, high-quality service that creates value for our customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders.", "So with that, we'll get started this morning. I'll turn it over to Eric.", "Eric L. Butler", "Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 93 for the quarter. That's 1 point better than a year ago, and it matches the record we set in the first quarter this year. We appreciate this recognition from our customers and we're committed to continuing to provide them a strong value proposition.", "Second quarter volume was a little better than flat against last year, as strong growth in Automotive and Chemicals and solid gains in Industrial Products and Intermodal were offset by continued weakness in coal. Excluding the impact of coal, combined volume in the other 5 groups grew 5%, despite a softer ag export market.", "Core pricing improved 4.5%. All 6 groups posted gains, but the overall improvement was impacted again this quarter by the fall-off in coal volume, where much of our legacy repricing has occurred. The improved pricing, along with about 2% from increased fuel surcharge revenue, resulted in a 6% improvement in average revenue per car. Together, the slight increase in volume and improved average revenue per car resulted in the 7% increase in freight revenue to a record $4.9 billion.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Let's start with Coal, which we used to report as Energy. To avoid confusion with the fast-growing shale energy markets that are driving growth in Chemicals and Industrial Products, and other energy markets from wind to ethanol, going forward we're going to call this group Coal. This is just a renaming of the old Energy line of business. There is no change in what's included in the results.", "In the second quarter, Coal revenue declined 9%, as the 10% improvement in average revenue per car wasn't enough to overcome the 17% drop in volume. Coal demand remained weak, as historically low natural gas prices reduced coal's share of electricity generation and mild winter weather sent coal stockpiles soaring. Powder River Basin stockpiles are estimated to have grown 70% from their low point last August, swinging from 7 days below normal at that time to nearly 20 days above -- 24 days above normal this April, before dropping back some in the past 2 months.", "The tough market conditions and the ongoing impact of a couple of contract losses last year led to an 18% decline in Southern Powder River Basin tonnage. Colorado/Utah tonnage grew 4%, overcoming the weak domestic demand with a 135% increase in export tons. Seasonal strengthening boosted overall coal volumes toward the end of the quarter and the recent upward movement in natural gas prices has been an encouraging trend, but the chart in the upper left shows we're still tracking well below last year and the comps get tougher in the second half.", "Ag Products revenue was up 1%, as volume declined 2%, but average revenue per car improved 2% despite the negative mix impact. With improved world supply, grain exports have declined as expected, down 32% from last year's strong volumes. Reduced U.S. soybean crush drove a 6% decline in soybean meal shipment. DDGs declined 13% as more product was fed locally, reducing rail demand, and lower gasoline consumption was reflected in the 3% reduction in ethanol volumes. Partially offsetting those declines was an 8% growth in domestic grain shipments and a 3% growth in Food & Refrigerated carloads.", "Automotive shipments grew 13%, which combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car, drove a 25% increase in revenue. As a reminder, last year's results were softened somewhat by the impact of the disaster in Japan on the Automotive supply chain. With Global Insight's current full year forecast at 14.2 million vehicles, the Automotive industry's continued recovery was reflected in solid year-over-year growth in sales. Improved credit availability is releasing pent-up demand to replace aging vehicles with new, more fuel-efficient and technologically equipped vehicles. For the UP, that translated into 14% growth in finished vehicle carloadings, while parts shipments grew 17%.", "Chemicals revenue grew 14%, as a 12% volume increase combined with a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Petroleum shipments increased 92%, driven by continued growth in crude oil shipments originated in the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale plays and moving to UP-served terminals at St. James, Louisiana and Galveston and Houston in Texas. Plastics volume was up 7%, with increased demand and new business. Industrial chemicals, LPG and most other Chemicals segments also posted gains. However, fertilizer was an exception, with volume down 15%, as demand for potash remained soft. The decline in fertilizer also had a negative impact on average revenue per car.", "Industrial Products grew 6%, which, combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car, produced a 14% revenue increase. UP's franchise is well-positioned to link new sand origins in the upper Midwest to new destination facilities in the oil-rich shale plays. Combine that with the continued conversion of rigs from vertical to horizontal drilling technology, now sand carloads continue to grow even as overall drilling activity was flat, driving a 28% increase in nonmetallic mineral shipments. Increased demand for rock into the Eagle Ford Shale play, along with increased construction activity in the Houston area, led to an 18% growth in rock traffic and an 8% increase in cement. As housing starts climbed, lumber carloadings increased 8% to their highest level since 2008, although they are still well below prerecession volumes.", "Offsetting some of the strength in Industrial Products markets was a 55% or 11,600-unit decline in hazardous waste, as ramp-down of government funding has impacted our uranium tailings business in Utah.", "Intermodal revenue grew 10%, as 3% growth in volume combined with a 7% improvement in average revenue per unit. Although the pace of recovery is slow, continued strengthening of the economy drove international Intermodal volume up 3%. Growth was dampened slightly by the continued impact of the contract loss last year, the effect of which we finally wrapped at the beginning of May. Continued success in converting highway business to rail drove 3% growth in domestic Intermodal.", "That wraps up the second quarter, so let's take a look ahead at what we see for the second half of 2012. Our current outlook is for the economy to continue its slow improvement, although that's far from certain with ongoing problems in the Eurozone and fast approaching U.S. budget and tax policy challenges. No matter what the economy does, we'll continue to focus on our strong value proposition, attracting new customers and supporting our existing customers as they continue to work to grow their business.", "Clearly, continued weakness in Coal presents a sizable challenge as we look at the rest of the year. While seasonal strengthening of coal shipments is already driving a stronger run rate sequentially, against the tougher comp, the third quarter volume decline is expected to be in the low to mid-teens. In ag, the prolonged and widespread drought conditions have moderated our earlier optimism about opportunities with the fall's harvest. Recent corn yield estimates have dropped back to last year's levels, likely eliminating any upside potential. World demand for U.S. soybeans still looks strong for the fall.", "The good news is for -- our diverse franchise gives us a wide range of opportunities to offset the challenges and drive growth. The biggest of those opportunities is continued strength in shale energy, delivering inbound materials as well as outbound crude oil. While the slowdown in natural gas drilling and the slower-than-expected ramp-up of customer facilities has shale energy-related carloads a little off their expected pace, we still expect it to contribute about 2 points to overall growth for the year.", "Shale energy will continue to be the largest growth driver in Industrial Products and Chemicals, with other segments of those 2 businesses expected to continue as they did in the first half. Forecasted improvement in housing starts and growth in nonresidential construction in the South should boost lumber, rock and cement in Industrial Products. While global markets may challenge some chemical manufacturers, low-cost feedstocks are keeping U.S. plants competitive, and facility expansions also provide us with opportunities. We anticipate strength in plastics will continue and industrial chemicals should track with the economy. We expect continued success converting highway business in domestic Intermodal and international Intermodal should pick up, tracking ahead of last year, as a slowing-growing economy is expected to produce a positive but somewhat muted peak season.", "Auto manufacturers expect sales growth to continue and that should be good for our finished vehicles and auto parts business. Put that all together and we expect to overcome the challenges in Coal, with the anticipated volume growth combining with price gains to drive revenue growth.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thanks, Eric. And good morning.", "Starting with safety. For the year-to-date period, we came very close to achieving an all-time record performance in our reportable personal injury rate. The second quarter reportable rate increased 9% compared to 2011, offsetting the year-over-year improvement in the first quarter. More importantly, a fatal incident that occurred in Goodwell, Oklahoma at the end of June took the lives of 3 Union Pacific employees. It was a terrible reminder of how unforgiving our industry can be, and it underscores why we are relentless in pursuing the goal of 0 safety incidents.", "With respect to rail equipment incidents to derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate improved 4%, and we are even more favorable in including all derailments, not those meeting -- not just those meeting the FRA reportable threshold. In public safety, the grade-crossing incident rate increased 22% in the year-to-date period, continuing the trend we saw in the first quarter. The combined effects of our robust growth in the South, which has a higher grade-crossing density than our overall network, and growth in commercial traffic has increased our grade-crossing accident exposure. We continue to focus on community support and driver behavior to address this increased risk.", "Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient, and as a result, our network remains fluid and is operating at very efficient levels.", "Weather was friendlier to our operation in the second quarter compared to last year, which helped, but that wasn't the whole story. In addition to milder weather, the operating team adapted the T-plan, locomotives and crews to manage ships and mix from Coal to growing manifest and premium volumes in the South. In Texas and Louisiana, we are effectively utilizing the existing infrastructure while we build new capacity, which I'll talk more about in a minute. As a result, velocity improved 2% to 26.6 miles per hour. Compared to 20 -- 2010, average speed was up 1% despite a 4% growth in our 7-Day volumes.", "Our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. The local operating teams continue to provide great service as reflected by Industry Spot & Pull, which tied an all-time quarterly record of 95%. The second quarter Service Delivery Index, a measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, also improved from 2011 levels.", "While the UP team is successfully managing the continued carload surge in the South, we continue to have capacity for growth in other parts of the system, with about 420 employees furloughed and around 900 locomotives in storage.", "Moving on to network productivity. Slow order miles were down over 20% from last year, which was a second quarter record for us. Our network is in excellent shape, reflecting our investment in replacement capital.", "Moving to the upper right, our car utilization metric improved year-over-year and reflects the improvement in network velocity and fluidity. In the lower left, gross ton-miles per employee declined 4% versus 2011, which includes the headwind of 700 additional employees working on capital projects and positive train control, driving about half the decrease. It also reflects the 17% decline in coal volumes, which is one of our heaviest commodities. Increased premium and manifest traffic, including local train starts, also amassed productivity gains.", "While not shown on the graph here, productivity gains were also achieved on the Intermodal side, as train lengths grew to an all-time quarterly record of 173 boxes per train, improving 3% on a 3% increase in Intermodal volumes compared to 2011. Lastly, our team is leveraging the robust volume growth in the South, using UP's extensive terminal infrastructure to generate a 1% improvement in the number of cars switched per employee day.", "To expand a bit more on the progress we're making in the South, second quarter volumes in the South were up 7% versus last year and up 6% from first quarter levels. In fact, we're pretty much back to prerecession volumes.", "During the first quarter call, we talked about the initiatives underway to handle this robust growth efficiently. Our results demonstrate the great progress we've made advancing them in the second quarter. Benchmarking against the first quarter, you can see the improvement made in terminal dwell, on-time train departure and car connections, despite volume growth of 6%. We've realigned resources, adjusted car routings to leverage available terminal capacity and modified train starts to maintain fluid operations and to increase local service frequency. In addition, the capital investments we're making in the South are beginning to have a positive impact in supporting both volume growth and improved service levels.", "Our targeted 2012 capital spend is still around the $3.6-billion mark. Spending for service growth and productivity will total over $1.3 billion. It's important to note that all of these projects have a positive safety impact. Capacity, commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers. The major projects include additional double track on the Sunset Corridor and the Blair project, work on the Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility and various projects in the South. Our capacity expansion plans in the South are estimated at around $200 million this year, increasing threefold from spending levels in 2011.", "The map shows current and future investment plans. Late in the second quarter, we cut over new capacity in West Texas that will help us serve inbound and outbound loads for the Permian Basin. In the second half of 2012, we'll be cutting over additional new capacity across the system, including projects to efficiently deliver growth in crude oil moves to St. James, Louisiana. Most encouraging is that new capacity investments are generating an excellent return, while supporting our diverse book of business, including increased shale-related volumes, growing Mexico and Intermodal business, as well as export grains to the Gulf.", "So with that, we remain positive on our operating outlook for 2012 and our ability to achieve network improvements on various fronts. A more mature Total Safety Culture, stronger relationships with local communities and improved infrastructure position us well to achieve our goal of another record safety year. We will provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service, and we are well positioned to react to dynamic shifts in volume while generating productivity and to invest a record amount of capital that generates attractive returns by increasing capacity in high-volume corridors.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning.", "Let's start by summarizing our second quarter results. Operating revenue grew 7% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.2 billion, driven by core pricing gains and improved fuel surcharge recovery. Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, increasing only 1%. Lower fuel prices this quarter helped offset other cost increases after 9 consecutive quarters of higher year-over-year fuel prices. Operating income totaled $1.7 billion, a 24% increase and a best-ever quarterly performance.", "Other income totaled $21 million, down $5 million compared to 2011. Interest expense of $135 million was also lower, down 9% versus last year. Income tax expense increased to $608 million, mostly driven by higher pretax earnings.", "Quarterly net income exceeded the $1-billion mark for the first time in our history. It was up 28% versus 2011. The outstanding share balance declined 3%, reflecting our share repurchase activity. These results drove a quarterly earnings record of $2.10 per share, a 32% increase versus last year.", "Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 7% to a best-ever quarterly record of $4.9 billion. Volume growth was up about a 0.5 points. The mix impact was flat this quarter, unlike the first quarter, where it was a large positive driver on a year-over-year basis. Growth in Intermodal traffic and shorter length-of-haul moves such as stone, offset the growth impact of higher average revenue per car moves, such to shale-related activities.", "Fuel surcharge revenue added 2% to our top line growth, driven in part from the positive lag impact of our fuel surcharge programs. The continued benefit from our recently negotiated legacy contracts generated a meaningful step-up in fuel surcharge coverage, contributing over 1% in freight revenue growth and roughly $0.05 in earnings per share compared to 2011. In addition, we achieved solid core pricing gains of 4.5%. However, pricing gains this quarter were impacted by the 17% decline in coal volumes. The combination of solid core pricing and fuel surcharge coverage gains reflect the value of Union Pacific's service offerings and contributed to the record profitability this quarter.", "Moving on to the expenses. Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was down 1% compared to 2011. Consistent with our recent guidance, more moderate inflation drove only a 1.5% increase in costs. Positives in the quarter include mild weather conditions versus last year's Midwest floods; lower new hire training costs; and generally, more efficient operations. As you know, wages for our union employees will increase effective July 1, which will drive inflation costs higher in the second half of the year to roughly 2.5%.", "Workforce levels increased 2% in the quarter compared to 2011, driven entirely by increased capital activity, including positive train control. Excluding growth on the capital side, we still expect workforce levels to increase for the full year, but not at a one-for-one rate with volume growth.", "Slide 24 shows fuel expense, which totaled $882 million, decreasing $22 million versus last year. The average diesel fuel price was $3.21 per gallon, which declined 2% year-over-year. The mix shift of lower coal volumes and growth in manifest and premium traffic drove a 2% increase in our fuel consumption rate, partially offsetting the impact of lower fuel prices.", "Purchased services and material expense increased 5% to $542 million, driven in part by higher subsidiary contract expenses relating to the 17% growth in subsidiary revenue reflected on our Other Revenue line. Engineering, locomotive and freight car repair expense also increased this quarter, driven by increased material usage and inflation costs. Overall, our year-over-year comparison was a bit easier due to the $10 million in flood-related expenses that we incurred last year in this expense line.", "Other expenses came in at $190 million, down $6 million compared to 2011, driven by lower personal injury expense. Our recent actuarial study resulted in a larger reduction to our estimate for prior year activity, compared to last year. Conversely, equipment and freight damage costs increased roughly $15 million, while property tax expense was also up compared to last year.", "For the third and fourth quarters, we expect the other expense line to be more in the range of what we saw in the first quarter of this year, barring any unusual items.", "Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Depreciation expense increased 8% to $433 million, mainly driven by increased capital spending. Looking at the full year 2012, we expect depreciation expense to be up around 8% to 9% compared to 2011.", "Equipment and other rents expense totaled $299 million, up 6% from 2011. Growth in Automotive and Intermodal volumes drove an increase in short-term freight car rental expense, which was partially offset by lower locomotive lease expense.", "Bringing revenue and expenses together, Slide 27 reflects our operating ratio performance. This quarter, we achieved an all-time quarterly best of 67 operating ratio, improving 4.3 points compared to last year, and more than 1 point better than our previous record set in the third quarter of 2010. Lower fuel prices contributed to about 1 point of the improvement versus 2011. For 2012, we've tightened our guidance a bit and we are now targeting a sub-70 full year operating ratio, which would be a first-ever in our history.", "Our incremental margin, after adjusting for fuel price and last year's flood impact, was a notable 78% for the quarter, highlighting the positive impact of core pricing gains, improved fuel surcharge coverage, operational efficiencies and growth in attractive new businesses. That said, it's also likely to be the high mark for the year.", "Union Pacific's record earnings drove solid free cash flow in the first half of the year, but below 2011 due to a 37% increase in capital spending and a 54% increase in our cash dividend payments. While cash from operations improved year-over-year, earnings growth was masked by more than $600 million in higher cash tax payments. Much of that was driven by the 100% bonus depreciation program in effect last year, which significantly reduced our tax payments in 2011. Although the impact of bonus depreciation will still be a net benefit to free cash flow this year, it will result in a headwind compared to 2011, due to the catch-up of prior year's programs and a lower bonus depreciation rate in 2012. Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At June 30, 2012, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 40.6%.", "We continue to make opportunistic share repurchases, which play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. Union Pacific's increasing returns over the last several years have enabled us to drive greater shareholder value. In the second quarter, we bought back 3.8 million shares totaling $415 million at an average purchase price of around $110 per share. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $1.4 billion to our shareholders in the first half of 2012, up more than 40% versus last year. Looking ahead, we have 20.2 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.", "That's a recap of our second quarter results. Looking forward, our quarterly financial comps become more challenging, but we still expect to achieve record earnings and a sub-70 operating ratio in 2012. In addition, we're still forecasting volumes to be on the positive side of the ledger for the full year. Continued growth in domestic Intermodal, energy-related shale moves of crude oil, frac sand and pipe, in addition to strong Automotive and Chemical shipments, should offset the Coal decline.", "We're committed to achieving real pricing gains, driven by the increased value of our service offerings and solid demand in many market sectors. Our prospects for 2012, supported by Union Pacific's strong value proposition and the strength of our diverse franchise, should result in greater profitability and allow us to grow shareholder returns.", "With that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thanks, Rob. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, the global economic outlook has become more uncertain and coal volumes are certainly going to remain a challenge. However, we're going to continue to take advantage of the opportunities provided by our diverse franchise to drive record financial results.", "I want to emphasize a point that Lance made. Union Pacific's commitment to employee and public safety is our #1 priority. That has not and will not change. We'll continue to focus on providing efficient service that adds great value for our customers. We're well positioned for upside, while remaining agile in today's changing environment. That said, we still believe in our prospects for growing profitability, generating improved returns and increasing shareholder value this year.", "So with that, let's open it up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Let's see, I wanted to see if you could give a bit more commentary on the Coal view. Your slide shows that in absolute loads, it seems like things have bottomed, but you do have more difficult comparisons in the second half. So how would we think about year-over-year? I think you had some stockpile comments. I didn't catch them all, and then I don't know if you want to comment on natural gas within that. And then do you think the broader -- a little more detail on your outlook for Coal in the second half.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay, Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, Tom. In terms of our Coal outlook, as we said earlier, our run rate is increasing as weather increase in load. Coal load demand increases also as natural gas prices increase. Our coal utility providers become more competitive in terms of using coal versus natural gas. As we said, in the third quarter, we will continue to have some tough comps as you saw on the slide, even as our volumes sequentially improve, which is why we said that third quarter will be down, again, in the low -- in the second half. The third quarter, we said, will be down in the low to mid-teens.", "Robert M. Knight", "If I could just to add, Tom. To your point on the trough, what that slide shows is that our low point was in the second quarter -- on an absolute basis. Forget the year-over-year for a second. On an absolute basis, we did trough out on our coal in the second quarter, and that was at a low, on a PRB basis, of around 23 trains per day, and we have sequentially grown to where we're running at around, call it, 30 trains per day PRB today. So we clearly have come out of that trough.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And, Eric, you -- I think you might have mentioned this. I just didn't catch it. What was the stockpile level that you -- days in stockpiles you think you're at today?", "Eric L. Butler", "We did -- I don't think we actually mentioned the absolute number, there. The report comes out this afternoon. We are expecting a reduction in the stockpiles with the report that comes out today or tomorrow. It will be around the low 20s, we think, above normal -- in terms of days above normal. So we are seeing continued, and expecting, particularly with this kind of weather that you're seeing across the country, a reduction in what the stockpile report will show.", "John J. Koraleski", "Tom, I'm a little skeptical of that reported information. It's going to go and show, as Eric said -- the last report that came out said 23 days of available stockpile. Our customer base is not expecting or is not behaving like they have 23 days of excess coal supplies. They are ordering more coal. They are bringing more coal sets on service. So that is a generalized number and I think it involves all Powder River Basin shipments throughout the United States. I think in our served territory, we might actually be in somewhat better position than what that average stat might indicate.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, as Rob mentioned, we are seeing our run rate sequentially improve.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. I mean, for the second question, if I could -- there is so much focus on legacy contracts this year. I don't think I've heard you talk much about legacy in 2013, but you've shown charts, I believe, $350 million in legacy business in 2013. Can you give us a sense of the timing of that? Is that all skewed to the beginning of the year, so you'd see kind of a full year benefit? And is that all coal? Or is there some other stuff in it?", "Robert M. Knight", "Tom, I would refer you and others to the chart that you've seen us use in the past, that kind of lays out the pie chart, if you will, of legacy, where we show in 2013, there's about $350 million of legacy renewals up in 2013. And most of that is front-end loaded, and we haven't broken out precisely, but as you know, the bulk of what's still in front of us is Coal-related.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just -- Rob, I want to just to follow up on a comment that you made, which is that the decline in Coal affected core price. Do you know roughly how much that would have affected it if it had just been, say, flat?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, roughly, it's -- if you recall, Bill, in the first quarter, we said about a 0.5 points of our pricing was hurt, if you will, by the fall-off in Coal. That was even worse in the second quarter because Coal was down more. So it was more than 0.5 points.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "On core price?", "Robert M. Knight", "On price, yes.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, got it. Okay. And then the -- I realize that there's a lot of moving parts here and there's uncertainty, but I think -- correct me if I'm wrong. Usually, the third quarter is typically your best OR quarter, and Coal, at least sequentially, looks like it will be a little bit better. So I sort of look at kind of the sub-70s target and I say, well, given where the first half was, the second half should be better. So that feels like a pretty modest guide. Or is there a part here that we have to remember just in terms of a cost metric or something, as we model the second half?", "John J. Koraleski", "Go ahead out there [ph], Rob. Go for it. We're going to fight over this one.", "Robert M. Knight", "Bill, I mean, we're -- there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world, so we're -- I would just say this, that we're not going to solve for the 70. Just like all the previous targets we've set, we're going to get there as efficiently as we can and do it the right way, and that's through a combination of good service, safe service, pricing it right and running it efficiently. So don't look at the 70 as a solve-for number. We're going to get there as efficiently as we can, but there's a lot of uncertainties in front of us.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "No, that's fair. That's fair. Just one last detail. I think in the past, you tried to estimate a market size for some of the shale play. Can you just remind us sort of what numbers you've thrown out?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "I'm not sure we've thrown out any absolute total market size numbers. What we have said in the past is that we would kind of double our volumes this year. And what we've said today is that, as we look at the outlook, our current outlook, that's about a 2% impact on our volume growth. I'm not sure we've given an ultimate market size impact of the shale play in the past.", "John J. Koraleski", "I think, Bill, one of the things we've said in the past was we expected our shale business, when you add it all up together, to be somewhere close to 400,000 carloads this year. And as Eric reported, there's a couple of customer facilities that are a little slower coming online. We're probably going to fall a little bit short of the 400,000, but not too terribly much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "So, Rob, I just wanted to follow up on the yields, and you talked about how mix was kind of a neutral in the quarter after a big positive in the first quarter. How should we think about mix in the back half of the year? And then just to follow-up on the point about Coal, as the coal volume declines moderate, is it fair that we should think that the same-store pricing increases a little bit, relative to that 4.5% in the second quarter?", "Robert M. Knight", "I'm not giving guidance on the mix. But as you know, Scott, it really is dependent upon the -- what actually moves. So we saw a fairly dramatic shift from first quarter to second quarter on that mix, which is a result of, as I pointed out, worse Coal, more Intermodal, more manifest, lower ARC moves. We're not troubled by that, by the way, because what we're focused on -- whatever the business is that we move, we're focused on doing it, handling it right and generating strong returns, as we proved in the second quarter, even without the benefit of mix. So I can't give you guidance on the mix, other than it's not an excuse for us to turn in less attractive margins, and we'll continue to approach it that way. And in terms of your question on the core pricing, yes. I mean, just generally speaking, again, we're not giving pricing guidance, but to your point, as Coal strengthens, we should achieve the benefit of some of those renegotiated contracts as that business picks up.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Okay, that's great. And then, just want to understand your thoughts on grain, given what's going on in the Midwest and the drought conditions. When you talk about eliminating the upside corn potential, does that mean you guys are now thinking about grain volumes being flat, going forward, starting in third quarter? Or is there still a chance that we get positive grain volumes, given the comps being easy and what still look like strong wheat production and wheat exports?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, if you look at -- or if you go back a couple of months and look at the USDA projections, they projected this year to be almost a bumper year, one of the best years, one of the best 3 or 4 best years in terms of crop yield, crop production. That clearly has come down with the current drought conditions. I think the latest USDA projections are it's going to be relatively flat versus last year in terms of crop yield, crop production, and so our outlook in our ag business is probably relatively similar to that.", "John J. Koraleski", "We actually have -- I think, Scott, if you look at it, we have somewhat easier comparisons in the third and fourth quarters, so we're hopeful that at least, if it doesn't get any worse than what they're currently talking about, we're hoping that we could still do a little better from a volume perspective in the second half than last year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I was curious, as we look at Coal and kind of trend out through the remainder of the year, at this point, if you were assuming normal weather, when do you get to normal stockpiles that your utilities serve? And then, how do you think about, directionality, 2013 volumes? I know this is difficult, but just curious, I mean, from your standpoint, how you're thinking about next year and -- in terms of flat, down or up.", "John J. Koraleski", "Justin, you're right. This is really difficult. If the kind of weather pattern that we see right now persists through the end of year, we should reach a point where we'll be okay with the stockpiles and our Coal business should be coming back to a more normal kind of a run rate for us. That's a pretty big \"if\". We've seen the weather change dramatically off and on. So you've been with us a long time. You've seen that happen from year to year. If the stockpiles stay where they are, come in on a normal range, we'll have a pretty good year next year in our Coal business, and hopefully it won't have the aberrations. We'll see. And then the other swing factor is what's going to happen with natural gas prices. Will they act the way the forward curve is kind of looking and continue to edge their way up? If that happens, we'll have a better prospect for a good year next year. If they crater on us and fall back down again, it will be a little more difficult.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So you still see Western coal, I mean, as solidly baseload. You haven't seen permanent switching that you think would impair that growth rate, looking out over the next couple of years.", "John J. Koraleski", "That's right. We do not see anything happening right at the moment that causes us to think the growth rate is impaired.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the export side, there's been a little bit of news with you guys and Peabody. Just curious where you guys are trending right now in terms of exports, and how you think about that business on a go-forward basis.", "John J. Koraleski", "Last year, we moved about 5 million tons of export coal. We think we're on a track run to increase that 60% to about 8 million tons this year, with the recent announcement, as we continue to look for other opportunities for port capacity to export.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Jack, when we go back to your Analyst Day a couple of years ago, when you guys laid out the strategy to get to 65 or 67, I don't think anyone envisioned that you'd be getting to numbers close to that this quickly. So could you just talk about some of the risks? I mean, obviously, we've seen Coal come down. It hasn't had much impact. But what could get in the way of achieving that maybe a little bit faster than was anticipated a couple of years ago?", "John J. Koraleski", "Brandon, I think as we laid that out in terms of the 67 to 65, the thing that I would put into perspective for you is, we have no intention of stopping there. If we get there sooner rather than later, then the goal just drops below the 65 at some point in time. We're going to continue to look at that. Certainly right now, when you look at what are the things that could get in the way, there's a wide assortment of those things, all of which we're up to the challenge of managing. You have the U.S. economic situation that will -- taking place. Of course out here, everyone, there's a lot in the press about the financial cliff that's approaching, depending on how the tax bills and things get settled out. That's certainly a risk to us. There's always a concern about what happens with fuel prices, long-term and near-term. We're watching carefully the global positioning of the global economy. When you look at anywhere between 30% to 40%, in any given quarter, of our business originates or terminates in another country, certainly what happens in China, what happens in the Eurozone and all those things can represent risk. Interestingly enough, they can also represent opportunity for us. So as the economic climate of Europe becomes more unstable, that raises the prospects in the United States of possibly moving some of that manufacturing to our economy, and particularly if we continue to see a positive impact on energy prices as a result of shale and shale development and those kinds of things. So there's a whole variety of things that -- up to and including weather. As we're seeing this year, weather can be a friend; weather can be an enemy. All of those things kind of play their role. But that being said, the path may be a little saw-toothed in getting there, but we will get there. And when we get there, we'll reassess where we're headed and we'll keep our direction on providing the most efficiency and productivity, while adding great value for our customers.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. And maybe one for Eric, as well, on Intermodal, which has actually seen some pretty favorable growth, a little bit above the economy here. How's your Mutual Commitment Program rolling out through the year?", "Eric L. Butler", "We're excited about our Mutual Commitment Program. We think it is a strong leverage value for us in the opportunity -- in the marketplace. We're seeing a number of our customers adopt it, as they're recognizing the value of it. And throughout this year, in terms of the volumes that we're seeing that have gone through our MCP program, we -- they're aligned with what we expect and what we have planned, and we're excited about the continued upside opportunity.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, Rob, just to clarify, you're not in any way kind of talking down second half with the sub-70 OR. Are you just looking at that? And I guess, to that point, I guess, on the employee cost side, you mentioned that you were looking at it to go up, I guess, or union wages were going up. It was -- I guess on a per-employee basis, costs were down 3% this quarter. Should we be looking for that to spike back up on a year-over-year basis in the back half?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Ken, a couple of points. And I am not saying things are going to get worse in the second half. What I'm simply giving is the record guidance of operating performance on a full year basis. And remember, that long-term target of 65, 67 is a full year number. And as I pointed on my comments, we've never in our history had a sub-70 operating ratio for a full year, and we're focused on doing that. But again, we're not going to solve for 70. We're going to get there as efficiently as we can. And if we get sub-70 -- the more sub we can get, the better. In terms of the point I was making on the cost side, just simply calling out that the inflation rate will go up a little bit in the third quarter as a result of the labor agreements. In -- I think I pointed out in my comments that, that labor line inflation will look more like 2.5% rather than the 1.5% that it was in the second quarter.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So we could still -- assuming if it was down 3% on a per-employee basis, if you add a point, you could still see that aiding results then, right?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Ken, that is -- you're exactly right. Those are still very good efficiency and productivity numbers from a cost standpoint.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "All right, great. And then, Jack, is there any expectation for an update or proposed rulemaking, or anything out of the STB following last summer's hearings that you would expect in the back half?", "John J. Koraleski", "You know, Ken, the STB has made some comments that would lead us to believe they are going to have some sort of announcement, pronouncement, finding or something. We don't know what that is yet, nor do we know the timing of it. So the answer to your question is I just don't know.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So there's nothing that's heating up, at least you've heard, behind the scenes or anything to lead you to believe that something is more imminent than not.", "John J. Koraleski", "No. No change.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Two lines of questioning, one on the Intermodal front, the other on pricing. You mentioned that you're up to a record 173 boxes per train. I was wondering sort of where you think you're going to max out. In other words, how much capacity do you have left in the Intermodal network?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Jason, I'll take the -- this is Lance. I'll take the capacity question. We've said this before that we've got plenty of upside in terms of productivity and train size. And specific to the Intermodal business, it's corridor-specific, but I think historically, we've said we could go -- we could see getting to a \"200 boxes per train\" kind of number. But again, it just depends on where the growth is, but we've got upside potential on virtually every corridor where Intermodal is, and we're investing to enable future growth as we speak. So candidly, I just don't see a limit at this point.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. My other question is around the pricing. And the comment was made, just so I understand it, 4.5% is in the core. Coal hurt you by more than 0.5%. My question is, what percent of the business right now is sort of tied to inflationary indexes? And how do you think that, kind of, was calculated into the mix? Is that -- did that hurt that core pricing number a bit?", "Robert M. Knight", "So what we've historically said is that about 75% of our business is -- and that is in contracts, long-term contracts. If you look at the percent of our business that's related to ALIF [ph] or RCAF increases, that's been -- we've historically said that's about 17% of our business.", "John J. Koraleski", "And that number was only 1.5% in the second quarter, so...", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "It would have a negative impact on the core pricing number that you gave.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, to some extent.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Group.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Some questions as it relates to Coal and pricing. Can you give us an idea -- outside of legacy, I know you mentioned the $350 million of legacy for next year, but outside of that, maybe contracts that have turned over more recently, what percent of your Coal business is going to reprice in 2013? And what should we expect if we assume -- let's say we assume natural gas is in the $2.50 to $3 range, do you anticipate that pricing can be steady? Or is it going to have to come down? What's your view if we make that assumption?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob, do you want to handle the legacy...", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Let me just say this, Chris, in terms of your question, we don't give the specifics in terms of how much business we're negotiating. But just rest assured, we're in constant negotiations across our entire book of business daily. I mean, we talk a lot about the marquee, if you will, legacy renewals, but we don't give specific guidance numbers beyond that, so -- it's just a constant part of our business and a constant part of what we do in our marketing and sales team.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, let me talk about the second part of your question on -- it sounded like you were asking, do we address our prices based on natural gas prices? We absolutely price to the market. We don't adjust our prices based on commodity prices. We believe we have a strong value proposition, and we believe the marketplace is recognizing our service and value proposition, and we're continuing to price to that value proposition across our entire book of business, including Coal.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Right, yes. I wasn't suggesting it was tied directly to the price, but more in line with your comment about the market. If natural gas is in the $2.50 to $3 range, what is the market for PRB coal? Is it competitive and you would expect, therefore, that prices are okay?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. I think there is a number of different kind of public assessments that suggests that for PRB coal, $2.50, $3 natural gas price is about the place where PRB coal becomes more competitive versus gas for many of our serving utilities.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up, the yields in the Chemicals business were a little bit weak. I'm sorry if I missed the reason for that. Was it a mix issue? Or what was going on there?", "Eric L. Butler", "Mix.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "What specifically?", "Eric L. Butler", "Well, as you know, our fertilizer business was down, as we talked about in our comments. And also, I think we talked about last quarter in terms of the tremendous growth that we have in our crude oil business, in our crude oil franchise. We talked about last quarter, I believe, that some of that business is shorter haul, so there's a downward mix impact associated with that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe a question on the Intermodal side. Eric, just on the -- can you give us a pricing update? I just want to get a sense of what kind of the current dynamic feels like right now. We've had fuel prices come in a little bit on the domestic side. I'm just kind of wondering with the dynamic is with truck, and kind of how you're feeling about that market.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. That's a good question. I think if you look at our results for the quarter, you could see that we're getting strong pricing in the quarter. Truck costs are going up. There is a competitive environment out there, and the Intermodal business, as you know, is historically competitive with truck. But we are seeing a pressure on the costs for truck providers, and we've had a pretty good results in the quarter in terms of our growth in Intermodal pricing, as you've seen.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So the recent move we've had, which I know has kind of bounced off of the bottom recently on fuel, hasn't necessarily had much of an impact from a market share perspective.", "Eric L. Butler", "We still see there's strong opportunity for pricing out there. Certainly, as you go through any period of time, you might see a period of time where a trucker wants to price something on fuel, but that doesn't change our strategy and we're continuing to drive our value proposition.", "John J. Koraleski", "So we have not seen much of an impact.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just a little bit bigger picture as far as some headlines we've seen recently about the potential for East Coast labor issues, I'm just wondering how much does that get involved in conversations you have with customers as you're thinking about kind of the midsummer, kind of late, early fall type of a peak discussion? Does it come up at all? Are people thinking about it?", "Eric L. Butler", "Customers are thinking about it. We have not seen much of an impact to date. Certainly, if there were an East Coast labor impact, customers are saying that they would use West Coast options. But to date, we haven't seen much of an impact.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And from a mutual commitment perspective, does that give you just one more kind of, a little bit more leverage in those discussions? Or is that not yet kind of on the table?", "Eric L. Butler", "To date, we're not really seeing that being much of an impact.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.", "H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I think most of my questions have been addressed. And maybe just a quick one on velocity. So velocity continues to improve here. Is there any way of thinking about that on an apples-to-apples basis? I suspect with coal volumes down, that's going to help velocity, all else equal. And then I guess what I'm trying to think about is, as volumes start coming back at some point, are you going to be able to hold the velocity gains that you're putting up right now as a result of the capital projects? Or should we assume that some of that starts to revert to the mean again?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes. So the way to think about velocity, the way we look at velocity, we believe, given the profiles that we've got looking forward, we can maintain the kind of velocity we've got right now. Our capital programs target where we have constraints in the network, and so we -- presuming we're effectively attacking those constraints, which we have been, that -- those really won't get in the way too much. What might be a risk to go-forward velocity is if growth happens in a rapid, unexpected fashion, somewhere where we're highly constrained, that can be a negative. But even this year, we've shown that where we get a significant growth in the South, where we are highly constrained, we've been able to manage through that largely and still put up good numbers.", "John J. Koraleski", "If you're looking year-over-year, Peter, the one thing to remember is that last year, we were hurt very badly by the drought in the South and the flooding situation in terms of our overall velocity, so...", "Lance M. Fritz", "That's right.", "John J. Koraleski", "Year-over-year, our current operating environment is much more favorable.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "All my questions have been answered, except one. I just wanted to touch in here on the peak season. I know one of your competitors in the East, earlier this week, talked about a little bit more of a muted peak season and I think yours, sort of, was around that same line. I think you mentioned positive but muted. I think that's where we were last year. I'm just curious as to whether that comment was relative to last year. Or are we looking at kind of the same thing as you saw last year?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. I mean, when we talk about peak season, we typically talk, rough numbers, 10% to 12% improvement in volumes for the peak season vis-\u00e0-vis the period of time before the peak season. This year, our current outlook is probably 5% to 8% improvement in volumes, which will be muted from what we typically see, but we think it will be a little stronger than what we've seen last year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "The question is around the shale business. I think in aggregate, we think about it as a potential 400,000-carload business. Can you walk us through the length-of-haul dynamics in there? I heard you say crude was a shorter haul, but I think frac sand is long. And then right now, what's the mix of, say, unit train businesses versus manifest?", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay, Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. There is a variety of locations. There's a balance there, some longer-haul business, some short-haul business. As you know, a sizable position of our crude oil business is joint line business with the BN and the CP out of the Bakken. So that has an impact. The crude oil business coming out of the Eagle Ford Shale, going to St. James, that's a shorter distance. So there's a number of ins and outs in terms of length of haul, depending on where the business is flowing from and where the sand business is flowing from.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then unit train versus manifest?", "Eric L. Butler", "The vast majority of our crude oil business is unit train business. Historically, our sand business has been manifest business, but we're driving more unit train opportunities with the current volumes. I think our current outlook in terms of the percent of unit trains in our sand business will be about 15%.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then a follow-up, somewhat unrelated, but the Intermodal peak you just referenced, does the uptake in MCP smooth that peak? I'm just trying to separate what's happening in the economy versus how the MCP might smooth your peak, round it off [ph]...", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. Again, if you recall the MCP, the intent of that was to smooth our year-round volumes. The peak driver really is market drivers, and to the extent someone does not have an MCP agreement with us, they would have to try to get boxes and service on a peak spot-price basis.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Larkin of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "We talked a little bit about labor inflation earlier on. Rob, could you give us an outlook for, overall, maybe inflation x fuel for the second half, and then through 2013? And then how much of that inflation you believe the company might be able to offset through a continuation of its productivity enhancements?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, John. Overall inflation, I'd say, is in the 2% to 3% range overall for us. And as you -- which is down as you know from last year. And our going-in position -- we haven't finalized our 2013 numbers. But I can just tell you this, that our going-in position, just at it is every year, is to offset -- we challenge ourselves to offset inflation with productivity. And there's lumpiness in there and mix will play a role in that, but that's the way we approach it. And if we hit half of that, let's say, that's doing pretty good. And if you look historically, we've achieved above that half, offsetting inflation with productivity. But we'll go in with that kind of mindset.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's great. And then as a follow-on, on the 4.5% core price improvement year-over-year, if you backed out the impact of the legacy repricing that's taken place over the last 12 months, what would the core pricing have been in that case?", "Robert M. Knight", "John, this is Rob again. Roughly 1.5 points of the 4.5% was legacy, and again, that was held back because of the lack of volume in Coal that we talked about. But rough numbers, I'd say about 1.5 points of that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just 2 questions: one on petroleum, one Intermodal. For the petroleum business, it ramped pretty substantially, 28.8 to 55.2 on the carload side. Is that a good run-rate number? Or are you guys still in the process of bringing on more destinations and facilities? And where do you think that run rate will sort of level out over the next 6 months?", "Eric L. Butler", "We're still in the process of bringing on more destinations and facilities.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And do you -- can you give us a sense for how much more that will ramp? Obviously, the 92% growth is probably a little high.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. We're expecting additional growth. It will probably sequentially not be as high as the growth that we've seen, but we are expecting additional growth.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. Can you give us any kind of direction, like 10, 20, 30, 50?", "Robert M. Knight", "David, this is Rob. No is the answer to that.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "All right. I just figured I ask. And then for the Intermodal business, the volume decline, you seem to have sort of offset the prior weakness and the pricing on it. At least the reported RPU number is down. Are those things independent? Or have you guys taken the throttle off a little bit on pricing in Intermodal to offset some of that share loss?", "Eric L. Butler", "I'm not sure I understand the question. Would you say that again?", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So in the last couple of quarters, you have been getting to double-digit RPU gains in Intermodal and volume declines in Intermodal. This quarter, you got a 3% gain in Intermodal volume and a 6% gain in Intermodal RPU. Are those independent? Or are those -- or are you -- or have you guys taken the throttle off a little bit on pricing aspirations in Domestic Intermodal?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, I think those are independent. I think if you look in the previous quarters, we basically were able to renegotiate some legacy things and get fuel where we had not historically gotten fuel. So that's where you see that. In terms of the volume improvement that you see this quarter, we think that, that's really market-related-driven. We are still focused and maintaining our price strategy and are excited about the results of that.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So market-driven from a domestic or international standpoint?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, in -- the international business has strengthened a little, stronger than what we expected in our earlier outlook. And our domestic business, in terms of highway conversions, are also coming very strong.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.", "Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Sal Vitale on for Jeff. Just a quick question on the fuel surcharge side. So fuel surcharge increased coverage accounted for roughly 1% of revenue growth this quarter. I think it was also similar, roughly 1%, last quarter. How sustainable is this? So at what point will this start to tail off? I mean, what percentage of your overall book of businesses currently have -- currently -- do you currently assess fuel surcharge on?", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay, Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Sal, well, you've probably heard me say that we're not going to sleep at night until we have 100% of our book of business with adequate fuel surcharge recovery mechanisms in place, and we're not there yet. But we did take a big step forward with the big legacy renewals that we talked about that were both at the end of 2011 and early 2012, and that's what you're seeing the continuation of, here in the second quarter. So I would not expect that once we lap these legacy renewals, that you'll see as big a step forward as you saw in the second quarter. But we would expect it to still move directionally in the right direction because we're not ,at 100% to where we want to be.", "Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And also, you said you start to lap that in the third quarter. Or is it the fourth quarter?", "Robert M. Knight", "No, it would be fourth quarter. End of fourth quarter is when some of that started.", "Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then just -- if I could just revisit the labor cost side. That was very impressive labor performance. So you're saying that the labor inflation for the second half should be about a point higher than it was in the second quarter. So would it be fair to assume that your labor expense per employee would be down on a year-over-year basis in the second half or flattish?", "Robert M. Knight", "We've got capital employees in there as well, including the positive train control. So I mean, directionally -- I can't give an answer, but that's probably not directionally off, Sal.", "Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just the last question, if I could. What are you currently playing -- paying for fuel? What is your current fuel price?", "Robert M. Knight", "Over -- just slightly over $3 right now, and going up, slightly going up.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brad Delco of Stephens Inc.", "A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Eric, I guess this is for you. A little bit more on the Intermodal pricing. It seems as if IMCs are expecting, or commented that pricing was a little bit weaker, and I thought maybe I could get an update from you on how many boxes you have parked, what your expectations are in the back half of the year. And would you expect your domestic Intermodal pricing to be maybe decelerating on a year-over-year basis in the back half of the year versus what we saw last year?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, I don't think we've publicly talked about how many domestic boxes we have stored. We view that as a competitive -- internal competitive information. We, as you know, are focused on price. We're focused on our value proposition, and we certainly understand the value of our services and that's where we're pricing them at. I can't speak to other IMCs and others in terms of how they are pricing their services, but we are pricing ours based on our value proposition, and our results in the quarter demonstrate that. And we're not changing our strategy in the future.", "A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Well, if I ask it another way, would you say your value proposition is as strong this year as it was last year?", "Eric L. Butler", "We are as highly confident of our value proposition. As I said -- as you said, you've seen what some of the IMCs have reported and what they have said. I would just say we have a strong belief in our value proposition and if the business is not re-investable, if the business we don't believe is supportive of our value proposition, we're okay not getting every piece of business.", "Operator", "At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Koraleski for closing comments.", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. And we're looking forward to speaking with you again in October.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Rob Knight, CFO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Knight, you may now begin.", "Robert M. Knight", "Good morning, everybody. This is Rob Knight, and welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Unfortunately, Jack Koraleski is ill with the flu today and will not be joining us. But here with me in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President of Operations.", "This morning, we're pleased to announce that Union Pacific set a new fourth quarter earnings record of $2.19 per share, an increase of 10% compared to 2011. This record also tied our best-ever earnings performance set in the third quarter of 2012. Our diverse portfolio of business, solid core pricing gains and efficient network operations drove these results despite significantly weaker coal and grain markets. Although it was a challenging year on many fronts, 2012 was Union Pacific's most profitable year in our 150-year history. It's a testament to the strength and diversity of our franchise, with the dedication and commitment of our employees and our unrelenting focus on creating value for our customers. The results are reflected in record achievements that we've made this quarter in both employee safety and customer satisfaction. Putting it all together, it translates into an increased financial returns for our shareholders.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Eric Butler.", "Eric L. Butler", "Thanks, Rob, and good morning. Let's start with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 93 for the quarter, a 1-point improvement over last year. That continued the strong performance we saw throughout 2012, with customers' evaluation of our value proposition up 1 point from 2011 to 93 for the full year, setting a new best-ever mark. We appreciate this recognition from customers and remain focused on driving further improvement in our value offering going forward.", "As expected, some of our key markets were challenged in the fourth quarter. And as a result, overall volume was down 2.5%. While Chemicals, Automotive and Intermodal group and Industrial Products was flat, it wasn't enough to offset the tough market conditions that drove deep declines in Coal and Ag products. The softening of coal demand continued to significantly impact growth, cutting into [ph] the 17% decline in Coal loadings aside, the other 5 groups grew 2% despite the shortfall in Ag. Coal price improved 4%, which combined with increased fuel surcharge revenue produced nearly a 5% improvement in average revenue per car. With price-driven average revenue per car gains outpacing the volume declines, freight revenue grew 2% to $4.9 billion.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 groups, starting with the 2 that saw declines. Coal was down 17%, as high coal stockpiles created by a sluggish economy and low natural gas prices continues to dampen the demand. A 12% improvement in average revenue per car held the revenue decline to 7%. With the weakened demand, Southern Powder River Basin tonnage declined 19%. Also contributing to the decline was a continued impact of contract losses, which more than offset business wins. Strong global demand for high BTU coal drove a 6% increase in Colorado/Utah tonnage despite a softer domestic market due to natural -- due to low natural gas prices. New business also provided a boost. Late in the quarter, much publicized low water levels on the Mississippi curtailed some shipments from both of these origins, but with relatively small impact on the overall volume shortfall.", "Before we move on to Ag, note that this slide clearly shows the challenging comp we have in coal volumes year-over-year in the first quarter.", "Ag Products volume was down 9%, mix-driven average revenue per car was flat, and revenue declined 8%. A 22% decline in carloadings was driven by last summer's drought, which unfortunately had its greatest impact in UP-served territories. The resulting tight supply of corn has reduced livestock count and lowered the domestic feed grain shipments, with increased reliance on local crops in East Texas and Arkansas also impacting our volume. Feed grain and wheat exports also declined with improved world supply and higher U.S. prices. Grain product shipments declined 6%, with reduced demand for gasoline and high corn prices curtailing ethanol production, driving a 17% decline in ethanol shipments. Food and refrigerated shipments offered some good news, growing 8%. The 78% increase in sugar shipments, driven by spot opportunity, was a big contributor, while malt and barley carloads increased over 40%.", "Our Automotive volume grew 9%, which combined with a 5% increase in average revenue per car produced a 14% increase in revenues. Pent-up demand and improved credit availability again drove sales in the fourth quarter, with year-end incentives also providing a boost as the auto industry's growth rate continued to outpace the overall economy. With consumer confidence reaching a 54-month high in November and new vehicles offering more features and improved fuel efficiencies, many continue to find in a compelling time to buy. For the quarter, UP finished vehicle shipments grew 7%, with parts volume up 13%.", "Chemicals volume increased 14%. Mix-impacted average revenue per car was flat, and revenue grew 15%, leading the way again with petroleum products, where a 69% increase in volume was driven by over 160% growth in crude oil. As has been the case all year, while crude oil has seen substantial growth, other chemical segments continued to put up solid if more modest numbers. Industrial chems grew 8%. Plastics, boosted by new business and solid export demand, was up 7%. And soda ash grew 4%, with growth in the export market. Dampening the good news was an 8% decline in fertilizer, primarily driven by soft international demand for potash.", "Industrial Products revenue grew -- increased 3% even as volume remained flat, driven by a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. Rock shipments grew 14% with increased construction activity mostly in the Houston area, which also contributed to a 16% growth in cement volumes. Lumber shipments were up 17%, as housing starts showed solid year-over-year improvement. Nonmetallic minerals saw modest growth, up 2%. But a number of other investor markets faced some challenges in the quarter. Hazardous waste volume fell 48% as the ramp-down of government funding again impacted our uranium tailing shipments. Excluding this decline, our Industrial Products volume would have been up 2%. A drop in gas-related drilling activity, lower steel mill utilization and softer demand for export scrap was reflected in a 9% decline in steel and scrap. Continued mine production issues hampered export iron ore shipments, leading to a 28% drop in metallic minerals.", "Intermodal revenue grew 6%, as a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit combined with a 2% increase in volumes. International Intermodal was flat, with a relatively weak peak season. A November strike at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports had minimal impact. Domestic Intermodal shipments grew 4%, with continued success in converting highway freight to rail in both containers and trailers.", "A closer look at how we see our business shaping up in 2013. Even with an uncertain economic outlook, our diverse franchise still provides opportunities to grow. As in the fourth quarter, the biggest challenges are expected to be tough market conditions in Coal and Ag Products. High coal stockpiles are expected to hamper recovery in coal demand. And a loss of one legacy contract beginning this year will also have an impact. That combination will likely drive a slight decline in coal volume for the year despite expected continued growth in export volumes as global demand remain strong. We expect the first quarter to see a steeper decline likely in the mid-teens, driven by the high stockpiles, with some additional impact from continued low river levels.", "Diminished 2012 grain crops should impact Ag Products throughout the first half, with first quarter volume expected to be down in the high single-digit range. Hopefully, we'll see a trend -- a return to trend line yields when the crops come in later in the year, which could offer some opportunity. Food & Refrigerated is expected to see slow growth.", "Automotive volumes should keep pace with the auto industry's expected growth. Crude oil is expected to continue as one of our strongest growth markets, but the pace will ease against 2012's larger base.", "Most other chemicals markets should remain solid, and we're expecting fertilizer to start growing again.", "An improved housing market should boost lumber shipments, and growth in construction is expected to support increases in rock, metals and other related markets, with metals also benefiting from the projected growth in the auto industry. Anticipated shale growth will also give our metals and minerals a boost. On the downside, we expect the falloff in wind business, reduced military shipments, and the diminished federal funding should again impact hazardous waste.", "Highway conversion should continue to drive Domestic Intermodal. International Intermodal may be challenged in the first half by the economy. But a stronger economy and improved housing market are expected to produce opportunities in the second half of 2013.", "Our strong value proposition will again support business development efforts across all 6 groups, with highway conversion opportunities playing the role in both our carload and Intermodal businesses. Across the groups, we'll continue to develop opportunities in Mexico, where our unparalleled ability to link their stronger economic growth with U.S. origins and destinations is the strength of our franchise.", "I mentioned the 2013 legacy contract loss, but we successfully retained and repriced 80% of the $350 million we competed for, providing a solid foundation for our 2013 price plan. As a result, while we're cautious, we expect a slight volume increase to combine with price gains to drive profitable revenue growth.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thank you, Eric, and good morning. So let's start the operating update with safety. We achieved another all-time record low reportable personal injury rate in 2012. It was 12% better than 2011 and our fifth consecutive year of improvement. Training, process improvements, capital investments and total safety culture combined to further reduce our environmental and behavioral risks. We've also reduced the severity of injuries to a record low this year.", "Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our full year reportable rate improved 2% compared with 2011. Yard and industry track derailments, a major focus of the operating team, improved year-over-year. Track-caused derailments declined considerably, reflecting the investments we've made in maintaining our infrastructure.", "In public safety, the grade-crossing incident rate increased 13% in 2012. As I've mentioned before, the combination of increased rail traffic in the south, which has a higher grade crossing density than our overall network, and growth in highway traffic, which is driven by increased economic activity in parts of our network, has increased our grade-crossing incident exposure. On the positive side, we've made progress identifying and isolating high-risk locations and improving or removing crossings of concern. We are starting to see a turning point. And although we still have a significant amount of work to do, I think we're moving in the right direction.", "Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient. And as a result, we're operating an efficient and fluid network, which is reflected in the 4% improvement in velocity compared to 2011. In fact, we came very close to matching our fourth quarter record set in 2009 despite running 9% higher volumes. This year, we've clearly demonstrated agility and resiliency in managing through the shifts in mix, including growth in manifest and premium volumes in the South and lower coal shipments in the North. Our improved network performance has been driven by a combination of process efficiency gains and capacity and expansion projects. The process improvements reflect our execution of Lean manufacturing principles, which we call the UP Way, which engages our entire labor force in the design and implementation of standard work.", "Our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. The local operating teams continue to provide great service, as reflected by Industry Spot & Pull, which set a best-ever fourth quarter record of 95%. The fourth quarter Service Delivery Index, which is a measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, also improved from 2011. The Service Delivery Index is leveraged by the fact that we periodically improve service commitments to our customers. In other words, the 89% in 2012 is measured against a more difficult standard than the 89% in 2008, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve the service product for our customers.", "Moving on to network productivity, fourth quarter slow order miles improved to an all-time record low, down 31% from last year. Our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investment in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures. As we exited 2012, over 99% of our railroad was free of slow orders.", "Moving to the upper right, car utilization improved 5% year-over-year, reflecting the improvement in network velocity and fluidity, and just shy of our all-time quarterly record set in 2009.", "In the lower left, Intermodal train lengths grew to a fourth quarter record of 174 boxes per train, improving 2% compared to 2011. Manifest train length is also holding strong given that much of the manifest growth occurred in the South, which is the most constrained area of our network.", "We've used the UP Way to reduce variability in our operations while increasing the role every employee plays on their work teams. Employee engagement is critical to our operating strategy and has had a significant impact. Our employees are utilizing their expertise to standardize their work and to remove variability. To expand a bit more on growth in the South, fourth quarter volumes in the South were up 3% versus 2011 and up 5% for the full year. Traffic in the South has returned to pre-recession levels. We've met the challenge with agility, repositioning horsepower and manpower to adapt to shifting demand. We have adjusted car routings to leverage available terminal capacity and modified train starts to maintain fluid operations and to increase local service frequency. While the UP team is successfully managing the carload surge in the South, we have growth capacity in other parts of the system, with about 800 employees per load and around 1,000 locomotives in storage. In addition, the capital investments we continue to make in the South are generating an excellent return and are having a positive impact. They support our diverse book of business, including increased shale-related volumes, Gulf Coast chemical traffic and growing Mexico and Intermodal business.", "Moving on to this year's capital plan. For 2013, we're planning to invest around $3.6 billion, which is down slightly from the $3.7 billion mark that we spent in 2012. Our spending for 2012 was slightly higher than our $3.6 billion projection as we took advantage of mild weather conditions during the fourth quarter to further advance some projects. More than half of our planned 2013 capital investment is replacement spending, while approximately $1 billion will be invested in service growth and productivity projects. Capacity, commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers. Major projects include work on the Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility, which should be completed by early 2014, and continuation of various projects in the South to support our diverse and growing book of business in that region. We're buying 100 new road locomotives under our long-term purchase commitment, which is part of our Tier 4 strategy. We also plan to acquire around 900 freight cars to serve as replacement for older assets and to meet expected business growth. In addition, we're increasing our Positive Train Control spend this year to approximately $450 million. For 2012, we've invested nearly $750 million of our estimated $2 billion projected spend. Although it's unlikely the industry will meet the 2015 deadline, we're making a good-faith effort to do so and working closely with regulators as we implement the new technology.", "In summary, we feel very good about our overall performance in 2012 and the improvements we've made in light of the dynamic market and geographical shifts. Our network is strong, fluid and resilient. I'm going to carry that momentum forward and continue to focus on those critical areas that will drive further improvement, achieving record safety results driven by the commitment to value safety above all, driving year-over-year service and productivity improvement by engaging all of our employees through the UP Way and providing customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service. We'll take advantage of growth where it shows up but effectively manage the network and resources if it doesn't. And we remain well positioned to handle dynamic shifts in volume while generating continued productivity gains and great returns on our invested capital going forward.", "With that, I'll turn it back over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance. Let's start by summarizing our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue grew 3% to a fourth quarter record of more than $5.2 billion, driven by core pricing gains and increased fuel surcharge recovery. Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, increasing 1%. Operating income grew 7% to $1.7 billion, also setting a best-ever fourth quarter record. Below the line, other income totaled $43 million, down $11 million compared to 2011. Interest expense of $128 million was down 9%, driven by lower average interest rates and some capitalized interest. Income tax expense increased to $604 million, mostly driven by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 7% versus 2011, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a fourth quarter earnings record of $2.19 per share, up 10% versus 2011.", "Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 2% to $4.9 billion. Volume was down about 2.5 points. Revenue mix was also unfavorable, driven by lower grain shipments and growth in shorter length of haul stone move [ph]. Higher fuel prices and a positive lag impact on recovery drove higher fuel surcharges, adding roughly 1 point in freight revenue growth. In addition, we saw the benefit from legacy contracts renegotiated in late 2011 and early 2012 that expanded our fuel surcharge coverage. This generated an additional 0.5 point of revenue growth. The impact in the fourth quarter was less than 1 full point of revenue growth that we saw earlier in the year, as we lacked some of those legacy renewals during the fourth quarter. We also achieved solid core pricing gains of 4%, which was a key contributor to our fourth quarter financial performance. Lower coal volumes again hindered further pricing gains.", "Moving to the expense side, Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 2% from 2011. Lower volume costs and solid operations more than offset higher training costs and modest inflationary pressures. In addition, we received an IRS refund of around $20 million of payroll taxes, which also drove costs lower in the fourth quarter. Workforce levels increased 2.5% in the quarter, mostly driven by more employees in the training pipeline and increased capital and Positive Train Control activities. As you recall, we tempered hiring a bit in the fourth quarter of 2011 based on expected volume levels and mix shifts. In 2012, labor inflation came in around 2.5%. For 2013, we expect it to be a bigger hurdle, around 3%. Also, our workforce levels, excluding capital, should grow in 2013 if volumes increase but not at a 1-for-1 rate.", "Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $920 million, decreasing $15 million versus 2011. Cost reductions driven by a 5% decline in gross ton miles more than offset the impact of a 3% increase in our average diesel fuel price versus 2011. In addition, our consumption rates increased 1%, driven by lower coal volumes.", "Purchased services and material expense increased 5% to $533 million due to higher contract expenses incurred by our logistics subsidiaries. The revenue generated from these expenses is reflected in our other revenue line. Joint facility maintenance expense and locomotive repair expense also increased this quarter. Depreciation expense increased 10% to $453 million, mainly driven by increased capital spending program. In 2013, depreciation expense will continue to increase but not at the 9% rate that we saw for the full year 2012. The combination of a favorable rate study and lower gross ton miles will result in an increase of around 3% to 4% versus 2012.", "Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $302 million, up 4% from 2011. Growth in Automotive volumes drove higher freight car rental expense, which was partially offset by lower locomotive lease expense. Other expenses came in at $182 million, down $9 million compared to 2011. It was a little bit better than what we have projected in October, in part due to lower-than-expected volumes. Lower equipment, property and freight damage expense, as well as other cost control measures, also contributed to this decrease. Conversely, personal injury and property tax expense increased compared to 2011. For the full year 2013, we expect the other expense line to be more in the neighborhood of $225 million a quarter, barring any unusual items. Higher property taxes and challenging year-over-year comps in personal injury expense will add upward pressure, in addition to any volume-related expenses.", "Now let's turn to our operating ratio performance. We achieved a record fourth quarter operating ratio of 67.1%, improving over 1 point compared to last year. On a full year basis, we generated a best-ever 67.8% operating ratio, the first sub-70% performance in our history. Our performance highlights the positive impact of solid core pricing gains, growth in attractive new businesses and continued focus on productivity initiatives. And this improvement was accomplished without the benefit of any volume growth. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving our sub-65% operating ratio target by 2017.", "Slide 28 provides a summary of our 2012 earnings with a full year income statement. I'll walk through a few of the highlights from our record-setting year. Operating revenue achieved an all-time record of $20.9 billion. Operating income also set a new best-ever mark of $6.7 billion, topping 2011's record by over $1 billion or 18%. And net income of $3.9 billion and earnings per share of $8.27 also set new historic annual records.", "Union Pacific's record full year earnings generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion, which reflects over $560 million more in capital spending and a 37% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2011. In addition, cash from operations of nearly $6.2 billion includes more than $900 million in higher cash tax payment. Over half of that was driven by the catch-up of prior year's bonus depreciation programs and a lower bonus depreciation rate in 2012 versus 2011. On a positive note, we'll see the benefits from a new bonus depreciation program in 2013, which will drive an added boost to free cash flow of around $400 million this year from what we've previously discussed with you in October. The net benefit, which includes the impact of prior year's programs, will be roughly the same in 2013 as it was in 2012.", "Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At December 31, 2012, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 39.1%, lower than this year's trend due to the pull ahead of $450 million in debt maturities from the first quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Slide 30 shows our full year 2012 capital investment of $3.7 billion. Our preliminary capital plan for 2013 is around $3.6 billion, down slightly from the 2012 levels. While spending on Positive Train Control is growing, we'll be spending less on locomotive acquisitions this year. The chart on the right reflects our achievements in generating returns on these investments. Return on invested capital was a record 14% in 2012, up over 1.5 points from 2011. Returns must continue to improve to support the significantly higher asset replacement costs and investments required to achieve our safety, service and growth initiatives.", "Beyond funding our capital programs, our record profitability and strong cash generation have enabled us to grow shareholder returns. After increasing our dividend per share 58% in 2011, we raised it an additional 15% last year. For 2012, our declared dividends totaled $2.49 per share, achieving our target payout ratio of 30%. In addition, we continue to make opportunistic share repurchases, which play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. In the fourth quarter, we bought back over 2 million shares at an average purchase price of around $122 per share. Full year purchases totaled 12.8 million shares, averaging $115 per share. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $2.6 billion to our shareholders in 2012, up 16% compared to 2011. Looking ahead, we have about 15 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.", "So that's a wrap-up of 2012. We're now focused on the opportunities and challenges of 2013. As we discussed in our October Investor Day Conference, we're cautious on the economic outlook for this year. We're expecting many of the same challenges that we faced in 2012. We'll be working through these issues, including the dynamics of the domestic energy markets and the carryover impact of the drought. We're also focused on Washington as they work through the various fiscal challenges. We'll be watching to see how it impacts what we currently see as a gradually improving economy. But if industrial production grows at around 2% as projected, we would expect strength in other areas to offset the shortfall in coal, driving slightly positive volume growth for us this year. That said, we successfully navigated through the complexities of 2012, and we'll continue to follow that same strategy in 2013. We remain agile and leverage the strengths of our diverse franchise. As we look out over the year, we're expecting to see a stronger second half relative to 2012. We're clearly going to have our challenges in the first quarter with very tough year-over-year comps in coal and grain volumes, as Eric described. Despite the challenges on the volume side, we continue to target inflation plus pricing gains. We should also realize the benefits from continued productivity and network efficiencies. Assuming the economy takes a positive step forward and fuel prices are stable, we expect to achieve another record financial year, generating best-ever marks in operating ratio and earnings, which will drive increased shareholder returns.", "So with that, let's open it up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm going to surprise you here with a question on coal. I guess, I'm sure you'll get a lot on that, but anyways, can you give us some thoughts around what might drive upside or downside to your -- your view on coal volumes? I think you're saying coal volumes are probably full year down a little bit. What would be the scenario, maybe gas price level, natural gas price level that would drive some upside? And also in terms of risk to the downside, how are you thinking about the impact of the Edison Mission bankruptcy and whether you're factoring in lower volumes there into your comments on coal?", "Eric L. Butler", "Thanks, Tom. As you say, there are a lot of uncertainty in terms of the coal outlook and environment, certainly, on the downside, regulatory environmental changes in Washington that could have continued negative impact on the Coal business and the coal market share. Certainly, the natural gas, the price of natural gas can also have impacts on the downside and the upside. Right now, we're expecting natural gas prices to remain in the $3.54 range for the year and -- but on the upside, as natural gas price goes up, that will drive more business to coal. If you look at the coal market share, full year market share for 2012, we're not expecting substantially higher coal market share vis-\u00e0-vis natural gas for 2013, maybe 1 point or 2 higher but basically flat in terms of overall market share, but there would be upside and downside to that. In terms of the announced bankruptcies that are out there, we are working closely with our customers, we work with them as they're working through those difficult times. We also are doing what we need to do to ensure that we are protecting our corporate interest. As we're going through the process, as you know, the way the bankruptcies work, customers have the right to look at contracts. And we're working with them as they're going through that process, and we'll continue to work with them.", "Robert M. Knight", "Tom, if I could just add a couple of more points to Eric's comments on the drivers of coal. Remember, we said in October at our conference, there was about a 10 million-ton contract loss, so that's factored, obviously, into our 2013. And the other variable, I'd remind everyone, that can impact our coal volumes up or down is weather. That's always the case. The biggest driver is when we have a deep cold winter season and more importantly, how early, how long and how deep will the summer season be, and that can always influence our volumes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was curious, what do we make about when you mentioned these contract losses, it seems like that happened last year with some of the legacy repricing, same thing this year. Does that suggest that some of the competitors are being a bit more aggressive on price than you'd expect? How do we sort of take that?", "Robert M. Knight", "If I can just make a comment and then I'll turn it over to Eric. I mean, Bill, that's -- we're negotiating contracts every day of the week. There's a lot of visibility given probably to the legacy renewals, but I would just say that we compete vigorously every day of the week on whether it's a legacy contract or non-legacy. So it doesn't strike us as unusual. That's the business we're in, that there's constantly negotiations taking place, and there are factors like price and service, et cetera, that go into those equations. But Eric, do you want to elaborate?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, I'll add to that, Bill. Price negotiations, as Rob said, I mean, they're always difficult. We always compete in the marketplace. We expect to win some, we expect to lose some, but our strategy remains the same. We're going to be reinvestable. We have had that strategy for many years now, and we remain dedicated to that strategy and focused on it. I mentioned that for 2012, we had about $350 million in legacy. We retained about 80% of that, and we feel pretty good about that retention rate.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Is return on capital metrics now up around 14% CapEx coming down? Is there sort of something to think about there, where the returns have gotten better, you slowed the growth in the CapEx? I'm not sure sort of if that suggests kind of maybe limited opportunity to keep taking up price because the way the returns are getting from a regulatory standpoint, is there -- maybe, Rob, you can sort of comment on how to think about that.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, though I wouldn't read too much into that connection in terms of the slight lead reduction, the $3.6 billion planned spend this year versus 2012, $3.7 billion and the ROIC. I would say that, as we've said all along and we walked our talk here over the last several years, is we have to improve our returns to justify those kinds of capital investments, and that's the takeaway here, and that's how we look at every capital investment. In terms of there being a slight reduction from year-to-year in capital spend, that's really more timing issues. We expect to spend more, as I mentioned and as Lance mentioned, on Positive Train Control spending this year but less on locomotives. We'll take 100 locomotives this year. And last year, we did 200. So those are all factors. Replacement spending remains strong and hasn't changed. That's a key investment that we spend every year. And the other thing that we talked about last couple years and we'll continue into 2013, as we direct more capital spending in the southern part of our network because of the growth prospects that we are seeing there and the return expectations, so that would be my answer in terms of how we look at our capital spending. And I wouldn't read anything in the slight reduction this year. Lance, you want to add?", "Lance M. Fritz", "I'll just add, Bill, that we're not at a loss for excellent projects to invest in.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I guess on the contract -- the legacy contract dealings this year, I wanted to -- maybe asking Bill's question a little bit differently. Of the 20% that you did not retain, is that business that went to a competitor or is that business that is no longer existent and it wasn't really up for renewal?", "Robert M. Knight", "Justin, as I said before, we compete against both our direct rail competitors. We compete certainly against alternative sources of fuel. The 20% that I'm referring to went to a competitor. And as I said, we are -- we compete [ph] all the time, we're comfortable with the 80% we retained. And our strategy is we want to move our business at reinvestable levels.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then a follow-up, I'm curious, you talked a little bit about the crude growth rate declining as we look out in 2013, albeit staying [ph] at a relatively high level. How much of that is pipeline supplanting some of the movement of crude-by-rail along the Bakken south line? And then also if you could talk a bit about some of the opportunities that you see as we move through this year or maybe into next year, that'd be helpful. You gave some good guidance last year around what kind of shale-related carloads you expect this year. Maybe an update on how you see that trending in 2013.", "Robert M. Knight", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, our -- as we mentioned all throughout last year, our shale-related business grew tremendously. I think we've mentioned possibly about 80% [ph] last year. Just because of the size of the base, we certainly are not going to see that same growth rate in 2013. We are expecting to see solid growth. As I mentioned in my comments, the crude oil side of our business will be one of the strongest part of our business, so we're still excited about that. In terms of your pipeline comment, there are -- there is additional pipeline capacity coming on. We did mention at our Dallas discussion, when we were there, that the number, as the capacity of pipeline is coming on, I think probably are barely keeping up with the production increases. So production increases are growing rapidly, that even the pipeline capacity increases, so we still see a place for rail type or crude-by-rail in the market for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just because it sounds like nobody's touched on coal yet, one more on coal for you. But on the -- can we read into that lost contract that this was one of those that was won before the pricing paradigm kicked in? Was this kind of naturally on somebody else's network that is shifting over, or is competition increasing on some of the baseload operation given the lighter volumes?", "Robert M. Knight", "Ken, I would just say, and Eric can expand on this, that we always have, we always will compete vigorously in our business. Coal's no different, but coal clearly is an area where we do. But Eric, want to comment on this?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, the contract, Ken, that we're referring to was a legacy contract. I mean, we've talked about our legacy contracts for many years. It was one of our legacy contracts. And as we've been saying for years, our strategy is to ensure that we price at market rates and that we attain reinvestable rates.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I understand it was legacy, but was it one that had been won during kind of the heated battles of before the legacy pricing contract kicked in, before like '03, '04? Was that a contract that had been won maybe based on price and therefore, you viewed it as not a core part of your network or was this just a competed [ph] business?", "Robert M. Knight", "Ken, let me just say I wouldn't get too hung up on the timing of when those discussions took place or when the decision was made. And of course, we don't have visibility absolutely to when they made the ultimate decision. We know when we were informed. But I would also just say the piece of business we're talking about in October and November we called it out, it was about 10 million tons of coal, it fits nicely with our competitor, and that's all we're probably getting into on that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "This question is I think for Jack, but when we think about 2013, a slower economy, and maybe a little bit less year-on-year tailwind from those legacy renewals that you had early last year, how should we be thinking about the OR expansion? I mean, you had a lot in 2012. Is it going to be diminished from those levels of gains but still a pretty positive turn?", "Robert M. Knight", "I'm sorry, could you repeat your question?", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I'm just asking with a soft economy, less contribution from legacy renewals that you had last year, how should we be thinking about OR expansion in 2013?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, let me -- this is Rob. Remember, we gave guidance of hitting a sub-65% operating ratio target by 2017. We've previously given a 65% to 67% by 2015. And if we can't keep backing it up, we had previously given a lower -- the low 70s, and we previously gave 75%. But we've always said, we're going to get there as efficiently, safely as we can. We're not using that as a hard stop. We're going to get there as early as we possibly can, assuming markets cooperate. But we're going to focus on safety, service, productivity, and with that service comes our confidence that we're going to be able to get core real pricing gains. We define that as inflation plus. Those are still the same principles that are driving us forward. To your point, does the tail sort of get a little slower as you get into the 60s, where we are today, as you head to that 65%? Sure. The slope of the line, coming from 87% to 67%, is a pretty dramatic slope. Going from 67% to that sub-65% target is a little bit different slope, but our focus and our commitment and our confidence of making progress hasn't changed at all. So we're going to continue to drive the same principles that got us to where we are as we move forward.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Well, and how do we think about core pricing gains this year? You've been running in the 4%, 4.5% range. And I understand that with coal coming off last year, obviously, you didn't get the full benefit in your calculation of those coal contracts that were renegotiated. But should we be assuming something similar to 4% throughout '13?", "Robert M. Knight", "We don't give specific guidance on the pricing numbers other than to say that it's going to be inflation plus or real pricing gains. The other thing that I would remind you is as we look backwards, we're not giving guidance going forward on this. As we look backwards, remember that we've obtained from legacy renewals 1.5% to 2% from legacy in our core pricing gains. So depending on the timing and how much legacy you have in any particular period will influence certainly how much pricing you get. But even ex-legacy, that can be lumpy from the time that contracts come up for renewal in the legacy front. But non-legacy, we're confident that we'll get that inflation plus overall pricing number, and that's the guidance that we're giving as we look forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "So another one on coal. When I look at the 13.5% decline in 2012, how much of that do you think is structural of plants closing or losing business? And then if at some point we get to gas prices back above $4 or $4.50, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years from now, whenever, how much of this 13% decline in coal do you think comes back?", "Robert M. Knight", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, Scott, we attempted to say back in Dallas, we attempted to separate the market drivers from the plant closures. Today, there is surplus plant capacity versus the demand. So plant closures aren't necessarily going to impact the volume of tons. It's really the demand for electricity generated by coal. So if you look at it on that metric, coal historically has had about a 50% market share; was probably in the high 40s, 18 months ago; for 2012, it's probably call it 37%, 39% market share. Coal electrical generation, we think that's about where it's going to be at a $3.50, $4 natural gas price. As natural gas prices go up, that percent of market share will grow, and the potential for coal volumes will grow. Additionally, if you look at the mix of where the coal is being produced, certainly, Southern Powder River Basin coal is a cheaper coal to produce than Central Appalachian coal. So we think you will continue to see a migration of market share from Central Appalachian coal to Powder River Basin coal for the amount of coal that's moving.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "So it sounds like you think that a lot of what you lost in '12, you can make up at some point, not in '13, but at some point in the future if gas prices get back to more normalized levels.", "Eric L. Butler", "As we were saying, if gas prices stay at $3.50, $4 or above, we think that the coal market share and therefore, our potential to participate in that coal market share vis-a-vis natural gas will be positive going forward.", "Robert M. Knight", "That and weather and the economy or more electricity demand, all those are factors that would be a positive for us.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Okay. And then one on the Intermodal side, so better domestic volume growth than we've seen in a little while, and then the yields growth slowed a little bit to what we've seen. Wondering if there's any changes in the strategy when it comes to domestic Intermodal to focus a little bit more on growth and less on pricing, or am I not reading that right?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, I don't think you're reading it right. If you think about our domestic Intermodal strategy, our strategy has been consistent and firm, and we're going forward with the same strategy in the future that we've had in the past. Domestic Intermodal has huge opportunities in terms of conversion, over-the-road conversion, and each year for the last 3 years, we've had excessively high domestic Intermodal volumes driven by over-the-road conversions. We still think that there's a large market out there. We estimate there's probably $7 million to $10 million of over-the-road truckloads that can be penetrated by the Intermodal market. And so we --- our strategy is to go after those over-the-road truckloads. We're going to continue to go after that. We're going to continue to do it as pricing through the market and strong reinvestability in that business.", "Robert M. Knight", "7 million to 10 million units.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, 7 million to 10 million units, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "I wanted to ask a question, first, just about the growth that you've experienced in your southern region. You've mentioned a number of times the volumes in that region are at pre-recession levels. I just wondered if you could give us some context on where volumes are relative to prior peak levels in that region.", "Robert M. Knight", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, sure. So our pre-recession levels were, relatively speaking, historic peaks. So the South right now is at historic peaks, and we're seeing a lot of that volume show up in carload traffic in terminals.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "Is that a function of the growth in crude-by-rail primarily, or are you seeing a lot of the other traffic routes also back at prior peak levels?", "Lance M. Fritz", "It's part a function of crude-by-rail. It's also part a function of Texas booming from the standpoint of oil production, the shale plays and all of the related activity with that. It's also reflective of the auto strength to and from Mexico.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "Okay. If I could sneak one last one in, I was sort of intrigued by your comment that you expect a stronger international peak in 2013. And I was just curious whether that is a general comment on the expectation of a stronger economy or whether, in fact, you're becoming more optimistic that the housing upturn will translate into a ripple effect into things like furniture and that sort of thing.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, I would say it's both. We certainly -- there's a lot of economic uncertainty. And as Rob said and others have said, there's a lot of things that are happening in Washington that could take us in a lot of different directions. But we're certainly hopeful there will be a stronger economy in the second half of the year. And of course, as housing strengthens, as the global insight projections are suggesting that it will continue to strengthen, the things that you build housings with, so whether it's furniture and other internal items, will ride our Intermodal outlook for the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe just a question on the legacy coal volumes from 2012 that maybe didn't move, when you look at the scenario, maybe $3.50 to $4 natural gas, is there amount of that legacy business on the coal side that you would expect to move in 2013 that maybe you would see that coming through in either core pricing or, I guess, maybe incremental margins? Just want to kind of think about that a little bit in this natural gas kind of environment.", "Robert M. Knight", "Let me just make a comment, and then Eric may want to elaborate, and I'll come at it from the pricing standpoint. It's kind of a difficult question to answer from what's normal, but you kind of roughed up the impact we had on pricing. As we increased the terms and conditions in pricing on some of those legacy contracts and did not then get all the full volume compared to what we might have in the past. That hurt us in our pricing calculation about 0.5 point in the quarter. So to your point, there's clearly a drag there. I guess, the mystery or the question then would be how much of that will come back, and I guess it's dependent upon all the other factors that Eric walked through. Eric, if you want to add?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, and the only thing I would add to what Rob would say is as the coal business comes back for that -- for those repriced legacy contracts, we will not consider that price going forward. But to your point, Chris, it will be in our margins going forward.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And when you think about maybe what the breakpoint on -- can you give us any help, I guess, on maybe what the breakpoint on natural gas is for a portion of that business? I mean, is this something in the neighborhood of $3.50 or maybe is it a little bit lower? I guess I just want to get some rough kind of guidelines maybe to use there.", "Eric L. Butler", "We -- our best assessment is the market kind of currently is at $3.50, $4. And as the price of natural gas goes higher, coal becomes much more competitive. As it goes lower than that, natural gas becomes much more competitive.", "Robert M. Knight", "Chris, I would just add that we're certainly in unchartered territory here just that we were on the downside, that at what point exactly will utilities switch back and what gas price, and one of the factors to consider, which we don't have visibility on, is how long has the utility contracted for the gas. That's a variable also that -- we'll see how that plays out.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I'll bring up an old question but ask it in a different way since I've covered you guys for an awful long time. I do remember when you battled with your western partner for a small percentage of market share. It doesn't seem like this is the case, it seems like this is normal back and forth in terms of contracts that might move. Am I right in my interpretation?", "Robert M. Knight", "Jason, you're absolutely right. I mean, one of the lessons learned that you know well and we've communicated and we're still driven by is we're not in this for market share. And I think where we walked our talk, as much as anything, is we turned in this record financial results without the benefit of positive volume for the year. If you go back to when we started this whole turnaround effort, if you will, and the returns and focus on the right fundamentals of the business, we were running higher levels of volume in the high 80s operating ratio. So we learned that lesson, and we understand that it's not a market share game. We're certainly aware of what's happening in the market, but we're focused on competing, providing good service, pricing it right and generating returns.", "Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. My next question is going to actually look out a little bit further than actually being able to be focusing on, but as I look at your Auto business, I looked at a lot of growth in the plants in Mexico. Even if they don't happen to go on firm [ph] as much as they go [ph] on cashew, cashew [ph] does distribute them to other railroads, including yourself. Talk a little bit about some of the new plants online and how might that impact UNP in 2014?", "Eric L. Butler", "You're right, Jason, there's an immense amount of auto construction new capacity coming on in Mexico. Vast majority of that is coming on for export to the U.S. or actually export to Europe and Asia. And some of the manufacturers are adding capacity in Mexico and just not enough export back to Europe and Asia, but the large portion of that is going to be dedicated to North America, particularly the U.S. We have the best franchise crew from Mexico. We have the best autos franchise. We have, as we've said, publicly about 75% market share in the autos market. A large portion of our autos business is to and from Mexico. We work with both the KCSM and the FXE equally. And so our perspective is no matter where the auto plants are located in Mexico, whether they're still served by the KCS, served by the FXE or dual-served by both of them, we want to work effectively with the partners and provide an effective service and take it to destinations in the U.S. And we have the best franchise, and we're going to continue to build on that franchise.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to focus a little bit. I understand your core pricing's intact at that inflation plus. But looking a little bit at the mix effect from some of the length of haul moves, I noted your Coal volumes and Ag volumes most, are hardest hit here this quarter. But in one, the average revenue per car was up 12% in Coal and flat in Ag. I was wondering if you might be able to, Eric, perhaps give us some color as to the difference in length of haul there and what implication that might have on mix effect going into 2013 on those 2 -- those areas.", "Robert M. Knight", "Eric, you want to?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, our coal mix of length of haul really did not essentially change in 2012. The ARC affect, as we've been talking about, are focused on legacy pricing and repricing on legacy contracts. If you look at our Ag side, we did have a length of haul with the drought and the very small corn crops. Our length of haul in taking corn to destinations was significantly shortened. Our California feeders used a lot of local feed as opposed to long-haul corn, which is relatively high priced. So our length of haul was impacted and our Ag business significantly primarily due to the corn drought factor.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy of Susquehanna.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "A longer-term question on coal. If I think about some of the sourcing differentials between the eastern franchises and the western franchises, obviously, PRB coal is in an advantageous position long term. It's cleaner burning, it's more economical, it's more competitive with gas at a lower price. So more than at least the academic, you would think it's more fungible or might back-fill lost production, that's environmentally viable, eastern mines, but that's more of an academic observation. I was just wondering if you could give a realistic assessment in terms of -- do we see sourcing shift over the next 3, 5, 7 years, to what extent might you be a continued share gainer and might that make your coal franchise grow more quickly than the market, whatever the market is going to be?", "Robert M. Knight", "Matt, let me make a couple of comments, and I'll turn it back over to Eric. I think all the academic -- the positives, as you repeated, we would agree with all those. The other thing that, if you recall, that we gave some guidance on October, was our export opportunity, albeit relatively small compared to the eastern routes but still a nice growth opportunity for us. Eric, if you want to...", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, I would just add to what Rob said and kind of repeat what we've said before, if you look at the coal overall market share, natural gas prices being in the range that they're in, the market share will probably remain high 30s, perhaps low 40s, vis-\u00e0-vis natural gas. We do continue to see a shift from Central Appalachian coal, which probably needs to be at $5.50 natural gas prices versus the Powder River Basin coal -- sort of $5, $5.50 versus Powder River Basin coal at $3.50, $4.

Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on a comment earlier about your returns, and I'm just wondering what your view is. Do you think that given that you're generating 14% returns on capital, do you see an increased risk that you'll face more rate cases?", "Robert M. Knight", "Chris, that's something that we'll continue to communicate our message as broadly as we can in terms of -- we have to earn adequate returns. We have to grow our returns to be able to make the kinds of capital investments that we are making and that we hope to make going forward as long as the returns are there. I think what it does introduce is more discussion on, which I know you're well aware of and others as well, the whole replacement costs way of looking at your returns. I mean, if you factor that in rather than a 14%, hard numbers would look more like call it a 7-ish. So that's a message that we'll continue to communicate and continue to work on, but we have to earn adequate returns in order to make these kinds of capital investments.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Makes sense. And then just a follow-up on the revenue per car in the Chemical division. Can you just explain why that was flat in the light of such big growth in crude? I would have thought that, that would have had a positive effect on your revenue per car. So maybe explain where the offsets are and if that's something that, going forward, you think the growth in crude will help improve revenue per car.", "Robert M. Knight", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "If you look at our Chemicals business overall and kind of look at it historically, our revenue per car in our Chemicals business has been some of the best over all of our businesses. As we talked in previous earnings releases, our crude oil business, the majority, if not all of that, is underlying business [indiscernible] moving from our interchanges with our CP [ph] partners and BN Santa Fe, where we interchange also substantial business with them in terms of the crude oil market. If the crude oil business -- because our Chemicals business has such a good revenue per car, the crude oil business is not substantially different than what our -- the remainder of our base Chemicals business is. And so we don't necessarily see a big driver of that in the future.", "Robert M. Knight", "Chris, I would just add to that, that arguably, the right way to look at it, the benefit that we're talking about that we're in fact achieving here, is not spelled out in the ARC analysis but it's more in our returns.

Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "On the issue of train size, I know it's difficult, with all the growth being focused on the southern part of the network, to really get a lot of traction there.

Knight", "Sure. Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, sure. So across the system, we have opportunity on train size. We continue to demonstrate that quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. When you look at the South, everywhere that we see significant volume growth and have seen significant volume growth, we've got capital being invested that helps us continue to grow size. So if you look at the route between El Paso, Dallas, Shrieveport, we call that the Texas Pacific route, or TP route, we've had some substantial investment going there for siding extensions in new sidings. That helps us grow train size. We're doing the same kind of investments on the north/south route that supports crude oil, as well as Ag to the Gulf. Once that kicks back up, as well as the chemical industry franchise. And then we've been making incremental investments around the state of Texas end points north, that help us on our Intermodal and Autos business to and from Mexico. So virtually everything that's shipping to and from Texas has an opportunity for train size in the next [indiscernible].", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Very good answer. And then maybe a longer-term question on International Intermodal. Haven't really talked too much about the new Panama Canal locks that are opening up, I think, in early 2015. Has your view changed at all in terms of how much, if any, of the transpacific traffic might shift to the all-water route to access some of the ports on the East Coast that presumably by then will be able to handle the larger ships, what might your response be? Is there a way to preserve some of that traffic over the West Coast ports?", "Robert M. Knight", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, John, our view hasn't changed from what we've said before. Today, there's about 30% of the business that is all-water route to the Panama Canal. And the rough dividing line is roughly the Appalachians, to go east of the Appalachian, typically go all-water. West of the Appalachian, you [ph] can have a land bridge, a rail product. This is kind of the rough rule of thumb. We think that might change by 1% or 2%, so you might go from 30% to 31%, 32%. But as we've pointed out before, the Panama Canal also has to get a return for the significant amount of investments that they're making. The other thing that we pointed out publicly before is that if you look at the supertankers, the Panama tankers, they really have a route to the East Coast now, particularly as the production goes further and further into Southeast Asia. And so to the extent that the business that makes sense to go into those big tankers and go to the East Coast, they can do that now, not going through the Panama Canal but going the opposite direction. And we do see some of those flows going in now, which is why we're not sure we're going to see much beyond 1% or 2% change as you go forward. And last point I would make is we still think that international trade and economic growth is going to grow the pie. So we still see upside volume growth on the long term as the pie grows.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Eric, I think this question is for you. I was wondering where you ended the EMP and UMAX fleet count at the end of the year, and what net growth expectation there are for 2013.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, we don't typically give our explicit kind of container fleet count publicly. We're excited about our MCP programs, and we do have a large container ownership. We, with our partners, have the strongest container ownership position in the industry, and so we think that that's a competitive advantage for us long term. And the way we're using that with our MCP program, we think, is the right strategic direction we've been, pleased with the success, and we're going to build on it.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I guess directionally, could you give us some sense whether you would expect total fleet count to grow in line faster or slower than what Domestic Intermodal growth would be in 2013.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, that's a good question. As you know, the last couple of years, the total industry fleet count grew significantly and substantially. We added to our fleet, IMCs added to their fleet, and so there were large fleet additions over the last several years. I do not expect to see significant, if any, fleet additions from an industry perspective. This year certainly, each company will make their own decision, but I think if you look at it, the industry probably has enough capacity to absorb at least growth in the next year or 2, but we'll see what happens from a capacity standpoint.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "In the current trucking capacity and fuel price environment, can you comment on your ability to close some of the historical discount between Intermodal and trucking price [ph].", "Eric L. Butler", "That's a good question. If you look at tracking capacity, it's narrowing. If you look at the driver shortages, they are increasing shortages. There's some evidence that as the construction industry is coming back, it's more difficult for the trucking industry to get qualified drivers. And mid-year, the new hours-of-service law will come in place, which will also be an impact on the available drivers. So we think that the trends remain strong, that Intermodal will increase its value proposition vis-\u00e0-vis over-the-road truck as we go throughout this year and future years.", "Lance M. Fritz", "And Eric, don't forget our service products' port side as well.", "Eric L. Butler", "Absolutely.", "Lance M. Fritz", "An outstanding service product. It's very competitive with truck right now.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Maybe just a follow-up for Eric. Eric, considering shifts in manufacturing to North America from other historically lower-cost regions, Union Pacific is perhaps uniquely positioned to capitalize on either location where products are made. Are you sort of ambivalent as to whether products are made in Mexico versus Asia, or is there an advantage to Mexico and perhaps you can haul raw materials and finished goods as well, or lower average rate per Intermodal car perhaps a disadvantage to Asian imports? Maybe you could just give some color on if you have preference given those 2 options.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, that's a great question. I'm not sure I would phrase it as a preference. What I would say is that there is a very strong trend with Mexico having a very quality-effective, low-cost workforce and not having the supply chain issues and potential other issues that you may see in some of the Asian countries. You are seeing the trends, and you're also seeing a trend of near-sourcing actually even from Europe due to lower energy prices in the U.S. driven by the shale plays. I think over the next several years, we're going to see -- and we're actually starting to see it now in terms of inquiries from companies for rail sidings, so to speak, so the actual opportunity is still several years in the future. But we're seeing a growing trend in near-sourcing to North America, both in Mexico and the U.S., that we think will be upside for the rail industry.", "Robert M. Knight", "I would just add that because of the strength of our network, we're in the position to leverage both opportunities because of our strength of both the ports and our unique strengths in and out of Mexico being the only railroad that serve [indiscernible] the border crossing point.", "Eric L. Butler", "And the other thing is that as we have these manufacturing opportunities come, they typically bring good jobs, which helps unemployment, which again helps -- as the driver for the economy, which helps our transportation outlook.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Don Broughton of Avondale Partners.", "Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Looking at this kind of just to 100,000-foot kind of a question here, I'm looking at all of your operating metrics, and they just -- every one of them continues to get better and better and better. Obviously, you've more than adequately invested in the infrastructure. So when I look at capital investment and I look at your outlook for 2013, and you need the economy to participate, that makes sense, to what level is there flexibility? I understand PTC, that's going to be what it is on mandate. And you got infrastructure replacement budgeted at $1.675 billion. How much of the other is flexible in your mind if you didn't get the economy you're looking for and could be trained towards other items such as share repurchase?", "Robert M. Knight", "Don, let me say a couple comments, and I'll refer to Lance to elaborate. First of all, remember that every capital dollar we spend, we are very focused on hitting the return base. So we go through the calculations based on what we think the projection of the economy is going to be in volumes and service, safety and returns from that business. And that's not going to change. So if there was ever a point where we didn't feel confident in making those investments, rest assured, we would back off making those capital investments. To the point, I know you know this, that in our capital spend, about $2 billion each year is for replacements, so a few points above and beyond that, we've got other spending decisions. Lance, you want to elaborate?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, you got that just right, Rob. And like in every year, Don, we know going into the year what our on-ramps and off-ramps are, depending on what the economy does. So as we stand right now, we've got a good, robust plan that will be able to match capital spend with what is happening in the economy or what our needs are.", "Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "So it's fair to say that your CapEx outlook is much more dynamic than most people assume it to be or understand it to be. Is that a fair statement?", "Lance M. Fritz", "I think that's a pretty fair statement, absent the -- what Rob reminded you of, and that is over 1/2 is keep the store open in capital spending.", "Robert M. Knight", "And of course, we have Positive Train Control in our current numbers, and we have that still in front of us. But Lance is right, we will -- the rest is flexible, if you will, and that's based on returns.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "It's been a long call, most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick one here. When Coal does normalize -- I'm referring to the question you had about what could come back once Coal does normalize. When we add that in with the new crude carriage, the frac sand, the piping that's going up, do you think the net effect of this, if I look at it on a total energy universe basis, will be long-term positive growth, or will the crude be able to offset the structural coal losses?", "Robert M. Knight", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "So when you talk about coal, again, I don't think we are projecting, I don't think the market is projecting, that coal is going to return to the levels that it needs to be at. I think what we're saying is that given a natural gas range, again, $3.50 to $4, coal will probably stay in that round number, 40% share in the market. So I'm not sure we are projecting that to be significantly [indiscernible] return back to its historical levels, unless we have an assumption about natural gas prices being significantly higher.", "Robert M. Knight", "And to add to that, to your point, the shale opportunities and all the related moves, we're very optimistic that our network is really well positioned to continue to serve those growing markets. So when you add it all up, I mean, the energy story for us, we think, is a very positive story.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "With regard to labor costs, I was just taking a look at the annualized average rate for the fourth quarter, which was down about 4% year-on-year, and then compared to the full 2012, it's down about 3%. And I'm just wondering, as we look forward, is the fourth quarter a good guide for the average rate for 2013?", "Robert M. Knight", "No, it's not. I would expect that that's going to increase. Remember the tax refund I mentioned in my comments certainly was a factor in that. There was also a greater percentage, if you will, of growth in our capital spending program as it relates to labor. So I would expect that, as we move into the first quarter, to be more normalized, if you will, at a call it 3% range.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So just a follow-up on that, would the 2012 -- with that incremental increase that you mentioned did then -- if we just make minor adjustments around that, would the 2012 annualized number then be sort of this figure we should be looking at based on 100,000 or 200,000 [ph], roughly give or take.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, I mean, sort of a 3% growth assumption in there, that's probably not an unreasonable with inflation.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "If you pull together all of your unconventional energy business, what's the -- roughly the mix right now between the inbound, frac sand, pipe, et cetera, versus the outbound take away? And what does that mix look like, 2013, 2014, how might that change?", "Robert M. Knight", "Eric, I'm not sure we have that.", "Eric L. Butler", "So I just want to make sure the question that you're asking. You're asking how much of our business is inbound versus outbound, recognizing it is in different regions and different origins and destinations?", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Eric L. Butler", "So our frac sand and pipe business predominantly is going from kind of Minnesota, Wisconsin, down to South Texas and West Texas, so it's going inbound that way. And our crude oil business is coming from the Bakken going to the South. It's probably a 55-45, 60-40 kind of a split.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And does that change materially as you get into 2013, 2014? I guess, just the take away [indiscernible].", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, the crude opportunity, as I said in our earlier comments, is one of our strongest growth opportunities. That will grow faster than the inbound opportunity in 2013.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Time for 1 final question. That question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just 2 quick follow-ups just to clarify on guidance, you said your -- the potential for quite positive volume growth overall, if you could just kind of clarify that a little bit. And then specifically with Ag, kind of what you're expecting for the full year, kind of first half, back half, that would be great.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, just to remind everyone, what we said on the volume guidance is we said assuming the economy cooperates, and let's define that as an industrial production number of around 2%, we would expect when you add it all up that our overall volumes in the face of slight decline in coal, is what we call that also, we expect our volumes to be on the positive side of the ledger, overcoming, if you will, that slight falloff in Coal. Ag, we said we got challenges in the first half of the year. We expect that things will hopefully improve in the back half of the year, but we didn't give any further clarity beyond that.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Rob Knight for closing comments.", "Robert M. Knight", "Okay, great. Again, we're very proud of what we've accomplished here and look forward to continuing to meet the challenges in 2013. And thanks for joining us on the call, and we look forward to speaking with you again in April.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski, you may begin.", "John J. Koraleski", "Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today here in Omaha are Rob Knight, our CFO; Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President of Operations.", "This morning, we're pleased to announce that Union Pacific achieved record first quarter financial results, leveraging the strengths of our diverse franchise despite significantly weaker coal and grain markets. Earnings of $2.03 per share increased 13% compared to 2012. We efficiently managed our operations in the face of dynamic volume shifts across our network as evidenced by our record first quarter operating ratio and customer satisfaction results. Putting it all together, it translates into greater financial returns for our shareholders.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.", "Eric L. Butler", "Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start off with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 94 for the quarter, tying an all-time quarterly record. It is up 1 point from the first quarter last year, setting a new first quarter record, and along the way, March tied our best ever month at 95. We appreciate customer recognition of the strength of our value proposition and continue to work to make it even stronger.", "As expected, some key markets were a challenge in the first quarter, and as a result, overall volume was down 2%. While Chemicals, Intermodal and Automotive grew and Industrial Products was flat, it wasn't enough to offset the challenging market conditions that drove steep declines in Coal and Ag products, whilst the coal demand have continued to have the largest impact on overall growth. Setting the decline in the coal loadings aside, the other 5 groups grew 2.5% despite the drought related to shortfall in Ag. Note that the volume comparisons were subject to last year's leap year which included an extra day of carloadings.", "Core price improved 4%, which combined with the modest benefit from positive mix and increased fuel surcharge revenue produced nearly a 6% improvement in average revenue per car. With the price-driven average revenue per car gains outpacing the volumes decline, freight revenue grew to 3% to $5 billion.", "Let's take a closer look at each of these groups, starting with the 2 that saw declines. Coal volumes were down 19%, as high coal stockpiles created by last year's low natural gas prices continued to impact demand. Core pricing gains and positive mix led to a 16% improvement in average revenue per car, holding the revenue decline to 6%. High stockpiles and inventory reduction initiatives by specific utility drove the decline in the Southern Powder River Basin shipments, with tonnage down 19%. Although coal stockpiles started to decline from last year's peak, they remain above normal levels.", "Also contributing to the decline was a previously mentioned loss of a legacy customer contract at the beginning of the year, which more than offset business gains. Colorado/Utah coal shipments also declined, soft domestic demand, mine production problems and the weak international market for Western U.S. coal limited shipments, with tonnage down 15%.", "Before we move on to Ag, please note that this slide shows the ease in comp we had year-over-year in the second quarter. Ag Products revenue declined 9%, with volume down 9% and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Last summer's drought continued to impact grain carloadings, with first quarter down 19% from last year.", "Domestic feed grain shipments declined as tight U.S. corn supplies, especially in UP served territories led to reductions in livestock feedings and increased reliance on local feed crop. Export feed grain shipments also declined with improved world production and lower U.S. supplies. Grain product shipments were down 4%, as reduced demand for gasoline has increased use of lending credits from previous years to meet the mandate to over 10% decline in ethanol shipment. A reduced supply and greater emphasis on meeting local demand impacted DDG volumes, which fell 26%. Food and refrigerated shipments also declined 3%, driven by lower sugar imports from Mexico and new restrictions in Russia and China that imported limit -- that limited import of U.S. meat and poultry.", "Automotive volume grew 2%, which combined with an 11% increase in average revenue per car drove a 13% increase in revenue. The growth rate of the Automotive industry continued to outpace that of the overall economy during the first quarter. Drivers that helped the momentum in the Automotive market last year continued into the first quarter, largely pent-up demand and an improving overall economy. New fuel-efficient models equipped with more features and technology appeared to be compelling consumers to replace vehicles.", "In addition, a rebound in the housing and construction market have increased demand for light trucks. While sales continued to grow, our finished vehicles shipments lag as OEMs had unscheduled downtime to deal with product refreshes and dealers sold off existing inventories to support sales. Parts volumes increased 5%, while pricing gains and the previously announced Pacer network logistics management arrangement increased average revenue per car.", "Chemicals revenue increased 14%, reflecting a 12% increase in volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Crude oil volume increased 11% from the previous quarter, more than doubled when compared to the first quarter of 2012. Growth was driven by increased shipments from Bakken, Western Oklahoma and West Texas shale plays UP served terminals, primarily in St. James, Louisiana and the Texas Gulf Coast.", "Plastics volume was up 3%, driven by the increased domestic demand and new business. Growth in the export market was the primary driver of the 4% growth in soda ash. Strong demand from Eastern Origins, Louisiana, as well as new business at the Gulf Coast led to growth in LP Gas, with shipments up 13%.", "Industrial Products revenue increased 6% even as volume remains flat, driven by a 7% improvement in average revenue per car. Nonmetallic materials volume was up 11%, as continued growth in shale-related drilling increased fracs and shipments. Growth in housing starts and residential improvements increased the demand for lumber, with shipments up 18%. Hazardous waste shipments declined 63%, as costs on government spending resulted in production curtailments during the first 2 months of the year, impacting uranium tailing shipments. The slow start for pipeline projects, lower steel production and softer demand for export scrap was reflected in the 10% decline in steel and scrap. Continued mining production issues continued to hamper our expert iron ore shipments, leading to a 5% decline in metallic minerals.", "Intermodal revenue grew 9%, as a 4% improvement in average revenue per car -- per unit, combined with the 4% increase in volume. Although the pace of recovery is slow, continued strengthening of the economy drove International Intermodal up 8%. While we continued to secure highway conversions with multi-carrier and premium LTL customers, overall domestic Intermodal shipments were flat, as these gains were offset by declines in select markets.", "A closer look at the remainder of 2013. Most economic projections continued to forecast slow economic growth. Although we face continued challenges in some markets, our diverse franchise still provides opportunity to grow in others. Despite softness in coal demand and the previously announced loss of a customer contract at the beginning of the year, we expect coal volumes in the second quarter to see slight gains against an ease in comp last year. This assume the continuation of recent trends in natural gas prices and further coal stockpile reductions.", "For the full year, we still expect coal volumes to be down slightly. We'll continue to feel the impact of the drought on last year's grain crop through the first half of this year, with second quarter Ag product volume expected to be down in the low double digits. Expectation for a more normal crop harvest in 2013 should provide opportunity later in the year.", "First quarter Auto sales were at a seasonably adjusted annual rate of $15.2 million, the highest quarterly level in 5 years. The steady pace is expected to continue throughout the year, which combined with declining dealer inventories, should be good news for our Automotive business.", "Crude oil should continue to drive Chemicals growth, but the pace will ease against the ramp up of volumes realized throughout 2012. Most other chemical markets are expected to remain solid.", "Industrial Products should also continue to benefit from shale-related growth, with increased drilling activity and a ramp up in pipeline projects after a slow start to the year. The housing recovery continues to gain momentum, which is expected to drive demand for lumber. Iron ore moves are expected to decline due to softer export demand and mining production issues.", "Successful conversion of highway business is expected to drive Domestic Intermodal growth, while modest economic growth and the strengthening housing markets should ease International Intermodal ahead of last year.", "For the full year, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development opportunities across our broad portfolio of business. Assuming the economy cooperates, we will see a more normal summer weather patterns, we expect a slight volume increase combined with price gains to drive profitable revenue growth.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thank you, Eric. And good morning. Let's start with our safety results. Our first quarter reportable personal injury rate increased from first quarter 2012. The reportable incident rate was abnormally high in February but moderated substantially in March, and continued to show improvement year-over-year at the start of this quarter. Severe injuries declined sharply in the first quarter, reflecting our work to reduce the risk of critical incidents and the growth and maturation of our Total Safety Culture.", "Rail equipment incidents or derailments improved to an all-time quarterly record. This improvement is largely the result of reduction in track cost derailments, which is a direct reflection of the investments we've made to harden our infrastructure. We also reaped the benefits from technological advancements and equipment defect detection.", "Moving to public safety. Our grade crossing incident rate increased about 14% from the first quarter 2012. Our grade crossing incident exposure is increasing due to growing rail and highway traffic in the South, which has a higher grade crossing density than our overall network. Driver behavior was a meaningful contributor, with an increase from vehicle striking our trains or not properly stopping at crossings. As I've said in January, we continued to focus on identifying and improving or closing high-risk crossings, and reinforcing public awareness and safe driving practices.", "Now let's take a quick look at the traffic pattern shifts we continued to experience on the network.", "volumes on the southern region of our network continued to grow. In the South, we are near all-time peak carload volume last seen in 2006 and we are moving it more efficiently, with train speed up about 14% compared to 2006. While service was good by historical standards in the South, we experienced modest operational challenges during the first quarter, which were reflected in our monthly velocity and terminal dwell numbers. We responded aggressively by leveraging our fluid routes and terminals and realigning critical resources. As a result, we completed an aggressive first quarter capital renewal program in the South, and I am pleased to report fluidity has improved substantially over the last few weeks.", "We are also making continued capacity investments to support volume growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses in the South. We expect 2013 capacity spending to top 2012, which includes critical double track additions, siding extensions and terminal capacity. These projects, along with continued process efficiencies, should support further improvement in network fluidity and service performance.", "The first quarter service results were solid, and our network is well-positioned to handle future volume growth. Velocity was basically flat compared to the first quarter of 2012, with the modest slippage I mentioned in the South, offset by a strong results in other parts of the network.", "We continued to provide outstanding local service to our customers with the first quarter best 95% industry Spot & Pull, which measures the on-time delivery of pulling of a car to or from a customer. Our Service Delivery Index, the measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, declined modestly compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decline reflects tighter service commitments to our customers, with service challenges discussed earlier and the mix shift from coal to manifest.", "Network fundamentals remained solid. We are increasing capacity in the southern region and we have available capacity in many other parts of the network, as well as roughly 450 employees per load and about 800 locomotives in storage.", "Moving on to network productivity. Slow order miles declined 25% to a best-ever quarter -- first quarter level. Our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investments in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures. And we continued to leverage existing resources as our Intermodal and Manifest business volumes grow. During the first quarter, we turned the 4% growth in Intermodal volume into an average train size increase of 2%. Intermodal, Manifest, Coal and Grain Train Size lengths offset new first quarter records. Continued deployment of DPU locomotives, our capital investment strategy and process improvements should continue to drive efficiency gains going forward.", "Car utilization was 1% unfavorable versus the first quarter of 2012 due to mix. Mix being equal, our car utilization rate would have been unchanged from last year's first quarter. The UP Way is playing a vital role in these results. Employee engagement is critical to the success of our average strategy, and as the team's doing the work to take ownership of improving the process and outcomes.", "We remain optimistic on our full year operating outlook for 2013, and our ability to achieve continued network improvements on various fronts. Our first quarter results were solid, and there is room for improvement. I am encouraged by what I am seeing at the start of the second quarter, and for the full year, my expectation is that we will operate at record safety levels, while improving service and bringing more productivity to the bottom line. We are committed to operate a safer railroad for the benefit of all of our stakeholders, our employees, customers, the public and our shareholders. We will remain agile managing network resources in response to dynamic market shifts while handling growth with efficient and reliable service. Our continuous improvement efforts, particularly the UP Way, will generate further efficiency improvements that add value for our customers. And we will continue to make smart capital investments that generate attractive returns by increasing capacity and high-volume quarters, while also supporting our safety, service and productivity initiatives.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Before I get started, I'd like to make everyone aware that the 2012 Fact Book will be available tomorrow morning on the Union Pacific website under the Investors tab.", "So with that, let's start by summarizing our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 3% to a first quarter record of nearly $5.3 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains. Operating expense totaled $3.7 billion, increasing 2%. Operating income grew 8% to $1.6 billion, also setting a best-ever first quarter mark. Below the line, other income totaled $40 million, up $24 million compared to 2012. A onetime land lease contract settlement added roughly $0.02 in earnings per share compared to last year, which we do not expect to repeat going forward. For the full year, we're projecting other income to be in the $100 million to $120 million range barring any other unusual adjustments.", "Interest expense of $128 million was down $7 million, driven by lower average interest rate of 5.6% compared to 6.1% last year. Income tax expense increased to $588 million, driven by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 11% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance declined 2% as a result of our share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a first quarter earnings record of $2.03 per share, up 13% versus 2012.", "Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 3% to nearly $5 billion. Volume was down a little over 2 points, partially offset by more than a 0.5 point of positive mix. Fuel surcharge recovery added roughly 0.5 point in freight revenue compared to 2012. We also achieved solid core pricing gains of 4%, which was a key contributor to our record first quarter financial performance. Lower coal volumes, again, hindered further pricing gains.", "Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides the summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was about flat compared to 2012. Lower volume costs and productivity gains mostly offset inflationary pressures of about 2.5%. And as Lance just discussed, shifts in traffic mix and significant capital replacement work in the South had an impact on operations and associated costs during the quarter.", "Workforce levels increased 2% in the quarter, mostly driven by a shift in traffic mix to more Manifest business, which require additional resources. Increased capital and Positive Train Control activity also contributed to the growth.", "Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $900 million, decreasing $26 million versus 2012. A 5% decline in gross ton-miles drove the reduction in costs. Although our average fuel price was flat year-over-year, our consumption rate increased 3%, mainly driven by lower coal volumes.", "Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $557 million due to higher locomotive and freight car contract repair expenses. In addition, under the new Pacer agreement, we're seeing higher costs in the form of logistics management fees and container costs not incurred under the previous agreement structure. These costs, both the purchased services and equipment rent expense line, and are recouped in our Automotive freight revenue line.", "Depreciation expense increased 2% to $434 million. The impact that increased capital spending in recent years was partially offset by a new equipment rate study that we discussed with you earlier this year. Looking at the full year 2013, we expect depreciation expense to be up in the 2% to 3% range versus 2012.", "Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $313 million, up 6% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses and growth in Automotive and Intermodal shipments resulted in higher freight car rental expense. Lower freight car and locomotive lease expense partially offset these increases.", "Other expenses came in at $237 million, up $21 million versus last year. Higher property tax expense and increased equipment and freight damage costs were the primary drivers. Lower personal injury expense partially offset these increases. For the remainder of 2013, we expect the other expense line to moderate slightly, more in the neighborhood of $225 million a quarter barring any unusual items.", "Turning now to our operating ratio performance. For the first time in our history, we achieved sub70 first quarter operating ratio of 69.1%, improving 1.4 points compared to last year. Our performance highlights the positive impact of solid core pricing gains and network efficiency, and is also noteworthy given the fact that we had 2% decline in volume levels this quarter. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving a full year sub-65 operating ratio by 2017.", "Union Pacific's record first quarter earnings drove strong cash from operations of more than $1.5 billion. Free cash flow of $401 million reflects the 12% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2012.", "Our balance sheet remains strong supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At quarter end, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 40.2%, which includes our March debt issuance of $650 million. Opportunistic share repurchases continued to play an import rant role in our balanced approach to cash allocations. In the first quarter, we bought back nearly 2.9 million shares, totaling $394 million. Since 2007, we purchased over 94 million shares at an average price of around $80 per share. Looking ahead, we have about 12.2 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.", "So that's a recap of our first quarter results. Looking at the second quarter. Although our full comparison is much easier, we'll see ongoing challenges with weak grain volumes. However, assuming continued growth in the other market sectors, we would expect our second quarter volumes to be flattish year-over-year.", "Aside from volume levels, we'll continue to target inflation-plus pricing gains. We'll also realize the benefits from continued productivity and network efficiency. For the full year, assuming the economy continues along its positive trend with industrial production growth of around 2%, we would expect to see volumes on the positive side of the ledger. We're well-positioned to achieve yet another record financial year, with best ever marks in earnings and operating ratio, driving even greater shareholder returns this year.", "So with that, I'll turn it back to Jack.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thanks, Rob. While there is still much uncertainty in the year ahead our diverse franchise does really support our continued focus on profitable growth opportunities. We continued to pursue evolving business development prospects supported by our value proposition and the efficiencies that rail transportation provides. We're also well positioned for upside, but we are just as prepared if our environment should take a turn for the worse. We remain committed to providing safe, efficient, reliable service for our customers to drive greater customer value, and increase shareholder returns in the future.", "So with that, let's open it up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to ask you about one of the popular topics, the crude-by-rail here. How would you view the potential impact of a decline in oil prices and also changes in the WTI brand spread? Or if you look at other spreads that might be helpful for inland crude moves, is that a material source of risk in the near term to volumes? Or are your contracts set up in a way that you have commitments, and so you don't have much sensitivity to the price and the spread moves?", "John J. Koraleski", "Tom, I think certainly, it depends on the order of magnitude of the moves that were to take place. We don't see anything in the horizon at this point in time that gives us any concern. But Eric, why don't you explain on those?", "Eric L. Butler", "Tom, there are couple of factors. We've said previously, crude-by-rail provides a great value proposition to the producers in terms of agility, in terms of being able to get to destinations that they previously couldn't get to. So all of that -- those value factors remain. Certainly, if the price of oil goes to levels, pick a number, below 70s, mid-60s, that's going to impact the amount of production, which, as the total production numbers come down, the total numbers that will go crude-by-rail will come down. So that clearly will have an impact if price of oil goes down. In terms of the spreads, we're probably less concerned about the spreads narrowing. Again, as the value proposition we've talked several times in the past publicly with crude-by-rail that, again, gets you to destinations, allows -- the producers flexibility and agility. So we think that even if the spreads get to some narrow -- some low single-digit numbers, there are still a value proposition for crude by rail. The biggest factor is if crude production goes down, then certainly, that impacts us.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And what about the structure of the contracts that you have in place into the St. James market? Are there some commitments that are multi-year where you would have some minimum volumes into those markets? Or is it set up in a way that, if things really changed, that there would necessarily be volume commitments?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. We said, we don't really talk about specific customer agreements. What I would say that you can look at is the fact that the destination providers and the origin producers, they're investing huge dollar amounts of capital to do crude-by-rail, both in terms of freight cars and facilities. So that should be a comforting indicator in terms of their long-term commitment to crude-by-rail.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Rob, can you just talk about the outlook there that you just ran through? If you look at truck carloads for the second quarter, do you still see coal moderating? Is Ag accelerating on the downside? Maybe if you can give a little bit more insight onto some color on what's in that in your targets there.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Ken, just kind of reiterate what both Eric and I talked about. Keep in mind, as I think you know, the coal falloff that we saw year-over-year in the first quarter being down 19%. Last year, you recall, we sort of hit the trough on coal, so we do have clearly an easier comp on coal as we head into the second quarter. But as Eric mentioned, we do envision that the Ag drought will continue certainly through the second quarter, and we estimate that's going to be down in the, call it, low double digits, which is a little bit worse year-over-year, if you will, compared to what we saw last year. So when you add it all up, the guidance that we're giving is -- assuming all the other markets remain about constant with what we saw in the first quarter, that feels flattish to us. But full year, again, if the economy continues to cooperate, which thus far it is, all of those things will sort of neutralize, if you will, when we get to back half of the year. We think at the end of the day, at the end of the year, we'll have volumes that, overall, on a positive side of the ledger.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And If I can do my follow-up on pricing. Was there any -- on the coal side, were there any contract settlements within that -- within the yields? And then also within pricing, you mentioned the Pacer agreement a couple of times. Can you kind of talk about or walk through the level of increase? I know you don't like talking about specific contracts, but maybe just magnitude of what we're looking at or continued to go forward on that contract? And then similarly on pricing on Domestic Intermodal side, I think you mentioned it was flat. Can you just kind of run through what you're seeing impact on those -- on that as well?", "Robert M. Knight", "Ken, this is Rob. Let me take the first point, and you asked about the settlements in the Coal line. There's a little bit in there. We're not calling out precisely what it is. But it's a little bit of an impact on the ARC and the coal. And in terms of the other pricing discussions, we don't break out by  -- we don't talk about pricing on particular arrangements or agreements. So Ken, I'm not sure what your question was.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess you mentioned that the Auto pricing was up significantly because of the Pacer agreement, so you kind of called it out on there. I mean, can you give us, I guess, an understanding of what Auto would be like without the agreement? I mean, it was a big number in terms of the 10% increase. Is it half of that in terms of magnitude?", "Robert M. Knight", "Ken, this is Rob again. I mean, the impact on the Autos ARC of that new agreement, it's a 50-50 [ph] in that number. So clearly, it's deflated [ph], if you will, the ARC number. But that pacer agreement, as I think, everybody is aware, as previously announced, is really kind of a neutralizing effect. I mean, it's showing up both on the revenue and expense line, but it doesn't change the full year economics to us, the bottom line. But there is a positive impact that's showing up in that ARC number on the Autos line. And you will see that, full year.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, just on the Domestic Intermodal, as you had mentioned, something on [ph] flat there. I just wanted to understand that as well.", "John J. Koraleski", "Domestic Intermodal.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. We are continuing to see strength in our Domestic Intermodal business at the minute [ph]. I think I mentioned our conversion strategy is going well. We're continuing to price with the market, and we're continuing to be pleased with the performance in that business.", "John J. Koraleski", "The volume was flat in the first quarter, Ken. Is that -- was that your question?", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Oh, it's volume, okay. It's not price, yes.", "John J. Koraleski", "It's volume, not price.", "Robert M. Knight", "Ken, this is Rob. If I can just make one clarifying point on the Pacer questions you asked. I said that the Autos ARC reflected that this new agreement, but it's not reflected in our 4% core pricing number that we report. That's not -- that doesn't factor anything related in that number.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "So I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of those things from the last question. With the coal yields being so strong, if it's not legacy repricing, can you give us a sense of maybe what's driving that strength and if you think it's sustainable? And then, Rob, you mentioned that you're getting good coal yields even without the volume. As the volume starts to come back, can the coal yields -- or should they get even better from what we found in the first quarter?", "John J. Koraleski", "Scott, when you look at the pricing of our coal overall, there was some legacy impact from prior contracts that have been settled, and there was also -- that's the normal escalations that we have in our new contracts going forward. There were some incremental fuel surcharge. There was a little bit of liquidated damages, but not very much. So that's really it.", "Robert M. Knight", "Scott, if I  can just make one comment. The ARC number that we reported in the first quarter for -- in addition to the comments that Jack just mentioned, there is the mix effect in there. So that -- again, if you look at our overall pricing as an enterprise, we report a 4% price. And as I mentioned in my comments, it's hindered somewhat by the lack of volume in coal. But if you're searching [indiscernible], we don't break it out by commodities what the pricing actually was. But it is appropriate to take into consideration that the ARC number we reported in coal did have some mixed effect in it.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "So when you add up all those kind of moving parts of maybe some liquidated damages that don't continue, and maybe coal coming back in some parts of the network, is this kind of double-digit run rate on ARC still sustainable for the year?", "Robert M. Knight", "It will depend upon the mix. Again, what we're looking at overall in our pricing is to be inflation plus kind of pricing overall, and that's how we approach the business overall. But when you look any individual commodity groups ARC, you can get swings either way depending on the mix of traffic that we move that quarter.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "That makes sense. And just last thing on the Domestic Intermodal. I'm a little confused if you're talking about the highway conversions going well, but domestic volumes were flat. What's offsetting that in the quarter? And just any color you can give us there would be great.", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. As I mentioned, in a couple of select markets, there were some competitive select markets that had some volume reductions and...", "John J. Koraleski", "Hey, Scott, let me take you back to our past comments, which is, as we take our prices up, there are some business is that's going to fall away from the railroad because it doesn't meet our reinvestable standards. And so we saw some of that. So we were taking some prices up, we've got some new business in highway conversions and we lost some business that needed our reinvestability threshold.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to ask a question on the cost side. When we look at compensation and benefits, it's actually been flat to down for the last 4 quarters or so. How should we think about headcounts and wage inflation, and some of the offsetting efficiencies that you're getting in the network for the rest of the year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "The way we -- the guidance that we've given on the head -- let's me start with the headcount question first. Overall headcount for the year, we would expect to float with volume. So again, our projection is that, assuming the economy cooperates, that our volume will be on the positive side of ledger. So the way I would look at it is that we expect volume to be up year-over-year, but not necessarily 1:1 because there is certainly productivity savings we will achieve throughout the year. On the cost side, the way I think I would guide you to look at, the way I would expect cost to flow through is we think our labor inflation is going to be around 3%. There were some timing issues that resulted in it being flat, you're right, this quarter end, a previous couple of quarters. But probably the right way to look at it is expect that, that inflation on the wage lines would be around 3% going forward.", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob, one other thing to note and we mentioned it in our commentary, headcount will also flux with CapEx and with mix shift to manifest.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "From that guidance, Rob, then, I mean, should we be looking for more normal comp and then inflation of 3% throughout the year, I mean, depending obviously on the volume outlook then?", "Robert M. Knight", "I think that's the right way to look at it.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then quickly on purchase services. You mentioned that the Pacer agreement did escalate costs there. Is that the new run rate that we saw in the quarter for the rest of the year as well?", "Robert M. Knight", "There could be lots of factors. Obviously, volume overall will play a part in there. But that particular item that we saw in the first quarter will repeat throughout the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jack or Rob, can I just ask you to comment a little bit on the return of capital approach? When you think about sort of the circumstances that might cause you to be a little bit more aggressive there or maybe change the way you think about leverage, because I know you do debt-to-capital. But I think if you look at it on a debt-to-EBITDA basis or in interest coverage basis, you've been pretty conservatively levered. So maybe you can just comment a little bit on what's circumstance you might be willing to be more aggressive in that regard?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Bill, I mean, as we've said before, we haven't changed our approach. We don't look at just debt-to-cap because we use that as one of the measures that we talk publicly about. We look at all the measures. But where it all starts is we're focus on generating the cash, to begin with. We'll continue then to deploy the cash by making investments in capital projects where we're confident the returns there. We expect [ph] the 30% payout on the dividends, so we would expect that as earnings continue to grow, we expect the dividends to continue to grow along with it. And then we will continue to be opportunistic on the share repurchase activities that, in fact, we've been deploying for the last X number of years. So in terms of when you add it all up, Bill, as you've heard me say before, we are still comfortable in that 40s -- low 40s debt-to-cap ratio. That's not how we drive our business, but that's the kind of resulting measure that we are still very comfortable with it.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Rob, you also made a comment in your comments about core price, and I just want to make sure I understood it, and that is that some of the coal that's repriced didn't move, and I think, if we think back to '12, that kind of caused the reported core price metric to be a little bit lower in light of otherwise been the case. Was that a material impact this quarter again? I would have thought we're certain to lap it, but maybe you can just give a little clarity there.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Bill, compared to sort of normal run rates, which is always the elusive part of that calculation, we call it about 0.5 point of price that did not materialize, had the higher levels of coal volume moved under those repriced contracts. So we reported 4% core price had it been sort of normal run rates of volumes in the coal world on those repriced contracts, it would've looked more like 4.5.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "All right. And then one last one just on nat gas, how soon is it at nat gas prices like this when we see the customers start to react? Is that a lag of like 6 months or 12 months? How do we think about that?", "John J. Koraleski", "Bill, actually, overall, we have seen customers start to make the shift back from natural gas to coal. The bigger problem right at the moment is there's not much demand for electricity or the demand for electricity is softer. So even though we've actually seen some customers start shifting back and taking more coal, we have not seen a substantial increase in coal shipments yet.", "Eric L. Butler", "If -- this is Eric. If you look back at last year this time, coal market share of electrical generation was down in the low 30% -- it's probably 32%, 33%, 34%. Today, it's about 40%. So clearly coal has regained market share at 4, 4.20 natural gas. As Jack said, the demand for overall electrical generation is still down as the economy is still coming back. And we're in shelf months in terms of weather patterns. So both of those are impacting the overall electrical demand.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Robert Salmon", "It's Rob on for Justin. Eric, could you talk a little bit more with regard to your coal outlook? This morning, Peabody raised their expectation in terms of the coal burn by about $20 million on both the high and low end for the U.S. What sort of growth are you guys expecting in terms of consumption across your utilities, and would that imply upside to what's baked into your guidance currently?", "Robert M. Knight", "I think -- and, Rob, in our comments, we kind of indicated -- we said flat to slightly increase from the second quarter with the easier comps. The fundamental issue really is going to come down to the overall demand, and then how competitive coal will be against the natural gas. So you need the economy to come back strong. You need the large steel mills to start using electrical generation. You need normal weather patterns in the summer. And as all of those things happen, you'll see the demand for electricity go up. And again, as I said, current natural -- current coal market share has grown back to 40%. It will never get back to the 50%, that it historically was, but it's better than the low-30s. So I haven't seen that Peabody outlook. But my guess is that they're expecting normal weather patterns and continued economic growth in the economy to drive electrical demand.", "Robert Salmon", "No, that's fair. Coal's always a tough one to model. Looking forward, I guess, Rob, circling back on Bill Greene's prior question. When you're saying with coal getting back to kind of normal type burn levels, would flat year-over-year in Q2 imply normal coal levels and we should be thinking about kind of a 4.5% core improvement looking forward?", "Robert M. Knight", "It's always difficult to predict what normal is. But we are assuming, as Eric said, the positive news of coal being a greater market share. We do have the easier comp. And if volumes materialize, we would hope to see that in our margins on that business that we've repriced. So I guess I would say that we are looking at things to be more normal as we look out for the balance of the year.", "Robert Salmon", "That's helpful. And I guess before I turn it over, Lance, if you could talk to the Intermodal train length extension, you saw over kind of 2% year-over-year improvement on Intermodal boxes. Could you talk how that played out on both the domestic and the international train starts across your Intermodal franchise?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. Off the top of my head, I do not have the detail on how that splits out between the 2. I can tell you that we do have sized opportunities on both. I would say they're probably more on the domestic side. But we've got plenty of train size opportunity both sides.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe just a question on the coal inventories. Eric, I know you mentioned that they're still elevated, could you just give us a rough sense of kind of where they stand relative to historical norms? I mean, are we still pretty far away from getting back to normalized levels?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So the numbers haven't come out for the latest month. But as of the numbers that came out in March, they still showed overall for the whole country, 11 days above normal. There's probably some pretty wide swings in that number between Eastern utilities and Western utilities. I would expect a large number of the utilities in our serving area are putting -- getting pretty close to normal. There are probably some that are below normal because they've taken some aggressive inventory actions. So I would expect that we can see next month as the number come out, you'll see some pretty normal and may even perhaps below normal inventory numbers.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And is there any reason to think that the level of what should be normal changes at all going forward just with the relationship between natural gas and kind of where we are currently with the shale activity, or kind of old normal is the right way to think about it?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. I don't really see a huge change for the coal-centric utilities. They're still -- it's in their best interest to burn coal, and they're in essence competing against the natural gas-centric utilities. And so they're going to get their burn patterns up and they need a certain run rate to protect their burn pattern, to protect against outages. So I don't see a significant shift in what has been historical normal inventory patterns for coal-centric utilities.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And I just want to come back to, and I apologize, just on the mix aspect within coal yields. I'm trying to get kind of a handle on how to think about that. Can you give us a little bit of color of what kind of drives the big mix changes? It's just seeing more volume that had been repriced, legacy volume that have been repriced moving relative to other business within the commodity group, or I guess we're just trying to think about how to project this out in the next couple of quarters. So if there's any little bit of color around the positive mix dynamic in the first quarter would be helpful.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So when we talk about mix, we're talking about the mix of Southern Powder River Basin coal, Colorado/Utah coal, export coal, et cetera. And so if you look at some of the places where there are volume -- volume reductions, we've had positive mix in other areas because of some of the new Southern Powder River Basin coal opportunity that we have.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So not to beat a dead horse, but I do have a couple of follow-ups on coal. First of all, can you just give us a ballpark out of the, let's say, 19 percentage point decline that you had in coal in Q1? How much of that was associated with the loss business? Was it 5 points out of the 19 or something in that neighborhood?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, Chris, the contract that we've spoken about previously was about 5 percentage points on the volume.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then if I kind of put together all the things that you've talked about so far that coal is back up to 40% of the burn, that inventories at the utilities in the west are back to normal or maybe below normal, your comps are getting easier. If we start to see increased volumes of coal, should we expect that the pricing gets better because you'll start to move some of the stuff that you didn't move last year, where you had recontracted at higher rates?", "John J. Koraleski", "It's really largely dependent on which customers grow, and what areas and how those kind of play themselves out.", "Eric L. Butler", "And again, as we've talked in the past about our pricing calculations, certain things may not come up in our pricing calculations, but they will show in improved margins as repriced business that those volumes come back, you'll see that in our margins even if you don't see it in our pricing calculation.", "Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one follow-up. The depreciation, bonus depreciation, Rob, what -- how much of a drag on cash flow do you think that might be for UP in 2013 versus 2012?", "Robert M. Knight", "Of course, as you know, we're getting still the benefit in 2013 of 50% bonus depreciation. So, which is what it was last year. So that is not a huge driver in 2013. But starting in 2014, we'll start to feel the impact of -- assuming there's no bonus depreciation beyond '13, we'll start to feel more of an impact. There's a slight benefit this year when you add it all up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just wanted to follow up again on the Intermodal side. I think when we look at the highway conversion opportunity, I think, largely, the assumption has been that given your length of haul, you have somewhat less of an opportunity than perhaps some of your eastern peers. Have you looked at the market for hauls of above, say, 500 or 600 miles to address what that upside opportunity is, and can you share that with us if you had a look at that?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure, we have. Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Walter, I guess I'm not necessarily sure I'm tracking why a longer length of haul should result in fewer opportunity. We actually think the opposite that longer length of haul should result in more opportunities. The current total size of our Intermodal book of business is about 3 million units a year, closely equally divided between domestic and international. We size the domestic attainable market opportunity, and we talked about this in Dallas, I think, last fall. We size that as somewhere around 10 million units. Now, not all of that will be easy to convert. If you look at customers, there's a stratification of large, mid-sized and smaller customers. The large customers, the Walmarts, the Targets of the world, they are very intermodal centric already because they see the benefits of Intermodal. They could tune their supply chains to Intermodal. If you go to the mid-sized and smaller customers, we certainly -- that's the target rich environment, and we're working aggressively to sell the value of Intermodal to them, and some of that requires them to tune their supply chains a little differently, but that's the market opportunity, the business development opportunity, and frankly, why we're so excited about the future potential.", "John J. Koraleski", "And Walter, when Eric talks about the 10 million opportunity, that does not include another 2.5 million to 3 million trucks that moves back and forth between Mexico and the United States. And as you know, we're building a new Intermodal facility down in Santa Teresa to really target that Northern Mexico, the maquiladoras and those kinds of things, which will hopefully make a dent in that 2.5 million to 3 million unit opportunity as well.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That's great color. Can you give us a sense of the available capacity on average of your Intermodal trains? Roughly how much incremental volume could we see go onto your new -- or Intermodal network without at fairly high incremental margin?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure, how about Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. So again, that depends very much on the length that the opportunity show up in. But just giving you an aggregate sense, I think we've averaged, what, 170 units a train in the first quarter, and most of our lanes could probably handle 250 plus/minus units. Again, very dependent on where it shows up and lanes specific.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And you're fully -- - double-stack capable roughly your network?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Virtually everywhere.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "I just had a question about your Ag business. Obviously, the USDA is forecasting some pretty large crops this year. I just wonder as you look out over your draw territory, what's your read on soil moisture conditions and I guess, the risk of continued dryness in some areas and floods in others?", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, I tell you what, right here in Nebraska, after the past month or so, we're about ready to stick a fork in this drought. We've had some nice heavy rains and heavy snows and things like that. And hopefully, that is doing its job in terms of replenishing the moisture content ground. Eric, you want to put some technical around that?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, if you look at last year, Cheryl, the USDA said last year was going to be 1 of the 5 best years in all of history, and then we know what happened. So I take forecast with a grain of salt that this time of the year simply because so much of it is weather dependent. As Jack said, it appears to be a great start in our growing season, nice moisture in our key breadbaskets, we're all excited about that. We're not out of the woods yet, and we do need it to continue. And you not only need it certainly for the spring planting season, but you also need moisture in the critical parts of the heat of the summer. So there's a long tail left before we can feel comfortable about the predictions of what will happen in the harvest at the late -- latter part of the year.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "Okay. And switching gears, just in terms of the public crossing accidents that you're experiencing in the South, which is really a function of your growth there and the whole region's growth, how disruptive for you from an operational standpoint are those? And how quickly do you think you can bring that back down?", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay, Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, sure. Excellent question. And just to predicate, this is an extremely frustrating statistic for us. We've been working very hard on impacting the trend for the past several years particularly down in Texas. The short answer on how disruptive, it varies, but generally speaking, it's a couple hours of downtime as the accident gets investigated and cleaned up. So they are -- they have an impact. It's variability. It's not same order of magnitude typically as a derailment. And in terms of when can we start moving the needle on the number, I'm telling you we're doing everything in our power right now to try to impact that number. As we look at it in large aggregate, we're about on top of last year's statistics. They're pretty volatile. So what you saw in the first quarter is a little degradation. But in general, absolute number, we're a bit worse but trying to navigate on top of last year's number. It involves a lot of things like an audit and blitz of our railroad to find where the risk is. The risk moves and grows rapidly with development of industry around us and in engaging the local authorities to care as deeply about the issue as we do to impact driver behavior. So there's a lot of activity going on there.", "John J. Koraleski", "That's a very difficult issue, and sometimes, you just -- I was surprised actually that we don't have the power to even put a stop sign up without getting the approval of local authorities, and sometimes, they just say no. So there are some pretty significant obstacles out there towards changing driver behavior and getting everybody on the same page as we are as to how important this is.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I'd like to follow up on the comment about cross-border. Can you just remind us how much Mexico contributes to the bottom line presently? And given the tremendous growth prospects, what do you think it might look like over the next few years?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Tom, we don't give the bottom line, but I'll give you the top line. It represents about 10% of our business levels currently, and it's been growing nicely the last several years across the board. The mix of the commodities has been growing at a pace greater than our overall volumes have been growing.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a more housekeeping-related question. With regard to the $40 million in other income, we estimate that -- I think you mentioned land sales contributed about $0.02 a share, what's the remainder of the $40 million?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Miscellaneous transactions. I don't -- I wouldn't call anything out in particular that was driving that. That's relatively -- the balance would represent a relatively normal run rate for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division", "I guess my questions more longer term here. I look at your 65% OR target by 2017, and to me, it seems fairly attainable. I mean, you just reported a first quarter that had fewer working days in it, you had a record OR, coal's under pressure, Ag's under pressure. Talk to me about that goal that you have out there and what some of your underlying assumptions are in terms of some of the commodity groups and also your core pricing which also seems fairly strong x coal at 4.5%.", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure, we think it's attainable, too. Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Jason, I mean, you've heard me say this over the years. I mean, it's not an end game, it's the next target that we've put out there, not unlike when we set the original 75% target. We got there as efficiently as we could and got there a little early. Then we set the low 70s, got there as efficiently as we could and got there a little early. We hope to get to this -- the previous sub 67% earlier as we mentioned last fall, and I'd say the same -- make the same comment about the sub 65%. So we're going to get there the same way we're going from where we are today to the sub 65% is the same way we got from the high 80s down to where we are today. And that is efficient safe operations, leveraging productivity, providing great service to our customers allows us to price it fairly. Fuel can obviously be a whipsaw on us, depending on what fuel does in terms in the calculation on the operating ratio. But I would just take comfort that we're going to -- that our assumption is a normal economy. If the economy cooperates and fuel prices are normal, if you will, and we're going to go after it as efficiently and as quickly as we can.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division", "And in terms of your assumptions for coal and its market share versus nat gas in that 65% OR?", "Robert M. Knight", "I mean, we don't get into that level of detail other than I would say, it's sort of a normal. I mean, we certainly think that Powder River Basin Coal is here to stay perhaps at lower levels than what we historically experienced, but our assumption is that it's sort of a normal from here on out if you will.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And my follow-up question, on your Southern region, it seems like you had a little bit of challenges operationally. And is it starting to feel better already in 2Q, and how should we look at that throughout the year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure. Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes. It is starting to look better. The actions that I mentioned in my comments regarding utilizing fluid routes, terminals, making sure we adjusted our resources rapidly, that made a difference in the tail end of March, and we're looking much more favorable in the South right now in the first few weeks of this quarter.", "John J. Koraleski", "Plus, we had our maintenance programs were very heavy in the first quarter, that was planned. Those are now starting to be completed and some additional capacity projects coming on as we go through the year with capital, and each one of those adds a margin of fluidity and improvement in our variability.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So all things being equal, we should start seeing that come out in your weekly performance numbers?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, I expect so.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "This is probably related to Jason's question there, I guess, on how the improvements were accomplished in the Southern region fluidity, but related of years' $1 billion or so growth in productivity CapEx, at this point, can you cite a couple of projects that are perhaps most material likely to impact income or ROIC over the rest of the year and next?", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. So we've got some new capacity and commercial facility spending, that will have some impact. We've got a very large facility in Santa Teresa. It includes an Intermodal ramp that we think is going to really aid what Jack talked about in terms of cross-border truck traffic and conversion to Intermodal, plus a fueling facility. We've got some excellent work going on in terms of more fluid operations to our crude oil destinations. We should see benefits of that over the years. We've got capacity that's being spent up in the northern tier of our network, as well as in Texas to enable incremental, more fluid frac sand movement. We've really got it spread all over the railroad, largely concentrated in Texas from Louisiana, but there are key projects all over the railroad that are unlocking critical pieces of capacity for us.", "John J. Koraleski", "There are some things, Keith, that we have kind of scaled back given the volumes that we're seeing and in the way the economy is running like for instance, the double tracking of the Sunset Corridor, where we're 70% done with that and -- but we're pacing it a little differently to watch in terms of the volume, but long-term potential is the ability to take that from 55 trains a day to 90, which would be a huge step forward for us. We have the Mississippi River bridge that we're continuing to work on, that is a key bottleneck that would be eliminated as we go through that project. In the Blair -- we have a Blair cutoff that is not order of magnitude, that big, but anything that would save 3 to 4 hours of transit time on the trains that go through our Central Corridor to Chicago eventually helps the bottom line enormously.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And maybe a one quick shorter-term question perhaps for Eric. We're seeing stronger growth in housing at last. Lumber improved 18% probably as a result of that. Could you comment on where and how material housing improvements are showing up elsewhere, be it light trucks, some Intermodal, et cetera?", "Eric L. Butler", "Great question. We're excited about the housing improvement finally. It -- housing is actually running ahead of the original Global Insight estimates, and I think the housing or the lumber producers are pretty positive about the trends that they're seeing and the housing start numbers that they're seeing. Housing, in addition to impacting lumber, it's also going to impact our Intermodal business. As you know, once homes are built, you have to furnish them. And so both on the International Intermodal business and the Domestic Intermodal business, we think that housing will have an impact on that. We think housing will also have an impact on ancillary business like our steel wheel book rebar business, which goes into construction. Our cement business, our cement business, we think that that will strengthen as housing strengthen. So all of those are things that will go as housing goes.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Eric, it sounds like you're using future tense though, that those are still sort of pending improvements, am I reading that correctly?", "Eric L. Butler", "No. I've been around here long enough. I remember when housing was regularly 1.7 million, 1.8 million starts a year, so even though we're back up to around 970 off a low of -- below 600, 970 still feels low to me. So I will feel like it's back regular normal when it gets above 1.3, 1.4, 1.5.", "John J. Koraleski", "But if you look, Keith, like in our cement business, I think it was up about 6% in the first quarter. Our plastics business, which include things like PVC pipe and those kinds of things that they're using in housing construction were also up in the first quarter. So we are seeing the residual impact that goes along with the incremental lumber.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Mims of FBR Capital Markets.", "John R. Mims - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Just one quick one for me just this late in the call. Eric, I stepped away for a minute, could you repeat what you were saying about International Intermodal, and maybe add to any comments related to outlook for any sort of a peak season in '13?", "Eric L. Butler", "What I was talking about International Intermodal is that as housing starts increase, you need to furnish the homes, and so we do see a trend between International Intermodal upswing as housing start improves, that was the connection that I was making. Last year, what we said was that it was a muted peak season. I think we used those words last year. It's early in the year, and it's -- at this point in the year, what happens, and peak will determine on the economic conditions, consumer confidence, retail sales, all of those things will determine kind of what happens in peak volumes.", "John J. Koraleski", "Right now, we are expecting the Intermodal peak to be stronger than last year. The order of magnitude is -- we're not sure we'll get it, really depends a lot -- bidding season is just coming in right now for a lot of those international contracts between the retailers and the ocean carriers and things like that, so there's still a lot to be determined in terms of how that'll play out for the summer.", "John R. Mims - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Right. Okay. So as of right now, though, it's still just more of a read on the macro versus you having real conversations as far as staging capacity with the liners or with the major shippers?", "John J. Koraleski", "Right, that's right.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just to expound on that, I guess, this 8% growth in the first quarter, I'm assuming that's not a run rate for the balance of the year, and that the first quarter, you did benefit to some degree from certain shippers shifting away from the East Coast to the West Coast ahead of any sort of East Coast ILA strike during the first quarter. Is that the right? Is that the right way to think about the volume, the first quarter volume?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. We do not expect to see that kind of run rate for the year. There was some nominal impact of shifts from the East Coast, but very small. The bigger factor frankly was the timing of the Chinese Lunar New Year this year versus last year, and there was some advanced shipping because of that, that was probably the larger impact. Plus we did see an impact -- inventories were pretty thin after the holiday season last year. And you did see an impact of inventory catch-up by -- in January.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, good. And then on the coal side, I know you kind of earmarked a number of different various items that drove RPU above expectations to the $2,300 level. Is this a good level to be thinking about then? I mean, you kind of -- you hit on mixed legacy, fuel surcharge and some liquidated[ph] damages as well driving that number. But is this $2,300 level a good level to think about for coal as it relates to RPU for the balance of the year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "As we indicated in some previous discussions, I'd be careful using a run rate of ARC because mix can have such an impact on that, up or down. So again, we're going to aggressively go after providing the good service and repricing where we can, but the ARC number can move on you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Maybe more of a conceptual question on the Intermodal side. The UP's service levels have improved dramatically over the last 10 years or so and have generally caught up to the other big Western railroad. And I guess the question is, as you see the service levels right now, where do you think you have a competitive advantage versus the competitor, where do you think the competitor has an advantage? Is that how you think of marketing the service, in particular, power lanes where you might have better on-time performance or a better velocity? And based on some of the investments that you're putting into the ground now, will you see that competitive positioning change at all here over the next couple of years?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, so good question. To start with, we -- as we look at our Intermodal network, we are actually proud of the fact, we go to many more places than our competitor in the West in terms of our franchise, in terms of origin destination points where we have service, too. And that's really the power of the diversity of our franchise. We just get to and from many more places than the customer base. A large portion of the customer base does see value in that. Having said that, for the places where we do compete head to head, we kind of assess where we are very regularly. And we are pleased that in most of the places where we compete head to head, we think our service is as good or materially better, and the majority of the places where we compete head to head. There are a couple of places where our competitor has a slight advantage, and we are continuing to put initiatives and strategies in place to ensure that we have the best service in the industry.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then maybe one question that you don't need to answer if you don't want to, but I'll ask it anyway. With respect to operating ratio as the key metric to focus on for the future, you've said again here today, that you believe you'll get to a 65% or lower for the full year 2017, that seems like a very achievable target as one of the other analysts mentioned. But what happens if in 2016, Eric, comes to Jack with a $400 million project that has a 68% operating ratio on it, does that put you in the position of, perhaps, saying no to that project, or do you feel as though you can still accommodate that and access that incremental traffic? Would return on invested capital be a better measure or some other measure that takes into account, the generation of free cash flow? Just conceptual thought in terms of whether operating ratio is the correct metric?", "John J. Koraleski", "John, when we look at business opportunities at a high level and at a specific level, we're really focused on the reinvestability of the business, our ability to provide good, efficient, safe and consistent service for that customer. And then we deal with it on that basis in terms of the acquisition or whether we take on the business or not. We don't really think about it in terms of the operating ratio. But I will turn that over to Rob in terms of broader discussion of the key measures.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. John, I mean I get your point. And I would say that we set operating ratio target out there just as a way of kind of speaking in our organization as setting our mind towards making financial improvement. But at the end of today, it's focused on returns. So we know we still got room to go in improving our operating ratio, which will improve our earnings, which improves our cash, which if we do all the investments correctly, improves our returns. So they all kind of go together. But at the end of the day, it's the improving our returns.", "John J. Koraleski", "It's a really portfolio of measures.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "It's been a long call and most of mine have been answered, so let me just throw a quick one out there. I see the carloads for the crude business, if I thought about that in terms of trains per day and how to allocate those carloads, roughly how many trains a day are you doing in the crude business relative to how many trains a day for the system total? And is it fair to assume, this would be the follow-up, that it's longer haul business, and therefore, a higher RPU than your average chemical RPU?", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. Trains per day were in the 5 plus/minus ballpark. Length to haul...", "John J. Koraleski", "750 miles.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "All right. And how many trains per day for the total network?", "Lance M. Fritz", "In the total network, boy, varies by day a week and moment in time. But for instance, right now, we probably have 820 trains on our network.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Per day?", "Eric L. Butler", "Excuse me, you're asking a question that I don't think I can answer because the question I just gave you was terminating or originating trains per day on crude, and the trains per day in the network I look at as inventory. So I really can't answer your question the way you've asked it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So Rob, I noted here you're talking about a new equipment rate study on the depreciation line. Did that lower the rate that you guys are depreciating the equipment at for -- on a-go forward basis? So if you could add some color to that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. So I mean, the result of the study was elongated, if you will, the depreciation on those assets, combine that with the fact that we're running a fewer gross ton miles, resulted in a lower depreciation rate than what we've previously experienced.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I think it was 5 -- the depreciation was 5.6% in the last Q. Is it -- can -- do you know the number off the top of your head, or should we just wait for the Q?", "Robert M. Knight", "In the first quarter, depreciation rate was 3%.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "3%, okay. And the fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter?", "Robert M. Knight", "I'm sorry?", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter?", "Robert M. Knight", "About 0.5 point on the revenue line.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "0.5 point on the revenue line, okay.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Long of Stephens.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "In the quarter, your volumes were down a little over 3% sequentially, but operating expenses were up nearly 4% if you look on a sequential basis. Just on a high level, can you talk about some of the puts and takes that drove that discrepancy, and would you say that's not a trend you would expect going forward?", "Robert M. Knight", "Mix is always a factor in that particular calculation when you look at car loading sequentially and the expense going forward. So I guess I would say that take the guidance that we've given you in terms of the components as best you can as best way of looking at it rather than trying to calculate that particular sequential relationship.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then as a follow-up, could you comment briefly on CapEx and remind me where you stand from a railcar equipment perspective, and any investments you might need to make there given your volume outlook for the remainder of the year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure. Our current CapEx is targeted at about $3.6 billion for the year, which is down just a bit from last year. It does include some equipment acquisitions that are needed for our business growth and replacements of retiring assets. If you had some specific question beyond that?", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Maybe specifically, on the car types that you're looking to purchase this year.", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. We're picking up some auto rack. We're picking up some food-grade covered hoppers. we're picking up a handful of other types. Some...", "John J. Koraleski", "Refrigerated boxcars and some containers.", "Robert M. Knight", "And John, it's -- it's less than $200 million of \tthe $3.6 billion just to kind of size if for you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We've come to the end of our time for the questions and answers today. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, great. Thanks so much for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you again in July.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this concludes today's teleconference.

Welcome to the Union Pacific Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski, you may now begin.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today here in Omaha are Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "This morning, we're pleased to announce that Union Pacific achieved an all-time record financial results this quarter. We generated best-ever quarterly earnings of $2.48 per share, an increase of 13% compared to the third quarter of 2012. The quarter was not without its challenges, including headwinds in coal and grain volumes and severe flooding in Colorado that caused network disruptions and shipment delays. But at the end of the day, that's all part of running a railroad.", "We managed our network efficiently, overcoming these challenges and continued to benefit from the strength of our diverse franchise. When combined with real core pricing and productivity gains, we more than offset the flat volumes to generate a new, best-ever quarterly operating ratio of 64.8%.", "We feel very good about our accomplishments this quarter. We're leveraging our capital investments to strengthen the UP franchise and further enhance our value proposition in the marketplace. We remain focused on delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that generates value for our customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders.", "So with that, let's get started this morning. I'll turn it over to Eric.", "Eric L. Butler", "Thanks, Jack, and good morning. In the third quarter, the value and diversity of our franchise allowed volume to finish flat compared to last year despite volume declines in 3 of the business groups. Industrial Products, Automotive and Chemicals led the way with growth. Offsetting that good news were declines in Intermodal, Ag and Coal. Core pricing gains of 3.5%, which, combined with a modest benefit from positive mix, produced a 5% improvement in average revenue per car. The combination of flat volume and improved average revenue per car pushed freight revenue to a record $5.2 billion.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue declined 2% with third quarter volume down 4% and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloadings continued to reflect the impact of last year's drought with third quarter volume down 9%. Domestic feed grain shipments declined as tight U.S. corn supply led to reductions in livestock feeding and increased reliance on local feed crops. Export feed grains also declined with improved world supply and the higher U.S. prices. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase in weak Gulf exports, primarily destined to Brazil. Grain products volume was up 3%, driven by an 11% increase in ethanol shipments as the discounts to gasoline led refineries to replenish low ethanol inventories. Declines in import beer and barley led to a 4% decrease in food and refrigerated volume.", "Automotive volume grew 8%, which, combined with the 9% improvement in average revenue per car, produced a 17% increase in revenue. Growth rates in auto production and sales remained strong in the third quarter, driven by pent-up demand to replace aging vehicles. Even so, the average age of vehicles on the road continued to increase, reaching 11.4 years, with customers replacing them with new models offering improved technology and fuel efficiency. UP finished vehicles shipments grew 5%, and sales continued to grow with seasonally adjusted annual sales rate reaching $15.7 million in the third quarter, the highest quarterly level in 5 years. Parts volume increased 12% while pricing gains in the previously announced Pacer network logistics management arrangement increased average revenue per car.", "Turning now to Coal. You can see from the chart of weekly carloadings that volumes picked up from the second quarter as expected but tracked 7% below last year. Core pricing gains and favorable mix led to a 10% improvement in average revenue per car and produced a 2% increase in revenue. Tonnage from the Southern Powder River Basin decreased 8% as mild summer weather led to a 3% reduction in year-over-year electricity generation in UP-served territories. Also contributing to the decline was the continued impact of a contract loss from the beginning of the year. Colorado/Utah tonnage declined 17% as soft domestic demand and mine production issues offset growth in West Coast exports. Also hampering loadings in the third quarter was the September Colorado floods. Providing some good news, tonnage from other coal-producing regions increased 19% from a relatively small base, driven by gains from Southern Wyoming and Illinois loadings.", "Before we move on, note this slide shows a steep decline early in the fourth quarter as volumes were impacted by nearly 3 feet of unseasonably early snow in the Powder River Basin during the first week in October. This has impacted volumes through the first half of the month, but we expect the majority of shipments be made up throughout the remainder of the fourth quarter.", "In Industrial Products, a 9% increase in volume and 2% improvement in average revenue per car, despite unfavorable mix, produced revenue growth of 11%. Nonmetallic minerals volume was up 21% as continued growth in shale-related drilling increased frac sand shipments by 27%. Our construction-related volumes grew 11%, driven by an 11% improvement in rock shipments with increased construction activity, mostly in the Texas and California markets, which also contributed to 12% growth in cement volume. Metals volume was up 8% as pipeline projects picked up following a slow start to the year. We also saw an increase in export iron ore shipments with the resolution of mine production issues that limited shipments last year. Growth in housing and home improvements continued to increase the demand for lumber, with shipments up 6%. Although the housing market continue to strengthen, lumber's growth eased early in the third quarter as falling lumber prices and excess inventory slowed lumber shipments. Offsetting some of the strength in other Industrial Products market was a 4% decline in government and waste volume. As in previous quarters, reduced government funding, limited military shipments and delays to extending the federal production tax credit led to a decline in win moves.", "Intermodal revenue was flat as a 2% increase in average revenue per unit offset a 1% decline in volume. With the economic recovery continuing its slow pace, retailers proceeded cautiously in the third quarter. Our international Intermodal volumes declined 5% due to market share shifts within the ocean carrier industry and increased port transloading activity. Continued success converting highway business to rail drove 4% growth in domestic Intermodal.", "Chemicals revenue grew 5%, reflecting a 3% increase in volume and a 2% increase in average revenue per car. Industrial Chemicals volume was up 9%, driven by strength in end-user markets such as housing and automotive. Increased demand in new business led to a 10% increase in petroleum products volume. Dampening the good news was a 5% decline in crude oil volume compared to the third quarter of last year, although crude oil shipments to St. James, Louisiana, continued to grow compared to 2012.", "Before we move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter, I'd like to give a brief update on our Crude-by-Rail business, which accounts for about 40% of our shale-related volume and about 2% of our overall volume. As we said, we've been expecting our 2013 crude oil volumes to increase at a moderate pace year-over-year, though not with the dramatic ramp-up seen in the year before, particularly given the lack of significant destination capacity expansion this year. As you can see in the blue portion of the bar chart, so far this year, we've seen the benefit of very steady demand into St. James, Louisiana, which continued to be a premier rail destination. Additional opportunities have come from other areas, such as West Texas and Oklahoma, and these volumes, in particular, has been somewhat more volatile as the domestic crude oil market continues to evolve and reflect the dynamics inherent in the commodity marketplace.", "As you know, pricing spreads are one of the influences on traffic flows as producers look to maximize netbacks. With the narrowing of the WTI discount to Brent, we've seen a resulting volume decrease into areas with readily available pipeline access, primarily Texas and Oklahoma, which also have been impacted by increased pipeline capacity. We've also seen a small decline in shipments from the Bakken to Texas as tighter spreads have made it more attractive to ship Bakken crude oil to the East, where new facilities have increased crude-by-rail capacity.", "Going forward, we expect the economics of crude oil spreads to continue to be a driver of traffic flows, particularly in areas such as Texas. Other markets, such as Canadian crude, should provide new opportunities as Crude-by-Rail continues to evolve. Meanwhile, our franchise strength in the South will continue to provide a solid foundation to our business, giving customers attractive access to important Gulf destinations.", "While crude oil volumes will always be subject to the ups and downs of market spreads, we believe the long-term fundamentals of Crude-by-Rail remain attractive. Increasing crude production, limited pipeline infrastructure and the flexibility rail provides will enable us to leverage our value proposition and develop new unique opportunities ahead.", "Let me close with what we see for the fourth quarter. Our current outlook is for the economy to continue its slow improvement, although there is uncertainty in the marketplace. No matter what the economy does, we'll continue to focus on strengthening our value proposition, attracting new customers and supporting our existing customers as they work to grow their business. Given that, here's what we see across our business for the next few months, both the challenges and the opportunities.", "With the effects of last year's drought behind us, an improved fall harvest is expected to provide opportunity for Ag growth. Global, Insight raised their full year light vehicle sales estimate to 15.5 million vehicles, which is good news for our Automotive business. Crude oil spreads will continue to impact our Crude-by-Rail volumes but strength in other Chemicals markets is expected to drive the solid performance we've seen throughout the year. With the challenges previously mentioned in our Coal business, we now expect full year volumes to be down in the high single-digit range, which includes the lost contract of about 5% of our Coal volumes. Industrial Products should continue to benefit from shale-related growth with increased drilling activity that supports frac sand and pipeline projects. An improving housing market is expected to drive demand for lumber shipments, and growth in construction is expected to support increases in rock, metals and other related markets. International Intermodal volume is expected to be down slightly compared to last year, while highway conversions will continue to drive domestic Intermodal growth.", "For the full year, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development opportunities across our broad portfolio of business. Assuming the economy does not slow down, we're well on track to deliver profitable revenue growth again this year.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Starting with safety, year-to-date results nearly matched our 2012 record results on the strength of a record-low third quarter reportable personal injury rate. I expect our total safety culture, risk identification and mitigation process and robust training programs to drive continued improvement as we go forward. Our ultimate focus is making sure every one of our 50,000 employees returns home safely at the end of each day.", "Rail equipment incidents or derailments improved 3% year-to-date versus 2012. This is a direct reflection of the investments we've made to harden our infrastructure and to leverage advanced defect detection technology, which, combined, have reduced track and equipment-induced derailments. We are also making progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and root cause resolutions.", "Moving to public safety, our year-to-date grade-crossing incident rate improved 7% versus 2012, reflecting our continued focus on improving or closing high-risk crossings and reinforcing public awareness. We achieved year-over-year improvement in 5 of the last 6 months, including a record third quarter rate. Our focus on grade-crossing risk in the South has generated an 18% year-to-date improvement in that region.", "Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient. And as a result, our network remains fluid and is operating at very efficient levels. Velocity in the third quarter improved 1% compared to 2012 and improved 2% sequentially from the second quarter, despite flooding that severed numerous corridors in Colorado. We rerouted traffic and developed contingency plans during the event to support our affected customers and rapidly restored service on the lines that were washed out.", "Our agility in the face of these outages prevented any year-over-year deterioration in our Service Delivery Index. The measure, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, improved sequentially from the second quarter and would've improved year-over-year if not for tighter service commitments to our customers. We continued to provide outstanding local service to our customers with a best-ever 96% Industry Spot & Pull, which measures the delivery or pulling of a car to or from a customer.", "Infrastructure investments and process efficiencies have improved our ability to recover after incidents, reducing their impact on the network. We continue to invest in capacity across our network, most notably in the South, where volumes are growing, across our diverse portfolio. Overall, our network remains well positioned to handle volume growth.", "Moving on to network productivity. Slow order miles declined 38% to a best-ever third quarter level. As a result, our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investment in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures. We continue to identify and realize efficiencies that contributed to our record 64.8% operating ratio this quarter. Locomotive productivity, as defined by gross ton miles per horsepower day, improved 1%. Network planning and improved locomotive reliability drove this improvement in spite of a 2.5- to 3-percentage-point headwind associated with the mix shift from lower coal shipments and higher manifest shipments.", "During the quarter, we continued to reposition resources to align with the traffic mix trend of growing southern region and manifest volumes, which require additional manpower versus the average of the network. The chart on the lower right demonstrates our ability to leverage growing manifest volumes through UP's extensive terminal infrastructure. We switched 1.5% more cars while keeping yard and local employee days flat. This resulted in an all-time quarterly record in terminal productivity. The improvement was particularly evident in our southern region where car switch per employee day was up 3%. These results reflect employee engagement, which is an important part of our operating strategy. Our employees are bringing their expertise to bear on improving safety, service and efficiency by standardizing work and reducing variability.", "To recap, our operating performance in the third quarter was solid, improving nicely from second quarter levels. We remain vigilant in our commitment to operate a safer and more efficient railroad for the benefit of our employees, customers, the public and shareholders. We've demonstrated the ability to successfully flex network resources in response to dynamic market shifts and unexpected events, including weather.", "As I touched on last quarter, we've successfully completed a number of significant capital track programs, both on the replacement and capacity side. Overall, these projects were completed with minimal network disruptions and resulted in measurable enhancements to our franchise. We will continue to make smart capital investments that generate attractive returns and that keep the network fluid and safe. With strong network fundamentals, we are well positioned for future growth while enhancing UP's value proposition.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue grew 4% to an all-time quarterly record of nearly $5.6 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains. Operating expense totaled $3.6 billion, increasing 1.5%. Operating income grew 10% to $1.96 billion, also hitting a best-ever quarterly mark.", "Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, basically flat with 2012. For the full year, we would expect other income to be in the $110 million to $120 million range, barring any unusual adjustments. Interest expense of $138 million was up 1% from last year. However, it includes about $7 million of net onetime costs associated with our recent debt exchange. Income tax expense increased to $701 million, driven by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 10% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance declined 2% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a best-ever quarterly earnings of $2.48 per share, up 13% versus 2012.", "Turning to our top line. Freight revenue grew 4.6% to more than $5.2 billion, driven by solid core pricing gains of 3.5% and favorable mix of a little more than a point. A decline in lower average revenue per car Intermodal shipments, combined with freight revenue impact from the Pacer arrangement, drove the positive mix. But these items were partially offset by double-digit growth in rock shipments, which typically move less than 200 miles, and a decline in longer haul grain moves.", "Moving on to the expense side. Slide 21 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was up 1% compared to 2012. Inflationary pressures and higher training costs drove the increase, largely offset by productivity gains. Workforce levels increased 1% in the quarter. About half of the increase was driven by more individuals in the training pipeline and the other half was due to capital projects, including positive train control activity. When you think ahead to the fourth quarter, remember that we saw the benefit of a onetime $20 million payroll tax refund that is reflected in last year's fourth quarter comp and benefits expense.", "Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $866 million, decreasing 2% versus 2012, primarily driven by lower average diesel fuel price. In addition, gross ton miles declined 2% due to lower coal and grain shipments. This mix impact also contributed to the 1% increase in our fuel consumption rate compared to 2012.", "Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 8% to $588 million due to higher locomotive and freight car contract repair expenses and joint facility maintenance expense. And we're incurring logistics management fees associated with the 2012 Pacer agreement, which are recouped in our Automotive freight revenue line. Depreciation expense was $447 million, basically flat compared to last year. The impact of increased capital spending in recent years was offset by a new equipment rate study that went into effect at the beginning of this year.", "Looking at the full year, we expect depreciation to be up about 1% versus 2012, slightly lower than our previous projections. However, for 2014, full year depreciation expense should increase at a more normalized rate, more likely in the 5% to 7% range.", "Slide 24 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $309 million, up 3% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses associated with the Pacer contract and growth in Automotive shipments drove higher freight car rental expense. Other expenses came in at $205 million, up $5 million versus last year. Higher property taxes and freight damage costs drove expenses up compared to 2012. A moderate reduction in personal injury expense and effective cost-control measures partially offset these increases. For the fourth quarter, we would expect that other expense line to be more in the neighborhood of $215 million, excluding any unusual items.", "Turning to our operating ratio performance. We achieved an all-time best operating ratio of 64.8% this quarter, improving 1.8 points compared to last year. Our performance highlights the positive impact of solid core pricing gains and network efficiencies despite flat volumes. Through the first 9 months of this year, we generated an operating ratio of 66.5%, improving 1.5 points from 2012, clearly illustrating the strength and value proposition of the Union Pacific franchise.", "Union Pacific's record year-to-date earnings drove strong cash from operations of nearly $4.9 billion, up 12% compared to 2012. Free cash flow of $1.3 billion reflects the growing profitability of the franchise and includes a 13% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2012. Our balance sheet remained strong, supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At quarter end, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was roughly 39%, which includes the impact of adding over $450 million to our balance sheet debt since year-end 2012.", "Opportunistic share repurchases continue to play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. In the third quarter, we bought back nearly 3.7 million shares, totaling $575 million. Year-to-date, we've purchased more than 9.6 million shares, totaling over $1.4 billion, already matching our full year spend from last year. Looking ahead, we have around 5.4 million shares remaining under our current authorization program, which expires March 31, 2014.", "So that's a recap of our third quarter results. As we move through the rest of the year, we're mindful of the economic uncertainty in the marketplace. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see modest volume growth, mainly driven by improved grain shipments. Assuming the economy doesn't slow down for the rest of the year, we would also expect to see continued growth in other market sectors. Given the flat volumes in the third quarter, it's unlikely that our full year volumes will be positive even with our modest growth assumptions in the fourth quarter. However, we will have to see how the rest of the year plays out. In addition, we should see solid core pricing gains roughly similar to the third quarter results. All in, the fourth quarter should round out another record financial year for Union Pacific.", "Now let's take a preliminary look at next year, realizing that it's still very early. From where we sit today, we're expecting modest volume growth if the economy continues along a slow growth trajectory. We think there will be some markets that will be stronger than others. We should see strength in grain shipments. And if the economy holds, there should be positive growth in other business sectors. Mexico-related traffic should also generate volume gains for us next year.", "Our Coal business is a little more difficult to predict, but we can tell you that we retained and renewed roughly 50% of next year's $100 million legacy business. The lost legacy business, which is currently not moving at re-investable levels, will create about a 2% headwind on our Coal volumes in 2014. But as always, weather and the economy will be the driving factors for our Coal business next year. Although 2014 is a legacy-light year, we'll continue to generate real core pricing gains. However, we don't expect to match 2013's levels, which, as you know, include about 1.5 of legacy repricing that won't repeat next year. In addition, inflation-related escalators are expected to be lower next year, including those used to calculate the A-lift cost escalator.", "At the end of the day, our fundamental strategy and focus on pricing for returns has not changed. While we won't see a legacy benefit next year and inflation escalators are expected to be modestly lower, pricing on the rest of our business in 2014 remains strong. When you add it all up, we expect to achieve core pricing above inflation next year. Overall, we're forecasting another record financial year in 2014, if the economy cooperates. In addition to our pricing initiatives, ongoing productivity gains and volume leverage opportunities should help drive continued margin improvement.", "We feel very good about our outlook going forward. The fundamentals are strong, supported by a diverse franchise that allows us to pursue new, attractive market opportunities. We'll continue to move the ball forward, focusing on improved returns to support capital investments that will strengthen and enhance our network, create value for our customers and drive increased returns for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Jack.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay. Thanks, Rob. Well, as Eric mentioned, we've had a bit of a tough start here to the fourth quarter with the early blizzard slowing Coal volumes out of the Powder River Basin. But the good news is there's still a lot of quarter ahead of us. And as we did in the third quarter, we'll manage through the obstacles to ensure our customer commitments are met and our network is protected. More broadly, we continue to monitor the economic landscape and the ongoing saga in Washington.", "But supported by our diverse franchise, we remain agile and well positioned for economic recovery. The 50,000 men and women of Union Pacific stand ready to leverage the opportunities while navigating through the challenges. We'll continue focusing on re-investable pricing, attracting new, profitable growth opportunities and running a safe, efficient and reliable network that generates greater value for both our customers and shareholders going forward.", "So with that, let's open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So I wanted to kind of -- I guess a broad framework that seems to be shaping up for 2014 is that there are pretty good reasons to think that your volume growth may be a bit stronger, obviously, grain, maybe coal is less of a headwind, hopefully, the economy, but you're going to get the slower pace of pricing gains, less legacy contract. So how would you frame the results of that in terms of margin improvement? Do you end up with a kind of a similar framework for margin expansion opportunity? Is it more challenging if it's kind of more volume and less price? How do you think about margin opportunity in 2014?", "John J. Koraleski", "Tom, I think overall, we're in a good position. We've not varied at all from our guidance that says we're going to get to an operating ratio of sub-65%. So it'll be a little more difficult. I'll let Rob give you some technicolor here.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Tom, I would just add to Jack's point, I mean, it's moving the ball forward. As you know, volume is always our friend because we're able to leverage that from a productivity standpoint. But you're right, without the benefit of the legacy repricing, we expect to continue to move the ball forward. And that's going to be continued focus on providing good service, leveraging volume where we can to squeeze out additional productivity initiatives and continue to fairly price the business. You add all that up, we continue -- we expect to continue to make progress on our overall margins.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then a follow-up on Coal. I know it's probably really challenging to have much visibility in Coal. But are there any, I guess, parameters that we should consider that you would consider, stockpile levels? Any activity you're seeing in the East, plant shutdowns? How would you put things together in terms of is it more likely your coal tonnage is up in 2014, or is it more realistic to expect it down? Just a little more detail on framing Coal, if you can.", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure. I think overall, Tom, if you look at energy and the Coal business, the 2 biggest factors are always going to be energy consumption, how much electricity is generated and what the weather is going to be like. We've seen the stockpile levels on a national basis come down a bit. But you always have to be careful because even within that mix of business, you have some that are a little higher, some that are little lower. Eric, you want to put some technicolor around that?", "Eric L. Butler", "I think that's exactly right. Stockpiles have come down. They're about 20 days below where they were last year, and actually, a couple of days below what would be considered historical norms. So what Jack said is exactly correct. It -- factors are what's the electrical consumption, generation, what's weather. Those are always going to be the key factors.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on Tom's question a little bit, but more with regards to rail inflation in 2014. So if we're assuming, this year, inflation was around 2.5% to 3%, is it fair to think about next year being closer to 2% to 2.5%?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Allison. We would -- at this point in time, and of course, things can change, we would expect that inflation looks like it's going to be more around, all-in, 2%-ish.", "Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "2%-ish? Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up question on the Crude-by-Rail and looking towards next year. Without getting too granular, I was wondering if you could maybe comment on some volume growth that you see that is less spread dependent and also, within the context of new origination terminals that you have coming online in the Niobrara and some new destination terminals in Louisiana and Texas that are UP-served.", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure. Eric, you want to do the rundown on what we're looking at for 2014?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So we still believe we'll see moderate growth in 2014. As we indicated in our comments, it's dependent upon a lot of market dynamics, including the spreads, the timing of additional capacity, production levels, overall demand. We're still very optimistic as we look at destination opportunities in California. Those destinations are still coming online. Some of them had long lead times just getting through the normal construction process that you typically go through in that region of the country. But again, kind of the normal vagaries of market dynamics will drive kind of what happens next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC", "I want to just follow up on, Rob, your comment around pricing for next year and understanding that it's legacy light. But when we think about 3.5% pricing that you got in third quarter, would -- how much legacy do you think in third quarter you actually got? Because I'm guessing with Coal, that was down. You didn't get a full 1.5 from that. I just want to get maybe kind of what the base is tracking right now, x legacy. And then maybe if you can give any color on how you think mix could help or hurt next year with grain coming back and maybe some of the other moving parts when we think about overall yields next year.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Scott. In the third quarter, our reported 3.5% price included, call it, roughly 1.5 points of legacy. But to your point, the 3.5% did not include probably less than 0.5 point of coal repriced business because the coal didn't move. So kind of do the math on that. As you look forward in 2014, yes, it's a legacy-light year and, yes, mix will play a part. I mean, if the volume of business that we've repriced, whether it be in coal or grain, if it happens to move before we've lapped the renewal of a contract, then we should see the benefit of the price on our price calculation. But as I always point out, if the business moves after we've lapped the repricing, while it may not show up in our core pricing number that we report, it will show up in our margin. So it's a net benefit to us, clearly. So I guess I'll just summarize by saying that we head into 2014 as optimistic as ever on our ability to price, but we just won't have that benefit of that, call it, 1.5% legacy charge.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then this other question for you, Rob, on the balance sheet. So you mentioned that you were going to need to reauthorize share repurchase next year. If I look, you guys are at about a full turn less of leverage than the other -- most of the other rails, and your returns are better than average, for sure. Do you think that there's an opportunity, now that we're through legacy and we need some other parts to the story, that -- is there an opportunity to more aggressively take on some leverage and more aggressively buy back stock?", "Robert M. Knight", "Scott, as you know, we always take a balanced approach. And as I've said many times, we're comfortable in the range we are right now on our net debt-to-cap ratio. I mean, it's not how we manage the business, but that's kind of a guiding light. So we'd always take a look at it, but that has served us well to be in that range. And in terms of will we look at more or less, we're going to continue to be -- hope to be -- continue to be optimistic in terms of our share repurchase. We did this year, as you know, buy at a higher rate of share buyback this year than we did last year, so we have been ramping that up. And I think that speaks to sort of our thought process.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "If I can hit, Eric, up, I guess, a bit on Intermodal. Looking at domestic, is this the kind of run rate here, the low single digits on the domestic side on the highway adoptions? And then internationally, you noted some losses. When do your grandfather that? And should we see growth going forward in the fourth quarter into next year? When do you start looking at kind of the environment on the international side as well?", "Eric L. Butler", "Let me start with the international. The international, what I mentioned was some market share shifts amongst the steamship carriers. And so that -- as you know, there's excess steamship capacity, and there's natural shifts that are going on amongst them. And as the bid seasons happen every year, those shifts will happen in the steamship arena outside of the rail arena. In terms of the domestic Intermodal side, the 4% we're proud of, but we think there's upside. We think there's still a large, over-the-road truck market out there for us to convert. We think we have the right products. We have the right strategies. We're investing in our franchise. We've talked publicly about our new facility outside of El Paso, Texas, that will be coming online next year. We think that, that will help us penetrate significantly the maquiladora market there around El Paso and also allow us to put some new products and services in place. So we are excited about the upside for continued domestic over-the-road conversions.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And if I could just get a follow-up, I guess, with Rob on the productivity side. And as you look toward maybe a little bit less coming from yields and maybe more of that from -- coming from productivity, do you still seeing accelerating opportunities to continue to gain on the productivity side? How do you look at that opportunity?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. I mean, Ken, we never run out of opportunities to squeeze out productivity. And Lance and his team are continually looking at the mix shifts that take place in the business. And we challenge ourselves, and you've heard me say this many times, to offset 100% of inflation with productivity. If we get half, offset half of inflation with productivity, we're doing pretty well. And our track record has spoken very strongly, I think, in doing so, even without the benefit of volume. So if we get positive volumes, that certainly will help. So we'll continue to look for every opportunity we can.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Wanted to get a sense, I mean, as we enter into this kind of post-legacy year for you guys, how your average book is structured right now with your customers, and kind of what the pace of contract renewal is going to look like on a go-forward basis and how we should expect that, that gets attacked. So as I look out over the next 5 years, what piece of your overall book do you think comes up and, what's the average tenure of the contracts that you've been re-signing?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Justin, I'm not quite sure quite what you're asking. We've talked historically in the past that at any one given time, about 70% of our contracts or our prices are kind of locked in for the next year. As we go into the future, there's a natural evolution of pace, of things that come up as you go through different markets. And we're, as Rob said and I think as Jack said, we continue to be excited about the value of our franchise and the value proposition that we sell and the ability to get price as we go forward on...", "John J. Koraleski", "But as we -- as Eric -- I think what he's kind of talking about is and, Justin, chime in here, buddy, about 40%, typically 40% to 45% of our business is tied up in multiyear contracts. But in our current world, 3 to 5 years is probably the timeframe of those. About 1/3 of the business or 30% is tied up in 1 year, like letter quotes and deals, and then the other 30% is roughly tariff that we have 20 days notice in terms of changing price. So at any one point in time, we have our business constantly being evaluated and looking for market opportunities where we can take advantage of price increases.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That was exactly what I was looking to get at, so thanks for the clarification, Jack. And as I think about the guidance here looking out to 2017, I was just, Rob, wanting to get an idea. Obviously, volume's been more challenged in the near term because of coal. But as I look out to 2015 and beyond, there's some expected positives on the Chem side of your business, specifically on petrochem, I would think. So I wanted to get a sense, as you guys think about mix within that long-term guidance, what type of volume CAGR you think you need to have, cognizant of what we just talked about in terms of the pace of pricing going forward and that being more of kind of an inflation plus as opposed to having that bump from the 1.5 points of legacy that we're seeing right now?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Justin, this is Rob. The guidance, it's just a reset. The guidance on the operating ratio is to -- by full year 2017, to achieve a sub-full year 65% operating ratio. And volume is our friend. And when we give that sort of guidance, we're assuming that the economy will cooperate, that volumes will be on the positive side of the ledger, if you will. But we know that we can't predict precisely exactly what the mix is going to look like. So we're going to have to deal with the hand that the economy plays us between now and then. And we're confident that if the economy cooperates, that the mix will enable us to achieve that target. But as I've said all along, each measure, each metric we've given, as we've been working down from the mid-80s operating ratio years ago, we're going to get there as soon as we can, as efficiently as we can. We're not going to stop, so the sub-65% is not an end game. It's just the next rung on the ladder, if you will, and we'll get there as efficiently, leveraging volume, if we can, leveraging productivity and leveraging strong price.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But -- okay. So you're seeing volume growth that's sub-GDP right now across your franchise and still being able to leverage that into margin improvement, which is something you guys have been able to do, do you think you can do even as we start to see more legacy wear off?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just maybe following up on the longer-term OR guidance. As you think out -- I think you have a few years now left to hit a target, which is a few hundred or a couple hundred basis points away from sort of the run rate that you're at right now. So when you think about the setup, is there anything that we should be thinking about, absent mix, that would be preventing kind of the continued progress that you've been making steadily over the last couple of years? Obviously, legacy comes into all of that. But I just want to make sure, from an operational perspective, are there any other challenges we may need to think about? It strikes me as being a bit on the conservative side, which is good, but I just kind of want to get a sense if there's something I'm missing in there on that guidance.", "John J. Koraleski", "I think, overall, Chris, when you look at it, we look at it from the perspective that we're going to achieve those goals, we're going to achieve them despite whatever hand we're dealt in terms of the economic activity. That's the commitment we're making. But you can never say never in terms of what happens if you have another 2008, what happens if the Washington situation melts down and consumer confidence wanes and we kind of do a double-dip here. We're not looking forward to that. But I think the thing that you can feel good about is if you go back and you look at our results and you look at our track record, when those things happen, we marshal very effectively, we deal with it and we move on. So I don't know, Rob, do you have any other kind of like big onetime things or things -- I mean, we've got productivity gains that we are absolutely focused on, Lance and his team. Rob always uses the term squeeze. I actually think of it more positively than just a squeeze. We have a lot of people working hard to do things better to drive bottom line results, and you see that reflected in our 64.8% operating ratio. Eric and his team are very effectively deploying business development strategies and taking advantage of price opportunities in the markets where we have the opportunity to go above and beyond what would be considered inflationary, and that's good for us. So everybody's kind of focused on that. Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes -- no, you're exactly right. Now clearly, going from a mid-80s to a mid-60s rate of improvement is one slope. Going from where we are today to sub-65%, the slope of the line is different, but the tenets of how we get there are unchanged.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Sure, sure. That makes sense. That's helpful. And then when you think about the capital spending side of it, in context of that target and sort of the slope of the line, as you say, over the course of the next couple of years, I think you updated us with guidance last year around this time for how we should be thinking about CapEx. Anything you need to change as you think about that, as you're further into that? Obviously, PTC is still in the picture and probably will be for at least a few years to come. But just kind of curious, your thoughts around that for '14 and beyond.", "John J. Koraleski", "We're watching our capital spending very closely. Our -- we had reduced our 17% to 18% to 16% to 17%. Clearly, that implies we're going to see some volume growth. If we don't see the volume growth, we'll be paring back capital. We'll be making the right decisions from a return perspective as we see the needs across our network. PTC is still in there. At some point in time, we may or may not change those numbers. But at least right now, we're comfortable with the 16% to 17% kind of number we put out there last year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to come back to the pricing discussion. In the past, you guys have been pretty successful at getting rate up to re-investable levels. Is there any way to quantify for us today what percentage of the business, or in broad strokes, that remains at -- on investable rates that has a lot of pricing upside in the future?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob, why don't you take a shot at that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Brandon, I know what you're asking and it's just not a number we provide, other than to say that we're confident across our entire book of business there are opportunities for us to price to market and make sure that we are at the re-investable level. So that's as detailed as we get on that.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe a follow-up for Eric. When we look at grain dynamics heading into 2014, what's the mix looking like right now from a domestic grain perspective or an export perspective or even ethanol? And how's that going to impact mix and revenue and volume for you going forward?", "Eric L. Butler", "So as you know, with the drought and high U.S. corn prices, U.S. grain on the world markets really took a hit, just because we're a high price relative to what the other prices were in other growing markets around the world. It looks as if -- and as you know, the USDA website has been down for the last several weeks. But the last public report looks as if this will be a near record year for corn production. And so I think that will make U.S. exports, corn, on the bean side and even wheat exports more competitive on world markets. I think you should see some growth in export opportunities vis-\u00e0-vis this year as you go into next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of William Greene with Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Rob and Jack, you've always sort of described your longer-term OR guidance as a -- as not really a target and an ending point but things can go beyond that. And I think something that we've all sort of struggled with over the years is thinking about kind of what structure of a network kind of limits how good margins can get. When you look at the Union Pacific network and you see what you've been able to achieve over the last 5 to 7 years, which, in margin terms, is kind of breathtaking, is there anything about the network that makes you say, yes, it's going to be hard for us to ever achieve sort of record profitability relative to our peers in the industry? Is there anything about your network, structurally, that limits how good you can be?", "John J. Koraleski", "Man, I can't think of anything. Rob, can you?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. No, Bill, I mean, there's no -- there's not like a mountain that's in our way that's not in other people's way. I mean, we all have the same challenges, and there's -- it's a great theoretical question in terms of how low can you get, and we get that question. I mean, a sub-65% is pretty good performance. We think we can go below that, while at the same time, of course, that's just a measure we use as shorthand, if you will. Because at the same time, what we are very focused on, of course, is improving returns, improving income, driving larger cash, et cetera. So at end of the day, that's what we're really focused on. How low can the margins go? We'll see.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, okay. Eric, a follow-up for you on Intermodal. Do you feel like the new hours of service rules so far have had any impact on your growth rate there, or is this kind of something that'll take longer to show up?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. Any impact right now has been negligible. Certainly, the truckers probably are seeing some impact on their expense lines. But in terms of conversion rates to intermodal, it's been negligible so far. We do expect, over the long term, that it will drive more business to intermodal, to the rails. And as I mentioned before, we still are pretty excited about the upside opportunity in terms of over-the-road conversions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "My question, I guess, focus in on the weather impact that you had in Colorado and Denver and more kind of a theoretical one here. When you see that kind of weather impact manifest itself, and it may be that we're going into a period where -- in the future where these happen more often, my question is do your clients -- do your customers say, \"Okay, this is weather, it's out of your control, we won't let it damage too much our relationship,\" or are we seeing more and more customers saying, \"And it looks like you've been able to reroute quite well.\" Do you see that as a competitive advantage versus other railroads that might or might not be able to reroute as well due to whatever network constraints they have? In other words, do you view that, your rerouting capacity, as a competitive advantage? And perhaps, Lance, you can answer that. Maybe, Eric, in your customer conversations, are they attaching more and more importance to that ability to reroute?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes. Walter, I'll let Lance and Eric chime in here, but let me just kind of from an overview perspective. I think our team did a remarkable job of working with customers, rerouting trains and ensuring that their freight moved to their marketplace as quickly and as efficiently as possible, and doing it in a way that they knew we're working hard to keep them ahead of the trouble and out of harm's way. And then to get the whole process back up and running again, get the railroad back up and running in a record amount of time, I think customers appreciate that. We spend a lot of time talking to them about our strategy is basically to create value for them. And we consider that a strategic advantage of ours in terms of being able to demonstrate, what does value mean, and this was a great time to do that. And that's not to say we were perfect in all cases, but I think our customers have given us high marks for that. Lance or Eric, you want to chime in on that?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, Jack. So we do talk about how our franchise is a wonderful thing, and it showed through in how we reacted to what happened in Denver. We had alternative routes that we could use and, to Jack's point, support our customers while they were going through some of the same issues. So I think that's a great manifestation of the franchise strength, basically.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Do you think it's better than your competitor?", "Lance M. Fritz", "I won't speak to whether it's better than our competitor. We focus on providing our customers outstanding service, so they fall in love with Union Pacific and think of us first.", "John J. Koraleski", "One of the things that Lance and Eric's team does that I love, and I think the customers do as well, is they do a postmortem on every one of these events and go back and say, \"What did we learn from this? What would we be prepared to do differently the next time the cards line up this way,\" so that we always learn, we always -- the next time Mother Nature takes a swipe at us, we're better prepared and more experienced in terms of how to deal with it and minimize any disruptive situations for our customers.\"", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That makes a lot of sense. My follow-up question, I guess, is on your Crude-by-Rail. You mentioned St. James seems to be showing a little bit more resiliency. Other areas seem to be more impacted by the differential. My question, I guess, is to what extent can your St. James destinations be insulated from that differential? And perhaps talk a little bit about the difference as to why that is and what level does it need your St. James and as they -- also be impacted by differentials.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So we talked in the past about the reason for St. James being such a premier rail destination, and it's really the connectivity, the pipeline connectivity, the connectivity to multiple refiners, the ability to do blending there. And so it has become, really, a premier destination for crude, light sweet crude, going to the Gulf. And we think that, that resiliency will remain. As you know, the oil will move to where the market dictates, based on spreads. But we think that the factors we've historically talked about with St. James makes it a premier destination, and we will see that resiliency remain for the future.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Eric, maybe you could -- if you could give us a little more color on the legacy retention issues. Are we done sort of settling up the legacy book for next year? Was the -- were the plants that did not get renewed, did they just shut down or was it a share loss? And whether this was PRB or Rocky Mountain coal?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So as you know, we don't really get into customer-specific negotiations or discussions other than what we said before. We had about $100 million of legacy renewal. We retained about half of those and the half we didn't retain was not at re-investable levels, so.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. But was some of the losses perhaps due to the plant just being shut down, or was it -- or if you don't want to comment, that's fine. I'm just trying to understand the -- what was driving the loss.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. Our calculation of legacy does not include plants that are shut down. There are lots of shutdowns going on in the East in terms of mine shutdowns. But in terms of our serving territory, there's not any measurable mine shutdowns that are occurring in our service territories, at least not this year and not for the foreseeable future.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "All right, great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, how do you feel about the viability of the Colorado and Rocky Mountain coals that were moving east relative to the Illinois Basin kind of going forward?", "Eric L. Butler", "That's a good question. First, utilities that are looking to convert, they can decide to convert to Illinois Basin or Colorado/Utah coal. And there's a different sweet spot depending on the mechanical burn capability and the scrubber capability of the utilities and they have an economic profile that may drive them one place or the other. We intend to participate in both markets. We have service products in both markets. We still see Colorado/Utah coal having a strong place in the marketplace, particularly the export market. And I think, going forward, the export market opportunities for Colorado/Utah are probably larger than even the Illinois Basin export coal opportunities.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I thought I heard you mention that transloading was a bit of a headwind for Intermodal. I was hoping you could expand on why that is. And that doesn't look like a trend that's about to reverse, so some color there, please.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. As you know, some of the BCOs are looking at landing product on the West Coast and transloading it into a domestic intermodal container as opposed to using the steamship container to move the product all the way inland. That is a trend that appears to have ramped up in the last year or so. And there are some benefits for some customers to do that. There are some benefits for some customers to keep the steamship carrier, what we call the IPI option, to move all the way inland. Our view of the world is we're going to participate in both markets, and we're going to provide effective products and services no matter how the shipper decides to ship the product.", "Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I'm hoping you can either confirm or deny the chatter we've heard from some of the IMCs that part of the issue with intermodal growth on your network is lack of access to equipment. And I think they were talking specifically about chassis. Can you put any detail behind that?", "John J. Koraleski", "Wow. Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. I'm not -- I think it's just chatter. We do not have a lack of access issue on our network. I think it's just chatter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Long of Stephens.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "You touched briefly on the Santa Teresa Intermodal facility earlier, and it sounds like that's still on track to open early next year. But could you provide any details on the capacity of that facility and how we should think about the potential ramp in volumes in 2014 and beyond that?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So our investment in that facility is going to do a couple of things for us. One, as you know, the El Paso, Juarez area has huge maquiladora opportunities. I think there's something like 250 customers that have manufacturing facilities in that region. And today, a large portion of that is moving by truck over the road. We are capacity constrained in our current El Paso Intermodal facility to take advantage of that. And so with the opening of this new facility, we'll immediately be able to double our capacity, but we're not limited by that. We'll have the footprint to go beyond that as we have market opportunities.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, Justin. The initial buildout should handle 250,000 lifts a year. And we have plenty of space available to go way beyond that, in addition to it being our new fueling facility.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great, that's helpful. And second question, I was wondering how much visibility you have on the potential impact from the new automotive production that's coming online in Mexico the next couple of years. Is that something that should be a meaningful tailwind as we head into next year, or is it still too hard to tell how much that volume could move on your network at this time?", "Eric L. Butler", "So you're referring to kind of the large, announced facilities by Nissan and Volkswagen, those opening dates are beyond next year. We, along with the Mexican railroads, both the FXE and the KCS, we're working to develop service products and offerings so that we can get our fair share of participation in those. But those facility operation -- I mean, opening dates are beyond 2014.", "Robert M. Knight", "If I could just add on that, Justin, because you've heard me say this many times, no franchise matches the Union Pacific in and out of Mexico. We're the only railroad that has the 6 border-crossing points. And today, we enjoy in excess of, call it, around 80% market share of all autos business in and out of Mexico. While we haven't given a precise number of what the market share is going to look like after these plants go, we feel very good about the franchise. We have north of the border and the fact that we are the only rail the crosses those 6 border points, that we will get our fair share of business that wants to move north and south.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "It's been a long call so I'll just ask one. I was just struck by the massive decrease you've had over the last couple of years in slow order miles. And just wondered if you could elaborate a little bit on what's driving that and where else that shows up in your operational metrics and in the cost structure.", "John J. Koraleski", "Did Lance pay you to ask that question?", "Lance M. Fritz", "I love that question.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes. Go for it, buddy.", "Lance M. Fritz", "So, Cherilyn, it reflects our capital programs, which are pretty sophisticated in trying to figure out where to spend the money and what to spend it on. So you see us investing $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion directly into track infrastructure renewal for about the last, call it, 6 or 7 years, and that slow order mile decrease is a direct reflection of that appropriate investment. And when you think about the impact it has, it has an impact on every aspect of customer service. Because those slow order miles are throughout the network, and they basically have the network, when they're present, operating at a level that's below design. And any improvement we make in slow orders, generally speaking, has a direct and immediate impact on the reliability of our service and the absolute magnitude of the service we can provide.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Eric, a quick question on Intermodal. Could you give us a sense of what you believe the discount to the product vis-\u00e0-vis a like-for-like truckload move would be today?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. We've talked before that it's lane-dependent, lane-specific. But a 15% number is probably a reasonable number, 15% to 20% in terms of the all-in cost of intermodal versus an equivalent over-the-road long-haul truck. But again, that's lane-dependent, lane-specific.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Of course. And when you talk about some of the optimism that comes from that network being able to even reaccelerate the 4% volume growth, is it under the context of being able to continue to narrow that gap as well and accelerate volume growth? Or do you anticipate that differential to be constant and expect volume growth to potentially accelerate? How should we think about that?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So a couple of factors. One, the question was asked before about the hours in service, so that is going to continue to have a cost impact on truckers. So their prices are going to increase. So we'll continue to grow our pricing even without narrowing the gap. I do think that there are places where we can narrow that gap and still convert. And fundamentally, we've done some work and analysis that basically says there's still a pretty large untapped market of people who just haven't tried intermodal and haven't used it, and so it's an ideal market sales opportunity for us to penetrate. So there's lots of upside opportunities, and we could get it. Even by narrowing the gap, we can still grow.", "John J. Koraleski", "And we also have new service products that your team has been working on with Lance and his team in terms of providing great service, some new market destinations and some originations. And as the network continues to evolve and develop, that's an opportunity for us as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Two quick ones here. When I look at Coal out into 2014 and look at the arc or the yields, given that you've retained sort of 50% of that legacy business, how should we look at how that arc's going to move? I mean, were the 50% return retained, longer length of haul, about average?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just trying to get a sense of the number that we're going to see all else being equal.", "Robert M. Knight", "For planning purposes, I'd look at it as an average, but we're not going to give detailed arc projections for Coal. And by the way, it will be dependent upon mix. I mean, in terms what -- we're confident in our ability to continue to price our overall book of business. We won't obviously have the legacy tailwind that we called out. But the arc will move based on the mix of the coal traffic that actually moves, so I can't give you a projection on that.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Right. But all I'm saying is that the mix that you retained, that 50%, that wasn't, overall, vastly different from your normalized mix?", "Robert M. Knight", "I'd call it in the normal range.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "In the normal range. Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up question on Intermodal. I hear you guys on -- in terms of the hours of service and truckload rates eventually have to go up. But we've been waiting for that for a while and we haven't really seen much progress on that. Sort of how do you look at sort of gaining market share off the highway if we're still stuck in this sort of very muted truckload pricing environment?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So again, hours of service just went into effect on July 1. So that's why when I answered earlier about negligible impacts, it really is just recent. If you look at what we've said before, we are putting in place lots of products, new offerings. There's an opportunity to sell what -- what we've seen is large shippers really have a great understanding of the intermodal value proposition, and they're heavy users of the intermodal value proposition. There's some market segmentation opportunities for the other guys other than the Walmarts or Targets of the world. And that's why I think we continue to be very optimistic about the ability to penetrate intermodal, get growth and get price.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I think a couple of us have hinted at the -- how conservative it seems, the sub-65% goal by 2017. And I mean no insult because you guys have identified conservative goals in the past and hit them again and again. But are there are couple of threats? What would be the top couple of threats that could disrupt this progress?", "John J. Koraleski", "I think when you just step back and look at it, certainly, what we just went through in Washington, D.C., and the fact that it wasn't really a resolve, it was just moved ahead, is still out there and it's very concerning for us, given that 70% of the economy is driven by consumer spending. And so anything that would cause the housing market to go back down, for people to stop buying cars, those have all been big benefits to us in the recovery piece of that. And that's a concern for us. I don't know of any other, quite honestly. Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "I would just add to that. I mean, you're right. And you're also right that we're not going to stop at that and get there as efficiently as we can. But the things that can impact you, clearly, in addition to the economy that Jack points out, would be the fuel price. Just the math of the operating ratio performance is heavily -- can be heavily impacted by fuel. But beyond that, it's sort of business as usual, if you will, in terms of the tenets of what are going to get us from here to there.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "So it sounds like you identify fuel price and consumer spending are a couple of principal ones and maybe legislation. But I noticed that you didn't mention sort of regulatory environment, is that less of a threat than might previously have been discussed?", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, you never say never because there are a number of pieces of legislation that we're watching, either legislation or from the Surface Transportation Board. But we work very hard to make sure that we're telling our story clearly, that we're creating value for customers, that we're investing heavily in our network and infrastructure. And anything that gets done on the regulatory front, we've been very clear that if it caps our ability to generate a return for our shareholders, it's going to curtail capital spending and investment. Nobody really wants to see that happening. And most people in Washington want to see more jobs and growth. So I never want to say we're not concerned about it, but we're working it as hard as we can to ensure that that's not a major issue for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research.", "Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I know it's been a long call, so I'll be brief. What should we be thinking about in terms of -- I'm looking at cash flows here, tax rate and with the reversal of some of the bonus depreciation items over the last year, what should we be thinking about in terms of deferred taxes and depreciation on the cash flow side?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Jeff. I mean, you're right. Bonus depreciation, we've had that benefit for several years now, and we don't anticipate that we'll see that benefit continuing to 2014. And as I've said, it's -- that impact in '14 is going to be in the several hundred million dollar range, but we don't think -- it's not going to impact our capital structure or our plans that we've outlined. But it's going to be kind of in that neighborhood.", "Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. So in terms of modeling free cash flow, how should I think about the difference between the income statement depreciation, cash flow depreciation? And what tax rate should I be thinking about?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. From a tax rate standpoint, I'd use around a 38%. On a book basis, yes.", "Operator", "Our final question this morning is from the line of Don Broughton of Avondale Partners.", "Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Question, in your assumptions in longer term, and it's still a ways away, what kind of assumptions have you made on international Intermodal, post the opening of the wider Panama Canal? So in the latter half of 2015 and 2016 and then 2017, are you looking for international Intermodal volumes to be flattish, just diminished rates of growth, or actually go negative for you?", "Eric L. Butler", "So we have talked publicly before, and we still think it holds that, today, about 1/3 of the business or about 30% of the business goes all water to the East Coast versus West Coast destinations. We think that, that might grow by 1% or 2% to 31%, 32%, but it won't be beyond that.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, great. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Koraleski, you may begin.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today here in Omaha are Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations.", "Well, as you can see, we wrapped up 2013 with another all-time record quarter. Union Pacific achieved our best-ever quarterly earnings of $2.55 per share, an increase of 16% compared to 2012. For the first time in 6 quarters, we reported overall volume growth despite significantly weaker coal shipments. It highlights the strength of our diverse franchise, the extensive network reach we have to various markets and a strong grain harvest. When combined with solid core pricing gains and our continued focus on safety, service and efficiency, we achieved a record fourth quarter operating ratio of 65%, improving more than 2 points compared to 2012.", "During the quarter, we battled some extreme winter weather that challenged us on many fronts, but as we said before, running a railroad is an outdoor sport, and we successfully worked through the challenges, managing and realigning our network resources to deliver on our customer commitments.", "All in, 2013 was another terrific year for Union Pacific, with our financial performance exceeding all previous milestones. It demonstrates our commitment to delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that creates value for our customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders.", "So to kick us off this morning, I'm going to turn it over to Eric Butler. Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Thanks, Jack, and good morning. In the fourth quarter, volume was up 2% compared to 2012 as the diversity of our franchise provided enough growth opportunities to offset volume declines in 2 of the groups. We had strong gains in Ag, Automotive and Industrial Products, and Intermodal also saw modest volume growth.", "This good news offset continued weakness in Coal and a slight decline in Chemicals. Coal price improved 3.5%, which, combined with the benefit from positive mix, produced a 5.5% improvement in average revenue per car. Volume growth and the improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up nearly 7.5% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.3 billion.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products volume grew 13%, which, combined with 5% improvement in average revenue per car, drove revenue growth up 19%. A 41% increase in grain carloadings was driven by a strong harvest as improved yields increased crop production following last year's lower drought-impacted volumes.", "With more competitive crop prices and strong global demand, grain export volumes saw significant growth, up more than 90%. The strongest gains were in feed grain shipments to the PNW and Mexico and wheat exports to the Gulf. Also contributing to this growth was increased demand for domestic feed grains.", "Grain products volume was up 6%, driven by a 21% increase in ethanol shipments as lower corn prices and increased gasoline consumption led refineries to replenish low ethanol inventories. Shipments of DDGs also grew 19%, driven by stronger export demand, primarily by China.", "Food and refrigerated shipments were down 4%. Gains in import beer were offset by declines in sugar volumes, following an unusually strong fourth quarter last year and a continued sugar surplus that reduced imports from Mexico.", "Automotive volume grew 10%, which, combined with a 7% improvement in average revenue per car, produced a 17% increase in revenue. The same trends that supported growth throughout the year, replacement demand, low interest rates and favorable financing, continued through the fourth quarter. Aided by moderating fuel prices, demand for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles gained momentum, and the growth rate of the automotive industry outpaced that of the overall economy.", "UP finished vehicle shipments grew 7% as sales continued to grow, with the seasonably adjusted annual sales rate reaching $15.9 million in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly level in 6 years.", "Parts volume increased 13%, while pricing gains and the previously announced Pacer network logistics management arrangement increased average revenue per car. We now lapped that arrangement on a year-over-year basis, so we won't see its positive ARC contribution going forward.", "Chemicals revenue grew by 3% as a 3% increase in average revenue per car more than offset a 1% decline in volume. Industrial chemicals volume was up 6%, driven by strength in end user markets such as housing and automotive. Increased demand in new business led to a 7% increase in petroleum products and LPG shipments.", "Dampening the good news was a 22% decline in crude oil volume compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And increased supply of crude at the Gulf Coast reduced Gulf prices, which led to a decline in shipments from West Texas and Oklahoma. In addition, the discount of Louisiana Light Sweet to Brent displaced some of the Bakken crude shipments away from Texas and Louisiana.", "Coal revenue declined 1%. Fourth quarter volume was down 10%, which was mostly offset by a 10% improvement in average revenue per car. You can see from the chart of weekly carloadings that unseasonably early snow impacted shipments from the Southern Powder River Basin in October, with the tonnage down 12% for the fourth quarter. River infrastructure projects and low water levels on the Ohio River curtailed barge traffic at St. Louis, which also reduced shipments. Also contributing to the decline were inventory management initiatives by select utilities and the continued impact of a contract lost from the beginning of the year. Despite growth in West Coast exports, Colorado/Utah tonnage declined 10% based on soft domestic demand and mine production issues.", "Providing some good news, tonnage from other coal-producing regions increased 10% from a relatively small base, driven by gains from Southern Wyoming and other regions.", "In Industrial Products, a 9% increase in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car produced revenue growth of 14%. Nonmetallic minerals volume was up 28% as continued growth in shale-related drilling, mainly in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basins, increased frac sand shipments by 36%.", "Metals volume was up 11%, driven by China-bound iron ore shipments through ports in California and Mexico. We also saw growth in pipe shipments with increased pipeline and drilling activity related to shale energy. Growth in housing and home improvements continued to increase the demand for lumber, with shipments up 6%.", "Intermodal revenue was flat in the fourth quarter. Lower fuel surcharge revenue and unfavorable mix led to a 2% decline in average revenue per unit, which offset volume growth of 2%. Our International Intermodal volumes declined 1%, driven by continued market share shifts within the ocean carrier industry and increased port transloading activity. We also saw a greater flow of revenue empty move for international container repositioning, which impacted the overall traffic mix for the quarter. Volume fared better for Domestic Intermodal, where continued success converting highway business to rail drove volume up 5%.", "I'll close with a look at how we see our business shaping up for 2014. Our current outlook is for the economy to continue its slow improvement. A diverse franchise provides access to a number of markets with potential growth opportunities. The new crops should provide opportunity for Ag in the first half of the year, with anticipated growth in both domestic and export grain markets. Food and refrigerated is expected to see modest growth.", "Automotive manufacturers expect sales growth to continue, and Global Insight has raised its full year light vehicle sales estimate to 16 million vehicles. This should be good news for our finished vehicles and auto parts business.", "Crude oil spreads, a growing Gulf crude supply and increased pipeline activity are expected to have a continued impact on our crude-by-rail volumes. Most other chemicals markets should remain solid.", "Turning to Coal. The previously mentioned legacy contract loss will impact volumes, but low inventory levels and increased exports should help offset this. Volume growth for the year will depend on weather conditions, economic activity and natural gas prices.", "Industrial Products should continue to benefit from shale-related activity, with increased drilling supporting growth in frac sand and pipe shipments. Housing starts are projected to exceed 1 million units for the first time since 2007, which is expected to demand -- drive demand for lumber shipments. Increases in commercial construction are expected to support growth in rock, metals and other highway-related markets.", "Highway conversion should continue to drive growth in Domestic Intermodal. International Intermodal may be challenged in the first quarter by a difficult comparison to 2013, but an improving economy and strengthening housing market should keep International Intermodal ahead of last year.", "For the full year, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will, again, support business development efforts across our broad portfolio of business. Across the groups, we'll continue to develop opportunities in Mexico, where our unparalleled ability to link Mexico's economic growth with U.S. origins and destinations is the strength of our franchise. Assuming the economy cooperates, we expect to deliver profitable revenue growth yet again in 2014, driven by modest volume and core pricing gains.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with our safety results. The 2013 reportable personal injury rate was up slightly from our all-time record performance in 2012. Not shown is the number of severe injuries, which declined to a new record low. We focus our attention on risk and severity because these injuries have the greatest human and financial impact. Our goal is for every employee to return home safely after every shift, and we will get there using a robust safety strategy that includes the Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture and risk identification and mitigation.", "Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments. Our full year reportable rate finished up 1% versus 2012. We continue to make progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and root cause resolutions. In addition, we continue to invest in capital to harden our infrastructure and leveraging advanced technologies to find and fix track and equipment defects.", "In public safety, our grade-crossing incident rate improved 7% versus 2012, a result of our efforts to improve or close high-risk crossings and to reinforce public awareness. Most encouraging was the 17% improvement on our southern region, which has a higher grade-crossing density than our overall network.", "While our reportable rate in both employee and rail equipment safety increased slightly during 2013, the absolute number of incidents, which includes incidents that do not meet the regulatory reportable threshold, declined in both categories.", "Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient, particularly in the face of recent winter weather challenges. Recall that in October, a winter blizzard in Wyoming severely impacted shipments out of the Powder River Basin. In early December, we were hit with the most severe winter weather interruption in the past 7 years. The storm covered 2/3 of our network and generated a 33% increase in the number of days with major service interruptions during the quarter. As a result, average train speed declined 3% in the fourth quarter compared to 2012 but remained within a solid service range. These weather interruptions also drove a decline in our Service Delivery Index. The metric, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, also reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced last year. We continued to provide outstanding local service to our customers with a fourth quarter record 95.5% Industry Spot & Pull, which measures the delivery or pulling of a car to or from a customer. Overall, our network remains well positioned to handle volume growth.", "Moving on to network productivity. We continue to leverage existing resources as grain train lengths set a new best-ever quarterly record, while automotive and manifest train lengths set new best-ever fourth quarter records. Intermodal train size dropped, reflecting an increase in new service offerings. We expect these new trains to grow as we convert business from the highway. Other efficiencies included a 2% improvement in locomotive productivity, as measured by gross ton miles per horsepower day, in spite of a 2 to 2.5 point headwind due to the mix shift from lower coal shipments to higher manifest shipments. The improvement reflects a long-term trend of increasing locomotive reliability, as well as effective utilization plans.", "We efficiently handled the volume growth across each region of our network, effectively utilizing our workforce. We leveraged growing manifest volumes within UP's existing terminal infrastructure, as reflected by an improvement in car switch per employee day. The improvement was particularly evident in our southern region, where car switch per employee day increased 5%. These productivity gains were generated by our men and women in the field as they leveraged their expertise to improve safety, service and efficiency using the UP Way.", "Moving on to our capital investments. We invested nearly $3.6 billion in our network during 2013, with more than $2.1 billion in replacement capital to harden our infrastructure and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. At the end of the year, over 99% of our network was free of slow orders. Spending for service growth and productivity totaled around $1 billion, driven by investments in capacity, commercial facilities and equipment. Major projects included are $400 million investment in our Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility and more than $200 million of capacity work in the South to support our diverse and growing book of business in that region. In addition, we invested another $420 million in Positive Train Control during the year, bringing our cumulative PTC investment to $1.2 billion of our estimated $2 billion projected spend. Although it's unlikely the industry will meet the 2015 deadline, we're making a good-faith effort to do so and are working closely with regulators as we implement this new technology.", "For 2014, our plan will likely exceed last year's spending. We'll continue to make capacity investments in our southern region while also advancing capacity projects across other parts of our network. Although some buckets will fluctuate year-over-year, our core investment thesis will not, which is to maintain a safe, strong and resilient network and invest in service growth and productivity projects that meet our aggressive return thresholds.", "So in summary, we finished 2013 on a solid note despite the winter weather challenges. As we move through 2014, our focus, above all, will be the safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We'll take advantage of growth opportunities by leveraging our network resources. We'll look to make productivity improvements in all areas, utilizing resources more efficiently and investing capital productively. As a result, we'll provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service. We call that moving our business up into the right. All combined, it translates into increased returns for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue grew 7% to an all-time quarterly record of more than $5.6 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains and volume growth.", "Operating expense totaled nearly $3.7 billion, increasing 4%. Operating income grew 14% to nearly $2 billion, also hitting a best-ever quarterly mark. Below the line, other income totaled $37 million, down $6 million compared to 2012. Interest expense of $127 million was down slightly compared to the previous year. Income tax expense increased to $709 million, driven by higher pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Net income grew 13% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance declined 2% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce best-ever quarterly earnings of $2.55 per share, up 16% versus 2012.", "Turning to our top line. Freight revenue grew 7.5% to a quarterly record of $5.3 billion, driven by solid core pricing gains of about 3.5%, which included a little over 1 point of legacy repricing. Volume growth of 2% and favorable mix of a couple of points also contributed to the improvement. Growth in longer-haul grain moves and a 5% increase in higher average revenue per car manifest shipments drove the positive mix. These items were partially offset by growth in lower average revenue per unit Intermodal shipments.", "Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2013. For the year, our core pricing gains ranged between 3.5% and 4%. Lost opportunity due to lower coal volumes totaled about 0.5 point for the full year. This slide also shows the quarterly rail inflation escalator, excluding fuel, on a year-over-year basis. As you can see, it drifted into negative territory in the second half of 2013, creating a slight pricing headwind on a portion of our business, which is tied to the escalator. Over the past 5 years, the cost escalator has averaged about 3%, but as we've discussed, we expect 2014 inflation to moderate, negatively impacting our pricing gains but also tempering operating expense increases.", "As we've said previously, the more significant impact on our 2014 pricing will be the lack of about 1.5 points of legacy pricing benefit that we saw last year. That said, we remain committed to our strategy of pricing for reinvestability. It's supported by the value we create for our customers and is required to generate the returns needed for continued investment in our franchise.", "Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 7% compared to 2012. Inflationary pressures, volume-related expenses and a mix shift to more manifest traffic drove the increase. In addition, higher overtime and re-crew expenses, driven by severe winter weather, masked overall productivity gains. You also need to take into account the $20 million payroll tax refund included in our 2012 fourth quarter results. Excluding this onetime item, our comp and benefit expense was up about 4.5%.", "Workforce levels were flat for the quarter as we leveraged a 2% volume increase with a 1% increase in TE&Y employees. Fewer capital employees offset the TE&Y workforce increase.", "As we look at 2014, we expect our comp and benefits expense to grow. However, the extent will be driven by volume levels and business mix. The good news story is our continued productivity initiatives that will help mitigate these increases. In addition, we'll continue to see labor inflation this year, but it will likely moderate to below the 2% mark.", "Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $905 million, decreasing 2% versus 2012, driven by a lower average diesel fuel price. On the flip side, gross ton miles increased 2% in the wake of strong grain shipments, while our fuel consumption rate increased 1% compared to 2012.", "Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 10% to $585 million due to higher locomotive and freight car repair expenses and an increase in joint facility maintenance expense. And we continued to incur management fees associated with the 2012 Pacer agreement, which are recouped in our Automotive freight revenue line. And as Eric mentioned, we've now lapped that contract on a year-over-year basis, so we won't see that variance going forward.", "Depreciation expense was $458 million, up 1% compared to 2012. The impact of increased capital spending in recent years was mostly offset by an equipment rate study that went into effect in 2013. For 2014, we expect depreciation expense to increase at a more normalized rate, likely in the 6% to 7% range. This range includes about $80 million of depreciation expense associated with Positive Train Control capital investments. I'll talk more about PTC in a minute.", "Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $311 million, up 3% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses associated with the Pacer contract and growth in Agricultural and Automotive shipments mainly drove higher freight car rental expense. Other expenses came in at $188 million, up $6 million versus last year. Higher property taxes and freight and equipment damage costs drove expenses up compared to 2012. A reduction in personnel injury expense and effective cost control measures partially offset these increases. For 2014, we expect the Other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% for the full year, excluding any unusual items.", "Turning to our operating ratio performance. Our focus on pricing the business right and moving it efficiently continues to pay off. We achieved a record fourth quarter operating ratio of 65%, improving 2.1 points compared to 2012.", "On a full year basis, we also made tremendous strides by generating a best-ever operating ratio of 66.1%. It clearly illustrates the strength and value proposition of the Union Pacific franchise. We've talked about our focus on continued core pricing and productivity gains and leveraging what we see as modest volume growth over our planning horizon.", "On the cost side, it's a matter of effectively managing inflationary pressures in addition to other cost hurdles that we have every year. For example, operating taxes that we pay will continue to increase as our profitability grows. Depreciation expense is another item that will continue to increase, assuming a growing capital spend. And as we've discussed, depreciation and other operating expenses will be driven higher by shorter-life Positive Train Control assets and maintenance costs as we move further into that project.", "Despite these obstacles, we feel very good about our prospects of now achieving our sub-65% operating ratio before 2017. Exactly how much sooner before 2017 will depend on the usual drivers: economic growth, fuel prices, inflationary hurdles, just to name a few. That said, we're equally focused on cash generation and improving our overall financial returns.", "Slide 27 provides a summary of our 2013 earnings with a full year income statement. I'll walk through a few of the highlights from our record-setting year. Operating revenue grew more than $1 billion to an all-time record of nearly $22 billion. Operating income also set a new best-ever mark of $7.4 billion, topping 2012 's record by 10%. And net income of $4.4 billion and earnings of $9.42 per share also set new full year records.", "Overall, one of the key measures for our performance is the cash that we generate. In 2013, cash from operations increased to $6.8 billion, up 11% compared to 2012. After $3.5 billion in cash capital investments and $1.3 billion of dividend payments, our free cash flow totaled nearly $2.1 billion, being the first rail to surpass the $2 billion mark in our industry's history.", "Taking a closer look at 2014, we will not see the benefit of bonus depreciation. In fact, we'll see a headwind to free cash flow of about $400 million due to tax payments associated with prior year programs. However, we don't expect this to impact our cash allocation strategy or our ability to grow shareholder returns.", "Slide 29 shows our 2013 all-in capital investment of $3.6 billion. It's a bit higher than our cash capital due to capital leasing activity and other noncash capital items. In 2014, we expect to increase our capital spending from 2013's levels, pending final approval from our Board of Directors in February. The chart on the right reflects our achievements in generating returns on these investments. Return on invested capital was a record 14.7% in 2013, up 0.7 point from 2012. If you calculate it on a replacement basis, our return shrinks to about half that number. Returns must continue to improve to support asset replacement costs and investments required to achieve our safety, service and growth initiatives.", "Beyond funding our capital commitments, our record profitability and strong cash generation have enabled us to grow shareholder returns. After increasing our quarterly dividend per share 15% in 2012, we raised it an additional 14.5% last year. For 2013, we achieved a payout ratio of 31.5%, up from 30% in 2012. We're making good progress in moving up within our targeted payout range of 30% to 35%.", "In addition, we continue to make opportunistic share repurchases, which play an important role in our balanced approach in cash allocation. In the fourth quarter, we bought back more than 4.9 million shares totaling $786 million. Full year purchases topped more than 14.5 million shares totaling over $2.2 billion, up 50% from 2012. Our new repurchase authorization of up to 60 million shares over a 4-year time period went into effect January 1 of this year. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $3.5 billion to our shareholders in 2013. It represents a 36% increase over 2012, clearly demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.", "Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our ongoing commitment to a solid investment-grade credit rating. Continued growth in earnings and cash flow has improved our 2013 year-end debt-to-cap ratio to roughly 38% and our debt-to-EBITDA to just under 1.4x, even with the addition of nearly $600 million of balance sheet debt since last year. As we've said, these metrics are a little lower than where we believe they need to be. We are targeting about 1.5x and around a 40% for year-end 2014, which is closer to the low 40s target range that we've previously discussed. Our $1 billion debt issuance earlier this month was a good step in that direction.", "So that's a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results. As we focus on 2014, we're projecting another record financial year if the economy cooperates. In addition to our pricing initiatives and ongoing productivity gains, volume leverage opportunities should also help drive continued margin improvement. And as Eric just highlighted, we have growth opportunities across a variety of market sectors that should drive modest volume growth for the full year. First quarter volumes also are expected to be on the positive side of the ledger, driven by continued strong growth in grain shipments, cross-border traffic with Mexico and various other industrial-related moves.", "Our Coal business is a little more difficult to predict. The lost legacy business creates about a 2% headwind on our Coal volumes in 2014. But as always, weather and the economy will be the driving factors for our Coal business this year.", "We feel very good about our outlook as we move forward. Our fundamentals are strong, supported by a diverse franchise that allows us to pursue new, attractive market opportunities. We'll continue to move the ball forward, focusing on improved returns to support capital investments that will strengthen and enhance our network, create value for our customers and drive increased returns for our shareholders.", "So with that, I'll turn it back to Jack.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thanks, Rob. So as we look at 2014, we see the economy is slowly strengthening. We're well positioned for economic growth and are confident in our ability to deliver on our customers' growing transportation needs. Excellent service is key to our future success. It supports our pricing initiatives and improves network and asset utilization. It also demonstrates the power of our value proposition to new customers that are looking for viable transportation alternatives.", "Our capital investment strategy will be another key part of UP's success going forward. We are making investments today, building the capacity that we need for tomorrow. Longer term, we remain bullish on our future prospects. We'll continue our unrelenting focus on both safety and service to our customers. We strongly believe in the power and the potential of the Union Pacific franchise to drive even greater financial performance and shareholder returns in the years to come.", "So with that, let's open it up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to see if you could give a little more flavor on the Coal outlook. I know you've got this 2 percentage point headwind from the lost contract, but it just seems like we're having pretty favorable weather impact in terms of the cold winter. You said some of your customers had already taken actions to reduce inventories. So maybe if you can give us a comment on where inventories are and whether you've seen some signs that maybe customers are looking to take more coal, given what appears to be a little better weather pattern.", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure. Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Tom, as you know, our Coal volumes are really driven by economic activity, both on the industrial side and the consumer side. Certainly, weather patterns, particularly Coal, particularly hot weather, will drive that. Natural gas prices will drive that. If you look at the last 30 days, certainly, those items seem to suggest a stronger coal outlook. But as you know, all of those items could move around month to month, quarter to quarter. And overall, coal market share still is hanging in there, around 39%. It's been pretty, pretty static. So the outlook drivers will be exactly what we said: economic activity, weather patterns, natural gas prices. And we -- I'm not sure we have any special ability to predict that better than anybody else.", "John J. Koraleski", "And the latest numbers, the 10 days is from, what, November? Down 10 days, Southern Powder River Basin. So it'll be interesting to see how the December numbers play out.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So where do you -- Jack, where do you think stockpiles are right now? Are they below...", "John J. Koraleski", "Tom, the last report we saw was November data that said Southern Powder River Basin stockpiles were down about 10 days. So it's somewhere around -- so that would put it somewhere around 60 days.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And that's pretty close to target?", "John J. Koraleski", "It's actually a little bit below target for this time of the year.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A little bit below target, okay. And then the follow-up question, it seems like you've had some recent favorable data points from a couple of truckload carriers. It feels like that market is improving and maybe tightening a little bit. If you look at the velocity numbers for your primary rail competitor for Burlington Northern, it seems like they've had some challenges maybe with capacity, that their velocity has been down. And it feels like you're maybe shaping up to have a cyclical or capacity-driven improvement in pricing as you look into 2014. I guess that assumes the economy improves. I was wondering if you could offer a thought if that's a reasonable way to look at it, that pricing might improve if you see the economy develops a momentum.", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Tom, as you said, it feels like the economy is slowly strengthening. And our competitor that you made reference to, they're a good company. Certainly, we all have had challenges in the past, and we assume they'll work through those. Our focus is really on driving our business development opportunities. We have a great service value proposition. We're growing our business development, as we said. Our Domestic Intermodal, I think this is the fifth record year for Domestic Intermodal. So we feel -- we continue to feel pretty good about our outlook and our opportunities in that space.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So I'm just thinking about the long-term guidance and the sub-65% OR by 2017. And we had a pretty good year this year with the economy. You guys had a record year in terms of your earnings and results. And we improved our operating ratio by 170 basis points or so. I mean, just extrapolating, you had Coal down 9% this year. If Coal is slightly better than that, besides the fact that you've got this headwind from the legacy side, what else makes you hesitant to say, yes, we can probably, at least, hit that 65% target next year? I mean, from my standpoint, that guidance feels wildly conservative, and I'm trying to figure out what the X factor is. I mean, to me, it's Coal because you've got that double-levered impact from a pricing standpoint. But if I have to think about the bias, it feels like it's still a positive there. So when you're sitting down and putting pen to paper on that, how are you guys thinking about that?", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay. Rob, why don't you take a shot at that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. So as you've heard me say many, many times, we're not going to slow down to get to the target at a later date and time. And I hope you're right with everything you've said, that we're going to get there as efficiently and aggressively as we can, as we have over the last milestones that we've set. And as I cautioned, things that we are mindful of are mix impacts driven by the economy, weather, fuel. Those are all factors that go into it, so we'll see how it all plays out. And I hope you're right, and we're certainly going to take advantage and leverage every opportunity we have to get there as efficiently and as soon as we can.", "Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Fair enough. When it comes to the share buybacks and the pace, I mean, obviously, 60 million shares, nice amount of capital to potentially deploy there. I think you guys laid out some slightly more aggressive balance sheet goals for this year.", "How confident do you feel around getting to those balance sheet targets? And when I think about the potential for going past those, are those hard stops? Or is that kind of fungible based on what you're seeing from the environment, and obviously those ratios move with what your capital looks like? So I'm trying to get a sense of that.", "John J. Koraleski", "Go ahead, Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Justin, I mean, also as you've heard us say many times, I mean, we are going to continue to be opportunistic in our share buybacks. I think you saw that in the fourth quarter, where the pace was quite strong. I think our 60 million over a 4-year period new program shows our confidence over the long term. It all starts with generating the cash on the front end. And that's -- our primary focus is to do that to enable us to continue to have the opportunities to invest in the business where it makes sense, where the returns are there, continue to raise the dividend and continue to have an aggressive buyback program. In terms of the targets, I've said many times, it's not how we initially build it, but we're kind of looking at that low 40s debt-to-cap range. And there's no hard number there, but that low 40s feels good to us and we plan on moving in that direction.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Group.", "Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "With respect to Crude-by-Rail, obviously, we've seen Bakken and West Texas move falling off here. But as we think about 2014 and volume growth in crude, are you expecting some year-over-year growth, given that you do have exposure to areas like the Niobrara and the Uinta, and that in addition to some origination and destination facilities coming online to use -- support some of the heavy Canadian crude moving down to the Gulf. So I was wondering if you could opine on that.", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure. Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "So Allison, as we've said before, the core part of our strategy is, as you suggest, strengthening destination facilities, identifying places where crude can land, identifying places where we could strengthen originations, whether with rail partners or on our own accord. So that's a core part of our strategy. We're going to continue to do that. In some parts of the country, there are clearly lots of environmental and other processes that you have to go through to get new facilities up and running. And so there probably are not a significant number of new facilities that will physically be coming online in 2014, but that is a core part of our strategy to basically strengthen facilities. Having said that, we acknowledge and recognize that, really, where and when and how crude flows between the various shale plays and the various destination regions really are fundamentally going to be driven by the market and spreads. And we have probably no greater ability to predict that than anyone else.", "Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. So it's a little bit unclear at this point whether or not you'll see volume growth this year? Is that fair?", "John J. Koraleski", "We're going to have to just wait and see as we look at what happens to the spreads in the market. We're excited. There's a couple of California destinations that are supposed to come online. We have to wait and see how that is going to play out in terms of the permitting process, as Eric said. There's a lot of moving parts to this one so...", "Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. On the Intermodal side, can you give us a sense of how much of a volume uplift that you might see on the domestic side from the opening of the Santa Teresa facility and some of the new services that you recently announced with Ferromex going to Chicago and then the service from Laredo to Memphis? How much do you think that this could add to volume growth?", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, Allison, we're probably not going to give you the number you're looking for. We're not going to give guidance specifically on it, but we're pretty excited about opening the facility. The Intermodal piece will open around April 1. So we'll transfer our current El Paso book of business over. And we've already started the marketing and the development efforts, the business development efforts in Northern Mexico, the maquiladoras regions of Mexico and those places to start bringing product online. We're seeing nice growth in our Eagle Premium Service and our service from Laredo into the Southeast. And we think that's going to continue to help us develop and fill out our Intermodal franchise in 2014. Eric, do have anything else to add to that?", "Eric L. Butler", "No, that's it. As you said, we're excited about it. We think we got a great franchise and we're excited about the opportunities.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC", "So for you, Rob, I just want to make sure, did I hear you right that, excluding legacy, the core price got a little bit better in fourth quarter? I just wasn't sure I heard that right. And then when I think about mix, so a real nice mix helped in the fourth quarter, how much of that do you think is grain? And if a lot of it is grain, should we think about that mix health continuing for the first, I'd say, 2 or 3 quarters of '14?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Scott, just I think the way to look at the legacy, I wouldn't read too much into that. I think there was about 1.5 point impact throughout the year of 2013. So that's probably a safe number to continue to think about. In terms of mix, Scott, as you know, it's difficult, and we don't give guidance on mix. But if strong long-haul grain shipments are stronger this year, which -- certainly, that'd be a plus. That in and of itself will have a positive impact on mix. There are other moving parts, as you know. But it's why we shy away from giving mix guidance because there are so many moving parts, but that would be a net positive.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. And then I want to take Justin's question and focus it maybe a little bit more on 2014 and, Rob, your margin view. So I think we all get less legacy this year but to Justin's point, kind of Coal should be certainly not down 9% and hopefully positive. You talked about less cost inflation. Just directionally, are there other things we should be thinking about why margins improvement in '14 can't be similar to what we saw in '13? Or do you think the lack of legacy is just so powerful that, that affects an unreasonable expectation?", "Robert M. Knight", "No. Scott, actually, we're not -- what I'm just saying is that there's a lot -- the same moving parts that we've had for the last 10 years, we're going to have those same moving parts as we look forward. And that's going to be the economy, the impact of fuel, the impact of mix on our business, so the higher depreciation rates that I guided you. Those are all factors. But don't read that to think that we kind of lost our enthusiasm to continue to move the ball forward on being aggressive in improving our margins, and we hope stars are aligned and we hope to be able to leverage each of those opportunities as we continue to make progress.", "John J. Koraleski", "I would also just call to everybody's attention that we've just proven in the last 2 years the impact weather can have on the grain harvest. And it can be pretty dramatic from year to year. So again, all of those things kind of enter the picture.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe just picking up on thoughts around the buyback. When you think about 2014 or I guess the next couple of quarters, is there any sort of major puts or takes we should be thinking about that would potentially lead to an acceleration or a deceleration on the pace of purchases versus where you were in the fourth quarter, I guess, with some of your targets about '14? I just want to get a rough sense if that's where the right run rate to be thinking about over the course of the next year or so.", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Chris, no. I mean, as you've heard me say many times, we've been reluctant to give any kind of a run rate or guidance on that. We'll -- the common theme will be we will continue to generate a strong cash position as we can and we will continue to be opportunistic in our share buybacks.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. But no real sort of thinking dynamic, it's just going to be an opportunistic type of decision on that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then Eric, a quick question for you. Just when you think about the International Intermodal, I know there's been some sort of -- there's been port changes among some of your customers. And so when I think about that in '14, do you have a point in sort of the second quarter or so when you begin to lap some of those differences, where you start to see some of that international volume pick back up just on the back of easier comps?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. As we said we're going to have some difficult comps in the first quarter, just because first quarter '13 was so strong for us. As you know, steamship carriers are constantly looking at ports, and the ports that we have access to are still a strong part of their portfolio. There will be economic drivers, but we don't think that there's any particular specific port-driven drivers that you'll see that will change the volume outlook in the latter half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Lance, I want to ask you a question. With expectations for volume growth here for the first time in about 2.5 years, does that make the efficiency opportunity that more easy to capture? Or does it drive some complications with adding capacity and adding workforce to handle the new volume?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Well, thanks for the question. We love volume growth. It does present opportunities for generating productivity, both in network yards and on line road and train size, many other areas. We are well prepared for it. I wouldn't categorize capital investment as a challenge. I'd categorize that as another opportunity and one that we love to embrace. Because right now, we're generating pretty attractive returns on those investments. So we're in pretty good shape for the growth that we see coming forward.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So is it possible that with the expansion this year, the efficiencies are even more visible?", "Lance M. Fritz", "I wouldn't say that. I don't think we can commit to that. I think we can commit to what Rob has said, which is we pursue productivity regardless of the environment. And our track record is such that we generate productivity.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And Rob, I want to follow up on that, too. With compensation and benefits, you did say you're going to have lower inflation hurdles this year. Can we talk about some of the drivers from a headcount perspective and then inflation perspective for that line?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Let me start with the expected employment numbers. I mean, that, as we've always said, will depend on what volume is. We would expect that if volume increases, our overall headcount will increase but not 1:1 because, obviously, there is productivity that we're able to achieve. And that excludes any capital headcount as sort of our -- to run our railroad. On the inflation side, yes, as I pointed out in my comments, we do expect 2014 inflationary pressures to moderate. We see that on the labor line at around 2% or so, all in, driven by some health and welfare positive news in our overall inflation expectations. And pension is part of that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Jack, maybe just your thoughts on returns and the Surface Transportation Board, particularly with 2 relatively new commissioners, your thoughts on being the top rail returns, generating the highest returns relative to their cost formula. Your needs on replacement rate returns now given Moby's [ph] retirement. Maybe you can just kind of give some thoughts on that.", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure, Ken. You know what, we're looking at this as an opportunity. We'll certainly do everything we can to help educate the new members and make sure that they understand the dynamics. It has taken us a long time for not only Union Pacific but other railroads to get to a revenue adequacy point of view. And when you get there, that's not the end of the game, that's not the goal, because the whole issue of replacement cost still has to be dealt with. It still has to be brought into the picture. And so, therefore, as we look at it, we're not afraid of it. We're ready to engage and we don't see at this point in time any negative consequences of changing out the STB members.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just similarly, maybe it's more for Eric, but on all the comments on the -- noting the economy is accelerating, I guess, where do you see it hitting in terms of volumes and relative, I guess, specifically, or maybe it's a Lance question, on how much capacity you see in the network right now?", "John J. Koraleski", "I think we're going to just leave it, Ken, with Rob's comment, which was we expect volumes to be positive this year. And how positive is really going to depend -- we're sitting here on January 23. There's a lot of year to play out. So we'll see. We are optimistic at this point in time that the economy does appear to be strengthening as we go forward. We like the prospects of having a strong grain harvest to kick the year off for us and hope that the second half is just as good. We're watching the coal burn just like you guys all are in terms of what's happening on the weather conditions and the economy activity to drive further consumption and the natural gas prices. So there's a lot of things right now. And if we can go through the year without a lot of government interference from debt ceilings and budget bills and those kinds of things, we could have a fairly decent year. But we're certainly not afraid of the volume in any shape or form.", "Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a technical question, if I can. When does the Coal contract comp against itself, the lost contract? Is that the end of 1Q?", "Robert M. Knight", "Start of the year, Ken.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I'm curious on pricing, if we can come back to that. And if we look at your outlook for the economy, how long in your experience in the past has it been before strong volume, strong economy, tighter markets start to allow the rail market to price up? We've obviously had all that legacy business. But just more from an underlying organic pricing standpoint, how long does that take typically?", "John J. Koraleski", "Overall, Bill, we're not going to get much into a discussion on pricing here. I will just tell you that as we look across our markets, at all times, every market is different. So the pricing opportunities ebb and flow with each individual markets. And I don't know. Eric, do you have any other insight?", "Eric L. Butler", "No. I would just say what Rob is continually said in the past. As we reported price, the majority of our price has been on legacy pricing. So I don't think it's an assumption that [indiscernible]", "John J. Koraleski", "We'll watch each market carefully. And our goal is always to price to market.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Can you remind us the percent of business that's tied to RCAF?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Bill, for competitive reasons, we don't share that number. It's a fraction of our business. It's certainly not the majority, but that's a piece of information that we have not publicly shared.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then just one last detail question on weather in the first quarter. I know we don't typically sort of break it out. You operate outdoors, obviously. But given what you've seen so far, is it going to be a material impact in the first quarter based on what you know today?", "John J. Koraleski", "Not the first 23 days. It depends on what happens tomorrow.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So 24 days and we got it. That's it.", "John J. Koraleski", "24 days, and we'll see what happens on day 25.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Vernon, Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Eric, a question for you on safety regulations with respect to crude. Obviously, if you get more stringent tank car standards, you might see a volume impact. But I was wondering how you might think that would impact your ability to price. Because presumably, oil spreads have widened a little bit and some capacity was taken out of the system, and maybe you could get a little opportunity to price that business a little more. Is that the right way to think about it? Or how have you guys been thinking about it?", "Eric L. Butler", "David, I'm going to let Lance talk about kind of the safety-related issues. But as we say, we really don't talk publicly about pricing strategies. We would assume that if there's a safety mandate that has a higher cost or price car associated with it that would be reflected in the supply chain, associated with moving crude by rail.", "Lance M. Fritz", "And I'm not sure that there was a question in there on safety and crude-by-rail.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Well, I mean, I guess, would you think that some of the regulations would pull some capacity out of the crude-by-rail marketplace?", "Lance M. Fritz", "I don't think we can comment on that. The things that are being discussed are the tank car standards that's really driven by the DOT and PHMSA. We already treat crude oil trains in a fashion that's over and above what's required by regs in terms of keeping our communities safe. So I don't think I'd comment on that.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And then, Eric, maybe just a quick follow-up on Automotive. Given the sourcing shift towards Mexico and your greater share of that market, is it right to think that the volume could be a little bit better than light vehicle sales on an ongoing basis? Or how long do you think you might be able to keep that better than light vehicle sale growth in volumes for Automotive going?", "Eric L. Butler", "So in terms of the Mexican automotive -- the Mexico manufacturing automotive market, there are a lot of new facilities coming online in the next several years, which will grow the production in Mexico from roughly 3 million vehicles a year today to 4 million vehicles a year, if you go out several years from now. We, with our franchise, continue to expect to get our fair share of that in terms of shipping those vehicles to market. But those -- whatever vehicles are manufactured in Mexico will, of necessity, have to displace vehicles manufactured elsewhere, unless the total sales number is going up.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "All right. And do you think you guys might get a little bit better share of that if it was like an Eastern facility moving down South or Canadian facility moving south?", "Eric L. Butler", "I'm not quite sure of the question. But clearly, as sales increase for the industry, given our strong Mexico franchise, we expect to get our fair share of that growth.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I'm just going to follow up here on price. I just wanted to check if my math is right here. If I just average out your core pricing or the -- over the year, you're about 3.75%. You said about 1.5 of that is due to legacy. So if we strip that out, you're down to about 2.25. You indicated that lower inflation would pressure the average price down. So if I exclude fuel surcharge and exclude mix, are we looking at below 2% core price for next year? Is my math correct there in interpreting what you said? Is there something I'm missing there?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Walter, as you know, we don't give pricing guidance. So we're not getting -- other than that we're focused on it. We price per value. We're confident in our ability to get reinvestable pricing and above inflation. We also commented that we don't -- won't get the turbocharge, if you will, over 1.5 on legacy and that we will feel a little bit of pressure on the moderating inflationary pressures for those contracts that are -- have that index. Beyond that, we haven't given commentary on our pricing, other than to say that we're going to continue to provide a good safe service to our customers and continue to look for opportunities to price to value and then continue to achieve core pricing in our business.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Just sticking on pricing here on the yields side with Ag. Obviously, as the volume is coming back, it is affecting your average yield. Is the fourth quarter rate, whether we use it on a per carload basis or -- should it continue to move? Or is that fourth quarter rate a fairly decent rate to use for -- as we look at 2014?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "No. Certainly, as we are continuing out the crop year, which kind of goes through the mid part of the second quarter, you would probably see similar trends as what we've seen in the fourth quarter. The further out that should look, it certainly depends on the crop year for next year. The weather and the size of the crop that should get beyond that.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, got it. Okay. And just a technical question perhaps for Lance. Headcount, how do you see that evolving? Is that something that changes directly with volume? Or do you see some synergy opportunities here that you can maybe move headcount a little less than volume this year?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes. Our intent is to always move headcount less than the growth rates and volume, and that's what we'd anticipate doing.", "Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Is flat a good number to put in for now? Or...", "Lance M. Fritz", "We won't make any...", "John J. Koraleski", "I hope not. I hope we grow more than that.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long of Stephens.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "When you gave your long-term OR guidance, you talked about averaging about 50% incremental margins along the way. The last 2 years, we've been well above that level. Clearly, a big piece of this is due to the top line growth being more driven -- or driven more by RPU, as volumes have been slightly down. But headed into the next couple of years, if we see volumes start to drive a larger percentage of your top line growth, is it fair to say we see incremental margins trend closer to that 50% or maybe even a little bit below?", "Robert M. Knight", "Justin, all those are factors -- this is Rob. All of those are factors that go into what it ultimately would be. But I haven't changed our view in terms of needing to achieve as this kind of a rough target, that 50% incremental margin on our growth as we look forward. So how we get there will depend on mix, will depend on fuel prices, will depend on a lot of things. But that's still our focus.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about Intermodal pricing and your expectations to -- in 2014. Do you think we could see an acceleration versus the trends we've seen in the last year? Or is your expectation that it continues to be a pretty competitive pricing environment?", "Robert M. Knight", "No. So from an industry standpoint, I'm not making any reference to UP, but from an industry standpoint, it's still a competitive industry. The international intermodal industry has surplus capacity with all the steamship carriers coming on. The domestic intermodal industry, it's a huge opportunity but you've got a lot of effective competitors. It is a competitive environment.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And do you think that XPO's acquisition of Pacer will have any impact on your business? And overall, as you look at your IMC partners, is there a possibility we'll see any changes or shifts in the next year or 2?", "Robert M. Knight", "XPO's acquisition of Pacer, from our perspective, we think is a good deal for XPO and Pacer and our business relationships with them. And we expect that to be positive for us. In terms of the other IMCs in the industry, there's always a lot of moving parts. Our approach is to have business relationships with the wide swath of the IMCs, and we'll continue to do that.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna Financial.", "Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "A question for Rob, just one, specifically as it relates to Mexico. I know the focus historically has been on Intermodal and Automotive, when we go to the talking points on growth. But you obviously have a movement afoot down there legislatively to open up natural resource extraction opportunities to foreign investment. You're on the board of the venture down there. I was wondering, Rob, if you could just give us an update on the legislative pathway down there, perhaps the commercial opportunity in energy transporter with Mexico. And realistically, what kind of time frame we might start to think about as that develops into a real viable commercial opportunity for UP?", "Robert M. Knight", "Matt, Jack and I are both on the FXE board in it for those of you who may not be as close to it, we have -- we own 26% of interest. I think everybody's excited about what's happening down in Mexico on multiple fronts but specifically to the energy reform. I think there probably are a lot of bases yet to be tagged and a lot of progress yet to be made. So I don't think it's necessarily a this-year kind of activity. But it's probably several years out yet before you actually see it start to take hold. But nonetheless, it's a great opportunity for us and our partner.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "How much did your cross-border traffic grow last year?", "John J.

Koraleski", "10% first year, over $2 billion of revenue.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then as that traffic grows, what impact is it going to have on length of haul and to average intermodal ARPUs?", "Eric L. Butler", "We measure length of haul from the border. So I don't think it will have a material impact in terms of on length of haul metrics.", "Robert M. Knight", "Matt, that 10% growth, by the way, was in the fourth quarter, just to be clear.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just the last follow-up on that. Can you give us a sense of the incremental margin from cross-border versus the overall franchise?", "Robert M. Knight", "Matt, this is Rob. Yes, we don't break that out that way.

It looks like we'll get some carrier consolidation this year with the new alliance, potentially a big merger. What, if anything, do you think that means for the business in general and your franchise specifically?", "Eric L. Butler", "As I was saying, our assessment is that there's a significant overcapacity in the steamship industry today and short of worldwide improvement in industrial production that consumes that capacity they'll need to have something done to absorb that capacity. So there are a lot of conversations going on, as you mentioned. I'm not sure we have any particular insight or perspective beyond what's out there in the marketplace.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "Okay. And then one question on operations. For most of 2013, your growth was very biased towards your Southern region and to manifest traffic in particular. So that was a challenge that you were dealing with. Does that trend persist in 2014? Or is that dynamic starting to level out a little bit?", "John J. Koraleski", "I don't think we comment on where exactly volume's going. But I will say that the South has done a stellar job stepping up to that volume increase. And actually, I would welcome continuing to see that trend. It would leverage the capital investment we've been putting down there and leverage the process improvements that our team has put in place. I'm really pretty excited about that.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel.", "John G.

We were wondering if you had a message embedded in your use of the phrase \"pricing for reinvestability\" instead of the phrase that perhaps has been used more historically, \"inflation plus pricing.\" Is there a nuanced meaning to that?", "Robert M. Knight", "No, John. In fact, I've used that terminology actually for several years. Basically, what we're saying is at a minimum, something has to be able to be priced at a reinvestable level. We price to market, and we're confident we add it all up if that's above inflation.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes. Our long-term goal, John, we started this a long time ago, is to say that every carload of freight that moves on the Union Pacific meets our reinvestability threshold. So that's kind of like an entry-level as we look at pricing opportunities. And that's why in some cases, our volume growth hasn't been quite as strong because we're being relatively selective in terms of what business does move on our franchise.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then just as a follow-on perhaps for Lance. As you've gotten deeper into the PTC project, I know initially there were thoughts that there weren't a lot of economic benefits associated with it. But as you've gotten deeper into it, do you think there are some operational improvements that could be driven out of the data and capabilities that will be embedded in the PTC system once it's fully operational?", "Lance M. Fritz", "So John, this is how we think about PTC: The first is I'm very proud of our team and our industry for driving that project to a point where now I can see, I believe, it's going to be successful and we're going to have put in place a significant -- maybe the industry's most significant technological advancement in a very short -- relatively short period of time. All PTC does is overlay on your existing system and stop trains for 4 reasons. So PTC on its own and the technology that we're investing right now on its own does not enhance operations. It is a safety enhancement, and I applaud that. Having said that also, the technology that's embedded in PTC might form a foundation for future investments that could be helpful, but that's over and above the investments that we're making right now, and they'll have to be justified by that return.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Rob mentioned fuel as a potential speed bump on the path to the OR target. But are there still any major fuel efficiency levers and reserve, like broader distributed power or more full implementation of throttle technology?", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. Could you repeat that question please for me?", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Sure, Lance. I guess, I'm asking, given the importance of fuel, are there still major levers to pull, like broader implementation of throttle technology or more use of distributed power?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, absolutely, there are. We're pretty deeply penetrated on DPU. But every unit that we buy is DPU-equipped. And so we'll continue to be able to penetrate parts of our network and train service that aren't currently DPU-ed. So that's always a benefit and a plus. And in terms of other technologies, we are actually deploying 2 different types of technology that will benefit in fuel consumption rate across the network. We're doing that in a measured fashion, testing it and highlighting it in certain areas first, but I see that we've got a lot of leverage we can continue to pull on fuel -- fuel consumption rate.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And following up on that. If you do improve fuel economy, do you have to in effect give some of this back via, say, reduced fuel surcharges?", "John J. Koraleski", "If you look at what we're going to do, Keith, we're going to invest in the economics. And we need to have a return on that in order to justify and pay for the investment that we're making in that. So at this point in time, we're not looking at changing any of our fuel. Basically, our fuel surcharge situation is designed to recover changes in fuel cost, and it will continue to be that way.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research.", "Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "My questions have been answered, but let me just ask one quick one. Pension expense, if you hit this, I know it will be lower, but can you just discuss what's changed and how much lower?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Higher returns and higher interest rates are driving a lower expected expense is what -- are the big drivers this year.", "Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Right, but did you identify how much lower?", "Robert M. Knight", "I did not.", "Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Are you willing to?", "Robert M. Knight", "Maybe in the neighborhood of $30-plus million delta.", "Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. So helpful, not material.", "Operator", "Our final question is from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I wondered, could you provide some context to what the volume growth looked like for the UPDS and streamline products in the fourth quarter and possibly provide some perspective as to what that volume comprises in the Intermodal segment in 2013?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. I don't think we historically break that out, but those are good vehicles for us to grow our business. We have a great business development focus, and both of those are and continue to grow nicely for our business.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then maybe as we a look into 2014 and think about container growth of your controlled fleet, can you provide a number for where we are in -- or we ended 2013 from a controlled container fleet perspective and what the growth expectation for 2014 will be?", "Eric L. Butler", "Are you talking about the size of the fleet?", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, the [indiscernible] and new [ph] mix.", "Eric L. Butler", "We historically have not discussed publicly the total size of our fleet. We do think that those strategies of an owned fleet are the right strategy. So we will be maintaining -- you could assume we will be maintaining or growing the size of our fleet.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'll turn this call back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. We're looking forward to speaking with you again at the end of April and in between as we have various meetings. So take care and thanks again.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference.

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of marketing and sales, Lance Fritz, President and Chief Operating Officer and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning we\u2019re pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved first quarter earnings of $2.38 per share, an increase of 17% compared to the first quarter of 2013 and another all-time quarter record. Total volumes were up 5% and the increase was broad-based.", "We saw growth in five of our six business groups with particular strength in agricultural shipments, industrial products and coal.", "The volume growth combined with solid core pricing and a continued focus on safety service and efficiency drove a 2 point improvement in our operating ratio to a record 67.1% for the quarter. As you all know this winter was one for the record but especially in the upper Midwest. So we're proud of the efforts of the men and women of the Union Pacific who worked tirelessly to serve our customers despite these weather challenges and helped us to achieve a solid start to the year. So with that let's get into it. I'll turn it over to Eric.", "Eric Butler", "", "Thanks Jack, and good morning. In the first quarter volume was up 5% compared to 2013 as solid demand made up for the challenging weather conditions in much of the country. We had strong grains in agricultural products, industrial products and coal. We also saw volume growth in the automotive and in chemicals we were able to offset declines in crude oil with gains in other commodities to end up even with last year\u2019s strong first quarter results.", "Corporate improved 2% which was partially offset by unfavourable mix and lower fuel prices to produce a 1% improvement in average revenue per car add in our volume growth and we increased freight revenue by 6% to a first quarter record of $5.3 billion. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups.", "At products volume grew 13%, which combined with a 3% improvement in average revenue per car throws revenue growth up 16%. We continue to see strong demand for grain with carloadings up 39% driven by last year's strong harvest. The biggest gains were in grain exports to China and Mexico and wheat exports to the Gulf. And lower corn prices drove increased demand for domestic feed grains. Grain product volume was up 5%, driven by the 11% increase in ethanol shipments as refineries replenish low ethanol inventories.", "Shipment to BBG's grew 38%, driven by strong export demand primarily from China. Food and repurchase shipments were down 3% for the quarter as the winter weather impact the cycle times for equipment serving the produce and frozen food markets. Partially offsetting those declines were gains in import beer where volume grew 3%.", "Automotive volume grew 2%, though average revenue per car was down 2% resulting in flat revenue for the quarter. I'll talk more about the average revenue per car decline in a moment. First, finished vehicle shipments declined 3% as winter weather impacted shipments and we had a couple of plants with unscheduled shutdowns. While automotive production was strong in the quarter, the severe winter weather contributed to year-over-year sales declines in January and February. Sales rebounded strongly in March, up 5.6% thanks to improved weather and dealer incentives. We expect that our finished vehicle shipments to rebound as the rail network recovers from the challenging weather.", "From the parts side volume increased 9% with strong production and over-the-road conversions driving gains. The decrease I mentioned earlier in average revenue per car reflects a change in the way we handle per diem revenue on Intermodal containers used by our customers for auto parts. As a result in 2014 the per diem revenue is included in other revenues instead of automotive commodity revenue.", "Chemicals volume was flat for the quarter with revenue up 2% on a 3% increase on average revenue per car. Industrial chemicals volume was up 7%, driven by strength in end user market such as shale related drilling, paper products and the icing materials. Fertilizer shipments were up 7% for the quarter on strong export potash demands.", "Crude oil volume declined 18% compared to the first quarter of last year with price spreads negatively impacting volume. Partially offsetting the decline was an increase in our prior shipments to the Gulf Coast.", "Turning now to coal, revenue increased 3% in the first quarter on a 7% increase in volume. The average revenue per car declined 4% driven by mix and lower fuel prices. Southern Powder River basin tonnage was up 2% as demand from the cold winter and higher natural gas prices offset our previously reported contract loss.", "Colorado, Utah coal tonnage was up 13%, and benefitting from the increased domestic demand as well as gains in West Coast exports. We continue to see strength from other coal producing regions where tonnage was up 25% for the quarter.", "Now in industrial products business, a 9% increase in volume and a 1% improves in average revenue per car produced revenue growth of 10%.", "Non-metallic minerals volume was up 18% for the quarter. We continue to see strong demand for frac sand and shale related drilling which was up 22% over last year. Aggregate and cement demand were strong particularly in Texas and California, driving construction shipments up 10% for the first quarter. And our government and waste shipments were up 23%, driven by a waste customer adding short haul shipments in January and February. Additionally the winter weather increased demand for salt, while shipments were up 28% compared to the first quarter last year.", "Intermodal revenue was up 4% in the first quarter, driven by 3% volume gain and a 1% improvement in average revenue per unit. Domestic Intermodal volume was up 8% in the quarter, driven by strength from our traditional IMC customers, new motor carrier customers and demand for new premium service offerings.", "Headwinds from the severe winter weather were offset by business development and highway conversions. Our international Intermodal volumes declined 1% against the strong comparison from the first quarter of 2013. The winter weather impacted consumer demand and imports to the West Coast ports were down nearly 3% for the first two months of the year.", "Now take a look at how we see out business shaping up for the rest of 2014. Our current outlook is for the economy to strengthen modestly this year. Last year's strong crops should provide opportunity for ag products in the second quarter with anticipated strength in both domestic and export grain markets. 2014 crop yields will be dependent on the weather.", "In food and refrigerator, we expect growth in import beer, but the draught in California could create a headwind for tomato paste and canned goods.", "Automotive market fundamentals remain strong with demands for new vehicles, easy access to financing, low interest rates and low fuel prices, all expected to drive increased sales. We should see finished vehicle volume rebound in the second quarter as continue to recover from the winter weather.", "Most of our chemicals markets should remain solid throughout 2014. Crude by rail will continue to be impacted by spreads, a growing gulf crude supply and increased pipeline capacity. Lower inventories will continue to be a driver for our coal business in the second quarter. Weather conditions in summer will influence how things shape up for the full year.", "Industrial products should continue to benefit from shale related activity with increased drilling, supporting growth in frac sand and pipe shipments. Housing starts were off to a slow start in 2014, but they are still projected to exceed 1 million units which we anticipate will drive demand for lumber shipments and we think the strength in construction products will continue.", "Highway conversions and new product offerings should continue to drive growth in domestic Intermodal. International Intermodal should benefit from a continued improving economy and strengthening housing market. For the full year our strong value preposition and diverse franchise will again support business development efforts across our broad portfolio business.", "Assuming the economy cooperates, we expect to deliver profitable revenue growth yet again in 2014, driven by continued volume growth and corporation's gains. With that I'll turn in over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance which is the foundation of our operations.", "The first quarter of 2014 reportable injury rate improved 3% versus 2013. Progress achieved through our comprehensive safety strategy, the number of severe injuries during the quarter declined to a record low reflecting our work to reduce the risk of critical incidents, our team's commitment to the Courage to Care and the maturation of our total safety culture.", "Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate finished up 7% versus the quarterly record set in 2013. However the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet the regulatory reportable threshold decreased to a record lows in each of the first three months of this year.", "Looking forward we expect continued improvement from investments that harden our infrastructure, expand advanced defect detection technology and enhance our ability to find and address risks.", "In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improvement slightly versus 2013. Driver behaviour continues to be a critical element. To make continued progress we're focussed on improving or closing high risk crossings and reinforcing public awareness.", "Severe winter weather conditions were a headwind to our safety performance during the quarter, most notably where our employees faced the brunt of below zero temperatures and record snowfall. Even so the team did a tremendous job addressing the risks.", "In addition to impacting safety, the most severe winter weather we've faced in quite a few years materially impacted our first quarter network performance. The impact was evident in the upper Midwest and at interchange points with other carriers, particularly in Chicago. Extremely cold temperatures and significant snowfall disrupted operations by limiting train size, curtailing switching activity, reducing the mobility to mobilize crews to crew load, change locations, elongating equipment cycles and reducing fuel efficiency. Our dedicated employees did a great job battling difficult conditions while maintaining open channels of communication with customers and our interchange partners as we managed through the challenge.", "We responded by leveraging the unique value of Union Pacific. We adjusted transportation plans to use alternative switching yards and gateways. We realigned resources to where they were needed most and employed the use of our surge capacity.", "This included increasing our active locomotive fleet by about 600 units since last fall and increasing our active TE&Y workforce by roughly 550 since January. While we mitigated a fair amount of winter\u2019s impact, our service performance fell short of our expectations and we are working hard to achieve a rapid and full recovery. And while that recovery is now underway, most of our first quarter operating performance metrics reflect the winter's impact. Velocity declined 7% as adverse conditions generated an 80% increase in the number of days with major service interruptions. These interruptions temporarily reduced operating capacity during the quarter, particularly in the northern region. The interruptions in subsequent limits on network capacity also drove a decline in our service delivery index, a measure which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments.", "On a brighter note we were able to maintain local service within a decent range, registering a 93.1% industry spot and pool. This metric which measures the delivering or pulling of a car to or from a customer also reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced this year.", "In addition to surge resources, infrastructure investments have also improved our ability to recover after incidents, reducing their impact on the network. For 2014, we plan to invest around $3.9 billion which is up about $300 million from our 2013 spend. We're purchasing 200 locomotives this year compared to a 100 last year, impart due to future volume growth assumptions as well as our tier 4 emission strategy. We continue to invest in capacity across our network, including new capacity in the upper Midwest and in the South, that support expected growth.", "And speaking of unit volume growth, for the first time in several years we saw solid and relatively balanced regional volume growth. While severe weather impacted our ability to fully leverage that volume, we were still able to realize meaningful productivity gains. For example the increase in regional TE&Y employees was less than our unit growth, despite the surge of crews we deployed in the North. Freight cart dwell was up 12% for the quarter, driven by a 36% weather related increase in the Northern region.", "On a more positive note, we held locomotive productivity flat in the face of the headwinds. Our longer term trend of improving locomotive reliability coupled with effective utilization plans should register continued gains going forward.", "Overall, we generated reasonable productivity improvement as our men and women applied their expertise to improve safety, service and efficiency using the UP way. Our primary focus was serving our customers and keeping our employees safe during difficult operating conditions. The net result was a 2 percentage point improvement in operating ratio, something our team is very proud of achieving in a very difficult quarter.", "In summary, our full year operating outlook for 2014 remains positive. We are confident we are on a path for restoring operations back to normal. We're focussed on reducing variability in the network to drive service improvements and we've made progress during the past few weeks. We will continue to work closely with our interchange partners as our recovery and that of the entire rail industry is conditioned upon interchanged fluidity. And as performance improves and as demand dictates, we'll adjust our resource levels accordingly, including moving locomotives back into storage.", "We expect to generate record safety results on our way to an incident free environment as network performance improves and we utilize resources more efficiently, our ability to leverage unit growth that generates solid productivity will improve and we will continue to make smart capital investments that generate attractive returns by increasing capacity and high volume quarters while also supporting our safety, service and productivity initiatives.", "As a result we'll provide customers with a value preposition that supports growth with high levels of service. All combined it translates into increased returns for our shareholders.", "With that I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with the recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 7% to an all time record of more than $5.6 billion, driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expense totalled nearly $3.8 billion, increasing 3% over last year. Expenses include about $35 million or roughly $0.05 per share of cost associated with the severe weather conditions in the quarter. Operating income grew 14% to more than $1.8 billion, hitting a best ever mark for the first quarter.", "Below the line other income totalled $38 million, down 5% from 2013. Interest expense of $ 133 million was up 4% compared to the previous year primarily driven by new debt issuances at the beginning to 2014. Income tax expense increased to $671 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income grew 14% versus 2013. While the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a best ever first quarter earnings of $2.38 per share, up 17% versus 2013.", "Turning to our top line, freight revenue grew 6% to our first quarter record of just under $5.3 billion, driven primarily by 5% volume growth. Lower fuel prices and business mix each drove about a half point decline in our average revenue per car.", "Both in our grain and frac sands volumes were positive mix drivers, but were more than offset by negative mix in automotive and coal. Eric just pointed out the increases in lower ARC auto parts versus the decrease in finished vehicle volumes which accounts for the negative mix in automotive.", "As per coal, we did see the benefit of higher ARC volumes including our prior year re-price legacy business, however this was more than offset by increases in lower ARC, shorter haul movements. Increased Intermodal and waste shipments also contributed to the negative mix. Core pricing gains totalled slightly over 2%, continuing our pricing strategy of outpacing inflation.", "Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. As you recall 2014 is a legacy light year. So we will not see the point and a half of legacy benefits which we saw in 2013. We're also seeing the impact of lower inflation on that portion of our business that is tied to inflation escalators primarily All-LF. The type table at the bottom of the slide takes a closer look at the quarterly All-LF escalator. As you can see it rebounded only slightly from negative territory in the fourth quarter last year.", "While pricing is never easy, we continue to see solid core pricing gains above inflation on the business that we can touch in the marketplace today. Keep in mind also that the positive mix impact of new business or business returning to Union Pacific franchise is reflected in our margin gains but is not added to our core price calculation. We continue to be as focused as ever on pricing to market at rates that earn a fair and re-investible return.", "Moving on to the expense side, Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense which increased 3% compared to 2013. Higher volumes, inflation and weather were the primary drivers, offset by productivity realized by leveraging the volume growth. Total TE&Y increased slightly, but not at the same rate as our volume growth. However this increase was more than offset by a decrease in employees associated with capital projects for the quarter when compared to 2013.", "For the remainder of the year we would expect to see compensation and benefits expense to grow, but this will be largely dependent on how volume plays out. In addition we still expect to see labour inflation come in under 2% for the full year.", "Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totalled $921 million, up 2% when compared to 2013, driven primarily by higher GTMs associated with increased volumes. Our fuel consumption rate was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis with the weather having come negative impact. Total fuel expense was tempered by a 3% year-over-year decline in average diesel fuel prices.", "Moving on to the other expense categories, purchase service and materials expense increased 9% to $607 million, due to volume related subsidiary contract expenses, higher locomotive and freight car material costs and crude transportation and lodging costs.", "Depreciation expense was $464 million, up 7% compared to 2013, consistent with our prior guidance. Looking ahead, we now expect depreciation to be up 7% to 8% this year.", "Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rent expense totalled $312 million, which was flat when compared to 2013. Higher freight car rental expenses was offset by lower container lease costs. Other expenses came in at $226 million, down $11 million versus last year. Higher utility expense was more than offset by a year-over-year improvement in our freight and equipment damage costs as well as lower environmental and personal injury expenses. For 2014, we expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% for the full year, excluding any unusual items.", "Turning to our operating ratio performance. Pricing the business at re-investible levels and moving it safely and efficiently continues to drive results. We achieved a record first quarter operating ratio of 67.1% improving two points when compared to 2013. Longer term, we remain committed to achieving an operating ratio below 65% before 2017. We also remain committed to achieving strong cash generation and improving overall financial returns.", "Turning now to our cash flow. In the first quarter, cash from operations increased to almost $1.8 billion. You'll recall that we expect the headwind of about $400 million this year due to tax payments associated with prior years' bonus depreciation. These payments will be reflected in subsequent quarters.", "We invested about $900 million this quarter in cash capital investments and also returned $363 million in dividend payment to our shareholders. Also, in keeping our commitment to achieve a dividend pay-out range of 30% to 35%, we increased our declared dividend per share by 32% on a year-over-year basis.", "Taking a look at the balance sheet, we issued $1 billion of new debt in January bringing our adjusted debt balance to $13.3 billion at quarter end. This takes our adjusted debt to cap ratio to 38.4% up from 37.6% at yearend '13. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted debt to cap ratio of approximately 40% and a debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 by yearend. We feel our current cash outlook positions us well to execute our cash allocation strategy.", "Our record profitability and strong cash generation enable us to continue to fund our strong capital program and grow shareholder returns. In addition, we continue to make opportunistic share repurchases which play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation.", "As you may recall, our new repurchased authorization of up to 60 million shares over a four-year time period went into effect January 1st of this year. Under this new authority, we bought back 3.8 million shares totalling $683 million in the first quarter. This brings accumulative share repurchases since 2007 to $110 million shares. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. It represents roughly 45% increase over 2013, clearly demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.", "So that's a recap of the first quarter result.", "As we look to the remainder of the year, its favourable economy and some help from the weather will combine with our commitment on core pricing above inflation and our on-going productivity initiatives to produced continued margin improvement and record financial results.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Jack.", "John Koraleski", "Okay. Thanks, Rob.", "As we put this winter behind us, we're off to a good start for the year. As always, there's going to be some challenges ahead. But we also see opportunity. In the weeks ahead, we'll be focused on restoring the fluidity of our network after the winter slowdown. We're absolutely committed to pursuing the excellent service our customers expect and deserve. It's a cornerstone of our on-going success.", "Our value proposition to our customers depends on it. Strong service goes hand in hand with improvements in network in asset utilization that are so critical to our future. Another potential challenge for the entire industry is the uncertain regulatory environment, which is being played out in Washington D.C., Canada and Mexico. We're watching things closely on all fronts making sure that regulators truly understand the importance of a healthy growing rail industry.", "We're also watching the weather and the economy very closely. There's still a lot of year ahead of us, so we'll have to see how the summer burn plays out for coal demand and how the 2014 crops will fair everything from planning through harvest. As far as the economy goes, a lot can change between now and the end of the year. But at this point, we're seeing some signs of gradual economic improvement. And we're encouraged by the opportunities it presents.", "With the power and the potential of the Union Pacific franchise, we'll leverage these opportunities to drive record financial performance and shareholder returns this year and in the years' to come. So with that, let's get started and open it up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "Our first question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research", "So I wanted to just first ask about the yields, particularly on the auto and coal side. So if I'm understanding this right, as finished vehicles start to grow again as whether it gets better, shall we start thinking about auto yields growing again? And then on the coal side, with yields down 4% year-over-year, they were just so strong in first quarter last year up 16%, was there anything unusual, like any liquidated damages last year that you didn't have this year that's driving that? Because I'm just not sure how to model coal yields going forward.", "Robert Knight", "Yes. Scott, let me talk about the autos first. As Eric mentioned in his comments, there was a process changed and affected some per diem treatment on some containers. It basically accounts for all of the decline in the autos' arc. On top of that then, as he also pointed out, the mid shift of finished vehicles and more auto parts also had an impact on arc. So we don\u2019t give guidance on what the mix is going to look like or what the arc is going to look like by commodity line, and we don't do it by the way as a company.", "But directionally, yes, if we see growth in finished vehicles outpacing the growth in auto parts, you would expect that trend to move in that direction. We're not giving that specific guidance, but you're thinking about it right.", "On the coal, our coal arc was down 4%, roughly half of that was driven by mix. I mean your traditional mix. If you might see, that's a great movement of shorter haul coal moves and less shipments of the higher. In some cases, repriced coal business. And the other half was made up of lower fuel prices drove lower average every car on the arc line. And year-over-year, you're exactly right, there was a small, as you recall we pointed out. It was roughly $15 million of liquidity. The damage is last year that did not repeat this year. That at this point, I don't see that our trend is continuing throughout the year. So that had a little bit of an impact on our coal arc line as well. And that piece was about 1.5, if you will, of the 1.5% of the 4% decline.", "Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then I just wanted to take a shot at the long-term margin guidance. So if I look at historically at the first quarter OR and then the full year OR, the full year typically is about three to four points better than the first quarter, and you had weather in 1Q. I mean it feels like we're on a run rate this year around 64% for the OR. And that's just so much -- so different than the sub-65 in 2017. So I'm not sure that if the long-term guidance is just really still or is there something that you're telling us that we need to be thinking about or worried about the next three quarters that's going to dramatically change the trajectory margins.", "John Koraleski", "Hey, Scott, our guidance is below 65 before 2017, not in 2017. Rob, why don't you fill in the blanks on that?", "Robert Knight", "Yes. Scott, I mean we hope you're right. I mean there's a lot of things that have to play out. I mean we certainly hope for the economy cooperates fuel prices as you've heard us speak many times. It can have an impact directly on the margins and the operating ratio.", "So as we've said all along on this financial improvement journey over the last decade, we're not looking at the sub-65% as an endpoint and we're not going to slowdown. We're going to get there safely and efficiently as we can. And if all the stars line, the economy cooperates and we move in direction that we hope everything happens, we get there as soon as we can. But our best look at this point in time is that it looks to us like it's sometime before 2017.", "Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a quick question on the volume pace, as you came out of the first quarter, things obviously ramping up. It seems like there was probably some pent up demand here that's carried into the second quarter. How do we think about sort of how long that last and maybe the pace of activity here? And how much is sort of still yet to be moved and wants to be moved and kind of when can the catch up do you think?", "John Koraleski", "Yes. I think you're exactly right, Chris. I think as we move towards the end of the quarter, we were catching up from some of the issues in the early quarter. But our volume outlook is still fairly decent for the year. So Eric, you want to \u2026", "Eric Butler", "Yes. Chris, as Jack said, clearly, there were some catch up, particularly when you think about the difficulties that the winter had on the automotive business. And then deep in coal utilities, there was a strong coal burn, and so there was some catch up there.", "You can also think about our grain business and the grain harvest. There's a natural processing in the first quarter shipping the record corn harvest that we had in the fourth quarter. But like Jack said, I'm pretty optimistic about a slowly-strengthening economy for the balance of the year. Slowly strengthening economy across our book of business will have positive impacts. Plus, we continue to have a strong valued proposition. And so we're optimistic for the balance of the year.", "Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup", "That's great. That's very helpful.", "And on the coal side, when you think about the inventories of the utilities that you're serving relative to the length of haul differences that I think showed up here in the first quarter, how should we think about that? Is there any imbalance there we might suggest you have stronger volumes continuing to the shorter length of haul utilities? Any sort of color you could give there would be helpful.", "Eric Butler", "Yes, I would say this. Those kind of balance in and out. Inventories are quite low. As you probably know, there are about 21 days below what would be considered normal. So they're quite low. But there's no kind of imbalance between short and long haul that would have a mix change for the future.", "Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America", "Great. Good morning. Great job working through the weather.", "Just a follow up on the short haul freight that you've gained, it seems like a lot impacting the mix. Can you talk if there's any long-term impact on margins? And really, is this long-term business or is this because some competitors are having infrastructure issues as they fix that, some of that reverts back to a different network or is this more permanent business in nature?", "John Koraleski", "Yes. It really kind of depends on the individual markets, Ken. For instance, the short haul move that Eric referenced on the waste product is a customer of ours that just historically last year had moved for nine months, and this year really picked up a volume in the first. So that's kind of an on-going issue for us.", "Rob, do you want to -- do you have any more with the \u2026", "Rob Knight", "Yes. Can I just say -- I mean your question is heading right on the reason why you heard me many, many times, say we're not going to get guide this fund on average revenue per car because mix is always a part of our business. And when you look as diverse as our franchise is, as diverse as all of our commodity groups are, mix is rather normal.", "But as you also are questioning in terms of the margin, just because something has a short haul lower average revenue per car doesn't mean it has a lower margin. So we're not afraid of that at all. We're pricing and moving the business as efficiently as we can, driving our margins which in fact we've done. We did that in the first quarter even with this negative mix impact.", "So mix will always be a part of our business, but we're focused on improving our margins regardless of the length of haul.", "John Koraleski", "As Rob said, if we can get our re-investability threshold met, we're happy to take the business.", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America", "That's great insight. Thanks.", "Just a follow up on the locomotive side, and I guess demand side overall. You noted demand kind of creeping in a little bit on a gradual improvement. If we start seeing, I guess, a faster pace of improvement, what's your thoughts on your ability to handle it to take the capacity access locomotives, your infrastructure's ability to handle it? Maybe it's a Lance questions in terms of scalability of the infrastructure and available capacity.", "John Koraleski", "Absolutely. Lance?", "Lance Fritz", "Sure. So Ken, we feel pretty good about fluidly handing the volume that Eric is bringing on for the network. If you think about where we are right now, the first quarter was, what, 179,078 car loads. We've publicly said we think our network can handle 195,000 plus with a very good excellent service product. So we're looking forward to that volume.", "Of course, it's dependent to some degree on exactly where it shows up. But you know, we've been putting capacity into the network in anticipation of that, and we feel pretty good about handling the volume.", "John Koraleski", "And our first quarter was pretty balanced, so we like that.", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America", "And similarity access to locomotives to handle that? Is that infrastructure still available?", "John Koraleski", "It is. If you think about how many locomotives we have left in surge right now. It's a little over 300. That's bearing in mind that we brought in what was at 600 locomotives since the fall with a large portion those not driven by volume, but instead driven by trying to overcome winter's impact. So we've got surgery resources that will be able to handle it.", "Lance Fritz", "So as we spin up volume and our operating stats improve, we'll actually be seeking some power out of the network and putting it back in storage.", "John Koraleski", "That's right.", "Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America", "Appreciate the time. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.", "Rob, I wanted to ask you about pricing. When we see this inflation metrics start to rise a bit, is it logical to think that the core pricing headline starts to rise as well? Is it as simple as that or is there another element though that you have to keep in mind?", "Robert Knight", "I mean that part of business that is tied to the All-LF and there were timing differences. And as you've heard us comment many times, they're not all the same. Those contracts and those pieces of our business that are tied to the All-LF have different timeframes of when they trigger. So you pick that into consideration. But directionally, if inflation increases and as All-LF in fact reflects that, that part of business that is tied to All-LF will increase. Yes.", "William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right. And then as we look \u2026 next year is a legacy. It's got more legacy in it, right? So as we look to next year, this should have a pretty good directional trend.", "Robert Knight", "Yes, next year, Bill, as you've heard us say several times, we've got roughly $300 million of revenue which tends to be sort of frontend a business that we will compete for in the marketplace. But it's about $300 million of legacy revenue next year.", "William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right. And then on inflation, I think in the past you've talked about seeking to offset it with productivity. But if it's going to run this low, is there a chance that our productivity actually causes our -- so not the cost-related to the volume growth, but rather just a fix cost based in the productivity. Can that actually cost the number to go down?", "Robert Knight", "Lance could comment on this as well. But I would say, potentially. Again, as what you're referring to, Bill, as you know is we set the price the business to market, achieve a successful above inflation sort of pricing environment. And then in addition to that, offset, and we challenge ourselves to offset all. But if we hit 50% of offsetting inflation through productivity, that's a great model. And to your point, we're in a lower inflation area environment and a positive volume environment that gives us more options to do as well as we can on that.", "John Koraleski", "That's perfect. Rob is absolutely right. Mirroring what Rob says about our drive to an improved OR, there's -- we don't set a limit as just offset inflation. We look for efficiency and productivity everyday through the UP way.", "William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "That's great. Thank you so much for your time.", "Operator", "And next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please go over with your question.", "Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Good morning, guys. It's been well publicized that your competitors had some major, major service issues, and it seems like you guys probably got some freight from them. How much do that really stress the system in the first quarter when you saw on top of the weather, and everything else?", "John Koraleski", "Jason, if you look at our issues in the first quarter, it was 99% winter. The additional volume and whatever we've taken on either of our own bringing on to the network or anything that might have been diverted on a temporary or permanent basis basically just would have been handled easily by our resources or infrastructure of the investments we've made in the past. So it did not -- the additional business did not stress our network. It was just really the impact of winter weather and the impact that it had not only on Union Pacific but broad-based throughout the industry on our interchange partners.", "Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay. And Jack, this is a broader question. I asked this on another call the other day. We've had issues with Chicago as an interchange in the real network, the entire topic been an analyst. I mean obviously it was great exacerbated this quarter with winter weather. And I know there's been projects around, like they create a project to try to improve that. What's really just holding the rail in street back from all giving together and really just trying to fix this interchange once and for all? Because it seems like this is something that would benefit sixth or the seventh class once going forward.", "John Koraleski", "My perspective on that, Jason, is Create still is a blueprint for how we can significantly improve the throughput in the Chicago area. But each railroad has its own issues that's stealing with as well. And so in our world, we're making investments. We're planning. We're working together having the centralized operating controlled group in Chicago help to mitigate some of the winter weather. But there's lessons learned here.", "And I'm sure that as we come out of this first quarter experience, we'll learn from that, the industry will learn from that. We spend a lot of time working with our interchange partners on throughput and volumes, and things like that, how can we handle things more fluidly, our ability to divert to different gateways depending on the individual interchange partner, those kinds of things.", "So I think there'll be lessons learned from this. But I still fundamentally think the investment and the strategy identified and Create holds a lot of potential for us. Lance, what do you think?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes. Absolutely, Jack. And there's something that the participants in Create have been public about, and that is since the start of Create, we've taken a half a day out of the time it takes for a car to transfer through Chicago side to side, end to end, which is real progress. It's down by about a third. And this year's winter was epic.", "And in the absence of Create and the Chicago Planning Group and the coordination that the interchange railroads undertook, it would have been a much worse outcome. Clearly, lessons learned, but it was effective.", "Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company", "And Lance, what do you think that number can come to? You said it's down by a third. I mean will it keep down by \u2026", "Lance Fritz", "No. So think about it like this. We've got 17 capital projects already in place, complete. There are 20 are in designer underway, and so each one of those is going to help. So there's still fair amount of upside in terms of reducing the time it takes cars contributors.", "Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay. Jim, I really appreciate the time as always.", "John Koraleski", "Thanks, Jason.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey, good morning gentlemen.", "John Koraleski", "Good morning, John.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I wanted to focus on the real cost escalator chart that was in Rob's, actually in the presentation. And if you look back at the trailing four quarters, that's pretty tampered inflation. And I would have thought with the labor cost, the escalation built in your contracts that certainly overtime you would've seen more than an average of less than one, which I think it probably works out to be there.", "Anything that's going on there that were missing? And would you expect that to continue over the next four quarters?", "Robert Knight", "Yes, John. I think you're going to see it continue to be low for the next four quarters. And if you recall that our labor inflation, which as you know the way the All-LF works is a market basket of inputs from the industry. But the labor inflation for us, we think it's going to be less than 2% this year. So that is a big piece of what's in there. And so it is driving and has been for quite some time now the reduction in that All-LF number.", "So it lines up, and overtime it does what it's intended to do. From quarter to quarter, there might be some timing issues. But it's done its job over multiple quarter and multiyear period.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then maybe just a follow-on on the timing of the restoration of complete fluidity in and around Chicago in the northern -- into the network. One of the executives giving testimony at the STB last week suggested that Chicago should be back in normal completely within four to six weeks. Is that in keeping with kind of your expectations? And will there be any meaningful impact on the EPS line during that restoration period?", "John Koraleski", "Hey, Lance, why don't you handle the outlook?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes. Okay, John.", "So we are very encouraged by what we see happening on our network right now. We're confident that sometime in the second quarter we will be back to normal. We're working to make that as soon as possible. And in terms of Chicago interchange, that's a difficult question for me to answer because it's dependent on how quickly the networks of interchange railroads come up to speed. What we see right now is real solid improvement as we've exited winter.", "John Koraleski", "Yes. So we're hoping it won't be a material. You won't see a lot of it in the second quarter from a cost perspective. But it really depends on how it plays itself out.", "John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.", "Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.", "John Koraleski", "Good morning.", "Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Rob, with regards to the incremental margins, as I'm taking a step back and kind of listening to what I heard on the call, it's fairly a mix work against you guys. There's a lot of incremental cause associated with winter weather which meant the network wasn't -- probably wasn't running as full as it could in constrained train lengths.", "Should I think about the Q1 64% incremental margin as being a low for the year and expanding from there?", "Robert Knight", "Rob, as you know, we don't give that level of guidance. But as you heard me say many times, for us to get from where we are today to our sub-65, and we're not going to slow down to get there in time. We get there as efficiently as we can.", "As soon as we're going to get 50% kind of number on incremental margins from here to there, there can be lumpiness from quarter to quarter depending on volumes of weather and other issue, fuel prices and other issues. So, you know, we're going to keep doing as well as we can. But I've shied away from getting specific quarterly guidance on that incremental margin number other than to get to our sub-65, we've got to continue to make good progress.", "Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. That's right. But we should think about the network running more fluidly, and that should obviously help overall operational performance, I would imagine.", "Robert Knight", "That would be a plus. Absolutely. And then we'll see what volume -- our volume actually plays out.", "Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes. It's fair. I'm not sure if this question should be directed towards Lance or towards Eric. I noticed in the network productivity section, one of the slides. You guys were calling out about 4% volume growth in the north. And as recently as a couple of quarters that it had been down on a year-over-year basis, clearly, your primary competitor in the west has been having a lot of challenges in that region.", "It looks like the TE&Y headcount, it increased about 6% year-over-year. Is this 6% growth with regard to expectations for future volume growth are just handling current traffic? And on a side note of that, can you give us a sense if you guys are seeing incremental competitive wins in the north, what type of traffic that's coming on, if it's coming on on the manifest network or unit train network?", "Eric Butler", "Yes, I think what you saw in the TE&Y buildup of 6%, Rob, was basically the impact of winter where we flooded the northern region with extra labor to help us work our way through the winter process. And it's not necessarily a reflection of what's happening in the north on an ongoing basis. Lance, you want to -- is that okay?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, that's perfect. Yes, yes.", "Eric Butler", "And then the other thing is when you think about our northern region, think about that's where the grain is, that's where frac sand is and our model is sitting there and also our coal business. And so, those were all some fairly decent volume gains just intrinsic in the business itself.", "Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Appreciate the color. It sounds like more unit train there. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Good morning.", "I just wanted to follow up with a question on coal and specifically the growth in Colorado, Utah coal versus Southern Powder River Basin. So you mentioned 13% tonnage growth in Colorado and 2% in SPRB. Was that a function of whether or easy comps? How do we think about sort of the relative tonnage growth with the respect of these two origins for the balance of the year?", "John Koraleski", "Okay, Eric?", "Eric Butler", "Yes, tonnage. When you think about Colorado-Utah coal, there was some easy comps year over year. We do continue to expect in the outlook to see a Colorado-Utah coal being a good source for export coal as the export coal opportunity strengthen in the future.", "But I think if you think about it going forward, Southern Powder River Basin growth will probably outpace Colorado-Utah growth going forward in terms of upside opportunity.", "Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And is it fair to say that the SPRB has a longer length of haul?", "Eric Butler", "That depends on the origin and destination pair. But that's probably not an unreasonable expectation. But it depends on the origin of destination pair.", "Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got it. Okay. And then just -- I have a couple of questions on the frac sand business. You mentioned the volumes were up over 20% in the quarter. So I was wondering if you talk a little bit about the sustainability of this pace of growth over the next couple of years as new minds continue to come online in Wisconsin. And then could you give us some sense of how much of the frac business you are originating and terminating on your own minds? And maybe what shales you're delivering the most active?", "Eric Butler", "Yes. We're very excited about our frac sand franchise. We think we have the premier origination franchise and we think a significant portion of the new mines that are coming online in the Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois region actually are coming on. Our franchise, at least access our franchise. So we're pretty optimistic about the longevity and the outlook from that standpoint.", "At the end of the day, it's really going to be drilling that really drives the consumption of frac sand and the drilling trends in terms of longer mines, longer drilling, deeper drilling, deeper horizontal more fracing all are pointing to significant continued growth in frac sand consumption, on those the really interesting friends in Texas in particular for Permian basin and Eagle Ford basin, I think in January I don\u2019t know, the February March numbers have come up but in January Texas had an all-time record of production of oil in terms of record just going back to the early 80s. So as long as those drilling trends continue you'll see the frac sand demand continue and we have a premier frac sand franchise.", "Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And I would imagine that has a pretty good length of haul from Wisconsin to Texas. Is that correct?", "Eric Butler", "Turbos [ph] is north, south, it\u2019s not as long as some east west moves but it is a pretty good part of our franchise.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.", "Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Rob, I wanted to come back to the discussion on pricing. Because I feel like there's a lot of maybe misunderstanding around the core pricing gains. Obviously you had higher levels of gains last year, but actually we're seeing better margin expansion this quarter. Can you just expand on your comment about how the new and incremental business is not necessarily captured in your metrics?", "Robert Knight", "Yeah, I mean you have heard me say this many times but the way we calculate price at Union Pacific is how much price do we yield in a particular time period against our entire book of business. I am very proud of the way we calculate it because it\u2019s the most conservative way of looking at it. What I pointed is that, so what that means that if we bring on a new piece of business or business that we haven't had for over a year let\u2019s say, that business might come on at great margins, of course we\u2019re very focused on bringing on at the right margins at the market level pricing. But it wouldn\u2019t show up in the new price, I mean it wouldn\u2019t show up in the year-over-year calculation of price.", "So you\u2019re exactly right, when we point out that our pricing was up 2% and all the headwinds we faced, low legacy number light and All-LF impact, the reason that we were able to expand our margins is we were able to leverage the business, leverage the new volumes that came on and as new business came on, we are confident we are pricing it right but it doesn\u2019t show up in the pricing number, but it shows up in our margins.", "Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And that's what we should really be focused on, to see how you are delivering on the pricing front, right?", "Robert Knight", "I mean clearly pricing is a tool along with productivity and other things that we do, but at the end of the day margin expansion is clearly the ultimate driver, the ultimate answer.", "Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hopefully, I can just get one follow-up in here for Lance. Lance, I think you did state that the network is designed for 190,000, 195,000 units, I believe. That's about 5% from where you've been running the last few weeks. Does that signal that we need a lot more CapEx going forward? Or are there any structural constraints in the network that make it tough to get to 200,000?", "Lance Fritz", "No, Brandon, what we typically say is 195, 200,000, several days we could handle fluidly and we say that because in 2006 we peaked at a number about like that very different service product at that time and since then we improved processes, we\u2019ve invested capital, we have more surge capacity and that's what gives us the confidence level. From the point of view of handling the volume that Eric\u2019s team is bringing on right now and for the rest of the year, absent some acute areas where maybe we've got a very specific capacity constraint we feel very good about being able to satisfy that with a high service product.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.", "Bascome Majors \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "There's a lot of regulatory balls in the air, the STB particularly, relative to just a few months ago. And you also mentioned some things developing in Canada and Mexico earlier in your comments. I was just hoping if you look at these all at once, could you help frame what, in your mind, is the greatest long-term concern for you? And perhaps additionally what's more immediate that you're looking at today that could impact you fairly soon?", "John Koraleski", "That\u2019s a fairly broad question and so we treat each of those as a very serious issue and we look at them very carefully and closely. So we\u2019re watching what's happening with Needling [ph] proposals the service hearings, the Canadian directed agricultural equipments, the Mexico reform. So in each of those cases we have teams of people looking at working very hard to ensure as I said in my opening remarks that everyone understands the importance of having a viable growing and healthy rail system that\u2019s paid for by private investment and not tax share dollars. So while we consider each one of those to be a very serious and concerning development it also gives us the opportunity to position all of the great things that not only Union Pacific but the entire rail industry has done by the constant reinvestment and investment of capital dollars to build the transportation infrastructure in this country and actually throughout North America that there is today.", "So we take them all one by one, if you look at the new discussion around revenue adequacy it\u2019s going to be an opportunity for us to point out the benefits of what\u2019s happened so far, the investment that\u2019s been made, the importance of having decisions that were going to change things to recognize replacement costs, those kinds of things. The service hearings, I think well I think could position us well to tell the story of how even though it was a difficult quarter for the industry, the capital investment made it a lot better than it probably would've been if it had happened five or 10 years ago. In Mexico, we've been working very hard to make sure the government understands the importance in the developments and the volumes that have improved since we took on our concession in partnership with the FXE and that if they look at the throughput and the development of transportation within the country it has certainly helped to grow the Mexico economy. If you look at all the investment from the automotive industry and things like that.", "So we look at these as every one of them, well, it's a serious issue if it were to go it right, give us a great opportunity to talk about all the good things that have happened. And so we\u2019re not afraid of them, we\u2019re willing to step up to the plate and participate each and every one of them to make sure our story gets told.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.", "Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I guess my first question here is for Lance. With all the difficulty you had in the winter weather you still managed to keep your headcount under good control here and didn't really need to resource up significantly to add any redundancy. So, that's quite impressive. But I'm just wondering is that reflective of what could've been a lower headcount if you didn't have the weather? How should we look at your headcount as you go through the year and the year this year?", "Lance Fritz", "So Walter, we think about headcount, resourcing, for the volume that shows up where it shows up, so that we can maintain an excellent service product. I won\u2019t look backwards and guess that what it would've been if winter hadn\u2019t happened. Going forward the right way to think about our headcount is exactly as Rob states with productivity we should be able to keep headcount growth lower than volume growth and I feel pretty confident we are going to be able to do that.", "Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "So there is no -- nothing that distorted that in the first quarter that you're going to significantly drop headcount now in the second quarter or anything like that?", "Lance Fritz", "That\u2019s correct.", "Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Second question now. As you alluded to in a number of different ways in your ag business, lot of volatility. You mentioned weather, you mentioned related to that the significant drought from last year, the unpredictability of that. If we look at the current trends in the first quarter carloads, it seems to be off to a very good start, not only on a comp basis, as an easy comp basis, but also on an absolute basis. I'm just curious if, as we model this out in future years, given how important the ag business is, when we look back at historical average levels, be it on carload or overall crop size, is there any reason why your carload volumes would be any different from an average run rate level historically, or is that how we should look at it? Might we need to revert our 2015 ag estimates downwards to reflect perhaps a very healthy 2014 haul?", "Eric Butler", "Walter, as you recall last year or 2012 going into 2013, there was the drought which significantly impacted our volumes last year, the same time first quarter. So if you look at year-over-year the fact that there was a record corn harvest and harvest started in October and the volumes are moving through the first quarter of this year, clearly is the primary driver behind the volumes that we are seeing. There were some as we said stress in the grain network on our competitors, so there was some small portion of incremental volumes we had assisting the market due to that, those challenges that they had. But again that surrounding the bigger issue was the record corn harvest was a pretty good bean harvest, pretty good wheat harvest and in terms of going forward in the future, again the weather will determine the yields, will determine the production and that will determine the volumes that move during harvest season.", "Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "If I could sneak one last one in here on the regulatory standpoint. I heard all your commentary. Perhaps you could give us if, to the extent you know it, the next few catalysts for any potential changes or regulatory -- in other words, are we going to stay within the confines of the STB and their actions? Or could there be any other occurrences that might impact the STBs, any changes the STB might make on the regulatory front?", "John Koraleski", "At this point in time as we look at it, the regulatory model is based on railroads being allowed to earn their rate of return and be revenue adequate. And we don't see a lot on the legislative front, there is the railroad antitrust bill that has been introduced but has seen no action and so we haven't really seen a lot on the regulatory front, other than what's happening in the STB and actually as we look at the STB hearings, they are taking a very measured and thoughtful approach to it. So we are in good shape.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Long of Stephens.", "Justin Long \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "We've been hearing a lot lately about a tightening truckload environment. And you would imagine this should bode well for intermodal pricing as we progress throughout the year. Do think you will be in a position to get better intermodal pricing in 2014 versus what you've seen the past few years?", "Eric Butler", "As we said we continue to price the market and we are continuedly focused on taking advantage of strong demand. As you mentioned the CSA is having an impact on trucking capacity, had an impact in the winter because of the safety concerns that probably were, was some trucking capacity that self selected themselves out of taking trips on the most difficult portion of the winter weather, because of the concern of the risk with CSA. But we continue to think that the intermodal opportunity is strong, trucking capacity is tightening and we continue to think that that's a good outlook for our book of business.", "Justin Long \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Maybe a follow-up to that. How much flexibility do you have to move pricing in intermodal? Have you already established your rates for this year or do you have the ability to raise rates throughout 2014 if the market and demand continues to move higher?", "Eric Butler", "As we have talked in the past, a portion of business is in different segments, some in long-term contracts, some in one year contracts that rotate or come up throughout the year, some in instruments that you can change on a relatively frequent basis. Our intermodal business has the same kind of profile and as we have opportunities based on demand and market prices we will them.", "Operator", "Next question is coming from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.", "Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar", "My question is for Eric. Eric, your comments remain quite positive on the 2014 economy. And I want to ask you about chemicals in particular, given the sea change in US natural gas economics from fracking. Would you share any new developments or your expectations for what industries within chemicals might lead rail volume growth? And if you think this will come on next year or further into the future?", "Eric Butler", "I think we have said several times in the past that with the relatively low natural gas prices, futures is still I think around 450 or something like that. You\u2019re seeing a lot of plastics development coming on a number of different plants that have been announced for expansion, I think we said in the past and in previous earnings releases that most of those will come on in 2016, 2017 that we continue to see strong upside opportunity from that. Our fertilizer business we continue to see a strong upside opportunity in our fertilizer business. So fertilizers, plastics, industrial chems, we think are long-term positive outlooks.", "Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar", "And I guess just a quick follow-up on the Mexico discussion. Given this business is handed off to your US assets rather than your own operations in Mexico, and I recall the Ferromex ownership stake. Can you comment on how you believe your franchise would actually be effective if the bill proposed became law? Is this just a bad precedent for other jurisdictions or would this in itself have material impact to UP?", "John Koraleski", "I think overall if you look at our franchise, the Union Pacific franchise, the business is moving into and out of Mexico, it's not going to really change materially, our ability to deliver goods about to the border and also to have taken from the border and deliver them throughout the US.", "Robert Knight", "You heard us say this before but our interest in this is we don't want to see something that erodes commerce in Mexico and we think one of the unintended consequences of potential bill is that that it would create less commerce in Mexico. But as you know the only railroad that crosses 6 border crossings in and out of Mexico, so we just like to see commerce continue to grow and volumes continue to one across the border both ways and we are ready to handle it.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of David Vernon, Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research", "Just two quick questions maybe on the growth outlook. Eric, the intermodal weeklies are looking pretty strong right now. How much of that is the Santa Teresa opening versus maybe some just straight organic conversion versus share take?", "Eric Butler", "So we did open our Santa Teresa facility April 1 of this year and we think that, that will be a strong lever for us for that market, that market. I think we talked publicly that, that new ramp has about 250,000 less capacity, if you think about our domestic intermodal business is 1.6 million units, so we are seeing a strong growth with our products and services across-the-board, certainly new product offerings from Santa Teresa will add to that. But we are seeing strong growth across the board.", "David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research", "Should we think that that Santa Teresa opening of that terminal is going to continue this growth through the year and it laps? Or is this more -- I guess I'm trying to figure out of the current strength is more of a temporary thing that should ebb as the weather sort of eases up and other rail service improves or if we should be expecting these higher upper single-digit growth in intermodal going forward?", "Eric Butler", "So the current strength is, the strength that we are seeing across our book of business, when ramp opens up there is a gradual ramp up and there is going to be a gradual ramp up in Santa Teresa. The current strength in our intermodal business is depending on slowly growing economy and our value proposition and that\u2019s an across the board opportunity for our book of business rate.", "David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research", "Maybe just as a separate question. Are you guys seeing any development of terminals for handling heavy crude-by-rail, either in the western, specifically California refineries or down in Texas on your network?", "Eric Butler", "As we have spoken before, there are number of different terminals that are under development both on the West Coast and to the extent also in the Gulf Coast. We\u2019re working actively and part of our strategy is to strengthen franchise we cannot direct when and where crude oil will flow, that\u2019s determined by strength that our franchise wants, to, we will ensure we have a franchise that landed when and where at once they flow.", "David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research", "Would you think that western -- those western refineries might have perhaps a little bit of a cost advantage via rail relative to the Gulf?", "Eric Butler", "I am not really sure what you are asking, when you say cost advantage you mean lower rail costs?", "David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research", "Yeah, lower, just to move from western Canada down to the Western \u2013", "Eric Butler", "It will be market based and we will price to take advantage of the value of our franchise whether it\u2019s going to the west coast or to the Gulf Coast.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.", "Ben Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "I think a question for Lance. If I look at cars online, cars online are call it 10% to 12% above trough levels of last year. As we think about volume growth accelerating and the cross current of the network normalizing into the third quarter, how should we think about the asset requirements of the network going forward? Can we continue to think about cars online falling as they were through all of last year? Or should we think about those 2013 levels as the trough and now that we do see volume growth accelerate that that growth number should lag, but we won't quite pierce and fall below the best levels realized last year? Can you provide some perspective there?", "Robert Knight", "Sure, Ben, as I look at car inventory on our railroad right now the large majority of the growth year-over-year is about winter impact and I am expecting that portion of inventory to ultimately bleed off as we\u2019re able to interchange it off to other carriers or ultimately get it to a customer on our own railroad. There is some amount of that growth that\u2019s driven by unit volume growth and what I really look at and care about is car productivity as opposed to the absolute inventory number. The absolute inventory number is important for me as an overall indicator but what we really try to drive is good utilization of the cars that are on us.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Don Broughton of Avondale Partners.", "Don Broughton \u2013 Avondale Partners", "Real quick, you talked about wage inflation. Looking at the comp benefit line, obviously wage inflation 2%. What are the other puts and takes, performance bonuses we hope you earn, pension tailwinds? What else is going to be pushing and/or pulling that line in 2014?", "Robert Knight", "On that line, a big offset if you will to wage inflation has been the pension expense, pension side of the equation and that\u2019s been the reason why I say that our labor line for the full year is expected to be below 2%.", "Don Broughton \u2013 Avondale Partners", "So the wage inflation actually is higher than that, it's just that the actual line itself will be -- come in at under 2%?", "Robert Knight", "", "That\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research.", "Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one on the locomotive CapEx you spoke about. With the tier 4 locomotive standards, this is the first time I think we're using exhaust gas recirculation to meet the standards and the experience of the truckers with this was we ended up with more expensive engines that were not as efficient. What are your thoughts on the locomotives post the tier 4 standard and does this change the economics for you in terms of thinking about natural gas as an alternative fuel in the long run for the locomotive fleet?", "Lance Fritz", "Sure, so first thing to note is, we have a couple of tier 4 test units that are on us, wired up so that we can fully understand with the OEM involved, what the economics and what really the overall performance metrics of those units look like. It is not certain what efficiency impact a tier four locomotive is going to have in relation to a tier 3. I know the OEMs are working very hard to make fuel consumption rates roughly equivalent and so there's more to follow there.", "And in terms of will delta in that make a fundamental difference in the LNG economics? The answer is that\u2019s probably a minor impact, the major impact is utilization infrastructure costs and couple other elements.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Claire Ouzagareen with Macquarie.", "Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie", "My first question relates to pricing. Could you clarify for us how much of your book is specifically tied to AII-LF or another inflation cost measure? And how much is able to take advantage of improving demand fundamentals for example, in intermodal?", "Robert Knight", "I mean roughly a quarter of our business is tied to an escalator, AII-LF being the major driver of the escalations that we use. I would also then add to that, Eric responded earlier to the intermodal question of what capability does it to have to take pricing up throughout the year and we\u2019ve got a mix of long-term contracts, we\u2019ve got a mix of short-term contracts, we\u2019ve got a mix of annual quotes if you will. So we look to take advantage and move and price to market wherever we can. We don't give specific guidance by commodity as to how much we can touch with any particular timeframe but across our entire book of business. We look to price to market where we have the opportunity.", "Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie", "Would you be able to comment to what verticals are offered most opportunity this year in your opinion?", "Robert Knight", "No, we don\u2019t get into that.", "Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie", "And then my second question relates to [indiscernible] rail opportunities specifically tied to the Permian, would you be able to share with us what kind of growth or infrastructure development projects you are looking for there to enable it to take advantage of production growth, and what kind of commitments you are looking for in the supply chain from a pure capital to developing an area?", "Eric Butler", "As we have said previously, the Permian basin has great coverage, pipeline coverage and that's where most of the production growth has taken in the state of Texas. So if you look at our crude by rail volumes from the Permian they actually had decreased significantly, we have said that in the past. And they are really nominal and going forward there may be some spot opportunities for crude by rail in the Permian but the Permian has great pipeline coverage, we don't expect that to be a driver of any crude by rail volumes going into the future. It is a driver of our drilling materials volumes like frac sand and pipe.", "Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie", "So you are not contemplating maybe laying some new rail into California refineries or that's more science fiction than feasible future?", "Eric Butler", "Yeah, so we are, as I mentioned before, looking at the destination franchise, for crude by rail into California. At this point in time, the market is suggesting a lot of that will be sourced from Canada or the Bakken. There are those in the market we believe that Permian will go to California. If that happens we will be prepared for it but I think the market today is suggesting majority of crude by rail in California will come from Canada or the Bakken.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.", "John Koraleski", "Well, great, thank you everybody for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you again in July.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Koraleski, you may now begin.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we're pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved second quarter earnings of $1.43 per share, an increase of 21% compared to the second quarter of 2013 and another quarterly record. Total volumes were up 8%, and the increases were nearly across-the-board. We saw growth in 5 of our 6 business groups, with particular strength in Agricultural Products, Intermodal and Industrial Product shipments.", "We were pleased to see strong volume growth, which, combined with solid core pricing, drove more than 2-point improvement in our operating ratio to a record 63.5% for the quarter.", "On the operating side, Mother Nature did finally release her winter grip, but we experienced numerous washouts, flooding and mudslides, which caused disruptions to our network during the quarter. In this environment, increasing velocity and fluidity has been a challenge, but we continue to be focused on safely improving network efficiency and service for our customers.", "So with that, let's get started. I'll turn it over to Eric.", "Eric L. Butler", "Thanks, Jack. Good morning. In the second quarter, volume was up 8% compared to 2013 as solid demand across our franchise led to volume gains in 5 of our 6 business groups. We had strong gains in Agricultural Products, Intermodal and Industrial Products, and we also saw strength in Automotive and Coal. In Chemicals, declines in crude oil volume were mostly offset by gains in other commodities. Core price improved around 2.5%, which was partially offset by mix that produced a 1.5% improvement in average revenue per car. Our volume growth and improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 10%, which set an all-time quarterly record of nearly $5.7 billion.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products led our growth again this quarter. Volume grew 16%, which, combined with the 2% improvement in average revenue per car, drove revenue growth up 19%. Strong grain demand continued this quarter, with carloads up 43%.", "Last year, you may remember that we experienced a tight U.S. corn supply and improved world production, which led to lower exports and reductions in domestic demand for livestock feeding.", "The strength in U.S. supply and lower commodity prices this quarter drove strong demand for export feed grain. Domestic feed grain demand was also strong across most of our franchise. The one soft spot within grain was wheat, where the smaller hard red winter wheat crop led to a slight decline in overall wheat shipments.", "Grain products volume was up 8%, led by 15% increase in ethanol shipments. We had a best-ever quarter for ethanol shipments, driven by favorable producer margins, higher gasoline demand and lower ethanol inventories, and DDG shipments grew 33%, driven by strong export shipments to Mexico. Food and refrigerated shipments were up 3% for the quarter. Import beer volume was up over 20%, partially offset by declines in rice exports and lower produce in frozen food shipments.", "Automotive revenue was up 2% in the second quarter on a 6% increase in volume. Average revenue per car was down 4%, driven primarily by the previously reported change in the way we handle per diem revenue and also by mix. Finished vehicles shipments were up 5% this quarter. North American Automotive production continue to be strong, up 4% versus the fourth -- the same quarter in 2013. Also, the sales rebound that started in March continue to gain strength as the second quarter progressed.", "On the Parts side, volume increased 8%, driven again by strong production demand and over-the-road conversions.", "Chemicals revenue was up 3% for the quarter, with a 4% average revenue per car improvement, partially offset by a 1% volume decline. Industrial Chemicals volume was up 7%, driven by demand in a variety of markets, such as shale-related drilling; inventory replenishment of de-icing materials after a strong winter demand; and increased demand for chemicals used in nylon production.", "Fertilizer shipments were up 2% for the quarter. Strong export potash demand, coupled with the delayed spring planting season in the U.S., drove the increase. And crude oil volume declined 24% compared to the second quarter of last year, with price spreads, again, negatively impacting Bakken volume.", "Our coal revenue increased 1% on a 1% increase in volume and a/1% improvement in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 2% as demand from lower inventories and higher natural gas prices partially offset our previously reported legacy contract loss. Volume was also impacted by network fluidity challenges.", "Colorado/Utah coal tonnage was up 11%, benefiting from increased demand in the western part of our network, and we continue to see strength from other coal-producing regions where tonnage was up 12% for the quarter.", "In our Industrial Products business, a 12% increase in volume combined with a 3% improvement in average revenue per car to produce 16% revenue growth. Nonmetallic minerals led to growth in IT, again, with volume up 21% for the quarter. Frac sand used in shale-related drilling drove the increase with shipments up more than 25% versus last year. Our lumber shipments were up 17% in the quarter. We were encouraged to see improvement in the housing markets driving continued lumber demand.", "Finally, construction products shipments were up 15% as demand for aggregates and cement continue to be strong, particularly in Texas and California.", "Turning to Intermodal. Revenue was up 16% in the second quarter, driven by a 12% increase in volume and 3% improvement in average revenue per unit. Domestic Intermodal volume was up 12% in the quarter. New premium services and continued highway conversions contributed to our volume gains.", "Our international Intermodal volumes were up 13%. Imports to West Coast ports rebounded in the second quarter after declining earlier in the year. We believe some portion of the strength in the second quarter can be attributed to cargo owners advancing shipments ahead of the July expiration of the ILWU contract. So it is possible that some of our traditional peak international demand has already moved.", "Let's take a look at how we see our business shaping up for the second half of 2014. In Ag Products, strength from last year's crop is carrying into the third quarter, and early signs point to another good crop year later this year. If we have another good crop year, we should have a strong second half in grain, but remember that our comp gets much more difficult in the fourth quarter. We also see continued demand for ethanol. The current forecast for ethanol production is 14.1 billion gallons for the year, which would be a record for the U.S.", "We expect Automotive production and sales to continue to be strong in the second half of 2014, which will drive both finished vehicle and auto parts demand. Most of our Chemicals market should continue to remain solid throughout 2014, though we think crude oil spreads will continue to be a headwind.", "Low inventory levels and higher natural gas prices will drive demand for coal in the third quarter. As always, weather conditions this summer will also influence demand. We will be better positioned to meet demand as our operational efficiencies improve.", "In our Industrial Products business, frac sand will continue to benefit from shale-related activity. We think the strength in construction products will also continue, particularly in Texas and California. And we are cautiously optimistic that the housing market will strengthen in the second half of the year, driving our lumber shipments.", "We think strong demand will continue in Domestic Intermodal as highway conversions and new product offerings drive growth. International Intermodal should benefit from an improving economy, though volumes in the third quarter could moderate because of the advanced shipments we saw in the second quarter.", "The economy got off to a slow start this year, but it is showing signs of the modest strengthening we expected. Our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development efforts across the broad portfolio of business. If the economy cooperates, we expect a strong second half of the year.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, we set first half records in 2 of our 3 major reportable metrics and improved in all 3 year-over-year. Our first half reportable personal injury rate of 1.01 set a first half record and improved 6% versus 2013. The team's commitment to risk reduction in Courage to Care and the Total Safety Culture overcame a challenging operating environment.", "In terms of rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 4% to 2.95 and also set a first half record. Continued investments in our infrastructure and advanced defect detection technology drove a reduction in track and equipment-induced derailments.", "We also made progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and root cause resolutions.", "In public safety, our grade-crossing incident rate improved slightly versus 2013. To make continued progress, we are focused on improving or closing high-risk crossings, as well as reinforcing public awareness through our use of targeted safety campaigns.", "In summary, the team has made terrific progress towards getting every one of our 47,000-plus employees home safely at the end of each day despite adverse weather conditions and the risk that comes with a stressed network.", "Moving on to network performance. In April, we discussed the impact the polar vortex had on first quarter operations. Starting the second quarter, we generated sequential performance improvement while growing volumes. By late May, we felt we were well-positioned to continue to make incremental advancement.", "Unfortunately, flooding severed a number of key quarters in June, including our east-west mainline, impacting our ability to generate the improvement we anticipated. The episodic weather events were compounded by an increase in track maintenance work and interchange fluidity issues. And as Jack noted earlier, while we were pleased to see increased demand, the network was challenged to absorb the stronger volumes while performing at sub-optimal levels. Fortunately, we were able to use our unique franchise to mitigate some of the impact. We adjusted transportation plans to use alternate switching yards and gateways and moved resources to where they were most needed. Using surge resources, we've increased our active locomotive fleet by more than 800 units and our total TE&Y workforce by around 800 since last fall, and we have more resources on the way. We've roughly doubled our TE&Y hiring plan from our original expectations and now plan to hire 3,200 TE&Y employees for the full year to cover both attrition and growth. In addition, we've added $150 million to this year's capital plan, which now includes a total of 229 new locomotives.", "Our service performance fell short during the second quarter, which is reflected in the metrics we report each week to the AAR. Second quarter velocity was down 7% and freight car dwell up 12% when compared to 2013. The interruptions and subsequent limits on network capacity also drove a decline in our Service Delivery Index, a measure which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments.", "On a more positive note, we were able to maintain local service within a reasonable range, registering a 93.9% Industry Spot & Pull. This metric, which reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced this year, measures whether a car is delivered to or pulled from a customer's facility on time.", "In addition to surge resources, infrastructure investments have also improved our resiliency. The team is working very hard to handle our customers' growing volumes while restoring the service they expect from us, and I am confident we are well-positioned to do so.", "Speaking of demand, as Eric noted, the volume trends we saw earlier in the year were largely sustained in the second quarter, with volume growth in each region of our network. We realized productivity with a volume growth despite the headwinds we faced during the quarter. So while we incurred some incremental costs associated with the congested network, we handled 8% volume growth with a 5% increase in regional TE&Y workforce. Productivity improved from an increase in average train lengths in all major categories and from T-Plan adjustments that reduced online work events. Our dedicated craft professionals and managers generated these results using the 5 key drivers to make a difference in safety and productivity and in serving our customers.", "One of those 5 key drivers is capital effectiveness. We increased our targeted 2014 capital spend back in May to around $4.1 billion. Roughly $2.4 billion of that is replacement capital, with most of that to renew our track infrastructure. We are on target for the year as roughly half of that program work is now complete. Spending for service growth and productivity will total around $1.2 billion. Capacity commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers.", "This year's forecasted new capacity includes 56 miles of double track on the Sunset Route and another 300 million or so on the southern region. The investments in the South add critical capacity and fluidity to a historically constrained part of our network. We are also accelerating investments to support growing volumes in our north/south corridors. We're purchasing 229 locomotives, more than 400 freight cars, as well as 5,000 domestic containers.", "Spending on Positive Train Control will total about $450 million for the year. All of these projects positively impact safety, whether they support replacement, service or growth. And the growth capital projects must meet aggressive return thresholds in order to be funded.", "To wrap up, our first order of business is to safely improve network performance while serving customer demand. We are working hard to provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high level of service. As I mentioned in April, our recovery is partly dependent on interchange fluidity, so we continue to work with our connecting railroads to improve performance at key gateways. We expect to generate record safety results on our way towards an incident-free environment. Our investments in surge resources and network capacity have proved invaluable as we handle network challenges, service interruptions and increased demand. Our focus on reducing variability in the network has never been more important to generating sequential improvement.", "Ultimately, safety and service will drive our ability to leverage unit growth to generate solid productivity, all of which creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue grew 10% to an all-time record of more than $6 billion, driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.8 billion, increasing 6% over last year.", "Although operating challenges in our recovery efforts did increase costs during the quarter, our operating income still grew 17% to a record $2.2 billion.", "Below the line, other income totaled $22 million, down 4% from 2013. Interest expense of $138 million was up 4% compared to the previous year, primarily driven by increased debt issuance during the first half of 2014. Income tax expense increased to $789 million, driven primarily by higher pretax earnings.", "Net income grew 17% versus 2013, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity.", "These results combined to produce best-ever quarterly earnings of $1.43 per share, up 21% versus last year.", "Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 10% to a quarterly record of just under $5.7 billion. This was driven primarily by volume growth of 8% and core pricing gains of just under 2.5%. Business mix was about 0.5% unfavorable as the positive mix impact in grain and frac sand volume was more than offset by the increase in Intermodal and shorter haul aggregate and cement shipments during the quarter.", "Other revenue increased 12% in the quarter. Primary drivers included subsidiary-related volume growth, as well as the change in the way we handle per diem revenue on auto parts containers, which Eric just mentioned.", "Slide 22 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. As we pointed out on our first quarter call, 2014 is a legacy light year, so we are not seeing the 0.5 of legacy benefit, which we achieved in 2013. Even without this legacy tailwind, our core pricing gain for the quarter was just under 2.5%. This was up slightly from the first quarter and also continue to exceed inflation, which remains low as we expected. We remain committed to a strategy of pricing to market at reinvestable levels that are above inflation. This enables us to earn the returns necessary for continued investment in our franchise.", "Moving on to the expense side. Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 5% versus 2013. Higher volumes and inflation were the primary drivers of the increase, along with some increased costs associated with running a less than optimal network. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 1% when compared to 2013. However, the reduction in the number of employees associated with capital projects helped to offset some of the increase in non-capital-related workforce levels. If you exclude capital-related employees, our workforce was actually up approximately 2.5%, with just over half of this increase coming into TE&Y.", "For the full year in total, we plan to hire about 5,000 people to cover growth and expected attrition of just under 4,000. This total includes the TE&Y hiring, which Lance mentioned earlier. Over the long run, as we hire and train new employees for growth and attrition, we expect to see our workforce levels increase with volume, but not at the same rate. Lastly, we still expect labor inflation to come in under 2% for the full year.", "Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $923 million, up 7% when compared to 2013, driven primarily by higher gross ton-miles associated with increased volumes. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1%, while our average fuel price was flat at $3.10 per gallon.", "Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 9% to $636 million due to volume-related subsidiary contract expenses, higher locomotive and freight car material costs and crew transportation and lodging expenses. Depreciation expense was $470 million, up 7% compared to 2013, consistent with our 7% to 8% full year guidance.", "Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $316 million, which was up 5% when compared to 2013. Higher freight car rental expense was partially offset by lower freight car and container lease costs, resulting from the exercise of purchase options on some of our leased equipment.", "Other expenses came in at $228 million, up $9 million versus last year. Year-over-year improvement in our freight damage costs and environmental expense was more than offset by increases in our property tax expense. For 2014, we still expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% for the full year, excluding any unusual items.", "Turning to our operating ratio performance. Pricing the business at reinvestable levels and strong demand continues to drive our results. We achieved a quarterly record operating ratio of 63.5%, improving more than 2 points when compared to 2013. Through the first half of the year, we have achieved a 65.2% operating ratio, an improvement of 2.2 points over last year. We also remain committed to achieving strong cash generation and improving overall financial returns.", "Turning now to our cash flow. Record first-half earnings resulted in cash from operations of over $3.2 billion. This is roughly flat with 2013, reflecting primarily the headwind this year in bonus depreciation and the timing of cash tax payments. Capital invested totaled $2.2 billion year-to-date. This includes about $260 million for the buyout of the financed lease on our headquarters building, which was put in place back in 2004 and is in addition to this year's $4.1 billion capital plan. In addition, we returned $776 million in dividend payments to our shareholders.", "Taking a look at the balance sheet, we increased our adjusted debt by approximately $1.1 billion since the first of the year, bringing our adjusted debt balance to $13.9 billion at quarter end. This takes our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio to 39.4%, up from 37.6% at year end 2013.", "We continue to work towards our targets of an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 40% and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.5.", "Opportunistic share repurchases continue to play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. As you may recall, our new repurchase authorization of up to 120 million shares post-split over 4-year time period went into effect January 1 of this year.", "Since the first of the year, we've bought back 16 million shares totaling about $1.5 billion. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since 2007 to 228 million shares. When you combine dividend payments with our share repurchases, we returned over $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year alone. These combined payments represented a 51% increase over 2013, again demonstrating our continued commitment to increasing shareholder value.", "So that's a recap of the second quarter results. As we look to the remainder of the year, continued strength in the economy, solid core pricing at reinvestable levels above inflation and improvement in network performance will help us achieve margin improvement, record financial results and strong returns for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay. Thanks, Rob. As we move into the second half of the year, our network velocity and fluidity are improving, which will better position us to serve the strong demand we're currently seeing in the marketplace. With our increased capital budget of $4.1 billion, we are committed to invest in the resources necessary to run a safe, efficient, reliable railroad, which supports our value proposition for our customers, and we're optimistic about the second half of the year. As always, we are closely monitoring the economic landscape, along with the major drivers across all of our business segments, including the potential impact that weather could have on grain and coal.", "As the economy gradually continues to improve, the power of our diverse franchise is providing business growth opportunities in all of our commodity groups. The men and women of Union Pacific are committed to safely improving our network performance, allowing us to provide customers with the excellent service they deserve while rewarding our shareholders with increasing returns.", "So with that, we're going to open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to chat a little bit more on pricing. We saw, as you show, Rob, in your slides, the core price metrics started to tick up again. Assuming that inflation doesn't fall further from here, and capacity is getting broadly pretty tight in the marketplace, do you feel like we've seen the trough in the core price metrics?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "As we've said in the past, Bill, we expect strong pricing opportunities as we see continued strength in demand reprice for reinvestability and reprice to the marketplace. We have mentioned in the past that we do have part of our escalators that are based on A-lift, which is still modest, but we've continued to see pricing opportunities as the demand strength [ph] continues.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Jack, I'm curious about your views on OR. You didn't mention it, but obviously, we know you've said this in the past that the guidance that you've given in the past that you're already kind of there. And if we look at third quarter, that's typically a better seasonal quarter for you than second. Of course, you wouldn't have any weather effects. So it would seem that third quarter should see a nice improvement on OR. But where do you think the wall is, if you will? Is there a limit? Is there a number you worry about or you think that's about as good as we can do? Or is that just really a theoretical, and we're not even close?", "Eric L. Butler", "You know what, we're not seeing a wall at this point in time. Rob has said many times, Bill, that when we reached our guidance of sub-65, we'll move on from there and continue. We're -- every time we look at productivity, core pricing, the opportunity is to grow our business, the reinvestment that we're making in our infrastructure to support that growth at profitable levels. We are enthusiastic about our ability to do better on operating ratio.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC", "So I wanted to get your take on some of the implications of the BN service issues, just because they're continuing, I think, longer than maybe some had expected at the beginning of the year. Do you think this is creating more longer-term or maybe permanent market share gains? And you think there is an opportunity for kind of incremental share gains next year? And then just wondering if you're seeing any competitive response from them on the pricing side that could limit some of the pricing opportunities.", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "So we -- I've said BN is a strong competitor. They're a capable competitor. I have said they will get their network back, and we are taking them at their word. We're in a competitive marketplace, and we continue to see them being an effective competitor in the future. We -- as always, we look for -- we focus on business development, and we look for opportunities that we could price effectively. It works well with our network, and we're focused on that, and we're focused on that for the long term.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Yes. I mean, that's all fair. I mean, clearly, when we look at the volume between you and BN, clearly, there's been some share shift. Maybe I'm not asking for specific conversations, but what are you hearing from customers? Do you think that, that's going to stick with you? And do you think that -- could there be opportunities for more of it?", "John J. Koraleski", "Scott, I think you're seeing some of both. I think there are some places where we've been able to pick up some share. And of course, the opportunity for us is to demonstrate to customers the power of our franchise, the ability to provide safe, reliable, consistent service day in and day out. And we're hopeful that, that has some stickiness to it and that, that business will hang with us even as the BNSF recovers. There are some other business where -- basically, our franchise isn't quite as strong as theirs to the end market location. And in all likelihood, as the BNSF service returns, and they're able to take the business back, it's going to shift back to them. So I think you see some of both.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. That makes sense. And then just last thing on coal, volumes have been struggling recently. I'm guessing that's more of a rail service issue than a demand issue. Any way of putting some numbers around how much coal you think you're missing out on because of some of the network issues and how much pent-up demand there could be once the network is back up and running?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "As you said, we are seeing strong coal demand. And I think as Lance and Rob both said in their prepared remarks, we did have network fluidity challenges. Weather and natural gas pricing will determine the demand in the future. But at this point, we've seen pretty good upside demand from our current run rate of coal volumes.", "Robert M. Knight", "Scott, if I could just jump in, this is Rob. What I would look to is the inventory levels are still below where the utilities would like them to be, I mean, if you look at it on a 5-year average. So as we are in the throes of the winter -- or excuse me, the summer air-conditioning burn season, with low inventories, we think that gives us increasing opportunities.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes. In fact, Scott, if you looked at those numbers, in May, it was like 19 days below, and in June it's dropped to 16. So there has been some improvement in the inventory levels, but there's still a lot of opportunity for us as we see the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "As a follow-up to the kind of core pricing discussion earlier, could you elaborate in terms of where you're seeing that acceleration come? Has this been driven by the market share gains that you've had? Any sort of incremental color you could provide would be helpful.", "Eric L. Butler", "I think we've said in the past that a portion of our business in the -- about 30% of our business is really repriceable at any one period of time. And I think pretty much across the board, with strong demand, we're seeing the opportunities for price improvement.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then a clarification with regard to the hiring that you guys had discussed, it sounded like that's a net incremental 1,000 employees, with 5,000 being hired for growth. But then you got 4,000 in attrition. Am I thinking about that right?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. That's exactly right. It's not an exact number, but what we're basically saying is fairly high hiring numbers, fairly high attrition rate, and the net number will ultimately be driven by what the volume ends up being because we still squeeze out and expect to squeeze out productivity. But it's a high-class problem for us as volume grows for us to continue to increase our hiring levels.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And Rob, as a clarification, what volume are you guys expecting in the back half with that 1,000 additional headcount?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. Great question. I mean, we're obviously not going to give that guidance other than we do see, as Eric walked through, a lot of optimistic opportunities for us. So without giving a specific number, we hope the economy continues to cooperate, not only for the balance of this year, but as we head into 2015.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Eric, can you just dig in a little bit on the comments on the preshifting and your thoughts beyond Intermodal as we head in not only the next couple of months but maybe even into the back half of the year, just given what level you thought was preshift? And what do you think the outcome of that is over the next couple of months?", "Eric L. Butler", "Ken, as we said, our international Intermodal was up about 12% in the second quarter. I would say, going into this year, we probably would have expected a 3%, 4%, 5% improvement in second quarter, and we clearly were above that. And so we think that most of the increase beyond that was not necessarily organically marked for a business driven but related to the free shipping. And so we think that it will not probably impact the volumes in the third quarter.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And then your thoughts on CapEx. I know, Lance, you delved into a lot of the detail of different projects. But when you think about this level of volumes and the speed, and obviously, CapEx takes time to roll in. Is the concern in the near term about ability to handle, whether it's pinch points or ability to keep pace with the volume growth that you're seeing right now, given that you're kind of almost at your targets for your weekly carload growth?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes. So Ken, we feel confident that our network can handle that kind of volumes that look like they're coming our way as we proceed through the second half. Our capital plan is targeted at specific bottlenecks and constraints. It's coming to fruition as we would like it to. And so going forward, we feel pretty good about being able to handle the volumes that we're seeing.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes, Ken, this is Jack. In fact, right now, we're moving some of the strongest volume we've seen all year, and yet, our operating statistics in performance is improving. So we feel really good about that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just as a follow-up to the last question's discussion. Is it fair -- I know that you guys are bringing on some additional headcount and locomotives, but you're also expecting network velocity to improve and benefit from some productivity gains. So if I think about incremental margins in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, is it possible or fair to say that we could see an acceleration from the 58% that you posted in 2Q? Not that, that wasn't a good number, of course.", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Well, Allison, as you know, we don't give guidance on that. But we're -- the entire team is focused on, in fact, making improvements everywhere we can. I mean, if the economy cooperates, that's a great opportunity for us to move. Bill's very strong volumes gives Eric a chance to price it right. Lance has talked about the improvements that we're progressing and, in fact, seeing in our operating efficiency, which should help us on the cost side. So we're focused on doing that. I'm not going to give guidance on that number, but we're focused on improving our margins.", "Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And with respect to the sequential improvement in pricing and the 30% of your book that's sort of tariff-based, what could we see in the back half of the year? Is there a potential to see another 50 basis points or something like that potentially by the end of the year as a result of more upward adjustments on spot business?", "John J. Koraleski", "Allison, that's way too specific. We're not going to go down that line. We are going to continue, as we said, to price to the market and to have reinvestability as our threshold, and we've got it headed in the right direction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes on the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Rob, if I could ask you about the repurchase activity in the quarter certainly seem to step up quite nicely, and you think out over the course of the next several quarters and maybe into the next year or so. As you're approaching some of your leverage targets, you're getting closer to that. Can we see a sustained level kind of in line with what we saw in the second quarter? Was that a bit of a catch-up or a trough? I just want to get a rough sense of maybe how you think about the pace of that repurchase activity going forward.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, and as you know, we don't give guidance as to what we're actually going to buy. But I would say there was nothing unusual in the second quarter other than we continue, a, starts with generating strong cash in the front end, which is our entire team's focus, that gives us then the opportunity to reward shareholders, and we will continue to be opportunistic with our share repurchase program as we were in the second quarter. So I can't give you a precise number, but we felt pretty good about what we were able to do in the second quarter under that philosophy, while at the same time, reinvesting in the business with a strong capital program and with an increased dividend payment that you saw year-over-year.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Sure. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then if I could just get you guys -- just curious to get your take on the crude-by-rail rules or the proposal that came out yesterday. Just getting a rough sense of maybe how you think about that 2-year time frame. And maybe some of the other puts and takes that are in there seemed relatively okay. The time lines seemed a bit tight relative to our expectations, but just curious, your take on that?", "John J. Koraleski", "Chris, I'm kind of there with you. There was really not anything in there that was totally a surprise to us. We have been actively involved with the Department of Transportation, the AAR and others in helping to do everything we can to make what is already a safe product safer. And so some of the ideas that are in that NPRM have already been implemented and some that are still there that we still need to work with. And so we want to be a voice at the table. The 2-year time frame -- the time frame really just revolves around what is the capacity in the industry to rebuild and to build new tank cars, and 2 years does feel a little tight. And if we go too far down that path, and then that's -- some product isn't going to be able to move, which is not the right solution. But so far, I have to say that I think we've got a good track record of having thoughtful approaches to this, and we're looking forward to sitting down again and filing our comments, sitting down with Secretary Fox and others to work through what is the right solution here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I guess, coming back on the pricing question, just talking a bit more broadly, I heard -- I think it was Jack or it might have been Eric saying, sticking to your approach of pricing in line with inflation. A number of your competitors have taken a little bit a step further now and looking a little bit more at yield management and focusing on customers that perhaps are not pulling their entire weight and looking a little bit more on return on invested capital as the metric by customer as opposed to pure pricing. Eric, have you looked at doing that? And I guess, I'm asking the question in the context of Intermodal, specifically with the tightening truck market. Could there be opportunities that just a blanket price in line with inflation is not the right approach but rather looking at it from a more opportunistic perspective, given some of the tighter capacity constraints that are going on, particularly in trucking but across your entire book business?", "Eric L. Butler", "Walter, I'm not sure. Hopefully, we have not given an indication that our pricing strategy is to price in line with inflation. Our pricing strategy is to price to the market at reinvestable levels, which basically means to make sure all of our business is generating an effective return on investment. So that's the strategy that we've had for a number of years. We think it's the right strategy. We think it's helping to drive the financial results we're producing, and we're committed to that strategy.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then specifically on particular markets, notably trucking, where perhaps the pricing might have not been where you wanted to be, can we potentially see an uptick in pricing in those areas driven by the tighter trucking market? I guess, it's where I'm going.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. We do see the trucking market tightening, the CSA drivers are tightening. The trucking market is an effective competitor for a wide swath of our business, not just Intermodal business. And certainly, as their costs go up, that gives us opportunity to see more demand for our network, and we're seeing that, and we have been seeing that, and we're going to continue to price to the market based on that.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. My second question here is just more of a broader question and certainly for you, Jack. There have been talk a little bit, and I heard you referenced the dependence on your partner on the other side for turning assets or your interchange partner. There has been talk about potentially, down the road, improving service broadly for the railroad industry through a cross-the-Mississippi type of merger. Is that something that you just think is not on the table from a regulatory approval standpoint? Or is that something we as investors should think about? It might -- obviously, not in the near-term but perhaps a little further down the road as a viable opportunity.", "John J. Koraleski", "I think that's pretty much off the table.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.", "Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "A question of a different kind. I want to focus a little bit on cash. Going back historically, you generally don't have less than $1 billion of cash on the books. And I'm just looking, you're down about $700 million from where you were cash-wise a year ago. And I know a lot of that's gone to CapEx, share repurchase and dividends. If you're going to stay within the boundaries of the growth targets you're at, is there a cash level you want to stay at? And we would assume that if the share repurchase were to continue at this level, it would have to result in more debt?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Jeff. I mean, as you know, we are -- we and most companies in Corporate America are holding more cash today than maybe historical numbers would have suggested. But I wouldn't get too hung up on quarter end cash balances from one quarter to the next because there's all kinds of timing issues, which really was the big explainer of some of the changes that we saw in our second quarter, whether it's tax payments, timing of tax payments year-over-year, that's all factored, that timing that we choose to do. So again, our focus -- the way I would answer that is our focus -- as I said earlier, the entire team is focused on generating quality cash from operations so that we continue to have the opportunity to reinvest in the business, continue to move our dividend up and continue to be opportunistic with share buybacks, which, I think, we, in fact, have walked our talk in terms of what we've done over the last several years.", "Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. So your point is that this is more of a working capital anomaly in 2Q. But I guess my question is, is there a certain level of cash you want to keep on the books? Should I think of this as kind of a bottom in terms of where you want cash to be?", "Robert M. Knight", "No. I wouldn't look at that. I mean, it's not a hard number on the cash. Again, as you know, we're focused on improving, which we did in the second quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio. We have said we want to get to that low-40s number, and we've got a little bit room or opportunity to continue to progress in that direction. I would look more at that number.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Eric, I wanted to ask you about your Mexico franchise and the opportunities that you're seeing, both in the auto sector and with your new Intermodal facility that you have in New Mexico. Is that driving a lot of incremental growth in the system?", "Eric L. Butler", "We're excited, Brandon, about our new Intermodal products and services, and Santa Teresa has facilitated us being able to put some new products and services in the marketplace, and we're going to look to grow that even more in the future. So we view that as upside and excitement for us. Our Mexico franchise, as we said in the past, we have the premier Mexico franchise with 6 border crossings, and we're continuing to focus and invest in strengthening our Mexico franchise with all of our Mexican rail partners. So that's going to be an area of focus for us in the future. As you suggest, auto manufacturing in Mexico is growing historically. They've been, call it, 1.5 million to 2.5 million vehicles a year. They are projecting over the next 3, 4, 5 years a growth of 4 million cars a year production in Mexico with all of the new plants. As anything, really what's going to drive the level of our auto business in the future is sales because wherever the car is produced, hopefully, we'll have a chance to move it, given the strength of our franchise. So growing the absolute number will really still depend on what's happening with automotive sales.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I appreciate that, Eric. And Lance, I wanted to ask about network velocity and obviously the favorable leverage you've been getting on your TE&Y headcount. Is that going to continue? Or do you need to ramp that a little bit faster to get the network to where you want to see it? And does that necessarily mean that you can't still get leverage if velocity is improving?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes. So Brandon, we love to get the leverage through service improvements. Service improvements are our favorite way of kind of leveraging growth. If you look back at the second quarter, we leveraged the growth, but we were behind the eight-ball when it came to our service product. As we look forward, the addition of resources, like labor, are going to help us improve our service product, and we still expect to get leverage productivity off the volume as we add that labor.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "When we look out to the third quarter, I was just curious, when you look at your base plan for putting more locomotives into play, calling more people back to work, what's your base plan for the ag crop? Because it seems to me that if the ag crop is good again, you could have increased demands on both you and your western partner, and we all know that BN hasn't had a good time of it this year. So I'm just curious what sort of the base outlook you have for the crop is?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "So Jason, the latest reports from the Department of Ag says that the corn crop is as good as it's been in the last 20 years. There's still weakness in the wheat crop, but if you're talking about the corn crop, we're expecting and, I think, the Ag -- Department of Agriculture estimates suggests that we're looking at perhaps another record corn crop year, which, again, will say that the transportation network will see strong demand for moving that. We feel pretty good about where we are with that. We have ramped up to handle the incremental demand from last year's record corn crop, and we are in a position to maintain that level if the crop comes in that strong. So we feel pretty good about how we're positioned to handle that potential demand.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Very good. And if I can go back to pricing, given how tight the truckload market and that we've seen the carriers now take rates up every chance that they can sort of get their hands on, should we look at sort of your core pricing here in 2Q as maybe the bottom for the year as you get a chance to reprice some of this Intermodal business going forward?", "Eric L. Butler", "Jason, so again, I hate to sound like a broken record, but we're continuing to look at a pricing environment that we think is strong, and we're going to price to the market in showing that business is reinvestable, and that's our focus. That will continue to be our focus.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Well, let me ask it a different way, then. You said that about 30% of your business, at any given time, may be up for pricing. Out of that 30%, how much is Intermodal?", "Eric L. Butler", "We don't go into that level of specificity, typically.", "Robert M. Knight", "Jason, this is Rob. I mean, we're not going to give a specific pricing guidance other than the tenets of our strategy remain in a strong force, and that is the price-to-market at a minimum reinvestable levels above inflation. And clearly, a strong environment, a strong demand environment is better than a weak demand environment. So we will look to move numbers and price appropriately everywhere across the business, whether it's Intermodal or Other.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "I had a question about all of the operating challenges you faced in the second quarter, which sounded fairly substantial, yet the operating ratio was absolutely spectacular. Do you want to share with us perhaps the cost of all of that flooding and all of the congestion that remains from the winter, et cetera? And perhaps, what the quarter would've looked like had you not had those operating challenges?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. John, I mean, I'm not giving the specific number, and it's hard to exactly split the hairs between was it -- or was it the weather, was it adding process as result of some of the challenges that Lance talked about. It was kind of all of the above, and they were -- without giving a precise number, they were somewhat meaningful, if you will. I mean, look at our labor line, you look at some of the purchased services, you look at some of the other cost items, they were in there. So your point is well-taken that had we not incurred those costs, things could have been slightly better, and I think you're focused on the right thing that we did a good job of improving our margins in spite of some of those challenges. And some of those challenges clearly were brought on by a very strong ramp-up in volumes so that helped, of course, contribute towards the positive volume and margin improvement. So again, without breaking out the numbers, we think that does give us an opportunity. If the economy stays strong and demand stays as strong as it is, for us to make the improvements that Lance talked about, for us to continue to improve our returns in our margins.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Got it. Second question related to some of the capital investments that you're making on the southern part of the network where you've had some capacity challenges over the last couple of years. As that area appears to be right on top of the area that will be ultimately supporting a lot of new investment in chemical, petrochemical plants, refineries, things of that nature, where do we stand in the build-out of all that chemical industry infrastructure? And when do you expect to start to benefit from traffic emanating out of those facilities or the expanded facilities?", "John J. Koraleski", "John, I think overall, we're really expecting that the investment in the chemical industry really starts to hit our network sometime in the 2016 kind of -- 2016, '17 kind of zone. That's when we see the bulk of it. And certainly, the investments we're making today are anticipating some of that as we see not only because of the oil business and things like that, but also everything else that's happening in our southern region. Lance, do you want to...", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes. I would remind you that the beauty of the investments that we're putting down in the southern region is that they can be broadly utilized for different commodity groups. You point out, one, the Chemicals franchise, we're/using them right now for our strong grain shipments down to the Gulf, and we can use them for many, many frac sand. It's beautiful to leverage that capital that way.", "John J. Koraleski", "And we have a very important project going on right now. It's one of the biggest congestion points on our railroad called Tower 55. We're about halfway through that project. We'll have it done by probably the 1st of September or around that point. But getting that bottleneck out of our network before this business starts to come on stream is an important step forward to us as we look ahead.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Eric, as you think about the RPU development in Intermodal, could you talk a little bit about how mix played in there? You had very good growth in international and domestic. Was the -- would you say mix is kind of a headwind to the RPU development? Or neutral? Or maybe a little bit of a tailwind?", "Eric L. Butler", "Mix was a little bit of a headwind in the second quarter, really, for some of the new products and services that we put in place. We're shorter haul than some of our traditional long-haul international Intermodal business and domestic Intermodal business. But it was just phenomenal in the second quarter.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And within that domestic Intermodal business, we hear a lot about chassis problems, particularly around some of the international moves and the potential for driver shortages to maybe make it more difficult to get some of the retail products in the market. Are you seeing some of those pressures as well? Or you guys been able to kind of manage through that, those sort of first-mile, last-mile challenges without a lot of problems?", "Eric L. Butler", "I think we are seeing some of those pressures, nothing that's beyond our ability to manage through on a tactical basis. We do have some major initiatives underway to really address making our first-mile, last-mile process a lot more effective. And one of the good things about the challenges that you see kind of in the dray network with the driver shortage is that it really emphasizes to go rail as long as you can and as far as you can on the rail network. So we do think we're going to see some upside from that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long of Stephens.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "You talked about the 229 locomotives that are coming on in 2014. I was wondering if you could talk about the timing of these deliveries over the course of the year. And also, as you look into 2015, do you have a rough idea right now of how many locomotives you'll need relative to this year in terms of new orders?", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. So we are receiving locomotives in the second half of the year. It's a good portion of that 229. And if you look out into 2015, we have not solidified our plans yet, but we could very well be in the market in 2015.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And secondly, in June, you announced a ramp of your premium Intermodal service from Chicago to the West Coast. I was wondering if you could talk about the mix of your Intermodal business. Do you expect to bring more of your Intermodal volumes in-house over time? Or do you think that mix between what you handle internally versus working with the IMCs will stay about the same?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So we have hardly none of our Intermodal business today that we do outside of IMCs. IMCs are our strategy, our market channel strategy to go to market. We do have an internal IMC that is focused on the auto parts business subsidiary, UPDS. But other than that, we -- our market channel strategy today is to work with IMCs.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And there's no plans to change that going forward?", "John J. Koraleski", "None at this time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I have a couple of questions around locomotive productivity and fuel burned. We did see a modest improvement in the second quarter, and I'm wondering with the additional locomotives being added in the second half, should we anticipate the consumption rate to pick up near-term or -- and then possibly trend down again longer-term?", "John J. Koraleski", "Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes, sure. So new locomotives are actually a benefit to sea rate. But there's just -- I don't think there's going to be enough new locomotives coming online in the second half to measurably show up in sea rate. I will tell you that I'm pretty proud that we got some sea rate reduction, which is improvement in the first half, given the fact that our network was a bit sluggish, and we pulled out a fair number of stored locomotives that are not our most fuel-efficient locomotives. So that just demonstrates that our activity on sea rate is getting traction, and I expect that to continue.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then did you have like a longer-term target where you think your fuel consumption rate would be, given that the newer locomotives that your garage are going to be adding over time?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. Better.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right. If I could just add, I had a question on your comment earlier on labor attrition. Is there any particular reason behind it? Is it just simply retirements?", "Lance M. Fritz", "It's primarily retirements.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then with retirements, could we assume that with your new hires that there should be an incremental unit labor cost sort of benefit?", "John J. Koraleski", "Not really. Rob, you want to comment on that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, John. I mean, given the labor agreements, no, there really isn't a meaningful -- we incur, when we hire somebody, some training and hiring costs, but in terms of the ongoing wage, there's no real difference.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I have a couple of quick questions on longer-term capital deployment. Rob, I believe you mentioned purchasing some leased equipment. Could you expand on this strategy? What portion of the equipment is currently leased? And was it just optimistic or a shift in ownership strategy?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, it's an ongoing, I mean, where it makes economic sense for us to take advantage of some of the markets and long-term deals. So I wouldn't read anything into that. There's no shift in strategy. It's just we're sort of opportunistic we're able to take advantage of that in the second quarter.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And CapEx, longer-term -- CapEx to fulfill PTC mandate is still quite high this year, rounding to $0.5 billion, I think. Given the reality of the implementation schedule, how do you now see the PTC spend fading over the next several years? And when PTC slips to maintenance rather than build-out, do you expect to step down in total CapEx?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. I mean, just to remind you what we've said in terms of our total capital spend for positive train control is going to be in the neighborhood of $2 billion-ish total. We're spending, to your point, planning to spend about $450 million this year, which is the high watermark thus far on our spend. We -- the deadline, we'll see what the date actually ends up being. But if it's -- if the deadline gets moved back, our expectation is to spend -- on the capital side, we'll still be in that $2 billion neighborhood. We don't want it to shift the deadline and result in higher spending, so we're very focused on that. To your point in terms of what might shift, we've said before -- you perhaps had heard me say before that will be an ongoing expense in our OE [ph], and that shows up most notably in depreciation, which, in fact, we're starting to see that in our numbers this year. So as we start to depreciate those new PTC assets, you will see an increase in our depreciation expense related to that. And again, we are seeing some of that this year.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "All right. This is kind of a devilish question, but if you haven't had to make the PTC spend, what do you think you would have bought with that money? Or would have CapEx just been lower?", "Robert M. Knight", "I would just say it is all return based. I mean, I wouldn't -- don't have a clean answer to that other than we didn't back off on spending other worthwhile projects on our network where the returns were there, and we were confident. So it's not as if it was a simple trade-off there. We'll always look at -- as we look at capital spending, we'll always look at our business case and the expected returns that we will expect to generate out of those capital investments. And that's all included in the guidance that we've given out in the 16% to 17% of revenue as we look forward. That's not how we build our capital budget, but that's kind of a guiding light of how we expect to size up our capital spending as we look forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean of Macquarie.", "Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research", "Also a question on Intermodal. Could you share with us your insight into the main pockets of growth opportunity, maybe across service offerings or types of customers, especially with the West generally seen as a more mature market than the East, and your numbers are obviously proving that wrong this quarter?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "We're seeing pretty good growth across the breadth of the Intermodal market, whether you're talking about motor carriers or brokers. I think the western part of the U.S., if you want to consider it West of the Mississippi, probably has as much or more opportunity as the Eastern part because we have longer hauls, which should make it easier for -- to make the conversion from truck to rail. So I think we're seeing strength pretty much across the breadth of our Intermodal customers.", "John J. Koraleski", "We're also hopeful, Cleo, that our investment in the Santa Teresa facility will draw truck traffic that's moving today from Mexico into the U.S. to our Intermodal facility in Santa Teresa, and then we can move it east or west from that point. So we're pretty excited about that market opportunity as well.", "Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research", "And the second question has to do with resource management, your view on management of resources to manage variability spikes in demand like we've experienced so far this year. Has this experience of the winter and the sheer volume led you to consider strategic changes in how you look at asset ownership? Or are you managing through it as a tactical way to -- within the same strategic framework that you are happy with?", "John J. Koraleski", "I think our performance for the first half of the year has been quite good, given what we had to face in terms of the weather conditions and the congestion it caused nationwide on the rail industry. I think one of the things that you've seen, and I think one of the earlier questions about how did we get to the 63 operating ratio here in the second quarter, is because over the years, we have really shifted our approach. We have become much less reactionary and much more anticipatory. And so as we see things starting to develop on the horizon, we immediately start a planning phase that says, \"We're going to mobilize materials. We're going to mobilize people where they need to be. We're going to be doing some alternative scenario planning as the way to minimize disruption to our network and to our customer service levels.\" And I think that shift to anticipating is really what's been kind of the key behind some of our performance, certainly in the first half of the year. And so we're -- we learn something from every event. We learn something from every thing that happens on our railroad, and our goal is to take that and work it into our planning structure so we become even more effective and better going forward.", "Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research", "Any particular pockets of tightness across your segments that you would like to comment on for next year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric, what do you think?", "Eric L. Butler", "We -- Cleo, we're seeing pretty good demand, and the -- our first look at the 2015 forecast is pretty good demand across our book of business. And so I don't think there's any one place that would stick out beyond any other places.", "Lance M. Fritz", "And Eric, if you look at it from a network perspective, Cleo, we are investing in the areas where we anticipate we are going to be tight, and we've talked openly about investing in the southern region and also in the north/south corridors.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research", "I'm just going to ask one because it's getting late here, but I wanted to ask a question on interline connectivity, which was an issue in the quarter. And I think the first half of this year has exposed the fragility of Chicago. So I just wondered if you could give some color on how much of your traffic touches Chicago and the extensive opportunities you think are out there to reasonably divert that to other interchanges over time?", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes. I would -- so I'm going to start, Cherilyn, and just say -- I think if you look at Chicago, I don't know that I would necessarily describe it as fragility. I think Chicago got hammered with a snow storm about every 2 weeks and frigid cold temperatures, so it never melted, it just kept building up and building up. I think that was a key problem there. We have worked with all of our interline partners in terms of not only their fluidity but also our fluidity. We're all in this together, and so we have done a lot of redirecting out of Chicago into the St. Louis area or down to Memphis in working with our interchange partners for the mutual benefit of both of our railroads as we work through those issues. Lance, why don't you...", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. So you would ask how much of our business? It's a fair portion, call it, 1/4 of our business ultimately moves through, into, out of Chicago. And when you think about our activity in Chicago, CREATE has really done a very good job of improving the Chicago gateway with interline partners. The gateway, since the start of CREATE, has improved by about 1/3 in terms of the amount of time it takes a car to traverse. And Jack mentioned it as well. We've got ongoing investments in Chicago, one of which is going to be in connection with Metro where we add a third mainline to our critical east-west route in and out of Chicago. So I'm very optimistic, both in the level of activity engagement we have with our interline partners and in the progress that we've seen. This winter was exceptional. It was an exceptional winter, and it had exceptional impacts on the railroad. And even so, volumes still continued to move through the gateway.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Eric, I just want to double check, but did I hear that you guys are planning to add 5,000 EMP and UMAX containers this year? I'm just curious, it seems like a pretty big add, or was that somewhat replacement?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So a part of it is replacement. As we discussed, our business is growing. And actually, as we look into the future, and we don't talk about this in specificity, but there's a bunch of containers that are aging out, and so we're trying to do some level-set planning and management strategically. But you can think of it as part replacement, part growth, part future level-set planning.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's perfect. And then just kind of following up on that, but on the rail-controlled side. Have you guys implemented any kind of, call it, general rate increases or maybe tariff increases on that rail-owned pool of containers?", "Eric L. Butler", "So the pricing that we're reporting in our Intermodal business, we are increasing our prices in our Intermodal business on -- whether they're rail-owned containers or private-owned containers, the pricing -- because the demand is going up, pricing is going up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Hartford with Robert W. Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "You mentioned earlier when you expect the network to be \"normal\" in the back half of the year. Did you provide a time frame?", "John J. Koraleski", "No. Lance, do you want to comment?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes. We did not provide a time frame, but what we did say is we're positioned to improve, and we expect to improve.", "John J. Koraleski", "And we're seeing improvement...", "Lance M. Fritz", "And we are seeing improvement as we speak.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And assuming that we do normalize before the upcoming winter, how should we think about network utilization, given the volume level that we have seen, given some of the locomotive investments and the container investments and other car-type investments that you have made? Is there -- can you provide some sort of figures as to what effective network utilization will be in kind of a steady-state or normal network fluidity environment?", "John J. Koraleski", "It's pretty difficult to do that, Benjamin, if you think about it, because it depends on where the business comes, what kind of business it is and all that. What we can tell you is at this point in time, as we look ahead, even at the volume levels we have, we're still open for business, we still have capacity, and we're looking forward to additional growth.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.", "John J. Koraleski", "Well, great. Thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to speaking with you again in October. Take care.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you Mr. Koraleski, you may begin.", "John J. Koraleski", "Thank you, Rob and good morning everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we're pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved third quarter earnings of $1.53 per share, an increase of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2013 and another quarterly record. Total volumes were up 7% and the increases were nearly across the board. We saw growth in 5 of our 6 business groups with particular strength in Agricultural Products, Industrial Products and our Intermodal shipments.", "Coming out of the first half, we were pleased to see the strong volume growth continue through the third quarter. These strong volumes along with solid core pricing drove a 2.5-point improvement in our operating ratio to a record 62.3% for the quarter. And as we continue to focus on improving our service, we are encouraged by the accomplishments that we achieved in the quarter.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.", "Eric L. Butler", "Thanks, Jack and good morning. Volume was up 7% in the third quarter as solid demand across our franchise led to volume gains in 5 of our 6 business groups. We continue to see strong gains in Ag Products, Industrial Products and Intermodal. We also saw gains in Automotive and Chemicals, and Coal volume was flat for the quarter.", "Core price improved over 2.5% to help average revenue per car improve 3.5%. The volume growth and improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 11%, which set an all-time quarterly record of over $5.8 billion.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products had another strong quarter and once again led our volume growth. Revenue was up 19% in the third quarter on a 14% increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloadings were up 34% this quarter as we continued to benefit from a strong U.S. supply and lower commodity prices. Export feed grain demand to Mexico, China and Southeast Asia were strong, and domestic feed grain shipments were solid across most of our franchise. We did see softer wheat exports this quarter, which partially offset our volume gains.", "Grain products volume grew by 6%, driven by another strong quarter in ethanol shipments. We also saw strength in canola, meal and DDG [ph] shipments.", "Finally, food and refrigerated segments were up 3% for the quarter, as volume increases and import beer more than offset declines in frozen foods, canned goods and import sugar shipments.", "Automotive revenue was up 3% in the third quarter on a 5% increase in volume. Average revenue per car was down 1%, driven again by the previously reported change in the way we handle per diem revenue and also by mix. Strong consumer demand drove finished vehicle shipments up 5% this quarter. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American Automotive production was 16.7 million vehicles in the third quarter, up 1 million units from the same quarter in '13 and the highest level since 2006.", "On the parts side, strong production and a continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 3% volume increase.", "Turning to Chemicals, our revenue was up 6% for the quarter on a 2% volume increase and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car. We continued to see strength in our Industrial Chemicals volume, which was up 7% in the third quarter. The demand was driven by a variety of end-use markets such as shale-related drilling and various housing-related applications.", "Liquid petroleum gas shipments were up 12% for the quarter, driven by new business to an LPG storage facility on our franchise. We also saw an increase in demand for fuel additive imports in Canada and propane exports to Mexico. Partially offsetting our volume gains in Chemicals was crude oil, which declined 10% in the third quarter. As previously discussed, increased production in Texas limited shipments of Bakken crude oil to the Gulf region. However, we were able to partially offset the decline from Bakken with gains from other origins.", "Coal revenue increased 2% on a 2% increase in average revenue per car and flat volume. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 2% for the quarter. Strong demand from lower inventories mostly offset volume headwinds from our previously reported legacy contract loss and a relatively mild summer. Volume was also negatively impacted early in the quarter from flooding in Iowa that interrupted service along our east-west main line.", "We continued to see increased demand in the Western part of our network, which drove Colorado/Utah tonnage up 13%.", "In our Industrial Products business, revenue increased 19% on a 12% increase in volume and a 7% improvement in average revenue per car. Once again, nonmetallic minerals led to growth in Industrial Products with volume up 30% for the quarter. Frac sand shipments were up 39% as we continued to see strong demand to most shale formations.", "Our lumber shipments were up 15% in the quarter. While steady improvement in the housing market increased demand, we're also seeing over-the-road conversions in many markets as order sizes increase and truck capacity tightens. And we continued to see strength in construction product shipments where volume was up 11%, driven by demand for aggregates and cement.", "Finally, in Intermodal, revenue was up 15% driven by a 10% increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per unit. Domestic Intermodal was up 13% in the quarter. Continued demand for new premium services and highway conversions contributed to a best-ever quarter for Domestic Intermodal volume. Our International Intermodal volume was up 8% as continued economic strength and new business volume carried over into the third quarter.", "Similar to the second quarter, we believe some of the portion of this strength can be attributed to cargo owners advancing peak-season shipments in anticipation of a possible impasse during the renegotiations of labor contracts at West Coast ports.", "To wrap up, let's take a look at how we see our business shaping up for the remainder of 2014. In Ag Products, all signs point to another record crop for corn and soybeans this year. Although the harvest got off to a slow start, we're optimistic for a strong finish to the year in grain. Though remember that our comp gets much more difficult starting in the fourth quarter. We also think ethanol shipments will be strong and we expect continued strength for import beer.", "In Automotive, finished vehicles and auto parts shipments will continue to benefit from strength in production and sales.", "Most of our Chemicals markets should remain solid for the remainder of 2014, though crude oil will likely continue to be a headwind. Low inventory levels should drive demand for Coal in the fourth quarter. We are hopeful that the weather cooperates as we continue to improve operational efficiencies.", "In Industrial Products, we expect the strength in frac sands to continue and we remain cautiously optimistic about the construction and housing markets. New product offerings and highway conversions will drive demand in Domestic Intermodal, and we continue to believe that the International Intermodal will benefit from an improving economy. But we expect growth to moderate in the fourth quarter as we believe the international peak season is largely behind us.", "Overall, the U.S. economy continues to show signs of strengthening, but we are keeping a close eye on softening economies in various parts of the world. Our diverse franchise and strong value proposition will continue to support business development efforts across our network and we expect a strong finish to the year.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Thanks, Eric and good morning. Starting with safety. Our team continues to address risk in the work place and to generate record safety results. The performance is noteworthy given our current network variability. Training and deploying thousands of new employees introduces risk as the new hires get a feel for their work. We rely on each team's commitment to risk reduction, Total Safety Culture and the principles of Courage to Care to counter that risk.", "As a result, our year-to-date employee personal injury rate of 1.09 was 4% better than 2013 and a year-to-date record low. On a technical note, we have restated our employee personal injury rates for 2011 through 2014 year-to-date due to an overstatement of employee hours during this period. The absolute number of injuries reported was not affected.", "In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 7% to 3.04 and also set a year-to-date record. Continued investments in our infrastructure and advanced defect detection technology drove a reduction in track- and equipment-induced derailments. We also made progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and standard work.", "In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased slightly versus 2013. To make continued progress, we are reinforcing public awareness through targeted safety campaigns in local communities and businesses. We are also developing analytics to assess crossing risks, which will enable us to target those with the greatest safety impact. Overall, we've made real progress on generating safety improvements on our way to an incident-free environment.", "The third quarter was a challenge for the operating team with significant weather events, robust volume growth and interline connectivity issues. During the third quarter, flooding and subsequent washouts on several key routes materially impacted operations. The 84 days with major service interruptions resulting from weather and incidents were the most we have ever recorded in a quarter since we first started tracking the measure back in 2005. In comparison, the average for the third quarter since 2005 has been 37 weather and incident interruption days.", "Variability also resulted from the construction of major capacity projects, most notably the Tower 55 project in Fort Worth, Texas. This public-private partnership, completed in late August, created operational efficiencies and additional capacity by reconfiguring and adding additional track through a key bottleneck in our network. However, a project of this magnitude required us to reroute significant train traffic to facilitate installation. Given the more-than-100 trains per day that traverse through this intersection, the reroutes placed additional pressure on the network during the quarter.", "Reflecting this variability, our service performance fell short during the third quarter. As reported to the AAR, third quarter velocity was down 10% and freight car dwell up 13% when compared to 2013. We have maintained velocity around 24 miles per hour while addressing these operational challenges in moving growing volumes. The team has adjusted transportation plans to use alternate switching yards and gateways, realigned resources to where they are needed most, and employed the use of our surge resources.", "The interruptions and their subsequent reductions on network capacity also drove a decline in our Service Delivery Index, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments. On a more positive note, we were able to maintain local service within a reasonable range, registering a 93.3% Industry Spot & Pull. This metric, which reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced this year, measures whether a car is delivered to or pulled from a customer's facility on time.", "Our team is working very hard to handle customers' growing volumes while improving service and we remain focused on making it happen. To support our customers' volume growth, we have increased our total TE&Y workforce by more than 1,100 employees and our active locomotive fleet by around 900 units since September of last year. And we've stepped up our resource plan throughout the year to handle growing volumes and provide the level of service that our customers have come to expect.", "As to our workforce, we are now planning to hire around 3,600 TE&Y employees to cover growth and attrition, up from the 3,200 we discussed back in July. Approximately 2,500 of these 3,600 have already been hired. And while some of these employees are already active in day-to-day operations, a good portion of these new hires are still in our training pipeline. Around 1,100 will be moving into active operations in the fourth quarter.", "We also have plans to acquire an additional 32 locomotives this year, bringing our new total to 261 units, up from 229. Around 200 of these units are now on property and deployed across the network.", "And a quick update on CapEx. We still plan to spend around $4.1 billion this year, including the additional 32 locomotives I just mentioned. While we are largely on schedule, timing issues on a few projects keeps our overall projection unchanged. And while we still haven't finalized our overall 2015 capital program, we do plan to acquire around 200 new locomotives next year. Our capital investments help maintain a safe, strong and resilient network and include investments in service, growth and productivity that allow us to handle growing rail volumes.", "Moving to productivity. The volume trends we saw in the first half of the year were largely sustained in the third quarter, with volume growth in each network region. We generated solid productivity with the volume growth despite the operational headwinds we faced during the quarter. So while we incurred some incremental costs associated with congestion, we improved network productivity by increasing average train lengths in nearly all major categories and by adjusting the T-Plan to reduce work events.", "The chart on the lower right demonstrates our ability to leverage growing manifest volumes through UP's terminal infrastructure. During the quarter, we switched 7% more cars with a 5% increase in yard and local employee days versus 2013. The result was an all-time quarterly record in terminal productivity. Our employees are bringing their expertise to bear on improving service, safety and efficiency by standardizing work and reducing variability to drive our operating ratio to an all-time record.", "Wrapping up. Our first order of business is to safely improve network performance while satisfying customer demand. We are working hard to provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service. As I've previously mentioned, our recovery is partly dependent on interchange fluidity, so we continue to work with our connecting railroads to improve performance at key gateways. We expect to generate record safety results on our way to an incident-free environment. We will continue to make sound investments in resources and network capacity to overcome congestion and service interruptions and to handle increased demand. Our focus on reducing variability in the network has never been more important to generating sequential improvement. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight", "Thanks, Lance and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue grew 11% to nearly $6.2 billion, driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expenses totaled just under $3.9 billion, increasing 7% over last year. And even though our network continues to run at suboptimal levels, our operating income still grew 19% to $2.3 billion.", "Below the line, other income totaled $20 million, down $8 million from 2013. Interest expense of $144 million was up 4% compared to the previous year. Primary drivers were increased debt issuance during the first 9 months of this year.", "Income tax expense increased to $836 million, driven primarily by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 19% versus 2013, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce best ever quarterly earnings of $1.53 per share, up 23% versus last year.", "Turning to the top line. Freight revenue grew 11% to over $5.8 billion. This was driven primarily by volume growth of 7% and core pricing gains of just over 2.5%. A positive lag impact on our fuel surcharge program added approximately 1 point in freight revenue growth. Business mix added another 0.5 point as the positive mix impact in grain and frac sand volume more than offset the increase in lower average revenue per car Intermodal shipments during the quarter.", "Other revenue increased 12% in the quarter. Primary drivers included revenue associated with the per diem on auto parts containers as well as subsidiary-related volume growth. Recall that beginning last year, per diem revenue on auto parts containers is now reported in other revenue as a result of a change in how we are compensated for this service.", "Slide 22 provides more detail on the impact of changing fuel prices on our fuel surcharge revenue. Represented by the blue line, you can see how diesel fuel prices declined in August and September. Remember, there is about a 2-month lag before the price of diesel fuel actually flows to our surcharge revenue. The dashed line reflects that 2-month lag.", "In periods of falling fuel prices, earnings benefit from the surcharge lag. On a year-over-year basis, the surcharge lag added about $0.04 per share to our third quarter 2014 earnings. This includes $0.02 of positive impact in the third quarter of this year as well as $0.02 of negative impact during the same period last year.", "As we look ahead, it's hard to say what might actually happen with fuel prices. It's a little like trying to predict the economy. So whilst we've been seeing a modest benefit to start off the fourth quarter, much can change between now and near the end of the year.", "Slide 23 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. Third quarter core pricing came in at just above 2.5%. This is up slightly from our first-half average, reflecting continued core pricing gains. And our commitment to a strategy of pricing to market at re-investable levels that are above inflation remain solidly intact.", "Moving on to the expense side. Slight 24 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 8% versus 2013. Higher volumes, inflation and increased training expense were the primary drivers of the increase along with some increased costs associated with running a less-than-optimal network.", "Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 2% when compared to 2013. However, the reduction in the number of employees associated with capital projects helped to offset some of the increase in noncapital-related workforce levels. If you exclude capital-related employees, our workforce was up over 3% with the majority of this increase coming in our TE&Y ranks.", "For the full year in total, we are now revising our previous estimates. We now plan to hire over 5,500 people to cover growth and expected attrition of just under 4,000. This total does include the increase in TE&Y hiring, which Lance just discussed. From a timing perspective, about 30% of this hiring is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of this year. Going forward, you should expect to see our workforce levels grow with volume, but not at the same rate of increase. Labor inflation is still expected to come in under 2% for the full year in part reflecting favorable pension expense.", "Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $882 million, up 2% when compared to 2013, driven primarily by higher gross ton-miles associated with increased volumes and lower diesel fuel prices. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1% while our average fuel price declined 5% to $3.01 per gallon.", "Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 11% to $650 million due to higher locomotive and freight car material costs, volume-related contract and subsidiary expenses, and crew transportation and lodging expenses. Depreciation expense was $481 million, up 8% compared to 2013, consistent with our 7% to 8% full year guidance.", "Slide 27 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $310 million, which is flat when compared to 2013. Higher volume-related freight car rental expense was offset by lower freight car and container lease costs. Lease costs are lower as a result of exercising purchase options on some of our leased equipment.", "Other expenses came in at $242 million, up $37 million versus last year. Higher state and local taxes, damaged freight and equipment costs and personal injury expense contributed to the year-over-year increase. Year-to-date other expenses are up 5%, within the range of our full year guidance of an increase between 5% and 10% excluding any unusual items.", "Turning to our operating ratio performance. We achieved a quarterly record operating ratio of 62.3%, improving 2.5 points when compared to 2013. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we achieved a 64.2% operating ratio, an improvement of 2.3 per [ph] points over last year. With 3 quarters now complete, we are in a solid position to achieve our long-term guidance on a full year basis of a sub-65% operating ratio this year.", "Turning now to our cash flow. Year-to-date cash from operations totaled nearly $5.4 billion. This is up almost 10% when compared to 2013. Recall, this amount is tempered by the headwind this year in bonus depreciation and the timing of cash tax payments. Capital invested totaled $3.3 billion year-to-date.", "In addition, we returned about $1.2 billion in dividend payments to our shareholders. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we increased our adjusted debt by approximately $1.7 billion since the first of the year, bringing our adjusted debt balance to $14.5 billion at quarter end. This takes our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio to 40.2%, up from 37.6% at year end 2013. This puts us in line with our target of an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 40%. And we continue to work towards our target of an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.5.", "We also continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchases. Since the first of the year, we've bought back over 24 million shares, totaling about $2.3 billion. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since 2007 to 237 million shares. When you combine dividend payments with our share repurchases, we returned more than $3.5 billion to our shareholders in the first 3 quarters of this year. These combined payments represent a 47% increase over 2013, continuing our focus on rewarding shareholders with increased cash returns.", "So that's the recap of our third quarter results. As we look to close out the year, we are well positioned to report a record year in many of our key financial measures. Of course, we still need the economy to cooperate, but the business fundamentals remain strong and are supported by our solid core pricing initiatives.", "I would also like to remind everyone that as we have previously announced, we have an Investor Day coming up in a couple of weeks on November 5 in Chicago. So as we look past 2014 and into next year and beyond, we look forward to providing you our thoughts and views at that point in time.", "And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay. Thanks, Rob. Well, as you've heard from the team today, we're feeling pretty good about the remainder of the year. Assuming that the economy and weather cooperate, we are well positioned to finish up the year with record results. We continue to see tremendous opportunity across our diverse franchise and we remain focused on improving our network velocity and fluidity so that we can leverage these opportunities by safely providing our customers with excellent service and our shareholders with strong returns.", "So with that, we're going to go ahead and open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Jack, just given that I'm the first here, I guess I'm going to ask a question that you probably know is coming. There's been some discussion around M&A in the industry right now and definitely proposals to fix the service issues facing the carriers. So I know you talked about it in the last call, or said effectively you don't think M&A can happen. But do you believe that combinations of the east-west carriers could potentially alleviate some of the congestion that you're seeing right now?", "John J. Koraleski", "Brandon, I am not convinced that merging is the way you solve service issues in this industry. And particularly right now, I don't think mergers make sense and I still believe that. I think, when you look ahead to the regulatory hurdles that are out there, the STB, the new rules basically say that any combination is going to have to enhance competition as opposed to the past when it was just maintain competition. And secondly, that they will consider the triggering effects of additional consolidations. So that really does add a whole layer of concern for me as I think about the prospects of future mergers. So I'm not a fan and I really don't believe that's the best way to fix the service situation.", "Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Well, when you look at the overlap, though, of the networks, do you believe there's a lot of competitive overlap in some of these combinations? Or are there, potentially, combinations that could help some of these bottlenecks where you wouldn't have significant competitive concern?", "John J. Koraleski", "When we come across bottlenecks, we work really hard with our interline partners to solve them. And I don't see that merging is the way to eliminate bottlenecks.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe just a question on pricing. I want to get a rough sense of sort of how you think about the pricing environment, particularly when you're looking out to 2015. Obviously, volumes are sort of getting back up towards previous peak levels. Just kind of want to get a rough sense about how you feel about that and a potential re-acceleration, if we could see one, in 2015 up from about the 2.5% you've been doing the last couple of quarters.", "John J. Koraleski", "Chris, we like to -- what we're seeing in the marketplace today in terms of the volume that's taking place and the demand and clearly, when a market reacts that way, the pricing environment gets better. I don't know, Eric, you want to put some technical around that?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, Jack, you're right. We've said in the past that as demand strengthens, we see our ability and our strong value proposition to continue to allow us to take price and we're excited about the future opportunities.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that is helpful. And then if I could just ask a follow-up question, specifically as it pertains to Intermodal. You've had some fairly strong results on the Intermodal side. Just want to get a rough sense, maybe if we can parse out is there-- how we think about sort of the core business and then the competitive potential opportunities that maybe you've seen over the course of this year. And maybe if it's just sort of a mix dynamic that's playing into that Intermodal average revenue per car. Just want to get a sense of how that is trending because it seems to be a bit of a standout.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay. Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. I think we've been saying the whole year, talking about our new products and services, and as we're rolling out our new products and services, it's really driving our value proposition and our ability to convert truck, particularly long-haul truck, to the rail. And again, that value proposition continues to allow us to price to market and strengthen our prices and it's just a continuation of the trend that we've had.", "Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And the fourth quarter, that's sort of the same dynamic, potentially, with international being a little bit maybe softer and then the domestic side continuing to do what it's been doing.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. As you know, there's always kind of a cycle throughout the year in terms of the volumes quarter-to-quarter, and we expect that cycle throughout the year to be similar this year as it was previous year. But given that, yes, we see our strong value proposition and the trend to continue.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Just had a question on whether or not you all have estimated the cost of the network performance issues that you incurred in the third quarter. You were able to put up, obviously, just spectacular numbers. But I suspect that if things have been more fluid, you would've done even better than that. Any estimates on the cost of that set of challenges? And also, was there any revenue missed due to performance issues or interline issues?", "John J. Koraleski", "Hey, Rob, why don't you take a shot at that?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, John, that -- it's difficult to kind of nail that down, as you know. Roughly -- clearly, there was some cost. I'd say, it cost us probably $0.01 or so on the cost. But as we pointed out, we recognize that we didn't meet all of the demand in our Coal business, for example. So there's some revenue that, clearly, we hope to continue to make up as we move forward, but that had an impact as well.", "John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "And then on the reduced year-over-year crude volumes, is there any hope for making up some of that by connecting with the Canadian carriers and hauling some of the heavy sour out of Alberta down to the Gulf Coast?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, John, as we've said in the past, our strategy is to strengthen our franchise to provide optionality between origins and destinations. We're still doing that. We're heading down that path. As you know, we don't control the flows. The spreads are going to drive that and the price of oil is going to drive that. In terms of the Canadian perspective, I certainly think that as oil goes to $85, $80, the Canadian heavies probably have more headwinds than they do at $100 or $110 price of oil. So those are all factors that will go into our crude oil opportunities in the future.", "John J. Koraleski", "I would just add to that, John. The trade-off of a 10% down on our oil business but a 39% increase on the frac sand business is pretty darn attractive to us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So Jack, I think the company used to speak about the capacity on the network being somewhere in that 190,000, 195,000 carloads at a 4-week moving average basis. Obviously, you guys have been doing a lot in terms of double trucking [ph] parts of the network to the Tower 55 project. Can you sort of help us understand where you think the capacity situation is now with all the resources you're adding? Are we -- or do you guys feel like you're in a good position to accommodate volume growth? Do you feel like there's the potential for a more drawn out potential for service issues as the volume outlook continues to look pretty strong?", "John J. Koraleski", "David, I actually feel pretty good about our positioning right at the moment. And I'm not backing down from the 195,000 to 200,000 kind of a range. Our capital spending on infrastructure has been excellent. Our railroad is really in the best shape it's been in, in a long time. We are adding crews I think, as you've seen in the presentation today, pretty aggressively here in the last quarter of the year and actually even into the first couple of months of next year. Our locomotive take for this year is solid and we're protected for next year. And I like all of that. We're running the 100,000 -- between 190,000 and 195,000 cars a week, week-to-week, and we are continuing to see improvement in our internal measures and our velocity and things like that. So I feel good about the fact that we're getting better even at these very strong volumes. And I think I'd stay in that 195,000 to 200,000. I think we'll be okay.", "David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "All right. And the results definitely support that. So Eric, maybe just as a follow-up, it looks like the growth in premium traffic, the trailer growth in the Intermodal segment there, you're picking up some business. Would you think that there's more runway to grow that? Or do you think that this is going to be sort of 1 or 2 premium accounts where you're getting a nice hit on the RPU? Or do you think that there's more potential to grow that premium service product over a longer period of time?", "Eric L. Butler", "As you know, and as we've said in the past, we're continuing to put new products and services in the marketplace. I think we spoke at the last quarter about some of the new premium services that we put in the marketplace between Chicago and the West Coast and the TMNW [ph]. And so we certainly saw a benefit from putting those new products and services in the marketplace. We're going to continue to look at opportunities to do that, and we expect to continue to drive growth across our Intermodal book of business, including our premium business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Real quick here. You talked a little bit about pension being a minor help this year. Given current interest rates, what are you expecting for '15?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. I mean, obviously, we don't have all the full numbers nailed, but Jason, I think it's a safe assumption that it'll be higher next year. And as I pointed out that pension and other health and welfare items are what drove our comp inflation number to be, as I stated, below 2%. We would expect that's going to obviously drive that to a higher number next year, probably closer to 3-ish, all in.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "3-ish, all in. Okay. Now given that and you said your core pricing was just -- I guess, just over 2.5%. Is that something that we should look to trend up, that 2.5% next year, to try to keep up with some of the additional costs that are coming on?", "John J. Koraleski", "Rob?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. I mean, I -- our philosophy, Jason, has not changed at all. And that is to price to market at re-investable levels and above inflation. So we're constantly taking advantages there, talk to where it make sense for us to bring on business at the right terms and right conditions and that -- we're not giving more detailed guidance on that other than our tenet and our focus and our belief achieving those goals has not changed.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Has it been a little bit more difficult given the service levels on some of the pricing discussions with your shippers this year?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Jason, we operate in a very competitive environment and lots of competitive options. And getting price is always difficult, but we believe we have a value proposition and we are going forward in selling our value proposition and gaining a price for it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about -- and Jack or Eric, really, the addressable market. So when you look at what's kind of going on with your operating ratio, it's getting to very impressive levels. And I realize you haven't quite gotten to low 60s on a full year basis, but you're getting to levels where I think all of us are going to sort of rightfully conclude that, well, there's probably more opportunity to go, but that opportunity set is diminishing. So could you talk about how you weigh the pros and cons of using some of that operating ratio to try to grow revenue faster? Is that something that you started thinking about, that you want to kind of start to try to win business using maybe price where appropriate? Or how do you think about this changing dynamic?", "John J. Koraleski", "You know Bill, I don't think about my opportunities as diminishing. As I look ahead for the next 4, 5, 6 years, and we'll talk about this more on November 5, I think the Union Pacific franchise is loaded with opportunities. And I think Eric and his team are doing an outstanding job of business development. Part of our capital investment strategy, like Santa Teresa, part of it in terms of the announcement we made about moving ahead with a new facility in Robertson County down in Texas. All that's focused on growth and development. There's still huge potential for us in Mexico. I'll stop. I'll let Eric...", "Eric L. Butler", "The only other thing I would add, and again, Jack and Rob said we'll talk more about this at the Investor Day, if you think about the shale play and the lower energy prices in this country, there is really a resurgence of activity, business activity, investment activity, manufacturing activity. And we see that continuing to be just a strong propellant for growth in the future. I mean, talking about price, using price to grow is not even in our vernacular at this point.", "Robert M. Knight", "Bill this is Rob, I just got to add. We'll try not to have 3 people answer each question. But, I have to add that focus really for us is on returns. Operating ratio has got a shorthand target, that gives us -- brings it all together in terms of efficiency, and we use that as a measure of success, if you will. But at the end of the day, we really are focused on driving returns.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "No, that's very hopeful. Let me just clarify, because I just kind of wanted to make sure I kind of asked this in the right way. And what I'm basically getting at is I think most people would say that a long-term organic growth rate, in volume terms for rails, is probably GDP-like. Pricing will be inflation-plus if you put that at 2% or so, we'll talk about maybe a 3% number. And that kind of puts you in the mid single-digit revenue growth rate range. And I think what I'm trying to get at is, is there a way to push that higher or are what you -- maybe what you're saying is, listen, our network has much greater opportunities than that organic GDP-like level of growth. But that's what I was kind of trying to get at.", "John J. Koraleski", "I think 2 things, Bill. One is you're right. I think we believe that our franchise has greater opportunities than that. And number two is it's not just about market and inflation. It's also about the value that you provide for the customer. How do you differentiate your service package, the options that you provide customers, the relationships that you build with them. And we think that gives us an edge.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz at UBS.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Let's see, so I wanted to ask you about how would you compare the current environment for -- rail environments, not just UP. But current rail environments, 2004 through 2006, I guess the shoe is on the other foot, so to speak, among the western carriers in terms of maybe who has greater capacity challenges. But is it fair to say that this may be similar where it really takes a while to recover for the industry and velocity, but that supports some positive things in terms of price and perhaps a couple of years of pretty favorable pricing?", "John J. Koraleski", "I think, Tom, that's not a bad assessment. Having been the poster child of what not to do in 2003, '04, '05, it feels better that we're where we are at the moment. But I do think, when you look across the rail industry, you're seeing incredibly strong capital investment. Almost uniformly across every property. You see operating teams that are experienced, that are working diligently to get these things working. There's a lot of interline activity between carriers that's looking at improving service and things like that. So I think it'll -- while there are some similarities to that, I'm hopeful that you're going to see a quicker return to kind of a more normal velocity than what we saw back in those days.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Let's see, in terms of the, I guess, getting to your own pricing opportunity, how much of your book is available to get repriced in 2015? And I guess how much of that have you already taken up, already set the repricing?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric.", "Eric L. Butler", "So we've said in the past, Tom, that at any one given period of time, roughly 70% of our book of business is tied up in contracts of a year and longer. We're rolling those over at -- all the time. So I think that's a good rule of thumb to continue to use.", "Thomas R. Wadewitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. But I mean, if you said tariff, one-year letter quote plus the multi-year that rolls over, is it maybe 50% of the book you could touch for next year or is there a broad brush number you can give us for what you actually [indiscernible] next year?", "John J. Koraleski", "If you look at it, Tom, it hasn't changed very much over the years. About 30% is in tariff, about 30% is in one-year letter quotes. But those all come up and due at different times during the year. So I think you kind of stick with what Eric told you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just want to revisit your answer then, on kind of the volumes here. To David's question before, you talked about 190,000 to 200,000, and you said you felt good about 195,000 to 200,000. But if you're growing at these levels and you're already running at 190,000, 195,000 carloads per week, do you start to face congestion if you get -- if the Ag business stays strong or what-have-you in terms of volumes? I just want to understand, do you see tightness, just given on the volume side? Understanding what you're doing on the crew and locomotive side. It just sounds like the network, at some point, hits that max or is it just based on where the volumes are coming in from?", "John J. Koraleski", "I don't think that, that's a max for us, Ken. I think we have potential even beyond those numbers. It really does depend. I don't know, Lance, why don't you take a shot at it.", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure. So right now, we'd love to have more crews in our network to spool up our speed. That's probably the starting point of where current service product gets back to what we would consider an acceptable level. As we look forward, we're constantly making investment decisions in all the critical resources to be able to handle growth where we anticipate growth is going to occur. And I don't see any reason why we would say future growth is going to be retarded because those investments aren't happening in the right spots.", "John J. Koraleski", "Nor do we think it's going to take anything more than what we've stated, which is a 16% to 17% of revenue kind of capital trend to keep us ahead of that game.", "Lance M. Fritz", "16% to 17%.", "John J. Koraleski", "Yes. We're not saying it's going to take an exceptional capital infusion to keep us good.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "No, that's encouraging because it sounded like you were saying before it was kind of a max, at least for now, but that's encouraging on the ability to grow. And then maybe, Eric, thoughts on the Ag business in terms of this record crop we've had. It looks like we've got another strong crop. You said there was a delay in getting the harvest started. Can you maybe delve into that and talk about business there and what you're seeing in terms of congestion and the infrastructure there and kind of the pace of growth we should expect on the Ag side?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. So last year was a record corn harvest and a good soybean harvest. This year, all indications is that it's going to be another record corn harvest. I think last year was 13.9 billion bushels. This year might be -- I think the estimates are 14.4 billion bushels. And likewise, soybeans I think are going to be up close to 4 billion bushels, which would be a record. The delay that's occurring is really the delay of farmers harvesting in the field, it's not a transportation supply chain delay. Variety of reasons for that. Some parts of the country, it's been wetter than usual. Other parts of the country, the farmers are making the decisions in terms of when they want to bring their product to market. So a variety of reasons for that. So we expect this record harvest to still -- record corn harvest to still be ahead of us in terms of harvesting and the farmers looking to put that into the supply chain, the transportation process.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's helpful. I appreciate the time and great results. If I could just get a clarification though, Eric, on something you said earlier. The oil that you mentioned was declining. Is that because it's moving east and west, and -- because your frac sand is going up. So I just want to understand why that downshift in the crude on your network when we're seeing such strong growth on all the others.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, the crude reductions for us have been the Bakken to the Gulf and Louisiana. And if you look at the flows of the Bakken crude, that is flowing east and west and not north and south. And one of the reasons it's not flowing north and south is that there's such huge production of crude in Texas, in the basins in Texas, that it's predominantly moving by pipeline to the refineries. We have some spot rail moves but predominantly by pipeline. There really is not a need to move the Bakken crude to Texas. So that's the dynamic that we're seeing.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.", "Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So following up on frac sands. So volume growth clearly accelerated in Q3. And in spite of the uncertainties surrounding crude prices, do you have any opportunities to take up price on this business, given the very tight supply? And it looks you took up some of the public tariff rates on this business. I was wondering if you could comment on what percentage is contractual versus spot.", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "So we don't give kind of percentages of contracts versus public by individual business segment. But we are focused, again, on our value proposition. We're focused on the demand, the strong demand that's going on in that marketplace and we are pricing it appropriately. If you look at that marketplace, there's huge new production coming online, of sand facilities in Wisconsin and Minnesota. We're excited about our franchise and the ability that we're giving the disproportionate amount of that new production on our line, which we think is a great opportunity for us in the future. So we think that as long as the drilling continues and oil prices sustain drilling, we have nice growth opportunity ahead of us in the future.", "Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And then you mentioned earlier your longer term view of a resurgence in industrial activity in the U.S. Within that context, how are you thinking about the new ethane crackers coming online, maybe in terms of the size of the opportunity? And has there been any talk from customers about potential delays from either labor or the recent slide in crude prices?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, as you know, Allison, that there's huge number of new capacity coming online. A lot of that will come online in '16 or '17. Those were the plans. But as long as natural gas kind of remains where it is, in the $3.75 range, it's going to be a huge financial incentive for those projects to go forward. There's been public reports of some spot shortages of skilled laborers. As far as we could tell, it's not significant or material to the timetable of any of those projects.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Wanted to follow up on that question about comparing this to that '04, '05 timeframe. If I go back and look, when you guys were having those significant service issues, it really kicked off a 3- or 4-year period of pretty material share losses to be in. This year we're seeing the opposite. Do you think this is the beginning of a multiyear period of share gain or do you think this is going to be more of just a one-off?", "John J. Koraleski", "That's really hard for us to tell right now, Scott. So I got to tell you, the BNSF is a great railroad. And they're going to come back, and they're going to come back strong. So we have seen some opportunities, probably the strongest we've seen have been in grain and in Intermodal, but those can move back very quickly. And our goal is to impress those customers with our value proposition and doing business with Union Pacific such that when the competition is stronger than what they are today, they won't think about shifting back. But it is a tough competitive marketplace out there and we recognize we will have to compete.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Are the tenor of the conversations suggesting that next year could be another year of share gain or could some of that go back in your mind?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "As Jack said, the BNSF is a tough competitor. I think they have publicly stated in different forums that next year, the full year, will be a full recovery year for them. We see them working hard to recover and I would not be surprised to see them recovering in different parts of their markets as you go through the year and they will continue to be a strong competitor.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay, that makes sense. And then one for you Rob. If I look back at last year when you had legacy pricing, it looked like it was about 1 point, 1.5 point boost to the core pricing gains. Is it realistic to think next year could be similar to that? And is there any update on what percent of the legacy you expect to retain? Sometimes you can give us an update around that.", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes. I mean, just to kind of reiterate what I think you already know Scott. You're right, we achieved about 1.5 point of benefit last year from legacy contract renewals. Coming into this year, we said \"legacy light.\" So basically 0 this year. Next year, we have about $300 million worth of revenue that we will compete for in the marketplace. We don't give guidance in terms of what the pricing's going to look like on that. But we're going to be in the marketplace competing and we're in those discussions as we speak. So no further update on that, other than it will -- we would expect there would be some contributor next year on legacy versus this year, 0.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just have one question here on Intermodal. We mentioned the BNSF issues and there was obviously some labor volatility. A few of the other railroads are talking about the potential that shippers will start to diversify away from the port of L.A., Long Beach. And I see you have a question mark on your Intermodal growth outlook. Do you think that this diversification is possible and to what extent it might impact your operation out of those ports?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "So, Walter, great question. The market is aware and we are aware of the difficulties that are occurring right now in the Port of L.A., Long Beach. They are experiencing backups. A variety of reasons for that. Probably some of it is due to some of the labor uncertainty with the West Coast ILWU workers. Some of it's probably related to the fact that you have larger ships going into the terminals and they're dwelling longer as they're trying to unload those ships. Part of it is due to the fact that as the alliances, the steamship alliances, are changing. It's having different impacts on different terminals within the Port of L.A. and Port of Long Beach. So a variety of issues. Those issues, frankly, are impacting some of our transportation operations. We're doing some things creatively to overcome those. But if you look at it, the Port of L.A., Long Beach is still such a huge driver of West Coast imports. It's unlikely to see significant long-term material diversions. Last month, September, the Port of L.A., Long Beach, hit volume levels that they hadn't seen since probably '06 or '07. So they're seeing huge volume growth. There might be some nominal diversions to some other ports, whether up or down the U.S. West Coast or in Canada. Some of those ports have similar capacity challenges that they also have, that they're also working through. So there might be some nominal short-term diversions. But long term, if the Port of L.A., Long Beach can get their issues worked through, they're still in a pretty good place to maintain and grow their segment of the business.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And as you see some of that capacity tightening along the Western U.S. and Canada, as we approach a more full -- approach Panama fully up and running, as time gets closer, are you hearing your shippers talk more and more, looking harder at what they're going to do with Panama? I know there's still a lot of question marks around the rates around there and all that, but any update on what the potential impact, longer-term, of Panama could be?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, so, as you know, there's still a whole rate question out there in terms of if it's going to cost more money and you have a longer transit time. There is actually a construction delay question still out there with the Panama Canal. I think what we've said in the past is still what we think today, that you might have 1% or 2% that gets diverted today. About 30% of the business is all water. That might grow to 31%, 32%. But we don't see, nor are we hearing from shippers, anything significant beyond that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "With regard to the -- you guys have historically talked that the train size performance isn't kind of the end-all be-all, particularly when there are growth opportunities. I think we saw that with the Intermodal results this quarter. Could you give us a sense how much more volume the Intermodal network could handle on average, if volumes continue to pick up here?", "John J. Koraleski", "Sure. Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Yes. Rob, so you're right. Train size is not the be-all end-all. Intermodal was impacted this quarter by new products that, on average, were smaller than the rest of the network. And if you think about train size opportunity on Intermodal trains as it exists today, to get them up to average train size in the routes that they go, there's plenty of upside. Not putting it in a percentage, but dozens and dozens of boxes.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then, Lance, as I'm thinking about the Intermodal growth, particularly on the expedite trailer side, you guys have clearly taken market share in the PNW down to Chicago. How much of the growth has been driven by some large customers you guys took on there versus just overall network gains that you're seeing across the network due to a tight trucking marketplace?", "Lance M. Fritz", "It's probably more a question for Eric. But I will tell you, we do not speak to specific customers. We do have a new product in that lane that's performing well and it is attracting new business.", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, that's the answer. And I mentioned that earlier, we put in some new products both to the PNW and to California. And those new products are attracting business, particularly as some of our competitors are struggling in that corridor.", "Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And, Eric, as we think about that business, should there be a significant peaking factor to the RPU in the fourth quarter associated with that or is the third quarter a pretty good run rate looking out kind of for the Intermodal product?", "John J. Koraleski", "I think overall, Rob, we're not going to give specific pricing guidance on that. I think we'll have to just wait and see how the business materializes and hopefully it's going to continue to be positive.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I had a question with regards to Mexico. It's been sort of around 10% of your revenue days. And I'm wondering, is that changing materially? And if not, when do you anticipate the growth or potential outsized growth in Mexico to start to contribute or a little bit more of the overall book of revenue.", "John J. Koraleski", "Overall, Thomas, it was 10% again in the quarter. Volume was up about 9%, so it's a great piece of business with us. In terms of future growth, Eric, you want to take a shot?", "Eric L. Butler", "We continue to think Mexico has nice future growth opportunities on the auto side, the grain side, the industrial product side. A 9% growth trend is pretty good.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I'm curious as to what the point when -- one would think, with all the newer sourcing opportunity, that it should be a bigger percentage of the book to business. And I guess if you can maybe frame out, maybe even how Santa Teresa fits into that picture and when you anticipate that potentially adding maybe 1 point or 0.5 point in terms of the overall revenue contribution. Will you be able to frame out perhaps maybe the medium- to long-term?", "Robert M. Knight", "This is Rob, maybe I can answer that for you that Thomas. I mean we're not going to give specific guidance on that. But I would just say that if look out over the last several years, our volumes in and out of Mexico -- and of course as you know, we're the only railroad that crosses the 6 rail crossing points. But our Mexican-related business has been growing faster than our overall enterprise business has. So it's been contributing. And we're not going to break out in terms of what the margins are on that business. But I would just tell you that it's good business that we're bringing on the network. So it has been contributing and continues to contribute as we move forward.", "Eric L. Butler", "And your Santa Teresa growth is meeting expectations. And just as a data point, that would be considered domestic business.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right, great. Can I just ask a question with regard to the labor inflation? Obviously we're hearing sort of recurring, sort of comments about the challenges recruiting labor and obviously -- just in particular, with regards to certain markets where labor's extremely tight. Should we be a little concerned? Is wage inflation possibly a headwind into 2015 that we should be thinking about or are there other mitigating factors that could dampen that sort of concern that we might be having here?", "John J. Koraleski", "You know, we have a solid pipeline of talent. We have a great organization out getting us new employees. And right now, we're not seeing a concern. Rob, do you have any insight on inflationary [indiscernible]?", "Robert M. Knight", "Yes, Thomas. I would just say that's all wrapped in to -- I agree with Jack's comments. In the inflation, we expect it to be higher next year. And as I said earlier 3 plus-ish versus the less than 2 all in this year. For lots of reasons.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on how you're thinking about the potential pricing environment in Intermodal. Do you think it should mirror some of the contractual rate increases we're seeing in the truckload market? Or given you've been pushing price in this business to get back to re-investable levels over the past few years, do you think the pace of increases could be below what we're seeing in truckload?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Again, we feel very good about our value proposition. And as the truck market tightens from a variety of issues, the new CSA rules, truck driver, the cost of fuel, the cost of cabs, we think that just strengthens our value proposition and strengthens our ability to get price as we go into the future.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And another one on Intermodal. It's obviously a lower RPU business, but is there any way you could speak to the incremental margins that you're seeing in Intermodal today? Just given the opportunity to build into the -- add the train lengths, et cetera. Do the incremental margins in Intermodal look pretty similar to your other commodity groups?", "Robert M. Knight", "This is Rob, let me answer that. We don't break out specific margin by business. But you have heard me, perhaps, say many times, that our Intermodal opportunities -- Intermodal has typically been on the lower end, if you will, of our very diverse business group and it's been moving up fast. All of our business has been moving in the right direction. And as Eric said, we still have confidence that we can continue to move it directionally correct.", "Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. But to clarify, today it's still a bit below the other businesses?", "Robert M. Knight", "It's probably below average, but improving nicely.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie.", "Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research", "Two follow-ups on previously asked questions. The one just before me on pricing and Intermodal: could you please help us understand the outlook for continued sustained improvement? And maybe the main drivers, whether it's narrowing the gap to trucking, given your enhanced value proposition, whether changes in the road mix or the mix of domestic versus Intermodal, new relationships that you are building. Please help us understand what we should look for, long-term, for Intermodal pricing.", "John J. Koraleski", "You know, Cleo, you did a pretty good job of answering that question. I think it's a combination of all those things. It's, first of all, getting our service back into the zone where it absolutely needs to be and we're committed and we'll get there. So that's a good thing for us. Secondly, it is the relationships, the new business opportunities. Thirdly, it's when you look at the business proposition that Intermodal offers compared to the trucking industry, the opportunity for highway conversion, when you think about environmental friendliness, when you think about the fuel efficiency, when you think about the whole package of the beauty of Intermodal, which combines the best of both truck and rail. That's an opportunity for us. You add to that the capital investments that we're making in places like Santa Teresa, that's part of our opportunity pipeline. So all of those things that you've identified continue to keep us excited about the growth opportunity. And then the other thing that I would add is the pressure on the trucking industry, the additional regulations they're seeing the increased insurance cost. And eventually, you're going to find out that they're going end up with driver shortages. We're back now to where the housing market's getting back into what would be considered normal. What we saw originally was all those guys that went out of construction went into driving trucks. And right now they want to stay home with their kids. They're all shifting back into the construction zone. So I would expect that, at some point in time, the trucking industry is going to have driver shortage issues. All that plays into our book. Anybody want to add?", "Unknown Executive", "No, good.", "Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research", "And the second question also goes back to the issue of capacity. Can you please help us understand why just looking at the past peaks in terms of carloads on your network may not fully reflect your new capacity and flexibility. I don't know if it's just because the cars themselves are getting bigger or there are changes with your manifest versus unit train mix. Any other change in the base of your resources that really enable you to support growth more than we appreciate right now.", "John J. Koraleski", "Okay, Lance?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Sure, yes. Actually, Cleo, if you go back to the same volume levels, historically we're running about 1.5 mile to maybe even 2 miles an hour faster than we were at equivalent volume levels. That's a direct reflection of improved network capacity. And so when we look forward, our current utilization of that network capacity is not what we want it to be, we're retarded by lack of crews and a handful of other things. As we get on top of that, moving forward, which we are doing, we anticipate that those service levels improve at these current volume levels and give us plenty of runway for future growth.", "Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research", "How about maybe infrastructure investments by your customers, whether it's Energy or Chemicals. Do those also help you carry more growth with the relatively efficient use of resources on your end?", "Lance M. Fritz", "Absolutely they do, Cleo. And our customers are making significant investment to support themselves in the marketplace and help us serve them better all the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of MorningStar.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I'd like to return to the strong frac sand growth you mentioned and its divergence from the quarter's crude volume trends. Could you share some color on broad customer behavior? For example, what portion of sand shifts to wet versus dry wells. And are you seeing changes in driller behavior, such as more sand per well?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "So the second question, more sand per well. Absolutely. There's a lot of technology changes that's allowing the drilling services industry to do longer laterals, more laterals, and that has been a driver of our sand growth all year long. And we've talked about that in the past, we'll continue to talk about that in the future. In terms of where the sand is going to, I think it's really being driven by the economics of the well. Today, you see lots of drilling in the Permian Basin, lots of drilling in the Eagle Ford. You see growing drilling in the Niobrara. You see the Marcellus kind of resuming the levels of drilling that they had a couple of years ago. And you see sand flowing to all of those places. It's really driven by the economics of the shale play.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "A significant portion of it is going to dry gas. Is that correct here?", "Eric L. Butler", "If you look at where the sand is flowing today, I think the shales that I just listed are the common places where the sand is flowing today.", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. The capacity improvements you've outlined, which is the biggest, earliest lever to improve congestion. Is it mode of power, employees or infrastructure? I suspect you'll say all of the above. Is it crew the biggest constraint?", "John J. Koraleski", "I wouldn't say all of the above. First thing we're focused on is crews. There are other constraints but crews is the primary one right now.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt Trey [ph] with Nomura.", "Unknown Analyst", "I had a question. Given the systemic issues in truckload and driver shortage which, by all appearances, look like it's going to be a multi-year thing. Is this an opportunity to examine your marketing strategy with Intermodal internally and potentially your usage of IMCs? I was just wondering if you're thinking about that.", "John J. Koraleski", "Matt, we evaluate our marketing strategy constantly. And up until this point in time, we continue to see IMCs as our primary carrier in the marketplace. We think that model is solid and we are working very hard to work together with our IMC customers to improve service and to help them succeed in their marketplace. I don't know, Eric, do you have anything to add to that? Okay.", "Unknown Analyst", "I guess, as a follow-up, short haul versus long haul. Traditionally we've kind of thought of about a 10% to 15% spread versus truck. And in short haul, Intermodal, 40%, 50% north in long haul. Is that relationship still true? Are those numbers accurate? Have they narrowed? And if not, is there an opportunity to narrow them given the issues in truckload?", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes. I think what we've said is that the spread actually kind of depends on lanes and it could range from 35%, 40% spread, which is large, so as narrow as a 10% or 15% spread. And we think, with our value proposition, we'll continue to be able to narrow that spread and price closer and closer to truck as we improve our service and value propositions.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.", "Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just to follow on that final point, in terms of the IMC partners. How do you think about the strategy going forward? The trend over the past 10 years, it seems, has been fewer number of IMCs as opposed to more. I'm just wondering how you think about that going forward, given the fact that you do think that, that strategy is a healthy and viable one. Would you prefer to see a continued reduction in the number of IMC partners and really focus on scale and throughput and productivity to solve some of the constraints and to pursue market growth in Domestic Intermodal? Would you prefer more to help alleviate or kind of continue to strengthen your bargaining power? I'm just trying to think about that strategy over the next 5 years with regard to IMCs.", "John J. Koraleski", "Eric?", "Eric L. Butler", "Yes, Ben. One of the things we realize is that it is a big, wide, broad market out there and you have lots of different customers, and customers opportunities. You have large customers, the large retailers that probably will be managed with a small set of large IMCs. But you have a large group of midsize and smaller customers that we believe, at least at this time, that you'll continue to have a broad base of smaller IMCs that will assist in servicing and addressing those channels. And that's the reason for the strategy that Jack talked about, where we continue to see the IMCs being a large portion of our go-to-market strategy.", "Operator", "At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.", "John J. Koraleski", "Great. Thanks, Rob, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. I was going to say we look forward to speaking with you in January, but hopefully we'll see you November 5 in Chicago at our meeting.

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. ", "John Koraleski ", "Welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today here in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning we\u2019re pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved fourth quarter earnings of $1.61 per share, an increase of 27% compared to the fourth quarter 2013 and another quarterly record. Total volumes were up 6% with increases in all six of our business groups. Industrial products and coal showed particular strength up 10% and 9% respectively. ", "These strong volumes along with solid core pricing and productivity helped drive 3.6 points of improvement on our operating ratio to a record 61.4% for the fourth quarter. These strong fourth quarter results rounded out a full year 2014 which was very successful on many fronts. We posted record financial results in revenue, operating income, earnings per share, and operating ratio. The strong demand we experienced back in the first quarter was sustained throughout 2014 driving total volume growth of 7% for the year. ", "Robust volumes challenged our network for much of the year and we remain focused on adding the necessary resources to safely improve service and we\u2019re encouraged with the progress that we\u2019re making. We remain fully committed to delivery safe, efficient, value added service for our customers. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Eric.", "Eric Butler ", "In the fourth quarter volume was up 6% as solid demand across our franchise led to volume gains in all of our business groups. Strength in industrial products and goal led our volume gain for the quarter and intermodal and chemicals volumes were strong as well. Growth moderated in ag products during the quarter as we are now comparing to the strong grain harvest in 2013. Core price increased 3% which drove average revenue per car up by 3% in the quarter. Our volume growth and improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 9% which set a fourth quarter record of $5.8 billion.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was up 9% in the fourth quarter on a 4% increase in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per car. [Indiscernible] car loads were up 3% in the fourth quarter reflecting another record crop year for both corn and soybeans. US corn production was up more than 3% and soybean production was up 18% over the 2013 crops. We saw strong overseas export feed grain shipments this quarter, partially offset by lower exports to Mexico as receivers switched to local supply. Domestic feed grain shipments also contributed to our growth as lower corn prices drove demand. Wheat car loadings continued to be a headwind as lower wheat prices drove down export shipments. Grain products volume grew by 4% as strong gasoline demand and favorable export conditions drove another strong quarter of S&L shipments. ", "Food and refrigerated shipments were up 4% for the quarter. There was a strong domestic sugar beet crop which combined continued import beer growth to more than offset softer fresh and frozen food shipments.", "Automotive revenue was flat in the fourth quarter on a 2% increase in volume. Average revenue per car was down 2% driven by the previously reported change in the way we handle per diem shipments and also by mix. As a reminder, we lapsed the per diem change at the end of 2014 so we will not have this impact going forward. Finished vehicle shipments were up 2% this quarter driven by continued strength in consumer demand. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 16.7 million vehicles for the fourth quarter up more than one million units from the same quarter in 2013. Partially offsetting our volume gains was production variability at some key plants. On the parts side, increased production and a continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 2% volume increase. ", "In chemicals, our revenue was 8% for the quarter on a 5% volume increase and a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. Fertilizer shipments were up 17% in the fourth quarter driven primarily by strong international demand for pot ash and shipments of phos rock. Crude oil volume was up 7% in the quarter. We saw gains in shipments from the Niobrara and Uinta Basins which more than offset continued weakness in Bakken shipments caused by unfavorable price spreads.", "Finally, liquid petroleum gas storage shipments along with fuel additives and lube oil demand, drove our petroleum and LPG shipments up 5% for the quarter. Coal revenue increased 9% on a 9% increase in volume and a 15 increase in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was up 17% for the quarter. You will recall that we had an easy comp due to a snow storm that impacted shipments out of the Southern Powder River Basin in October 2013. In addition, strong demand from lower inventories and stock powder replenishment ahead of winter attributed to our growth and offset volume headwinds from our previously reported legacy contract loss. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 11% for the quarter driven primarily by continued soft demand for export coal. ", "Industrial products revenue increased 15% on a 10% increase in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per car. Non-metallic minerals were up 28% for the quarter again, primarily driven by a 35% increase in frac sand shipments. We continue to see demand for construction product shipments where volume was up 17% based on demand for aggregates and cement. Lumber shipments were up 10% in the quarter driven by housing and non-residential construction [indiscernible] over-the-road truck to rail conversions.", "Finally, in intermodal, revenue was up 11% driven by 6% increase in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit. We had another strong quarter in domestic intermodal with volume up 10%. New premium services and highway conversions continue to drive and led to a best ever fourth quarter in domestic intermodal. Our international intermodal volume was up 2% as new business volume and continued economic strength in the US offset headwinds created by reduced west coast port productivity. ", "Let\u2019s take a look at how we see our business shaping up for 2015. In ag products the strong corn and soybean crop and competitive corn prices should sustain domestic demand while worldwide grain inventories are relatively high creating a potential headwind for exports. Ethanol margins are tightening which can lead to a reduction in ethanol production in the near term. Longer term increased gasoline consumption and export opportunities should create strength in the ethanol market and demand for DPG should strengthen as China reenters the market. ", "We also anticipated another strong year of import beer growth. In automotive finished vehicles and auto parts shipments will continue to benefit from strength in production and sales driven by an improving US economy, replacement demand, and lower gasoline prices. Low inventory levels should continue to drive replenishment demand for coal into 2015. We\u2019re watching natural gas prices closely but at this point we have not seen lower prices impact demand for coal. We expect most of our chemicals market to remain solid in 2015 but we think crude oil will be a headwind throughout the year. We will keep a close eye on oil prices as the year progresses as the recent drop has led producers to reevaluate their plans for 2015. Ultimately, if oil prices remain at current levels it will impact our crude oil shipments. ", "We also expect energy markets to be a factor in our frac sand volumes and industrial products. The decline in oil prices has impacted rig counts so it is unlikely that we will see the robust levels of growth that we saw in 2014. However, our franchise is well positioned to participate in ongoing fracing operations. We\u2019ll have to see how the energy markets play out to see what the ultimate impact will be on our sand volumes.", "Also, in industrial products we expect the marketing construction products to continue particularly in the southern part of our franchise. We also anticipate year-over-year improvement in housing and other construction markets to drive demand for lumber. In intermodal consumer demand and highway conversions will drive growth in domestic intermodal in 2015. In international intermodal we would expect increased imports to drive growth this year however, the deterioration of productivity at west coast ports is having an impact on our volume early in the first quarter. At this point while we are hopeful that the parties will come to a resolution soon, international intermodal will be a headwind until the labor dispute is resolved. ", "To wrap up, there are a number of uncertainties on the horizon. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on the impact of crude oil prices, softening global economies, and the west coast labor dispute. Overall, we expect the US economy to continue to strengthen this year and drive growth in many of our business groups. With our diverse franchise, strong value proposition and continued focus on business development, we expect to deliver another year of positive volume and profitable revenue growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "I\u2019ll start with safety where our full year results included a record low reportable personal injury rate of 0.98, an 11% improvement versus 2013. I\u2019m very proud of the team as we made a nice step forward on our commitment that every employee returns home safely after each shift. In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 7% to 3.00 falling just short of an all-time record. Enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped reduce the absolute number of incidents including those that do not meet the regulatory reportable threshold, to a record low.", "In public safety our grade crossing incident rate increased 5% versus 2013. Driver behavior continues to be a critical factor in crossing incidents. We continued to reinforce public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns, and focused our counter measures on high risk crossings. In summary, the team has made terrific progress on our goal of achieving annual safety records on the way to an incident free environment.", "In regards to network performance we worked hard in 2014 to match network resources with the robust volume growth we enjoyed. During the latter part of the fourth quarter our available resources were largely aligned with demand. That, combined with a successful Thanksgiving holiday operation and better winter action plans, contributed to substantial service improvement in December. The net result was sequential velocity improvement in each region of our network, all while handling strong volumes.", "While our velocity in December was more than a mile an hour faster in November, and the best since January, our service performance still fell short during the fourth quarter. As reported to the AAR, fourth quarter velocity was down 8% and freight car dwell up 11% when compared to 2013. Our performance in December was a step in the right direction, but we are still not where we need to be. The team continues its relentless push to handle our customer\u2019s growing volumes while improving service.", "Moving to productivity, volume trends from the first nine months of 2014 largely continued in the fourth quarter including relatively balanced growth in each region. We continued to leverage volume by increasing train lengths. During the fourth quarter we set best ever records in nearly all major categories. The exception was in intermodal where new service offerings created a headwinds. Even so, we still generated a year-over-year increase in part reflecting our success in growing volumes within these lanes and our fuel conservation initiatives generated positive results in 2014 including a 2% improvement in the fourth quarter.", "We found new opportunities to reduce waste and continued to deploy advanced technologies that assist the engineer in saving fuel and that optimize train [needs]. With the workforce and locomotives resourced to match demand, we are positioned to generate both productivity gains and improved network fluidity. Last year, our total TE&Y workforce increased by more than 1,700 employees and our active locomotive fleet increased by around 800 units. Surge resources activated during the year accounted for some of the TE&Y and most of the locomotive growth.", "In addition to recalls, we hired around 3,600 TE&Y employees in 2014. Approximately 1,000 of these new hires moved from training to active status during the last three months of the year. For 2015, we plan to hire 2,800 TE&Y employees to cover growth and attrition and to generate incremental service improvement. We also plan to acquire 218 locomotives on top of the 261 units we purchased in 2014. ", "As 2015 unfolds, we will adjust resources based on demand and network performance. Rebuilding our surge resources is an important part of our operating strategy. Capital investment in our track infrastructure has also helped us handle volume growth while maintaining a safe and resilient network. In total, we invested just under $4.1 billion in our 2014 capital program. This includes $2.3 billion in replacement capital to harden our infrastructure and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network. At the end of the year, roughly 99% of our track miles were free of [indiscernible].", "Spending for service, growth, and productivity totaled $1.4 billion driven by investments in capacity, commercial facilities, and equipment. Major growth investments included the completion of our Santa Teresa New Mexico facility as well as the Tower 55 project in Fort Worth Texas, both alleviated key bottlenecks. We also invested $385 million in positive train control during 2014, bringing our cumulative PTC investment to $1.6 billion of the roughly $2 billion projected spend. ", "Assuming moderate economic growth, our overall 2015 capital plan will likely be higher than last year\u2019s spending. New capacity investments will continue in the eastern third of our network and we will advance quarter strategies and reduce bottlenecks across the system. Our core investment thesis will not waiver, which is to maintain a safe, strong, reliable network and to invest in service, growth, and productivity projects that meet our aggressive return thresholds. ", "To wrap up, as we start 2015 our investment strategy is to continue to move our service volume frontier up and to the right. As a result, we expect to generate record safety results on our way to an incident free environment. We expect to create opportunities through improved network performance, and to continue working with connecting railroads on key gateway interchange performance, and we\u2019ll invest in the resources and network capacity needed to overcome congestion and to handle increased demand. Leveraging volume growth and productivity gains to drive incremental operating ratio improvement. We will remain agile adapting and adjusting resources according to network performance and demand. ", "In fact, we\u2019ve already started to rebuild our surge plate moving around 100 older less efficient locomotives into storage and 400 or so employees into furlough or alternative work status. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable, and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert Knight ", "Let\u2019s start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue grew 9% to nearly $6.2 billion driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expenses totaled just under $3.8 billion, increasing 3% over last year. The net result was operating income growing 20% to about $2.4 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $71 million up from $37 million in 2013. Included in the $71 million was approximately $0.02 per share of onetime items including real estate gains.", "Interest expense of $146 million was up 15% compared to the previous year, primarily driven by increased debt issuance during the year. Income tax expense increased to $867 million driven primarily by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 22% versus 2013 while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce best ever quarterly earnings of $1.61 per share, up 27% versus last year. ", "Turning to our top line, freight revenue grew 9% to nearly $5.8 billion. This is driven primarily by volume growth of 6% and core pricing gains of 3%. Fuel surcharge revenue was about flat for the fourth quarter as the decline in fuel price was offset by the lag in fuel surcharge program and higher volumes. All in, we estimate the net impact of the reduced fuel prices add $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter versus last year. This includes both the surcharge lag and the lower diesel costs.", "Business mix was also about flat for the quarter as the positive mix impact from frac sand volume was offset by the increase in lower average revenue per unit intermodal shipments during the quarter. Other revenue increased 8% in the quarter. Primary drivers included revenue associated with the per diem on auto parts containers as well as subsidiary related volume growth. Recall that last January we began reporting per diem revenue on auto parts containers in other revenue as a result of a change in how we are compensated for this service, and as Eric just mentioned we\u2019ve now lapped that change on a year-over-year basis so we won\u2019t see a variance from the per diem going forward.", "Slide 22 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. Fourth quarter core pricing came in at 3% reflecting steady improvement throughout the year and a more favorable pricing environment. For the full year, core pricing was around 2.5% demonstrating our commitment to market pricing at reinvestable levels above inflation. While 2014 was a legacy light year, we do expect to see some benefit in 2015 for legacy renewals and I\u2019m pleased to announce we have successfully retained 100% of the legacy business that was up for renewal beginning in 2015. In addition, we have also successfully renegotiated a year early, the legacy business that was due to expire in 2016. With the exception of only a few small contracts in the out years, we have now successfully addressed all of our remaining legacy contracts.", "Moving onto the expense side, Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefit expense which increased 7% versus 2013. Higher volumes, inflation, and increased training expense were the primary drivers of the increase along with some increased cost associated with running a less than optimal network. ", "Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 4.5% when compared to 2013. At this point in time we plan to hire around 5,700 employees in 2015 to cover attrition of just under 4,000 as well as for volume growth and capital programs. As Lance just discussed, the bulk of this hiring will come in our TE&Y ranks. Labor inflation for 2015 is expected to come in between 4% and 5% for the full year. This is driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. ", "Turning to the next Slide, fuel expense totaled $813 million down 10% when compared to 2013. A 7% increase in gross ton miles was more than offset by lower diesel fuel prices in the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% while our average fuel price declined 14% to $2.66 per gallon. ", "Moving onto our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 14% to $665 million due to volume related contract and subsidiary expenses, higher locomotive and freight car material costs, and crew transportation and lodging expenses. Depreciation expense was $489 million up 7% compared to 2013 and in line with our 7% to 8% full year guidance. In 2015 depreciation expense is expected to increase between 4% to 6% for the full year. ", "Slide 26 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $296 million which is 5% favorable when compared to 2013. The favorability was primarily attributable to lower lease cost as a result of exercising purchase options on some of our leased equipment. Other expenses came in at $228 million up $40 million versus last year. Higher state and local taxes, personal injury expense, and damaged freight and equipment costs contributed to the year-over-year increase. Other expenses finished the year up 9% within the range of our full year guidance of 5% to 10%. For 2015 we expect the other expense line to again increase between 5% and 10% on a full year basis excluding any unusual items. ", "Turning to our operating ratio performance, we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 61.4% improving 3.6 points when compared to 2013. The net impact of lower fuel prices contributed about 1.5 points of the improvement. I am also pleased to report a full year operating ratio of 63.5% which is 2.6 points improvement from 2013. As you will recall from our investor day event this past November, we have issued new operating ratio guidance of a 60% operating ratio plus or minus on a full year basis by 2019. ", "Slide 28 provides a full summary of our 2014 earnings and a full year income statement. I\u2019ll walk through a few highlights from our record setting year. Operating revenue grew more than $2 billion to $24 billion. Operating income totaled almost $8.8 billion topping 2013 by 18% and net income was just under $5.2 billion while earnings grew 22% to $5.75 per share. ", "Turning now to our cash flow, in 2014 cash from operations increased to almost $7.4 billion, up 8% compared to 2013. After dividends our free cash flow totaled $1.5 billion for the year. This is down $581 million from 2013 reflecting primarily higher cash capital and dividend payments along with the headwind of bonus depreciation. ", "Taking a closer look at 2015, we will see the benefit of 2014 bonus depreciation which was passed just before year end. This benefit will nearly offset the cash tax payments associated with prior year programs. As a result, the net impact of bonus depreciation on this year\u2019s cash flow will be close to neutral. ", "Slide 30 shows our 2014 capital program of just under $4.1 billion. In 2015 we expect to increase our capital plans somewhat from \u201814s levels to approximately $4.3 billion pending final approval from our board of directors in February. The chart on the right shows our improvement in generating returns on these investments over the last several years. Return on invested capital was 16.2% in 2014 up 1.5 points from 2013. Of course, as we\u2019ve said many times, if you calculate it on a replacement basis, our returns would be significantly lower.", "In addition to funding our capital program our record profitability and strong cash generation enabled us to also significantly grow shareholder returns. We increased our quarterly dividend per share twice in 2014 to $0.50 per share by the fourth quarter, up 27% from the fourth quarter of 2013. For 2014 we achieved a declared payout ratio of just above 33% up from 31.5% in 2013 and consistent with our new guidance of growing dividend payout target to 35%. ", "We also continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchases. In the fourth quarter we bought back more than 7.7 million shares totaling $880 million. For the full year purchases exceeded 32 million shares and totaled about $3.2 billion, up 45% from 2013. Our current repurchase authorization of up to $120 million shares over a four year time period went into effect January 1, 2014. About 88 million shares remain on that authorization as of yearend 2014. When you combine dividend payments and share repurchases we returned almost $4.9 billion to our shareholders in 2014. These combined payments represented a 37% increase over 2013 continuing our strong commitment to increasing shareholder value. ", "Taking a look at the balance sheet we increased our adjusted debt by approximately $2.1 billion in 2014 bringing our adjusted debt balance to $14.9 billion at year end. This increases our adjusted debt to cap ratio to 41.3% up from 37.6% at yearend 2013. This puts us in line with our guidance of an adjusted debt to cap ratio in the low to mid 40% range. We also finished the year with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 and remain committed to our longer term guidance of an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 plus. ", "That\u2019s a recap of the fourth quarter and full year results. As we look ahead to 2015, we are well positioned to achieve yet another record year in many of our key financial measures. Solid core pricing, ongoing productivity initiatives, and volume leverage opportunities assuming the economy cooperates, should help drive continued margin improvement. As Eric highlighted earlier, we have growth opportunities across a variety of market sectors that should drive modest volume growth for the first quarter and the full year. ", "We\u2019ll continue to focus on improving returns and generating strong cash flow which will support our ongoing capital investments as well as our commitment to increasing returns to our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jack.", "John Koraleski ", "As you\u2019d expect with 2014 behind us, we\u2019re intently focused on the year ahead. Here\u2019s what it\u2019s looking like. Overall, the US economy continues to move forward at a moderate pace but of course, there\u2019s always some uncertainty out there. Clearly, one of the biggest uncertainties is the outlook for energy markets which will bring both challenges and opportunities as we move ahead. Lower energy prices could slow the recent [shale] related domestic energy boom depending on how low the prices get and how long they stay there.", "On the other hand, lower gasoline prices could spur continued auto sales and help strengthen the consumer economy which would create opportunities in our other market segments. On balance, with all the pluses and minuses taken together we expect to see positive volume growth for the 2015 year. We\u2019ll watch closely and stay agile so that we can meet our customer\u2019s needs across our diverse franchise. We\u2019ll also continue to build on the progress we\u2019ve made in improving our network capability so that we can provide the safe reliable service our customers expect and deserve.", "We\u2019re entering the year well-resourced and we\u2019re looking forward to safely providing efficient value added service for our customers and increasing returns for our shareholders in 2015. With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Allison Landry - Credit Suisse.", "Q - Allison Landry", "Thinking about frac sand in 2015 and the number of wells drilled is expected to be down somewhere in the 25% range and sort of offsetting that would be the better capitalized E&P companies high grading and improving productivity per well, if you sort of balance these factors do you think you can still grow frac sand carloads year-over-year? What scenario do you think volumes would outright contract?", "Eric Butler", "I think you have it exactly right where there are ins and outs in terms of there have already been reported probably about 20% rig reduction but the well capitalized companies are focused on continuing to drill where they could make their profit and there\u2019s a wide range of economics in all of the shales, so thinking of all those factors. Having said that, I think it really is too early to tell how all of that is going to play out. We certainly don\u2019t know if oil prices will remain this low. If oil prices increase certainly, that\u2019s going to be a lift for us so there are a lot of ins and outs. ", "We feel really, really good that we have the premier franchise in terms of kind of frac sand coverage. We have the best franchise for most of the major shales, particularly the shales that will arguably still be profitable the Eagle Ford, Permian, you can see growth in the Niobrara. There\u2019s even rumblings about the Haynesville coming back. We feel really, really good about our franchise and our position and at this point we, like everybody else, is keeping a close eye on it.", "Allison Landry", "Just as a follow up question, Jack some of your comments at the end I think, in terms of thinking about the broader economic benefit of lower oil prices sort of against the backdrop of weakness and shale related activity, how do we think about this in terms of overall volume growth? Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes but are you thinking about it sort of as like a net-net neutral sort of on a relative basis with benefits maybe in autos, consumer products, etc. and then that being offset by crude by rail, frac? Could you help us think about that?", "John Koraleski", "I think your heads in the right place on that. I think when you look at it, I think popular opinion says consumer drives two thirds of the economy. If consumers are having discretionary spending and they\u2019re going to buy automobiles, they\u2019re going to build houses, they\u2019re going to buy new furniture, consumer goods, those kinds of things, those kind of all hit right within the sweet spot of our franchise and we\u2019ve seen that in the fourth quarter, the construction products up 17%, lumber up 10%, automobile business the SAR at 16.7% so it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that knocking on the door of $17 million for 2015. ", "Again, when we add it all up pluses and minuses, we think at the end of the year barring anything that is unusual that we haven\u2019t seen at this point in time, we\u2019re going to still end up with positive volume by the time we get to the end of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Exeter [ph] - Bank of America.", "Ken Exeter [ph]", "Rob, when you set the operating ratio target fuel was much higher and you noted a 1.5 point benefit. Are there any other offsets that don\u2019t get you to move up that timeframe? I guess if you think about the 1.5 point benefit from the 63.5 along with the repricing that\u2019s already locked in what can happen in terms of - is there a chance you hit that target in 2015 or is there something there that can offset that?", "A - Robert Knight", "Clearly, this unprecedented fall off in fuel helped us and clearly, if it stayed at this level or dropped even further that would be a contributor towards achieving our targeted 60 plus or minus operating ratio target. But you know, we\u2019ll see how fuel plays out. I\u2019m not willing to bet that over the long haul fuel will stay where it is and the rest of the story if you will in terms of us running a safe efficient railroad getting core pricing, squeezing out productivity so I think what the drivers are really going to get back to is our core fundamentals in the business that will enable us to get to that sub 60 as soon as we possibly can.", "John Koraleski", "Ken said that 1.5 points came from fuel, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite right is it?", "Robert Knight", "Just to clarify that because I\u2019m not sure I did catch exactly how you asked it, but just to clarify the impact of fuel, the benefit of the failing fuel price in the fourth quarter was about 1.5 points of benefit in the fourth quarter. For the full year the benefit of the fuel was more like .7 of a helper on our operating ratio.", "Ken Exeter [ph]", "I was extrapolating that fourth quarter benefit through the year if we stayed at these lower prices. If I could just get a follow up. Eric, you mentioned low nat gas prices can impact, there\u2019s a lag before it impacts coal flows, can you maybe delve into that a little bit? Talk about maybe the outlook for coal, do we see one more quarter of replenishing stock piles and then starting in the second quarter we see a fall off with these prices or is it still kind of in that flux point even at these levels? In terms of PRB switching it seems like it\u2019s already impacted the Colorado Utah side? Maybe you can delve into that a little bit?", "Eric Butler", "We\u2019ve historically said and I think the market convention was kind of the switch over point was below the mid twos for natural gas pricing. The Colorado Utah impact was really an export coal world coal price impact, it\u2019s not a domestic US natural gas impact. As we look forward we\u2019re not really seeing a lot of switch over impact for us now. We are still seeing replenishment. As you suggested the inventory numbers for December should come out here in the next couple of days, we still expect that inventories are going to be low when they come out here in the next couple of days but the other - we\u2019ve said forever, the real driver is weather and the economy and so that will be the ultimate driver for our coal volumes. ", "We do feel really good about where we stand from a position - one of the strategic factors that I think may have changed from the past is that if you go a year ago and what happened with natural gas prices there was a lot of volatility and I think there\u2019s been rethinking on many of the utilities to really think coal as a base line fuel as a risk hedge against the natural gas volatility. For that reason I feel pretty good about our coal outlook.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Justin Long", "I wanted to ask a question about intermodal. I know this varies by lane, but when you look at the price differential between intermodal and your truck in your network today, what\u2019s the typical spread and how has that spread changed, if at all, over the course of the last couple of quarters as we\u2019ve seen fuel prices come down?", "Eric Butler", "I think we\u2019ve said historically that the spread can be pretty wide, as much as 25% to 30% in some lanes and it can be narrow, as low as 10%. I think the factors that we\u2019ve been talking about are still there or even growing. The factors being driver shortages, I think that is still a factor that is going to drive conversions. If you look at the experience that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve had another year of record domestic intermodal volumes. You can look at our fourth quarter volumes and we\u2019ve had new products and services. ", "Last year we talked a lot about the new services that we put in place. We opened Santa Teresa, so we\u2019re entering new markets. You still have driver shortages. Growth in domestic intermodal is still a sweet spot. There still is a gap there, but as we are selling out value our goal is to grow volume and close that gap.", "Justin Long", "Maybe just as a follow up to that, do you think that 2015 is a year where intermodal pricing mirrors contractual rate increases and truck load? I\u2019m just curious if this would be the best proxy, truck load rate increases or if there\u2019s a reason you think intermodal pricing should be any different than truck load this year?", "Eric Butler", "We still think we have strong opportunity to grow price in our intermodal book of business. If you look at what happened in \u201914 as demand increased on truck drivers, etc., some truck loads, some truck entities, have shorter term prices so they probably were able to respond quicker than entities that have longer term contractual arrangements, but we feel really good about our opportunity to price going forward. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Thomas Wadewitz - UBS.", "Thomas Wadewitz", "I wanted to ask a bit about legacy contract repricing. I think you highlighted that you were successful in retaining all that was coming due in 2015 and so that was good news, but also pulled forward what was in 2015. I think in the past you talked about - maybe it was a 2013 impact where you got like a 1.5 point boost to pricing, to core price, from legacy. Given the success on legacy in 2015 should we think of that as higher than the 1.5 point impact to core price? Is it more like two points or above that? How can you kind of frame that legacy impact to core pricing in 2015?", "Robert Knight", "What I\u2019ll tell you is it\u2019s a positive but we\u2019re not going to give the specific numbers on that as we never have in terms of our guidance. We\u2019re pleased with the business, we\u2019re pleased that we were able to compete and retain those contracts that we talked about for \u201915 and \u201916 and it will certainly be a positive contributor to our core pricing in 2015. ", "Thomas Wadewitz", "Is it reasonable to think it\u2019s maybe a bigger impact than 2013? ", "Robert Knight", "I\u2019m not going to answer that. The caution that you\u2019ve heard me say many, many times is that I wouldn\u2019t straight line past performance and overlay that on top of these contracts. When we report our pricing in the first quarter and beyond you\u2019ll see that embedded in the pricing numbers that we report but I\u2019m not going to give any more details on it.", "Thomas Wadewitz", "On a follow up question, the industry had capacity challenges in 2014. Your western competitor perhaps had greater challenges than others and I think it\u2019s fair to say you probably gained some volume as a result of that. How would you think about the impact of that to 2015 volumes? Their velocity seems to be improving. I think you said you believe that you\u2019re adequately resourced so is there some volume that goes back to them potentially? Should we assume your volume growth slows down because you don\u2019t gain share like you did, or how would we frame that potential impact from change in capacity and service performance of your competitor?", "Lance Fritz", "I think overall when you look at the business we were able to move in 2014 the table is set for us to prove the value proposition of Union Pacific versus our competition and our competitor has always been right there chomping at the bit so it\u2019s always a head-to-head competition in any one of those opportunities. Our challenge and our ability to convince those customers that the Union Pacific value proposition is what fits in their business model more effectively is really what we\u2019re all about here. Yes, we may lose some of that business, we may gain some additional business, we\u2019ll just have to see how the competitive world plays itself out in 2015.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs.", "Tom Kim", "I wanted to follow on Tom\u2019s earlier question on the legacy reprice. First off, can you just quantify the amount that was up for renewal for 2016 as you highlighted what was for 2016 previously?", "Robert Knight", "I would just call your attention to the last pie chart that we showed at investor day. The revenue that we reflected there, which is based on historical by the way it\u2019s not a projection of what those contracts are going to drive going forward, but we said there was about $300 million of revenue in the legacy bucket for 2015 and about $140 million in that bucket for 2016, so those are the buckets we\u2019re talking about here.", "Tom Kim", "Just the same in regard to the timing, should we factor this in sort of staggered over the course of the year, or is this sort of a January one effect? If you could just give us a little bit of sense in terms of how to be thinking about how that flows through it would be helpful?", "Robert Knight", "The bulk of that $300 million for this year was front end loaded so we should start getting it relatively early on that piece this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Group - Wolfe Research.", "Scott Group", "I actually had one more follow up on the legacy stuff. Rob, is there any way to put some color on historically how much of the benefit of a legacy deal was in the base rate and how much was just getting a fuel surcharge for the first time? Could that suggest that maybe the legacy benefit isn\u2019t as good as maybe it would have been now that oil is much lower? That\u2019s one question if you will.", "Robert Knight", "Fuel not only in the legacy contracts but in all of our contracts will obviously play a role in what we report in average revenue per car or per unit. But in terms of your question of can I give you some historical or shed some light on that, the answer to that is no. It was a combination of walking up the pricing on our historical legacy renewals, and as you know, rolling up or improving. It wasn\u2019t always a case of going from zero to adequate. In some cases there were fuel surcharge mechanisms in place in those old contracts, we were just able to look at them and make sure that they were adequate. I would say the same thing applies in this go around, but trying to quantify or give you a percentage split, I can\u2019t give you that.", "Scott Group", "Can you guys just give an update on what you\u2019re seeing at the west coast ports? What contingency plans you have in place in case there\u2019s a lock out and strike, and just how you\u2019re thinking about what the impact there could be?", "John Koraleski", "We\u2019ve been staying very close to the situation and working with our customers. Eric, why don\u2019t you talk about some of the things that we\u2019re doing and thinking about?", "Eric Butler", "I think you probably know that both sides did ask for federal mediation so that mediator was appointed I think, last week or so and they\u2019re going through the process. I don\u2019t think we have any unique knowledge of how that process is going. We\u2019re hopeful that the issue does get resolved. We had put a contingency plan in place in the event of a work stoppage and we\u2019ve communicated those to our customers in terms of the things that we will do to manage our network and do the best job we can of managing customer needs and expectations through a work stoppage. As Jack said, we\u2019re staying close to it. I\u2019m not sure we have any specific knowledge beyond the parties in a federal mediation that is going on.", "Scott Group", "Do you think just the uncertainty is going to have an impact on your volume or your ability to get price?", "Eric Butler", "The uncertainty has nothing to do with price, the price is driven by kind of the market opportunities and the value of our product and that still remains. Certainly, in the short term BCOs are doing what they need to do to protect their supply chain. That\u2019s expected, that\u2019s what has occurred at times in the past when similar labor issues have gone on in any port. We think going forward, that once the issues are resolved and they\u2019re behind, the whole supply chain effectiveness of the rail transportation network, our rail transportation network with the ports of Long Beach, LA, still is a premier way of getting products into this country.

We don\u2019t do that. What I would say, and if you refer back to some of the materials at the investor day, we did share that the majority of our franchise is destined in the Eagle Ford and Permian shale plays. I think we said about 60% of that, but we do have a great broad franchise in all the shale plays whether you want to look at Niobrara, Uinta, if you want to look at Marcellus, Haynesville, etc., we have a great franchise and so we think that does provide us a natural hedge for whatever the change is that the market and these low oil prices may bring.", "Rob [Zelman]", "Rob, switching directions over to the core pricing side of the equation, with the roughly $140 for 2016, will be experiencing step up in 2015 regarding that pricing or are you just kind of saying we\u2019ve already agreed to lock in the pricing which will commence in 2016?", "Robert Knight", "I\u2019m not going to get into the details of that particular renewal. We\u2019re confident with the business that we renewed. We like the pricing, we like the margins on it, but in terms of the timing I\u2019m not going to get into that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Eric, in the past you guys have quantified your exposure to the frac sand, the crude oil, and the pipe. Is there any way that you can just update investors right now with your aggregate volume exposure to those three segments?", "Eric Butler", "I think in the past, and I\u2019m checking the number, but I think in the past we\u2019ve probably said about 5% of our volume is related to that. I think that\u2019s about the number. Just to be clear you were asking in total what is our oil, frac sand market share percent of our volume and we\u2019ve said 4.5% all in. 2.5% from the sand the rest like, 1.5% from oil, and then the remainder is some of the materials, pipe, etc., just to kind of size our total.", "Brandon Oglenski", "I think Jack hit on it earlier, that you\u2019re seeing quite a bit of improvement in your construction markets so can you talk about - and I know this might be more difficult to quantify, but what\u2019s your exposure to non-res construction or even housing starts and how do you weigh that versus where you think construction projects were going into the energy markets, and does that become a net benefit for you going forward?", "Eric Butler", "I think what you\u2019re asking is geographically where are our markets. We\u2019ve shared before kind of the fastest growing states are kind of in the southwest and the west and then the southeast. Certainly, when you think about the south to the southwest and the west we have a great franchise exposure to those. Certainly, some of the growth has come from the energy related growth in Texas, particularly around the Houston market, but we\u2019re seeing good growth in our construction products in housing in non-Houston non-Texas markets also.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company.", "Jason Seidl", "You mentioned that there\u2019s probably going to be a little shift change between international and domestic intermodal, particularly in 1Q given what\u2019s going on in the ports. Can you remind us the impact that\u2019s going to have on your intermodal yields?", "A - Eric Butler", "We have not discussed what our yield are by our intermodal business. We are seeing positive trends in yields across our book of business whether it\u2019s domestic or international because of our strong pricing, and we expect that trend to continue.", "Jason Seidl", "I\u2019ll ask it a different way. Is there any big difference between the length of haul between domestic and international?", "Eric Butler", "There\u2019s not a significant difference in the length of hauls between those two. There\u2019s a minor difference because again, our domestic business runs east west from the west coast kind of to the Midwest Chicago and Midwest interchange and our international business runs over that same route. The minor difference would be the mix of our business that runs north south which would have a shorter length of haul.", "Jason Seidl", "Sort of related, as a follow up, I guess this may be a little bit more for Lance, but obviously the rail industry was challenged in \u201914 operationally, it impacted sort of everybody\u2019s bottom line. Can you talk about productivity gains assuming everyone shows a little bit of improvement this year in 2014, if we can put a number on it?", "Lance Fritz", "Without putting a number on it I\u2019ll remind you that as we discussed going through 2014 we said we were getting significant productivity and probably a little bit aberrational in that we would have liked to have more crews and locomotives to run the network. As we move into 2015 we expect to continue to get productivity. I would expect it maybe not to be quite as turbo charged as it was in 2014 because we\u2019ll now be matched in terms of resources to demand, but we will get productivity continuing in 2015.", "John Koraleski", "Especially when the cycle times improve we\u2019re able to pull locomotives out of - put them back in storage pull them out of service, those kinds of things. Those are the least productive units that we\u2019ll be storing so there is just some natural productivity occurs as velocity spools up. I think our latest numbers that we reported is a velocity of 25.3 and headed in the right direction so we feel good about that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Wetherby - Citigroup.", "Chris Wetherby", "Thinking about pricing for a second, if we put legacy aside and think about sort of the underlying potential of the business into 2015, it would appear that we\u2019re sort of getting a little bit of inflection more positively throughout the year of 2014. I just want to get a rough sense of how you think about that outlook for sort of everything ex legacy as we think about the next year? Sort of what you\u2019ve had the opportunity to touch and maybe what could be coming up?", "Eric Butler", "As we\u2019ve said throughout 2014 and as we\u2019re saying today, we feel good about our market value and our opportunity for pricing and we have a strong value proposition, the economy is strengthening and we\u2019re excited about our ability to get price going forward.", "John Koraleski", "We don\u2019t really see anything that\u2019s changing our view on our pricing model at this point in time. Reinvestability has to be the threshold to get onto the Union Pacific franchise, price to market, take advantage of opportunities across the franchises as we see them and we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s happened here recently that would cause us to veer from that at all.", "Chris Wetherby", "As a follow up, on the intermodal side just thinking about the international intermodal side with what\u2019s going on in the west coast ports and the sort of prolonged period of negotiations there, do you have any sense that some of the disruptions that you\u2019re seeing may ultimately be permanent or semi-permanent as shippers look for other alternatives? We\u2019ve talked about this before in the past and my guess is most likely business comes back once we get resolution but I just want to get a rough since maybe how we should be thinking about that. Do you hear that at all?", "Eric Butler", "I think you\u2019re exactly right. Certainly, any shipper in terms of while this uncertainty is here they\u2019re trying to identify options to protect their supply chain and you see that for example, right now with growth into Oakland or shippers trying to get into Oakland which is part of our franchise also. Long term the port of LA, Long Beach, is in a sweet spot in terms of the connectivity with the rail network, our network, our competitor network. Long term the expectation is once these things are behind that will be the preferred option for shippers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Vernon - Bernstein Research.", "David Vernon", "A couple on trying to get some help in modeling forward RPUs. As you think about the demand outlook, I think we\u2019ve talked about in terms of crude oil and frac sand, should we also be expecting that with reduced demand for sand or oil transportation there\u2019s also going to be an impact on the RPU or is the pricing going to be pretty well divorced from the supply/demand economics in the underlying commodity?", "Eric Butler", "As I\u2019ve said before, we still feel really good about our franchise, and our strength, and our value proposition. We still see upside opportunity to drive value and to drive price in that market. ", "David Vernon", "But say the price of frac sand goes down a lot, should we expect that the producer is going to eat that or there\u2019s going to be a little bit of pain shared between the producer and their transportation partner?", "Eric Butler", "We have never and we don\u2019t anticipate ever tying our value of our transportation products to commodity price values. ", "David Vernon", "Then maybe just as a quick follow up, as you think about the outlook as we talked about it maybe a little weaker depending on what oil prices do, maybe a little stronger on construction, as you think about that mix impact would you expect that the average RPU on the construction stuff that would be growing would be directionally better or worse than maybe some of the oil related stuff that\u2019s going to be coming down? I\u2019m not looking for specifics I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of directionally what impact that mix should be having on the result.", "John Koraleski", "I think overall when you look at it, it will depend on which market. So, if it\u2019s a manifest business, if it\u2019s a lumber business, things like that tend to have a somewhat longer haul than some of our frac sand. But you know, there are so many moving parts to this that it\u2019s pretty difficult for us to say what mix is going to come our way as we look ahead to the year.", "David Vernon", "Can you give us any insight into that directional sort of average construction unit versus the average crude and frac unit, higher or lower?", "Robert Knight", "The answer is no to your specific question. You\u2019ve heard me say many times that we avoid giving any guidance on average revenue per car and that\u2019s not a negative thing. I think what it says is the strength of the UP franchise is so diverse that we play in multiple markets and just because one piece of business has a lower average revenue per unit is not a bad thing, it might have a higher margin. That doesn\u2019t bother us when we see an average revenue per unit go up or down because it speaks to the diversity, it speaks to the mix. In every case we\u2019re focused on improving our margins. The other thing that\u2019s clearly going to impact average revenue per unit right now and potentially throughout the year is going to be the impact of fuel so you\u2019re going to see I think, some swings up or down but that in and of its self doesn\u2019t trouble us and we can\u2019t give guidance on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Greene - Morgan Stanley.", "William Greene", "Rob, I wanted to ask a question on the cost side and that is there\u2019s a sense that given the number of locomotives and employees that we\u2019ve added and embedded in the cost structure, if volumes disappoint us perhaps in the second half of the year or whatnot for whatever reason, that you\u2019ve embedded a kind of fixed nature into this cost structure. Can you speak to the variability of the cost structure, how much you could take out if you had to adjust because the markets turned against us in ways we don\u2019t expect?", "Robert Knight", "I would answer that by saying we\u2019re not projecting that. As you know, our guidance is positive volume for the year with all the moving parts. But to your point, I think we\u2019ve sort of proven over the years, when there are times when the economy goes south on us that we\u2019ve taken the right steps and Lance highlighted some of them in his talks, the furlough opportunities, the storage of the less efficient units. If you had to go deeper you\u2019ve got opportunities to consolidate terminal operations, etc., so without putting a number on it I would just tell you that that\u2019s something that we take pride in, in terms of being agile and being able to react to market conditions. ", "So as Lance pointed out in his comments, we feel like we\u2019re fully resourced right now with people and locomotives. We played catch up, if you will, through the back half of 2014 and we\u2019re confident that there\u2019s still opportunities to grow our business and we\u2019ve got attrition on the labor front still in front of us so we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll make the right steps should what you\u2019re outlining play out.", "William Greene", "Then Jack, I wanted to ask you more on the legislative front we\u2019ve seen that Senator Thune is potentially going to put forward the bill that he\u2019s talked about in the past. I don\u2019t know how much of the bill you\u2019ve seen but maybe you can speak a little bit to is this the sort of thing that you can work with them on? Is there something here that we could get out of this or is it all sort of bad news and we\u2019d rather keep the status quo as we have? Can you speak to any of that?", "John Koraleski", "I think Senator Thune has kind of opened the door to comments and working with the industry and asking us what we think about the provisions of the bill and things like that. We\u2019ve been able to provide some input. As always, we try to be a positive voice at the table and look at both the good opportunities as well as the challenges that each piece of legislation presents and I have no concern that we won\u2019t be able to do that again.

I\u2019m just wondering, the next two months are critical from a weather perspective, what specific steps are you taking - you talked about the loco adds, and the crew additions, and the headcount additions, but what do you see as the critical focal points of your service remediation improvement plans let\u2019s call it, in the first three to four months of the year as we look at a winter that so far has been benign?", "Lance Fritz", "Matt, one thing we\u2019ve done is learn from last years\u2019 experience during very difficult weather environments and we\u2019ve beefed up our winter action plans. That includes that at any sign of inclement weather 24/7 command centers locally that can make the right adjustments and calls on the ground. We\u2019ve taken advantage of this benign weather and done some engineering work on our track that is positioning us better for the spring thaw so I\u2019m very pleased with that. We\u2019ve also been working with our interchange partners at critical gateways like Chicago to put in early warning systems that are more robust and have more robust action plans around them and they\u2019ve actually kicked in at different points during this winter, during bitter cold periods, and proven to be very effective. I\u2019m really, really pleased with how we\u2019re navigating this winter notwithstanding that in certain parts of our territory been a more benign winter than last year.", "Matt Troy", "A follow up question would be just to clarify on the surcharge, there seems to be varying opinions out there in terms of the potential benefit of lower fuel costs if they were to remain down where they are currently. If oil stays kind of in this mid $40 range is it fair to think about, you had mentioned I think, something to about the tune of $0.05 of a benefit from lower fuel costs in 4Q, if I just look at the slope and the two month lag it would imply something similar, maybe $0.01 or $0.02 higher. Is that a fair assumption with fuel where it is and should we expect thereon if fuel stays down here at the same level that it becomes somewhat of a wash in second quarter and beyond? Just trying to think about kind of the benefit. I know it\u2019s a long run net/neutral but just timing is obviously an issue here, if you could help us there that would be great.", "Robert Knight", "Matt, under your assumption if fuel kind of stayed in the same neighborhood it is in the first quarter, I would expect that the first quarter looks similar to what we saw here in the first quarter or so and that\u2019s consistent with your thinking. Beyond that, there are 60 plus surcharge mechanisms and we\u2019re not guiding that fuel is going to stay flat forever, but we endeavor of course to keep the cost impact neutral so if it did just flatten out that would be certainly our objective.

We have a public/private partnership project on our primary corridor in and out of Chicago which is the Geneva Sub, to triple track a critical portion of that\u2019s shared with a metro service and that will be very, very helpful.", "We\u2019ve also announced a Hearne new network terminal in the middle of Texas and I think at the investor day we talked about a $600 million kind of number and a 25,000 daily car count kind of number and that will be very impactful, probably taking us the next two and a half years or so to build, maybe a little bit more.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "A question on intermodal, looking at the AAR velocity data it appears you maintained your intermodal velocity quite well even when overall velocity slowed a bit. I recognize that velocity is only one measure, but could you speak perhaps to your on time performance within intermodal? Is it where you want it or excluding new intermodal lane offerings is it still an area in which you expect a little improvement?", "Lance Fritz", "We do expect improvement in intermodal. If you look backwards I would not be as charitable in terms of our premium intermodal service in 2014 as you were. Our expectations were for better performance than that. We were able to differentiate the service compared to other services we provide. A real positive note is that in the peak season ending the year we performed very well and as we\u2019re entering this year that same level of performance has sustained. There are opportunities on certain lanes in our premium domestic intermodal franchise, but it is showing better service and I anticipate it will continue to show better service this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Denis Hartman] - Robert W. Baird.", "[Denis Hartman]", "Going back to the west coast issues, putting aside some of the labor disputes at the moment, how much conversation have you had with some of the international intermodal shippers that are more reluctant today than they have been in the past to allow some of their containers to free flow inland and more interested in doing trans loading activity to make sure the containers get back to Asia? Can you talk about any sort of conversations that you might be having that could affect international intermodal volumes in 2015 and presumably to the benefit of some trans loading in domestic intermodal activity?", "Eric Butler", "As you mentioned, that has been a trend going on for probably three to four years where international shippers are seeing a value proposition of letting their [ISO] boxes or international boxes to just destine on the west coast, trans load into a domestic box, and then go inland. So, that trend we have been seeing for probably three or four years. We think that that is a trend that will probably continue mainly because a lot of the BCOs as part of their supply chain organizations are using the trans loading function as part of their kind of distribution management strategy so it\u2019s less kind of a transportation driven issue but it\u2019s kind of their overall warehousing and distribution center management strategy. We think that is a trend, it will continue. I don\u2019t think that west coast labor issues have any particular significant long term change to that trend that has been going on for several years.", "[Denis Hartman]", "When we look at some of the expected weakness in international intermodal in 2015, we should subscribe it to the ongoing labor dispute and not an acceleration of that trans loading trend?", "Eric Butler", "That would be the assessment right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cleo Zagrean - Macquerie.", "Cleo Zagrean", "My first question is related to the impact of the recent volatility in the energy markets on your investment in business development. Please help us understand how you are thinking about it. Are you looking at winners and losers from an environment of sustained [load] prices? Are you expecting these to recover? For example, is the southern chemical franchise less of an urgency and consumer related areas more in focus? Please highlight a few areas that are gaining traction in business development for you this year?", "Eric Butler", "I\u2019m not quite sure exactly what the question is. I would say we are continuing a focus on business development. Energy, even with the recent volatility still I think, has some positive drivers for us in North America because we still have relatively low energy price and in fact, even lower energy prices than what we thought earlier. That is going to be a positive driver for things like chemicals production in this country. That\u2019s going to be a real positive driver in terms of continuing the trend that we\u2019ve seen or near sourcing. We\u2019ve talked in the past about trends of manufacturing moving back to North America. We think that\u2019s still - if anything, it\u2019s going to be even a more positive driver from some of the volatility so we still think that\u2019s positive.", "John Koraleski", "I think one of the things as we look at this and as we talk to our customers, first of all this is still a relatively early phenomena in terms of the dramatic reduction in oil prices that we\u2019ve seen. Nobody that I can find expects that this is going to be a long term trend and certainly no one at this point in time has made any decisions to alter long term capital, facility expansions, or things like that. I think it\u2019s just way too early to see if this is sustainable trend in energy prices.", "Cleo Zagrean", "My second question relates to operations, productivity specifically. Can you share with us a few operating initiatives that your team is most excited about this year so that apart from volume and price impact on the operating ratio we can get a sense of where you might gain the next important improvement in the OR?", "Lance Fritz", "One of the things that we talk about routinely that continues to be an exciting opportunity for us is the penetration of [indiscernible]. Our interpretation of lean manufacturing principles and Cameron and the operating team, in fact, the whole corporation is doing a wonderful job of absorbing those principals, turning them into projects and action plans and removing variability out of the network. I can see dozens of different projects at any given time that are going to be paying off either from a productivity perspective, a safety improvement perspective, or a service improvement perspective. That\u2019s the first thing I would highlight.", "The second thing I would highlight is we\u2019ve got a very robust menu of capital investment that is gaining significant traction as we enter this year and each one of those critical investments is going to make an improvement in safety, in service, and in productivity and unleash different bottlenecks around the network. I\u2019m just really, really jazzed with what we\u2019ve got facing us for the coming year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Engstrom - Stifel.", "John Engstrom", "I\u2019m looking at intermodal and I\u2019m trying to tease out the story which is a difference between competition with truck versus having low diesel prices versus a weaker tail season, things of that sort, also with a soft year on your baseline. Can you talk to me a bit about given your sequential decline in car loads how you think about what the primary drivers were behind that?", "Eric Butler", "You\u2019re talking about an intermodal sequential decline in car loads? What are you looking at?", "John Engstrom", "Yes, I\u2019m looking at the sequential decline between 3Q and 4Q just given the year-over-year comps are a little challenging given the winter in December last year. I\u2019m just trying to tease that story out.", "Eric Butler", "Again, the international side for our intermodal business, all of the west coast labor challenges through the fourth quarter, all of the uncertainty. The domestic side of our intermodal business with the new products and services and the road truck conversions, and the whole story about truck availability and all of that, we\u2019ve had a record year on the domestic side of the intermodal business.", "John Engstrom", "One follow up question on capacity. We talked a little bit about adding crews and locomotives as a primary lever behind velocity. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a bit about your cap ex investments in Fort Worth, Robertson County, opening up Santa Teresa and if you also see that increase capacity as being another lever which is sort of beneficial for you guys on velocity and there\u2019s a bit of a tradeoff moving forward?", "John Koraleski", "Absolutely, the investments that you outlined have helped us in terms of velocity and service performance. You take just a little snapshot like Fort Worth and Tower 55, we increased speed through that facility on both the north/south and east/west route. We increased capacity adding the ability to run an incremental 20 trains a day through the facility and we reduced the complexity of the facility itself and simplified it\u2019s signal systems which is a safety enhancement. One project that did all three and we\u2019ve been seeing the benefit of it and on that particular route that impacts our manifest product to and from the shale play, it impacts our premium intermodal product from the west coast to the southwest United States. You outlined it just right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets.", "John Barnes", "Just two quick ones. Number one, on the west coast issue if in the event that there is a more pronounced labor action and as much as a shutdown, how much will that impact service level immediately in terms of just equipment balances and then once normal operations resume how long does it normally take you to recover from those imbalances and get the intermodal network, the velocity there back up to normal levels?", "John Koraleski", "We have been monitoring it closely already taking steps storing equipment and staging them in critical locations so that if the next move takes place of a total shutdown we will embargo, we will lock down and not allow the congestion of the ports to impede on the velocity of the rest of our networks. We can\u2019t allow that to happen so we have plans in place to take those steps. We\u2019ve communicated with customers about our intent to do exactly that in the event of a total shutdown and I feel pretty well about our ability to stage and think about this so that if it does happen we will have positioned ourselves for a quick return once services have been restored to the ports? ", "John Barnes", "Secondly, the eastern rails have talked a little bit about that their coal franchise has become more surge dependent than base load dependent and therefore more dependent on heating days and cooling days. Where do you believe your coal franchise stands in that paradigm? Are you close to a point where it\u2019s more surge dependent or is the cost benefit still close enough that you\u2019re still seen as a vital piece of the base load in the western US?", "Eric Butler", "Coal remains a vital piece of the base load energy in the western US. It is a critical part of utility and manufacturing fuel source.", "Lance Fritz", "If you think about it, our coal business has been very dependent upon weather whether you have cold or hot summers and those kinds of things and so to that extent there is some surge component. But, I think the interesting thing that Eric talked about in his remarks is a realization that a coal base kind of helps cushion against the volatility of natural gas and I think that realization on the part of the utilities is making it a little more stable than what most people would think.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.", "John Koraleski", "Thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you again in April.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

[Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning, everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion, or $1.30 per share for the first quarter of 2015. This is a 9% increase in earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2014. Solid core pricing gains in the quarter were partially offset by a sharp drop in volume. While we took actions during the quarter to adjust for the volume decline, we did not run an efficient operation.", "Total first quarter volumes were down 2%, with particular softness in coal, industrial products and intermodal. Throughout last year, we worked to add the people, locomotives and capacity needed to meet a dramatic increase in demand. By the end of 2014, we had seen full-year volume growth of 7% and we were fully resourced to meet this demand. Over the last few months, however, volume has shifted negative. As a result, our operation is in catch-up mode and not as efficient as it should be.", "Managing a network is a constant balancing act to ensure you have the right resources in the right place at the right time. This balancing act becomes more difficult during significant volume swings. We're taking the steps to align our resources with current demand, while remaining agile in an ever-changing environment. We remain committed to safely providing excellent service for our customers while improving that service and our financial performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.", "Eric Butler", "Thanks, Lance and good morning. In the first quarter our volume was down 2%, driven by challenges in some key markets. Automotive and ag products volume grew with declines in coal, industrial products, intermodal and chemicals. Milder winter weather and natural gas prices drove softer coal demand, lower crude oil prices reduced demand for shale-related shipments and we also experienced the effects from the drawn-out west coast labor port dispute. I'll talk about more specifics as we walk through each group.", "Fuel surcharge revenue reduction negatively impacted average revenue per car and was a 4% head wind on freight revenue. However, solid pricing gains across our business led to a core price improvement of 4%, which combined with a 1% mix and drove average revenue per car up 1%. Overall freight revenue was down 1% as the strong pricing gains and mix were offset by lower volume and fuel surcharge revenue.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue increased by 3%, on a 3% volume increase and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain volume was down 2% this quarter. We continue to see strong demand for overseas export feed grain shipments, particularly through the Gulf and Mississippi River. Those gains were offset primarily by declines in wheat exports and to a lesser degree, softer demand for domestic feed grain.", "Grain products volume was up 4% for the quarter. Ethanol volume grew 7%, driven by increased gasoline consumption and export demand. We also saw increased export demand for soybean meal and a strong canola crop drove increases in canola meal shipments. Food and refrigerated shipments were up 3%, driven primarily by continued strength in import beer, partially offset by slightly lower refrigerated food shipments.", "Automotive revenue was up 6% in the first quarter on a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by a 1% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 11% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand and reduced impact from winter weather. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 16.6 million vehicles in the first quarter, up 6.4% from the same quarter in 2014. Auto parts volume grew 3% this quarter, driven primarily by increased vehicle production.", "Chemicals revenue was flat for the quarter, with a 2% improvement in average revenue per car offsetting a 1% volume decline. Plastics shipments were up 8% in the first quarter, as stability in resin prices resulted in improved buyer confidence in the market. Strength in fertilizer demand this quarter drove volume up 10%. The slight delay in last fall's harvest pushed some application into the first quarter of this year. We also saw strength in export markets, particularly to China. Finally, lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continue to impact our crude oil shipments, which were down 38% for the first quarter.", "Coal revenue declined 5% in the first quarter. Volumes were down 7%, partially offset by a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 1% for the quarter. We experienced a very mild winter this year, which combined with low natural gas prices to reduce demand for coal. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 32% for the quarter, as a mild winter and low natural gas prices drove receiving utilities to switch to other fuel sources. Colorado Utah tonnage was also impacted by soft demand for coal exports.", "Industrial products revenue was up 1%, as a 3% decline in volume was offset by a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. We continue to see strength in construction products, where volume was up 4% for the first quarter. Demand for rock was strong in the quarter, particularly in the southern part of our franchise. Metals volume was down 17%, as lower crude oil prices significantly reduced new drilling activity. In addition, the strong U.S. dollar drove increased imports, which reduced demand from domestic steel producers. Our government and waste shipments declined 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by a temporary reduction in short-haul waste shipments.", "As a side note, our minerals business was not a key driver in industrial products this quarter; but I wanted to mention the fact that our frack sand volume was up 3%. Demand remains strong in January, but tailed off significantly in March. I will talk more about our outlook in a moment.", "Turning to intermodal, revenue was down 5%, driven by a 3% decrease in both volume and average revenue per unit. Due to the structure of intermodal fuel surcharge programs, there was a greater average revenue per unit impact to intermodal this quarter than seen in other commodities. Domestic shipments grew 9% in the first quarter, setting an all-time first-quarter record for volume. We continued to see strong demand from highway conversions and for our new premium services.", "International intermodal volume was down 12%, driven by the west coast port labor dispute, which stretched late into the quarter. We're encouraged that the parties have come to a tentative agreement and we're working with our customers to reduce the backlog and return to normal.", "Let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In ag products, we expect grain volume to return to normal seasonal patterns through the third quarter and we anticipate exports will favor shorter-haul shipment to the Gulf and river in the near-term. As always, we're keeping a close eye on planning reports and the weather to determine what the next crop will look like. In grain products, we think the ethanol market will remain strong and DDGs will remain steady throughout the year. Finally, we anticipate continued strength in our import beer business and we see potential upside in refrigerated shipments.", "In automotive, finished vehicles and auto shipments should continue to benefit from strength in sales, driven by a healthy U.S. economy, replacement demand and lower gasoline prices. Coal volume will largely be dependent on the weather this summer and natural gas prices. If natural gas prices remain in the current range, it will be a head wind throughout the year. Also, the latest inventory figures show that stockpiles are significantly up from last year and are now above the five-year historical average, which will likely lead to continued softness.", "We think most of our chemicals markets will remain solid this year, though we expect that crude oil prices will remain a significant head wind for crude by rail shipments for the rest of the year. Lower crude oil prices will also impact some of our industrial products markets. We expect metals to continue to experience head winds, as capital investments for new drilling activities are reduced. As I mentioned earlier, frack sand shipments were up modestly in the first quarter, but we expect to be meaningfully lower year over year, starting in the second quarter, as demand softens and we come up against tougher comps.", "On the positive side, we think continued strength in the construction and housing market should drive growth in aggregates and lumber. Finally, we anticipate strong demand for domestic intermodal to continue throughout the year, primarily from highway conversions. For international intermodal, we expect a backlog recovery to continue for the next few weeks, then return to normal seasonal patterns for the remainder of the year. Both domestic and international intermodal should benefit from the strength in consumer demand in the U.S..", "To wrap up, we're experiencing some volume head winds created by uncertainty in the coal market and crude oil prices, but we see opportunities in other markets. While top-line revenue will be impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue, we expect solid core pricing gains for the year. As always, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will support new business development efforts throughout the year. With that, I will turn it over to Cameron.", "Cameron Scott", "Thanks, Eric and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance, which is the foundation of our operations. The first quarter 2015 reportable personal injury rate improved 23% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.85%. These results are a validation that our comprehensive safety strategy is working and we're focused on the right things. I am very proud of the team's commitment to find and address risk in the work place.", "In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 6% to 3.16. To make improvement going forward, we continue to focus on enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment to help reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet regulatory reportable thresholds.", "In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 27% versus 2014 to a first-quarter record mark of 1.88. Our strategy of reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns is generating results and we will continue our focus in these areas to drive further improvement. In summary, the team has made a nice step function improvement in several areas that is generating results on our way towards an incident-free environment.", "Moving to network performance, as we discussed, we worked hard in 2014 to match network resources with the robust volume levels of 2014. During the latter part of the fourth quarter, our available resources were largely aligned with demand, helping generate the sequential velocity improvement in the network. While we have largely held those velocity levels made in December, we still have more work to do as we exit the first quarter that provided more favorable weather conditions, but one that also saw more extensive track renewal programs on key corridors.", "While our velocity in the first quarter was almost one mile an hour faster than the first quarter of 2014, our service performance still fell short. As reported to the AAR, first-quarter velocity and freight car dwell were about flat when compared to the first quarter of 2014. However, the team continues a relentless push to improve service and reduce costs. While productivity was not where we wanted it to be, we did generate some efficiencies, even with the decline in volumes during the first quarter. We achieved record train lengths in nearly all major categories, including in automotive, where we leveraged an 11% increase in finished vehicle shipments, with a 5% increase in average auto train length.", "Our terminal productivity initiatives also continue to generate positive results, as car switch per employee day increased 3%. But our sub-optimal services performance and timing issues with readjusting resources lead to inefficiencies during the quarter. One example of this is locomotive productivity, as measured by gross ton miles per horsepower day, which was down 6% versus 2014.", "As for our efforts to readjust resources, while we chase volume up -- while we chased volume on the way up last year, it's been a different story in the first part of 2015, with some softer volumes we have seen thus far. To balance our resources to current demand, we have placed around 500 TE&Y employees into furlough or alternative work status. We have also reduced our original TE&Y hiring plan downward by 400 and are now planning to hire around 2,400 TE&Y employees for the year. Of course, we will continue to monitor and adjust our work force levels and hiring plans throughout the year as volume dictates.", "The same process is under way with our locomotives. By the end of the quarter, we had already moved 475 units back into storage and continue to look at every opportunity to further reduce our active fleet. Also, our planned acquisition of 218 units this year will further improve our overall reliability and efficiency. We have experienced a timing lag in getting our resources aligned with demand, but we're intently focused on balancing our resources and reducing our costs as the year progresses.", "We're also adjusting our 2015 capital program down $100 million to approximately $4.2 billion. We will continue to invest to improve the safety and resiliency of the network, including more than $1.8 billion in infrastructure replacement programs. Our capital program also includes continued investment for service, growth and productivity, which are primarily concentrated on the southern region of our network; but which also include corridor strategies that reduce bottlenecks across the system.", "This reduction does not impact our core investment strategy, which is to maintain a safe, strong and resilient network and to invest in service growth and productivity projects where returns can justify the investment.", "I would also like to give a quick update on positive train control. As most of you know, the rail industry has been required to install PTC by the end of 2015. The required development and testing of this new technology has been challenging. Nonetheless, we have been moving forward, investing approximately $1.7 billion thus far to complete the mandate. Now that the scope of the project has been better defined, we've updated our total project investment in PTC to approximately $2.5 billion.", "Although UP will not meet the current 2015 deadline, we have been making good faith effort to do so, including field testing since October 2013. The industry has been working to extend the deadline and I think there is general understanding on Capitol Hill that this has to happen. While we remain hopeful that an extension will be passed, our overall investment in the program will not be contingent on the deadline.", "To wrap up, as we continue on in 2015, we expect to continue generating record safety results on our way to an incident-free environment. We expect to leverage the strengths of our franchise to improved network performance. We will invest in the resources and network capacity needed to overcome congestion and generate productivity gains; and we will remain agile, balancing and adjusting resources depending upon demand to drive improved cost performance. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Rob Knight", "Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of first-quarter results. Operating revenue was flat with last year at just over $5.6 billion. Strong core pricing was offset by declines in fuel surcharge revenue and total volumes. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.6 billion, decreasing 4% when compared to last year. The net result was operating income growing 7% to about $2 billion.", "Below the line, other income totaled $26 million, down from $38 million in 2014. Interest expense of $148 million was up 11% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2014 and at the beginning of 2015. Income tax expense increased to $704 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income grew 6% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share, up 9% versus last year.", "Now turning to our top line, freight revenue of about $5.3 billion was down 1% versus last year. In addition to a 2% volume decline, fuel surcharge revenue was down about $200 million when compared to 2014. The decline in fuel price was partially offset by the positive lag in the fuel surcharge programs.", "All in, we estimate the net impact of reduced fuel prices added about $0.08 to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. This includes both the fuel surcharge lag and lower diesel costs. In the second quarter, we expect the net earnings impact of reduced fuel prices to be closer to neutral.", "Business mix was slightly positive for the quarter, driven by a decline in lower average revenue per car international intermodal shipments. Looking ahead, given the volume shifts between our commodity groups, business mix is likely to have a negative impact on freight revenue's beginning in the second quarter.", "Slide 23 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. First quarter core pricing came in at 4%, reflecting a more favorable pricing environment in 2015. This represents a full point to sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. Of this, about 0.5% reflects the benefit of legacy business that we renewed earlier this year. This includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy contract renewals.", "Moving on to the expense side, Slide 24 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 9% versus 2014. Lower volumes were more than offset by labor inflation, increased training expense and lower productivity. Looking at our total work force levels, our employee count was up 6% when compared to 2014. About a quarter of this increase was in our capital-related work force.", "As Cam just discussed, we're adjusting our total hiring downward to better balance our resources. The largest hiring area will continue to be in the TE&Y ranks. In total, when you factor in attrition, training, furloughs and volume levels, we expect our net overall work force levels to be around 48,000 by year end, about flat with year-end 2014.", "Labor inflation was about 6% for the first quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation and will likely continue to be in the 6% range for the second quarter, as well. Keep in mind that the first and second quarters include the 3% agreement wage increase effective the first of this year, on top of 3.5% wage increase from last July. For the full year, we still expect labor inflation to be about 5%, including pension.", "Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $564 million, down 39% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 1% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1%, while our average fuel price declined 38% to $1.95 per gallon.", "Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $643 million. Increased locomotive and freight car material costs were the primary drivers. Depreciation expense was $490 million, up 6% compared to 2014. We expect depreciation expense to increase about 6% for the full year.", "Slide 27 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $311 million, which is flat when compared to 2014. Other expenses came in at $259 million, up $33 million versus last year. Higher state and local taxes and casualty costs contributed to the year-over-year increase. For 2015, we still expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% on a full-year basis, excluding any unusual items.", "Turning to our operating ratio performance, we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 64.8%, improving 2.3 points when compared to 2014. Our operating ratio benefited about three points from lower fuel prices, including the fuel surcharge lag. Keep in mind, however, we also lost the revenue benefit from our energy-related volumes as energy prices declined.", "Turning now to our cash flow, in the first quarter, cash from operations increased to just under $2.1 billion. This is up 17% compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher earnings and the timing of cash tax payments. We also invested about $1.1 billion this quarter in cash capital investments. As Cameron just noted, we now intend to spend about $4.2 billion in capital for the full year, down about $100 million from our previous estimate.", "Given the sharp decline in fuel surcharge revenue, capital spending well likely be greater than the 17% of revenue this year. Longer term, however, we still expect capital spending to be about 16% to 17% of revenue, assuming of course that fuel returns to somewhat higher levels.", "One housekeeping item to note on the cash flow statement. As you know, in the first quarter we changed the timing of our quarterly dividend payments so that the cash outlay occurs in the quarter for which the dividend is declared. As a result, we had two dividend payments during the quarter -- one for the fourth quarter of 2014 and one for the first quarter of this year. This is the only time we will see this, this year.", "Together, these payments totaled about $922 million. We also increased our first-quarter dividend by 10%. This is in line with our commitment to grow the dividend payout target to 35%. Taking a look at the balance sheet, our adjusted debt balance grew to $15.6 billion at quarter end, up from $14.9 billion at year end. This takes our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio to 42.6%, up from 41.3% at year-end 2014. We remain committed to an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio in the low to mid- 40% range and an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.5 plus. We feel our current cash outlook positions us well to execute on our cash allocation strategy.", "Our profitability and strong cash generation enable us to continue to fund our strong capital program and to grow shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we bought back about 6.9 million shares, totaling $807 million. Between the first-quarter dividend and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders in the quarter. This represents roughly a 23% increase over 2014, demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.", "That's a recap of the first-quarter results. As we look towards the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are a number of factors that we'll be watching very closely. On the revenue side, we expect a favorable pricing environment to continue, supported by improving service and our strong value proposition. We remain committed to solid core pricing above inflation.", "As for volume, the outlook is a little more uncertain. The recent challenges that we've seen in coal and in the shale-related markets are likely to continue. At this point, we think coal volumes in the second quarter could be down in the mid-single-digit range versus 2014, with ongoing softness throughout most of the year, as Eric discussed earlier.", "For the year, strength in other areas could offset these headwinds, depending on what happens to the drivers, ranging from consumer spending to the size of the 2015 grain harvest. Of course, as I previously noted, the volume mix shifts could also have a negative revenue impact. We will just have to see how it all plays out this year.", "From the cost perspective, the second quarter will likely still reflect some impacts of operating inefficiencies, although as Cameron noted, we will see gradual improvement in productivity over time. As I mentioned earlier, if fuel prices stay close to where they are today, the net impact on earnings should be neutral for the remaining quarters of the year. Taken together, we have our work cut out for us again in 2015, but we will continue our unrelenting focus on safety, service and shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thanks, Rob. As you've heard from the team, we've had some challenges to start off the year; but we're taking the steps needed to work through those challenges and realize the opportunities we see ahead. As Eric mentioned, weakness in our coal and shale-related markets could persist for some time; but we continue to see gradual improvement in the underlying economy, which should be a positive for other parts of our business.", "When you consider other wild cards, from the next grain harvest to the strength of the U.S. dollar, it all adds up to a dynamic environment. That's the nature of our business. Our goal is to provide our customers with excellent service wherever the need arises. We expect to see solid improvement in network performance and cost efficiency over the coming months. As we leverage the strengths of our diverse franchise, we continue to be intently focused on safety, service and shareholder returns.", "Now let's open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. ", "Tom Wadewitz", "First I wanted to ask you on coal, it seems like the macro backdrop's pretty challenging. You acknowledge that -- particularly, low natural gas prices. But I'm wondering, your mid-single-digit decline seems somewhat optimistic versus the trend we have seen recently. There's been more like, I don't know, down 10%, 15%. What is it that leads you to say mid-single-digit instead of worse and how much visibility do you have to that?", "Lance Fritz", "Eric, do you want to take care of that?", "Eric Butler", "Yes. As you know, Tom, a lot of factors go into play, as there was a relatively mild winter, a narrow serving territory of our utilities. The heating days were down 5% to 10% versus last year. We're assuming more normal weather patterns for the balance of the year. That clearly is a factor. The other factor, as you know, is this is typically the shelf months. We see this every year where you don't really have heating or cooling during the spring. Again, we're assuming we're going to get back to normal, seasonal weather patterns. As we mentioned, natural gas prices -- what happens with that will have an impact. A lot of factors, but that's our best assessment at this time.", "Tom Wadewitz", "The second or the follow-up question on the resource levels, you indicated a number of times that inefficiency, or let's say a time lag in resource production versus volume. How do we think about how that will play through in second quarter? Do you catch up pretty quickly and see reduction in resources? Do you expect train speed to improve? How do you think that plays out in terms of the margin performance? Does that really kick in and support margin improvement, or is that something where the revenue head wind is more the dominant factor in terms of, again, looking how that affects the OR or the margin performance?", "Lance Fritz", "Sure, Tom. Thinking about the time lag. We talked to you all last year about trying to catch up with the volume. Then in the fourth quarter, we indicated we had finally caught up and were fully resourced. Then coming into the first quarter of this year, volume shifted what I would consider fairly dramatically to be negative, ending up 2% down. It's really all about being caught in a rip tide, being behind the curve in terms of getting our resources right-sized.", "When we look forward into the second quarter, we have indicated that we're anticipating better service and better efficiency. We haven't put a stake in the ground and said exactly how that happens, but we anticipate -- and I see it happening right now on the network -- we anticipate continuous improvement as Cameron and his team get the business right-sized. Rob or Cam, any additional comments?", "Eric Butler", "I would add to that list them. We're always focused on improving the margins. As Lance pointed out, we're focused on continually spruce bit on the cause the balancing the network. We will have challenges as I pointed out of the mix yet we anticipate taking hold in second quarter and beyond. Even with all of that activity, we're always going to be focused on improving are margins of where we're today.", "Operator", "Next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. ", "David Vernon", "First question on the top-line. If you think about the range of potential downside on the frac business, have you guys try to look into that at all as far as how much demand maybe down as we get into second quarter?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes so a lot of things can change that or drive that, as you know, particularly, coal prices. We look at the outlook right now. We see a mid- teens kind of a range. We see our business to look more like '13 volumes than '14 volumes.", "David Vernon", "Okay and then maybe a quick follow-up, the core pricing gains of 4%, I think, Rob call you mentioned inflation is going to be on the labor side, unusually high this year because of the new labor agreement. How do we think about that in terms of your expectation about pricing above inflation? Are you expecting more productivity for back half of this year? How do we think about the pricing inflation relationship? Or do we think that pricing that he gets better in the 2nd and 3rd quarter as reported?", "Lance Fritz", "David, just to [indiscernible] question, we have been consistent and clear that when we're pricing in the marketplace we're pricing for our value proposition. Whatever either Eric or Rob want to comment on, it's in that context, our pricing in the marketplace is our volume.", "Lance Fritz", "I want to say, David, long-term view is pricing above in place in. Not necessarily core pricing [indiscernible] to inflation and we expect higher labor inflation. Overall, for the year, expect overall company inflation to be in the 3%, 4% range. That gives you a guiding light in spite of the challenges we know we're going to face on the labor line. Overall, companywide we think about 3% copper% rate for the year.", "David Vernon", "The 4% includes the legacy reprice, right?", "Lance Fritz", "To make the first quarter does include legacy for pricing, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.", "Rob Salmon", "As a clarification to David's last question in you're prepared remarks, Rob. You had indicated that the core pricing accelerated to 4% in the first quarter. I think you had mentioned that roughly half of that was attributable to legacy. Was that half of the step up from three to four or just half of the four in aggregate?", "Rob Knight", "Let me clarify that. Of the 4% core pricing reported in first quarter one-half of a point of that. 3.5% to 4%. .5% was attributable to the legacy renewals.", "Rob Salmon", "I appreciate the clarification. Kind of taking a step back to going back to investor day, toward the end of 2014, you had indicated that your longer-term full-year volume outlook is positive. I guess given the drop-off that we have seen in terms of shale-related business and coal challenges you indicated, as well as uncertainty in terms of [indiscernible] you still have confidence that the volume growth in aggregate will be positive or do you see that a little bit more challenging as we look out from here?", "Lance Fritz", "I will let Rob answer that in a little more in detail but, the thing that we think about is the beauty of our franchise, the strength of our franchise and all of the opportunity that it represents. We've have got a diverse book of business and over time we have seen that there are always areas where we can develop more business and grow. And so we feel still quite bullish about in the long term being able to grow based on this great franchise.", "Rob Knight", "Lance, I would add your comment caught we know we have some challenges right now but if you look at the UP franchise, it's a fabulous franchise that has great optimism long-term. . inventories are high right now, gas prices are low, energy prices are low which is impacting our frac business.", "All of those are going to balance out over the long-term. You add-on top of that what's happening in the chemical franchise, the opportunities still in front of us longer-term with the investments being laid in the Gulf. You look at Mexico franchise and we're the only rebel that interchanges at the six border crossing and look at all of the opportunities taking place there. You look at our strong auto franchise. You add it all up. The diversity of our business mix and strength of our franchise caught long-term supervised a stronger optimism which is why we make think longer-term expectation still is volume will be on positive side of the ledger.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Bill Greene", "Rob can I ask you to put, maybe if you can little bit finer point on some of the challenges on the cost side in the first quarter? I think, last year, the sort of estimated we had about a $35 million headwind from the weather.", "Can you estimate what the headwind is from some of the inefficiencies that occurred in the network this quarter?", "Rob Knight", "Bill, you are right. Last year we pulled in about $35 million of a deficiency tied too significant weather events, primarily in Chicago area. This year clearly our cost performance in the first quarter is not we would like it to be. If you take fuel off of the table, our costs were about to enter billion dollars up year-over-year. It's a combination of things that we all had talked about this morning. We had some timing issues. We've resourced for unexpected coming into the quarter higher level of volume.", "We had some mechanical activities that we took on that I would categorize as timing. And then as we pointed out with had inefficiencies in the network. Without putting a splitting hairs in terms of where those dollars are, we think they are all there for us to right-size the network. If you look at what you would have expected if you are running optimally and had you had things timed up a little bit better, you probably had a negative in the quarter of about 122-point in operating ratio. That's how I would look at it.", "Bill Greene", "Okay and then your point about second quarter is it will still take some time for the network to get to the operating efficiencies that you want. Maybe it will be less than the first quarter impact but still meaningful. Is that what you were trying to communicate?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes and, Cameron, why don't you walk us through a little bit about the activities that are underway to get these things right-size and get your--", "Cameron Scott", "We still have work to do that we think we can eventually right-size the network in the second quarter. As Rob mentioned, we do think there was some inefficiencies throughout the quarter but the rightsizing of our locomotive fleet, weekly we review opportunities to store additional locomotives and several times a month we're also rightsizing our hiring plans as we look out for the remainder of the year.", "Bill Greene", "Okay. Rob, let me ask you one last wish into that here. Just on share buybacks, how opportunistic can you be or is the first quarter run rate kind of what we should expect? I mean, if the shares are down a fair amount can you wrap this up? Do you feel you would rather have a BA consistent buyback each quarter?", "Rob Knight", "As you know, our approach has always then and we'll continue to be opportunistic in the marketplace. We don't have a set number of dollars or shares we will buyback inning in any quarter but I will assure you will continue to be opportunistic as we move forward. The current price is frankly an opportunity for us.", "Operator", "Our next questions is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Lance, in context, your 1st quarter wasn't that bad. Earnings were up 9% even with all of the challenges you had and yet it sounded like the tone from everyone on the call here is that we're not too happy with that. Obviously, we could have done better. It did miss Wall Street expectations here and I think over the long run, you guys have them better at staying at expectations relative to some of the other stocks in the space. I think investors have reported your company for that. As I hear it from some of the questions and the answers here, it sounds like we still have crossed challenges. ", "We're catching up for new volume reality. We don't know energy and coal markets are going to shake out. As your content more difficult on earnings growth this year, consistent reps a plop in 2015. Is a getting more challenging to see double-digit growth this year? I know you don't want to explicitly guy but can you help folks on this call understand where these year could shakeout?", "Lance Fritz", "Sure, Brandon and you're exactly right. We're not going to speak specifically about what to expect from the year from percentage perspective. I think you've got the tone pretty well right.", "When I look at the first quarter, I am proud of the hard work that the team did in terms of trying to get the cost suggested to the volume reality. I'm disappointed that we couldn't have done better because we, here at the table, see the opportunity of what the franchise really has the ability to deliver. Having said that, I am confident as I look forward that are operating team and all of the teams are focused on doing the right thing.", "As we look forward, we're adjusting to current volumes at the same time as we're trying to determine what this peak season and looked like and what the growth rate look like from here. I will tell you, there is no change in my confidence both this year and over the long run of being able to generate out of this wonderful business, this beautiful franchise, the kind of financial performance and return generation that you have seen historically. As we have said before, it gets more difficult from 65% or 64%, 63% operating ratio, but we remain absolutely confident it's there, we will realize it and continue to realize it.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Could you maybe talk a little bit more explicitly about some of the drivers of margin improvement this year outside of the benefit from the fuel surcharge? It seems like you do have a bit of compensation benefit headwind given the wage increases. Obviously, if volume could come in flat or maybe even negative for the year given some of the uncertainty, what's the ability to drive leverage in the business then?", "Lance Fritz", "So Brandon, I think Rob and the team have outlined a core portion of that this morning which is, as we look forward as Eric said, we're in an environment where pricing, core pricing gains looks good. Cameron and team are working on rightsizing the business and generating efficiencies through the UP way and taking variable out of the network and looking for all other opportunities to generate margin improvement. Rob, anything else you want too at?", "Rob Knight", "I would just remind you that it's the same levers that have got us from where we were many years ago to where we're today. While volume is our friend how we don't use it as an excuse. You saw us perform well in years when volume did not play to our benefit. We know we have some challenges here with volumes. We've got challenges with mix as I called out but we're going to continue to be relentlessly focused on cost control and cost management, as Lance and Cameron have outlined. As Eric talked about, pricing's note key driver. We improved by the proposition and marketplace and pricing will continue to be a strong driver of that. To get to are longer-term widens of a 60 plus or minus operating ratio by full-year 2019, it's going to take those same efforts and same focus from the organization that we're going to continue to focus on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Wetherbee", "I just want to try to understand a little bit better about sort of what the outlook was internally as you guys thought about 2015 and in particular the volume opportunity. I know you were looking for any positive volumes for the full-year and that was rolled in question, we have had tough comps sort of understood coming up in that next quarters. As you're trying to adjust to volume environment, I'm trying to understand where your heads were at coming into this year versus where we're now. It seems maybe a little bit bigger of a change than anticipated. And what to make sure I understand that.", "Lance Fritz", "Chris, we don't specifically address what our budgets are forecast coming into the year. What I will say is the big change is actual growth and then actual decline. The biggest change there was coal which was somewhat surprising in terms of how weak it turned out quickly. Of course we had difficulty with the West coast ports and labor dispute. We have pretty good visibility to that. Looking forward, Eric, why don't you talk to us about what your markets look like as you look into the future.", "Rob Knight", "Yes, I think what Lance said is accurate. The big swing, especially first quarter, we talked about the international intermodal West coast port labor dispute and we think will kind of normalized throughout the year but the big swing factor is coal. As you know, Chris, as you go back really probably four months, oil price outlook for the year was still up in the 90s and is now in the 50s. Of course, that had a swing factor that is impacting broad swaps of the market also.", "Chris Wetherbee", "I guess that certainly makes sense. Maybe sticking on that coal question and maybe one for you, Eric, in terms of mid- single digit outlook in the second quarter that you are thinking about Colorado Utah underperformed pretty meaningfully relative to PRB in the first quarter. Is that inherit in the second quarter outlook would you expect PRB to soften a bit on comps and then you still have weakness in Colorado Utah? I'm just trying to get a rough sense of how you think about coal?", "Lance Fritz", "The mid- single-digit assumes a continued profile with Colorado Utah Copper to get her to come because we're not expecting export markets to pick up significantly this year.", "Chris Wetherbee", "So will be roughly more performance we have seen?", "Lance Fritz", "Thereabouts caught driven, again, by weather and natural gas prices.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Group", "Rob, I wanted to ask you about some of the yield drivers in terms of how much of a negative to you think makes could be in the second quarter? And then on the pricing, the 50 basis points from the legacy pricing, maybe is a little lower than would have expected. Wondering if that's a timing issue and that Rams or is this the volumes are down which limits the impact of the legacy repricing and it's going to stay about 50 basis points the rest of the year?", "Rob Knight", "Yes let me address the mix comment. As you know, we don't give specific guidance around mix because there's come again , beauty of our franchise is we have a lot of diverse business opportunities. As a result, not common to have a fair amount of mix. We're highlighting that given the change anticipated in both the coal and fracking environment. And continued strength in our intermodal that's likely versus the first quarter, likely to be a bit of a mix headwind as the rest of the year plays out.", "How precise that will be, we will have to see. I'm not going to give precise guidance around that. In terms of your pricing question on the legacy contributor, as I have always said, you can't straight-line. Don't take what we repriced in past years on legacy and assume that each contract is the same. They are all different. That was what those contracts on a GAAP to market and that's what we took them up too. To your point, broadly, not just on legacy but I would say broadly, the way we look conservative Lee at calculating our prices, you know, the fact that volume was down in some key markets did have a negative impact on the way we continued brute price. I view that as positive as volumes recover we expect to enjoy the improved returns on those business volumes we have been able to reprice.", "Scott Group", "Okay and the contract you repriced 416, is that showed up in this number already? Were they just right at the actual impact does not show up until mixture?", "Rob Knight", "It's also in that number.", "Scott Group", "Okay. And last thing, just to go back to the question about the buybacks. Was your point about the extra dividend payment in the quarter, in your mind, does that have an impact on how much you bought back the first quarter? And as you go to a more normalized dividend just once a quarter, there's more or less for the buyback or they are independent? ", "Lance Fritz", "They are independent. I was just calling out folks understood there were two differ payments in the quarter. I would not make any correlation to that on my share buyback pace.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Ken Hoexter", "Just kind of a follow up on some of the volume commentary. Maybe Eric, just talk a little bit, a little bit on chemicals given that usually a precursor for a comedy and we see trend week lately. Longer-term your looking at plant opening up a Gulf region but more in near-term this year, is that a precursor for industrial side of the comment? Given set their.", "Eric Butler", "As you know chemicals business improved by rail was actually pretty good on the first quarter. We were up one percentage, two percentage points in the first quarter net accrued by rail. We think that is a precursor to the economy. Plastics business really ties pretty closely to construction and automotive and all of those and even on consumer side and retail side of house call plastics business was up in first quarter as we mentioned. We think that all of those trends indicate the strengthening North American economy. As Rob said earlier, we had some headwinds and coal, some headwinds we shale stuff that if you net that out, we feel pretty good about some of the underlying strength of the economy.", "Ken Hoexter", "Just a follow-up, Lance, maybe there is a lot of discussion at out east and in Canada about industry consolidation. Can you address union does we did this a couple of quarters ago but perhaps revisit your thoughts on how the market has changed over time and your thoughts given some of the activities or discussion on the eastern and Canadian half of the country?", "Lance Fritz", "Current discussions have not changed our position on industry consolidation. We're not in favor of it. We don't think it is the right thing to do at this time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.", "John Larkin", "You had mentioned that grain exports in some cases were still pretty strong but export haul was getting it. That was due to be very strong dollar. At you give us more complete picture of the impact of the strong dollar on the exports across more than just grain and coal?", "Lance Fritz", "The grain exports really were driven by milo and soybeans. We had a great soybean crop in and China is really pulling those into China and spreads between Gulf Coast, West Coast have narrowed in terms of ship spread. That really is driving milo and beans from central part of U.S. into China which was a positive for us. We're still seeing headwinds from the strong dollar in exports across, probably, a pretty good chunk of the economy.", "When you think about steel, steals being impacted, both with imports come particularly, from Asia coming into the country and domestic steel producers are struggling is also being impacted in terms of machinery exports, construction and farm machinery exports, headwinds because of strong dollar. On the weak side, we're seeing some difficulty in the U.S. wheat crop competing in export markets partially being to the strong dollar. The strong dollar is, as you would expect, impact the exports are pretty wide swath of the economy beyond just coal and it is helping imports. You should see our intermodal import business and other import business strengthen as you go throughout the year but the strong dollar is having an impact.", "John Larkin", "And maybe a question on the ever-changing energy markets. Do you have a sense for where oil prices would have to go in order to recharge the activity levels in the shales and then related to that, how high would natural gas prices have to go in order for the utilities to switch from natural gas back to coal?", "Lance Fritz", "If I could predict energy markets, I would probably be sitting in a different spot than today. There is a lot of conventional wisdom out there and I think the conventional wisdom was that you needed to be in the 70s for the U.S. shale markets to be strong. I think even if you look today with oil in the 50s, there is some shale but it's still going pretty strong. Permian shale is still doing relatively well. The Eagle Ford shale is not. I think there is a spread there, again, conventional wisdom on natural gas is somewhere in the three, 3.5, 350 is probably in the crossover range but, again, depends on a pot of different things like utility by region of the country.", "Eric Butler", "John, just a little more detail. Clearly, we like to see oil prices back in the 75 cross-trained. Clearly, that would be better for us.", "John Larkin", "But all of the guidance has been wrapped around no change and energy prices going for 2015, is that a fair assessment?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Allison Landry", "Following up on your earlier comments on the underlying strength in base chemicals and prospects, can you remind us how much for business is tied to the housing and residential construction markets? Yesterday, we saw existing home sales numbers that surprised to the upside and new forms Tom starts are expected to be pretty solid for the year. I wanted to get a view of sort of an all-inclusive perspective of the commodities that you move that are tied to these markets and what that represents as a percentage of volume or revenues.", "Lance Fritz", "I think, historically, we have set between 5% and 2%. We still think that's a good estimate. Housing starts were down in February and March. I think the housing start number comes out today or tomorrow. I think there is some expectation that weather has impacted the number being down the last couple of months and the existing home sales number was very strong, as you say. Again, we tend to factor that into our optimism about the underlying strength of the economy.", "Allison Landry", "As a follow-up question, given that your main competitor has seen modest improvement in velocity, albeit some easy comp's, do you think that the risk of losing some of the traffic that you gained last year as a result of their issues is now somewhat heighted? It seems like there's plenty of traffic as you go around at the West Coast ports but BNSF yesterday actually made comments it has regained some lost Ag business. So I just wanted to get your perspective there.", "Lance Fritz", "The BNSF stuff has been showing improvement in their service product. We would anticipate that would happen. They are very good, vibrant competitor. Eric had said, historically, some of the business we had shipped last year, certainly, in Ag maybe to a lesser extent some other commodities was naturally a better fit for their franchise, there network and would likely go back. I think you see that in the Ag line in terms of reported volumes. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?", "Eric Butler", "No.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Tom Kim", "I have a couple of questions. First on intermodal. Can you give us a sense how much your intermodal volumes might have been impacted by the west coast port congestion and how you think it will take that congestion to unwind to sort of filter into this Q2 numbers?", "Eric Butler", "So international intermodal volume was down to the low teens in the first quarter. Again, we expect that as you catch-up throughout the year that that will normalize and most of that will catch-up. We do not expect to see any permanent deterioration of our West Coast international intermodal business.", "Tom Kim", "Okay. Would it be possible to give us a sense of how much your filter fuel surcharge might have impacted ARPUs for that commodity group? Rob you had mentioned that impacted in the first quarter little bit more than the rest of the book of business.", "Rob Knight", "We don't break out by commodity in specific surcharge contributed to each individual commodity but there are timing differences by different contracts and we have some 60 plus different mechanisms. There can be and there are timing differences on the intermodal line versus some of the other lines.", "Tom Kim", "Okay. And then just with one, Rob, as a follow-up, you had commented that you anticipate some potential makeshifts ahead which could impact your revenues. Can you talk about how the mix shift is going to affect your RTMs versus carloads? Because I noticed that your RTMs were down about 4% in the first quarter and carloads were down about 2%. I would think this going to impact your real productivity unit cost and ultimately margins. So I'm just wondering if you could help us frame how we should think about the impact of efficiencies that might be affected by RTMs potentially being weaker than carloads?", "Lance Fritz", "I'm not going to break it out at this point as you are asking, Tom, but I would say mix is something we deal with. From a cost standpoint that just presents challenges and opportunities depending what the volume actually is for the operating team and Cameron's all over it improving the cost structure. In terms of the top-line, the pricing line or the impact on revenue, again, it will depend out which markets are stronger than others.", "We do anticipate as I called out there will be a headwind for the balance of the year. A simple explanation for why there is ahead hit headwind of it in our revenue line is we think there will be stronger growth and a lot of his recovery with intermodal we just talked about and soft as a goal and frac markets those are the negative drivers on that, if you will cap next headwind we anticipate. We're calling that out directionally as a challenge but we're not using that as an excuse not to continue to run as efficient operational the cost side as we possibly can.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jason Seidl", "When you look at your core pricing of 3.50%, kind of in line with what I expected but is it occurring in certain areas in terms of, are you getting more pricing now out of that truck competitive business then you were 1 year ago? Is that what is driving the improvement? Eric?", "Eric Butler", "We're getting a good market waste pricing across our business. As we said before, a certain percentage of our business has been fixed on multi-year, longer-term contracts and you can't touch them. We talked about that before but for the things that we're able to reprice, the demand is strong. The impacts in terms of the challenges of the trucking industry is having are in our favor and we see strong opportunities to price out value across our book of business.", "Jason Seidl", "Doesn't it get any easier to price intermodal products once the port clears up or did that not really have much of an impact on your pricing?", "Eric Butler", "Pricing is always difficult no matter when you do it. I would guess most of the international intermodal business would not be in spot pricing type of agreements.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay. And to piggy back on Allison's question as a follow-up, you obviously benefited from BN last year in several different categories and you locked up some of that business in some longer-term contracts. One of those does when you those contracts start expiring?", "Eric Butler", "We don't talk about individual contracts. I don't think we mentioned that last year. We don't talk about individual contracts.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ben Hartford", "Eric, I did wanted to follow up on domestic intermodal pricing in particular given the decline in crude, I know there are certain lanes now where you can find intermodal pricing all-in that is competitive to trucks you guys are more insulated to that with the longer length of haul. Let's assume that crude does stabilize here around $50, $55 a barrel. As you look into '16, do you see a situation where intermodal rate growth does have to lag, truckload rate growth going forward at current levels of crude because of the lower energy price? And some of that disparity, historical disparity between truck and intermodal might have narrowed over the past several years? Can you provide some perspective there?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, I guess I'm not white understanding the foundation of your question. I think actually truck pricing is increasing. If you look at most of the truck pricing indexes, because of the challenges that the truck industry is having, they are getting high single-digit type price increases. So I think would suggest instead of the gap narrowing it might even be expanding rather than staying the same.", "Ben Hartford", "Yes got truck pricing has increased. I was asking as we go into '16, should we expect domestic intermodal pricing growth to mimic truck load or does it need to lag what the truck load rate growth is to make sure there is enough of an all-in price delta between truck and intermodal?", "Lance Fritz", "We have a value proposition and we're going to continue to price tag as strongly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Kauffman", "I want to go a different direction. We're hearing a lot about the drought in California, the lower water tables, the reduction water use and also during the quarter, we heard those I think we focused with port issues on inbound movement of products. We also heard there was a fair amount of Ag and produce related products that could not get off the West Coast. Could you discuss how that affected you in the quarter and how you're thinking about this drought in California in terms of the growth of your Western business?", "Eric Butler", "The drought in California, as you know, the authorities right now in California are trying to insulate the Ag industry and really are putting the onus for water conservation on residential customers. Politically, how long that can sustain with the Ag industry being insulated is anybody's guess. I do think that if you look at the Ag industry in California, you kind of profile who uses the most water to the least water, I think our customer base will probably be in the using the least water category.", "So we feel pretty good that the drought will not have near-term material impacts on our food and refrigerated business. We feel pretty good about that. Short of some Armageddon type of scenario. In terms of the export question, yes. So Ag products, particularly refrigerated products do go export off West Coast ports and they were similarly impacted just like the imports were impacted so just like things couldn\u2019t get on, things couldn't get off and they similarly had impacts fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year.", "Jeff Kauffman", "As a follow-up thought last year we heard about truckers moving water into California on an as needed basis. Maybe I'm going off the deep end here but is that a potential revenue source for you over the long run?", "Lance Fritz", "I do not think that's material.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Troy with Nomura Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.", "Matt Troy", "I had a question, as you talk to your utility customers you mention natural gas switching impacting some of the Colorado Utah basin business. Just curious what the echoes of 2012 still lingering, how should we think about the potential for additional or incremental vulnerability in your coal business. What's your sense in speaking with coal customers that as natural gas approaches to 250 now and potentially lower, how much has switched to how much remaining could switch? What is the vulnerability there?", "Lance Fritz", "I think the things that can switch probably have switched. As natural gas goes lower, there might be some incremental impact you would expect there would be. But I think we have seen mostly--", "Eric Butler", "Comments on that, Matt, if you recall last time natural gas prices got to historically low levels. We really in our territory didn\u2019t see materials switching until it got sub $2. That doesn't necessarily predict the future but what we're seeing though and I think the bigger impact to date rather than our utility based switching from one source to another, they are able to buy electricity off the grid that is being produced by somebody else, perhaps, from gas. So we\u2019re seeing that impact as opposed to a pure switch, turning off the coal plant and turning on the gas plant in our territory.", "Matt Troy", "And my follow-up would be, you mentioned PTC, I'm just curious there, I think when it was initially enacted, no one believed that it would be completed by 2015 in many of the various stakeholder groups but here we're knocking on the deadline. Curious in terms of your conversation with Washington, what it is it industry is proposing as the path forward in terms of either time frame or incremental expansion to the window? And coming off the wall question here, what if Washington in all it's rational thought and reason decides to hold you to letter of law? What will be the implication if the industry does not make the deadline and they are not flexible? Thanks.", "Lance Fritz", "I will start with a path forward. Cameron had mentioned, we believe that, virtually, everyone involved understand there has to be an extension because the industry is not going to make the date. That extension is going to have to come through Congress. There are a number of different vehicles that could make that happen and we're monitoring all of those potentials. And giving feedback and input into our thoughts to help navigate that process. From the perspective of having an extension occur, I remain confident that that will happen. It just reflects the reality of the situation. From the perspective of what if we don't get an extension? There are penalties outlined in the current regulation, current law and we've been discussing what our actions would be should an extension not occur. That would be a horrible outcome for the industry. And I don't believe that's the way it's going to go but we will be prepared for that very, very, remote possibility, as the year comes to a close.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "John Barnes", "First on the port situation, can you talk a little bit about -- you have been through this a couple of times before. Can you talk a little bit about your view of a return of market share to the western coast ports or do you think some of what's swung to the east coast and other ports is more permanent in nature?", "Lance Fritz", "We've said for quite some time that there may be as a low single digit number of share transfer from West Coast to East Coast when the Panama Canal opens up. The reality from our perspective is the most efficient vessels and the ones that are being commissioned, as we speak, A, they won't go through modified Panama Canal and B, there needs to be some significant work to occur on the East Coast ports in some circumstances to handle those. Having said that, there is also a natural cost/value proposition that makes those imports want to come into the West Coast. Eric, you want to add anything to that?", "Eric Butler", "No. I think that about covers it.", "John Barnes", "So you still view it as a couple of percentage points in market share?", "Eric Butler", "Yes currently East Coast has about 31. Historically, we\u2019ve said that could go to 33 with the Panama Canal opening but as Lance said, the larger ships that are being built today really won't even be able to go through the expanded Panama Canal. There is a value proposition for the West Coast. If you look at ship spread in terms of the West Coast versus East Coast and if you look at the cost of over land, bridge, rail, transportation, there is a natural economic driver to the West Coast.", "John Barnes", "Okay. My other one is, I know you've got an uncertain volume environment right now at play. I get where the pressure points are but if 2014 taught us anything is you can get caught on the other side in a more robust growth environment just as easily. How do you go about balancing where to pull in right now? Where to pull the rings in, especially given what you experienced in '14 where you really ran out of certain resources? Can you make sure you don't pull back so much trying to balance in this environment that should growth reaccelerate that you're not back in that same similar situation as you were in 14?", "Cameron Scott", "In 2014, our locomotive surge fleet strategy served us very, very well. When business came on, we are able to match that business. So as we look into this year, redeveloping that search fleet and being agile, as we mentioned, is a very critical asset and very critical initiative for us. We take Eric's forecast and where he predicts business will be and then we make our moves appropriately.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "With respect to West Coast ports, I was just wondering if you could comment on the challenges associated with big ships and new shipping alliances which may remain once the backlog is cleared and what you are doing internally and with your supply chain partners to cope?", "Lance Fritz", "You are right, there is going to be a challenge and basically the challenges because the new alliances, as they bring their business together, they bring it all to one terminal and then overwhelms the capacity of that individual terminal on the port vis-a-vis being spread out between multiple terminals. So that is a challenge. The alliances are working through that the challenge of terminals are working through. There was a challenge was starting to be seen before even the ports slow down. We from outside are working with our customers developing planning practices and protocols in capacity management protocols that we're sharing with them to basically say, here is the capacity within this window that we can do into the extent that there is a larger than that flood because of alliance activity through the terminal, what do you need to do to correct that? So we did see it in the past. We will see it in the future. We're working with them to spread that out.", "Cameron Scott", "Are most important asset in LA basin to stay up against the intermodal businesses is locomotives. And we have spent over the last year developing a model that stays up against Eric forecast of business week-to-week to week. It has been very successful, are originating on-time departures out of the LA basin are in the mid-90s and we feel very confident we can keep it there.", "Operator", "Are next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.", "Cleo Zagrean ", "My first question relates to the impact of mixed operating ratio. Can you please clarify for us whether you expect mix to be a headwind or tailwind, if a headwind is it mostly because of declines in coal and frac rather than international intermodal coming back? Thank you.", "Rob Knight", "Cleo, the headwind that we would anticipate from the mix going forward is a result of, we expect strong intermodal and softer coal and fracking related activities, as you are calling out. But as always we're going to continue to focus on being as efficient as we can on the cost side. And as Eric has been talking all morning we're going to continue to price to the value proposition. So we're not throwing the towel in terms of the margins but we know we\u2019re going to face the headwind of those mix changes.", "Cleo Zagrean", "And my second question relates to coal. Can you please discuss to what extent share shifts may have affected your volumes in a flat Western coal market in the first quarter? And your outlook for Colorado, Utah, with any kind of detail you want to share on the market for that coal and whether your long-term export outlook has changed? Thank you.", "Eric Butler", "Yes, there were no material contractual share shifts that we saw.", "Lance Fritz", "And what about Colorado Utah, Eric?", "Eric Butler", "There were no material shifts.", "Cleo Zagrean", "Okay, because we have seen been up like mid high single digits and your volumes down. So I was wondering whether those are related in any way, it's just totally separate tracks so to speak?", "Eric Butler", "We can't speak to their business, naturally. We kind of describe the dynamics we saw in our business, it would not surprise me if they had a much greater opportunity for inventory replenishment for their customers in the first quarter than we had, simply because we had more deliveries last year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "I had one quick one on frac sand adjusting to the current outlook down mid-teens in the second quarter. But as opposed to something like coal where you have natural gas and inventories as you mentioned, a little bit of a leading indicator. With sand it's a little tougher as the amount of sand per well continues to go up and different basins move ahead at different rate. So do you have any sense of the visibility into the second half of the year either in what you're seeing in actual orders or talking to your customers directly what the programs might look like at this point? Thanks.", "Eric Butler", "I'm not quite sure where does what you are asking but it would be basically be similar to what we kind of said before.", "Lance Fritz", "Brian, were you asking for a crystal ball on frac sand in the second half of the year?", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Yes call please. I was asking how you think about the second half of the year with frac sand?", "Eric Butler", "I think our frac sand volumes based on current activity will probably be more similar to 2013 volumes than 2014 volumes.", "Operator", "Our next comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Knowing the strength in autos in the period, will you please comment on how your expectations for trades with Mexico compared with maybe somewhat tempered with overall growth rate?", "Lance Fritz", "Let me jump in just on the very long-term and, Rob mentioned this early on in a comment about our franchise because we do serve all six rail gateways to Mexico and because of Mexico's opening up of some of their core industries, as well as the significant foreign direct investment from the very long-term perspective, we feel very, very good about our business and growth with Mexico.", "Eric Butler", "I have nothing more to add with that. Mexico continues to be an upside for us. We have a great franchise and we're optimistic about the outlook.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Yes if Mexico does grow outsize compared to business in the U.S., would this be accretive?", "Lance Fritz", "Not necessarily. With that question actually has been in fact what we have experienced with last decade, our volumes in and out of Mexico have grown at a slightly faster pace than the overall enterprise volumes. And I would not try to draw conclusion in terms of margin -- those moves.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Is it longer haul though?", "Lance Fritz", "It can be, again, I would say overall scheme of things, it's no different than are overall enterprise mix.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Lance Fritz for closing comments.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you, Rob. So you heard us talk about today was our first quarter where we came into the year, volumes changed on us dramatically and we've spent the quarter aggressively trying to write-size and just fell short of that mark. As we look forward into the second quarter, we're looking forward to continue that work and improve our service product and our efficiencies and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s going to happen. And we look forward to talking to you about it the next time we get together. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation.

Baird & Company, Inc.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets", "Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar", "Operator", "Welcome to Union Pacific's Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion, or $1.38 per share for the second quarter of 2015. This is a 3% decrease in earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2014. Solid core pricing gains were not enough to overcome a significant decrease in demand. Total volumes in the second quarter were down 6%, led by a sharp decline in coal. Industrial products and agricultural products also posted significant volume decreases.", "As you recall, first quarter volumes were down 2%, and we began realigning our resources early in the year, storing locomotives and furloughing employees. These efforts continued throughout the second quarter. We've made meaningful progress right sizing our resources to current volumes, and I'm encouraged to report that we've made these improvements while posting strong safety performance. But, our work is not finished. We'll continue to become more agile with our network and our resources. We remain focused on providing safe and efficient service for our customers, and strong financial performance for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.", "Eric Butler", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was down 6%, with gains in automotive and intermodal more than offset by declines in coal, industrial products and Ag products. We generated solid core pricing gains of 4%, but it was not enough to offset the drop in fuel surcharge and the mix headwinds, as average revenue per car declined 5% in the quarter. You'll see the impact of lower fuel surcharge revenue as we discuss each business group. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 10% decrease in freight revenue.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 7% on a 7% volume decrease in flat average revenue per car. Grain volume was down 19% in the quarter. Our domestic feed grain shipments declined 6% as we return to more normal seasonal shipping patterns compared to the strong demand last year. Export feed grain was impacted by the strong US dollar and abundant global grain supply, driving our export shipments down 36%. In wheat, our export shipments also declined, but were partially offset by moderately better domestic shipments. Grain products volume was down 3% for the quarter.", "Ethanol volume declined 6%, driven by extended plant maintenance downtime following a record year of production. Partially offsetting the ethanol decline was increased demand for soy bean meal exports to China and an increase in bio-diesel shipments. Food and refrigerator shipments were down 2%, driven primarily by fewer potato shipments and also due to lower frozen meat exports.", "Automotive revenue was up 3% in the second quarter on a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by a 3% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles in the second quarter, up 3.6% from the same quarter in 2014. This is the first quarter with the SAAR rate above 17 million vehicles since the third quarter of 2005. In auto parts, volume grew 5% this quarter driven primarily by increased vehicle production.", "Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% reduction in average revenue per car and flat volume. Plastics shipments were up 11% in the second quarter. Stable resin pricing led to strong buyer confidence in the market, and we also saw a strength in export volume. Petroleum and liquid petroleum gas volume was up 10% in the second quarter, driven primarily by strength in several LPG markets. Our volume gains were offset by a 29% decline in crude oil shipments, which continued to be impacted by lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads.", "Coal revenue declined 31% in the second quarter on a 26% reduction in volume and 7% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 28% for the quarter, as demand for coal continued to be impacted by mild weather and lower natural gas prices. In addition to soft demand, volumes were also impacted by heavy rains in June that flooded coal mines in the Powder River Basin and damaged our main line. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 31% for the quarter, driven by both the soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. I'll talk more about our outlook for coal in just a minute.", "Industrial products revenue was down 14% on a 13% decline in value and 1% decrease in average revenue per car. Construction products revenue was down 5% for the quarter. We experienced higher than normal rainfall in the southern part of our franchise during the quarter, which led to construction delays that impacted both cement and rock volume. We still think the construction market is fundamentally strong, particularly in Texas, and that our construction products business will rebound.", "Minerals volume was down 24% in the second quarter. The reduction in drilling activity led to a 28% decline in shipments of Frac sand. Finally, metals volume was down 27% as lower crude oil prices reduced drilling related shipments by nearly 50%. Also, the strong US dollar continued to drive increased imports, which reduces demand from domestic steel producers.", "Intermodal revenue was down 5% as a 2% volume increase was more than offset by a 7% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic shipments grew 3% in the second quarter, as we continued to see strong demand from highway conversions and for premium services. International intermodal was up 1%, as our recovery from the west coast port labor dispute was muted by the strong comparisons from 2014. You'll recall that the second quarter 2014 results included free shipments ahead of the west coast port labor contract expiration.", "Additionally, we experienced a slowdown later in the quarter due to relatively high retail inventory levels and softer than expected retail sales. I'll update you on our expectations for peak season in just a minute. To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In Ag products, overall crop conditions in our territory appear favorable at the moment. However, low commodity prices and abundant global supply creates uncertainty in our volume outlook for grain. In grain products, we expect demand for soybean meal to remain strong in the near term, and ethanol production should return to seasonally normal levels.", "Automotive should continue to benefit from strength in sales, and we expect growth in finished vehicles and auto parts shipments. In coal, while the weather has been closer to seasonally normal temperatures recently, we expect lower natural gas prices, higher inventories and low export demand to continue to be head winds in the second half of the year. Although we anticipate continued year-over-year declines in the back half of the year, we expect that volumes will sequentially improve from second quarter levels.", "Most chemical markets remain solid for the remainder of the year, with strength expected in LPG and plastics. We continue to expect crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will remain a significant headwind for crude-by-rail shipments for the rest of the year. Lower crude oil prices will also continue to impact some of our industrial products markets. Rig counts are down roughly 50% from their peak in 2014, but seem to have stabilized in recent weeks. We expect our Frac sand shipments to level off as well, though they will be significantly lower year-over-year, given the strong comps. The reduction in new drilling activity, along with the strong dollar, will continue to be head winds for our metals business. The housing market continues to strengthen year-over-year, and we believe our lumber franchise is well positioned to grow with demand. In construction products, we anticipate to return to growth as weather conditions normalize.", "Finally in intermodal, the relatively high current retail inventory levels could moderate our growth in the second half of the year in both domestic and international. However, many of the consumer confidence and spending indicators are still positive, so we're preparing for a normal peak shipping season, though it could be muted. As always, highway conversions will continue to present growth opportunities in domestic intermodal.", "Overall, while there is uncertainty in some of our markets, we continue to see opportunity in several others. We will continue our focus on solid core pricing gains and business development across our diverse franchise.", "With that I'll turn it over to Cameron.", "Cameron Scott", "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance. Our first half reportable injury rate improved 23% versus 2014 to a record low 0.82. Successfully finding and addressing risk in the work place is clearly having a positive impact, as we improve towards our goal of zero incidents.", "In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 17% to 3.46, driven by an increase in yard and industry reportable. To make improvement going forward, we will continue to focus on enhanced training to eliminate human factor incidents. We will also continue making investments that harden our infrastructure to reduce incidents.", "In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 11% versus 2014 to 1.97. We continue to drive improvement by reinforcing public awareness through channels including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. Moving to network performance, we continue to face a very dynamic environment. Significant volume swings and business mix shifts have led us to more frequently adjust our transportation plans. Add to it the numerous flooding related outages we faced during the quarter, and it was a challenging operating environment.", "During the quarter, we experienced 64 weather interruption days, caused by more than 100 weather-related track outages, including a significant interruption in the Powder River basin during early June. We define interruption days as more than 50 hours of train delay associated with weather or incident events. The strength of our franchise and investments we have made in resources and infrastructure have enabled us to mitigate the impact of these events. We rerouted trains where possible, while our engineering crews worked around the clock to restore operations. I'm very proud of the men and women of Union Pacific who faced these challenges head on, enabling us to generate year-over-year improvement in both velocity and terminal dwell.", "That said, we know there is more work to do and we're working diligently to improve service and reduce costs. Throughout the year, you have heard us discuss the importance of resource alignment as a key lever to reduce cost. While we strive to be as real-time as possible, the reality is that there is a time lag in adjusting the resource space, especially during periods of volume swings and business mix shifts.", "As you can see in the charts on the right, we have made meaningful progress right sizing our TE&Y workforce and active locomotive fleet throughout the first half. Our total TE&Y workforce was down 4% in June versus March. More than half of the decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. We expect a further reduction in the third quarter. By the end of June, we had around 1200 TE&Y employees either furloughed or on alternative work status, and had about 900 locomotives in storage. This is up from the end of the first quarter, when we had around 500 TE&Y employees furloughed or on alternative work status, and 475 locomotives in storage. While we still have some work left to do, we are now getting closer to having our resources aligned with demand. But as always, we'll continue to monitor and adjust our work force levels and equipment fleet as volume dictates.", "Moving to network productivity. Even in the face of less than optimal operating conditions and lower volumes, we're able to generate some efficiencies during the quarter. We ran record train lengths in nearly all major categories, remaining agile and adapting our transportation plan to current demand. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals, as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity despite a decline in the number of cars switched.", "Growth capacity investments whether it be in the form of sidings, double track, or terminal infrastructure have enhanced our ability to generate productivity and have increased the fluid capabilities of our network. However, as was also the case in the prior quarter, the associated time lag in adjusting resources to lower volumes continue to lead to inefficiencies in other areas. This was particularly evident in efficiency metrics such as locomotive productivity, which is measured for gross ton miles per horsepower day. While lower coal and grain volumes did create a mix headwind, this suite productivity metric was down 8% versus the second quarter of 2014.", "To wrap up, as we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding record results on our way to an incident-free environment. We will continue making operational improvements by leveraging the strengths of our franchise to improve operational performance. While our resources are now more closely in line with demand, we will continue our focus on other productivity initiatives to reduce costs. Ultimately, safety and service will drive our ability to run an efficient network, all of which creates value for our customers and increases returns for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Rob Knight", "Thanks, good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.4 billion in the quarter, down 10% versus last year. A significant decline in volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue, along with a negative shift in business mix more than offset another quarter of solid core pricing.", "Operating expenses totaled just under $3.5 billion, decreasing 9% when compared to last year. Drivers of this expense reduction where significantly lower fuel expense, along with volume-related reductions and cost-saving initiatives. The net result was an 11% decrease in operating income to $1.9 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $142 million, up from $22 million in 2014. Included in this amount is the previously announced Fremont, California land sale, which contributed $113 million to pretax income or $0.08 per share to total earnings.", "Interest expense of $153 million was up 11% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the last 12 months. Income tax expense decreased 7% to $734 million, driven primarily by reduced pretax earnings. Net income decreased 7% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce a quarterly earnings of $1.38 per share, down 3% versus last year.", "Now, turning to our top line, freight revenue of about $5.1 billion was down 10% versus last year. In addition to a 6% volume decline, fuel surcharge revenue was down about $400 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of fuel price was a $0.06 headwind to earnings in the second quarter versus last year. This includes the net impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. Of course this is a turnaround from the first quarter, where we had the benefit of surcharge lag and more favorable spreads.", "Assuming fuel prices and associated spreads remain at current levels, we estimate that fuel will be a slight headwind to earnings for the remainder of the year. Business mix, as we guided on our first quarter earnings call, was a negative contributor to freight revenue for the second quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in bulk grains, Frac sand, and steel shipments, along with an increase in intermodal volumes.", "Looking ahead, business mix will likely continue to be a headwind to freight revenue for the remainder of the year. A 4% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. Core pricing continued at levels that are above inflation and reflects the value proposition that we offer in the marketplace. Of the 4% this quarter, just under a half percent can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business we renewed earlier this year, and this includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy contract renewals.", "Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 5% versus 2014. Lower volumes were more than offset by labor inflation, increased training expense, and operating inefficiencies. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 4% when compared to 2014. About half of this increase was in our capital-related workforce. Excluding our capital-related employees, our force level grew by about 2.5%, but is down 500 sequentially from the first quarter.", "As Cam just discussed, we are continuing to adjust our TE&Y workforce levels to better align with current demand. While we have made progress, we continue to look for every opportunity to right size our workforce and focus on labor productivity. By year end, we now expect our net overall workforce levels to come in somewhat lower than the 48,000 that we reported at the end of last year.", "Labor inflation was about 6% for the second quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. Remember, the first two quarters of this year include the 3% agreement wage increase effective the first of this year on top of the 3.5% wage increase from last July. For the full year, we still expect labor inflation to be about 5%, including slightly higher pension costs.", "Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $541 million, down 41% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 10% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 2%, largely driven by the decline in coal volumes, while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.99 per gallon.", "Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 6% to $600 million. Reduced contract service expenses associated with our subsidiaries was partially offset by an increase in locomotive material expenses. Depreciation expense was $497 million, up 6% compared to 2014. We still expect depreciation to increase about 6% for the full year.", "Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $312 million, which is down 1% when compared to 2014. Lower locomotive lease and freight car rental expense were the primary drivers. Other expenses came in at $225 million, down 1% versus last year. Lower personal injury expense was somewhat offset by higher state and local taxes. Year-to-date, other expense is up 7%, consistent with our full-year expectation of a 5% to 10% increase, excluding any large unusual items.", "Turning now to our operating ratio performance, the quarterly operating ratio came in at 64.1%, an increase of 0.6 points when compared to the second quarter of 2014. The operating ratio benefited just under a point from the net impact of lower fuel prices in the quarter.", "Turning now to our cash flow, cash from operations for the first half increased to just under $3.8 billion. This is up 17% compared to 2014, primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and changes in working capital. We also invested more than $2.1 billion this half in cash capital investments.", "Taking a look at the balance sheet, our adjusted debt balance grew to $16.6 billion at quarter end, up from $14.9 billion at year end. This takes our adjusted debt to capital ratio to 44.2%, up from 41.3% at year-end 2014. We continue to target an adjusted debt to cap ratio in the low-to-mid 40% range, and an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 plus. We have made meaningful progress towards our targets as we continue to execute our cash allocation strategies.", "Our profitability and cash generation enable to us to continue to fund both our capital program and cash returns to shareholders. Since the first of the year, we have bought back about 15 million shares totaling $1.6 billion. Between the first and second quarter dividends, along with our share repurchases, we returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders in the first half of 2015. This represents roughly a 15% increase over 2014, demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.", "So that's a recap of our second quarter results. As we look towards the back half of the year, we will continue to focus on achieving solid core pricing gains. However, we expect volumes to be down somewhat year over year in the second half, given the market dynamics we are experiencing in many of our business segments. Also, as we discussed earlier, business mix will continue to be a head wind on freight revenue.", "On the expense side, we noted on our first quarter earnings call that inefficiencies cost us as much as 2 points on the operating ratio. We've made good progress since then. We estimate that these extra costs added just under a point in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we expect to reduce these costs even further. While we continue to improve, it is not likely at this point that we will achieve record earnings on a full year basis, given this year's challenges.", "Longer term, however, we expect to be on track to achieve our long term financial guidance. As always, we remain committed to providing our customers with safe, efficient service, and our shareholders with strong financial returns.", "So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thanks, Rob. With the challenges of the first half now behind us, our focus is on the remainder of the year and beyond. Clearly, there are still a lot of moving parts. We'll keep a close eye on crude oil and natural gas prices, the upcoming grain harvest, the strong dollar impact on balance of trade, as well as the continued demand for autos and the outlook for the consumer economy. All of this leads to a fluid demand picture across many of our business segments.", "While the volume outlook is uncertain, we remain laser focused on operating safely and efficiently no matter what the market environment. We will continue to reduce costs and productivity as we further align resources with demand. While we've made some progress, there is more to be done. Longer term, we continue to be optimistic about the strengths of our diverse rail franchise. We remain committed to providing excellent service for our customers and strong returns to our shareholders in the years ahead.", "So with that, let's open up the lines for your questions.", "Rob Knight", "Lance, if I can make one comment before we take the first question?", "Lance Fritz", "Sure.", "Rob Knight", "We just understand here recently that some of you have had trouble accessing the slides on our web site. They are back up and running now. So if you have any difficulty, we suggest you log out and log back in, and they should be up and available for you. We apologize for that.", "Lance Fritz", "Thanks, Rob.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Good morning. I wanted to touch on, Rob, what you wrapped up there with. When you think about earnings progression as we go through the rest of the year, clearly we had the pinch point here in the second quarter with resources relative to volume. Volume gets better a little bit sequentially, and resources are still adjusting. Do you feel like getting back to year-over-year earnings growth is something that can be achieved by the fourth quarter of this year? I don't want to get too specific in terms of guidance, but I just want to get a rough sense of the puts and takes about trying to get back up to a positive trajectory and then thinking out into 2016?", "Rob Knight", "We're focused on obviously improving earnings as best we can. You're exactly right, we're going to be laser focused on continuing to align the resources and be as efficient as we can on the costs. But what we're calling out in my comment to suggesting that it's not likely that we will beat last year's record earnings is the reality of what we're seeing in the business mix, particularly the coal volumes. We're not calling for any dramatic turnaround in our coal volumes. As Eric pointed out, while we are seeing some sequential improvement as we speak right now, we are anticipating that that will be a challenge.", "The other thing I would just point out Chris in the way you're looking at it, is recall last year actually is a very tough comp for the fourth quarter in particular. So we've got that headwind, if you will, in terms of getting back above that level. So we're focused on taking advantage of every opportunity we can, but we just see some continuing softness in some of our key markets, and that's going to be the key driver.", "Chris Wetherbee", "That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on the coal that you mentioned there. As you see that sequential improvement into 3Q, any sense you can give us on how to think about that specific commodity group in the back half, or just maybe the third quarter? And maybe where stockpiles are, so we can get some rough sense there? Thank you.", "Lance Fritz", "Eric, can you take care of that for us?", "Eric Butler", "It all depends, Chris, as we always say, depending on weather. Inventory levels are still higher than the 5-year average. They have come down about three or four days. The burn is increasing, but they are still higher. The volumes will depend on whether; it will depend a lot on natural gas pricing. At current natural gas levels, it remains a difficult comparison for coal to remain coal. It's about a 30%, 32% market share today, versus the 39%, 40% last year. A big change in that is natural gas pricing.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Allison Landry", "Thanks, good morning. So, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the mix head wind that you mentioned going forward. So based on some of your comments, if grain volumes do end up materializing, you do see a rebound in construction products and potentially some muted growth on the intermodal side. Is there a scenario where mix could be flattish? I'm just trying to understand maybe some of the puts and takes, and the magnitude of the negative mix in the back half.", "Lance Fritz", "Rob, do you want to take that?", "Rob Knight", "If what you just outlined, Allison, came true, those would certainly be positive contributors to the mix. As you know, I don't give guidance on mix. It's rare that we do. This year is unique in that we are confident that the mix head winds are in front of us. So we're giving that directional guidance. I would just remind everyone that, because of the great diversity of our business mix, which is a strong attribute of the Union Pacific franchise, we tend to have a lot of mix swings in our business from quarter to quarter. So the points that you are making would certainly contribute. Would they be enough to overcome some of the other head winds like the coal, the shale, the sand, et cetera? Perhaps not, but every opportunity we have to, you know, narrow the gap, if you will, and improve on the mix, we'll certainly take advantage of it.", "Lance Fritz", "I'd like to add to that. This is Lance, our commercial team has a robust business development pipeline. They're pursuing business opportunity that presents itself to us because of our wonderful diverse franchise. So to Rob's point, it's hard to be precise in making a future call. There are opportunities and puts and takes. The guidance we've given you is what we think is our best guess.", "Allison Landry", "Okay. Just a follow-up question. Could you give us a sense of how much the inefficiencies cost you in the second quarter?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, Allison, just to rephrase that, remember we said it was up to about - call that $100 million in the first quarter. It was closer to just under a point in the second quarter. From a dollar standpoint, we'll call that a $50 million improvement, from first to second quarter in those efficiencies. Again, we're focused on continuing aggressively to remove those efficiencies as quickly as we can.", "Allison Landry", "Sorry, I missed that last part. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe research. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Scott Group", "Thanks, good morning.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning.", "Scott Group", "Just want to clarify one quick thing first. Rob your comments about earnings growth, what are you assuming for the second quarter? Is that based on $1.30 or $1.38?", "Rob Knight", "In the second quarter, $1.38. I guess what you are getting at is the land sale. Yes, all in.", "Scott Group", "Okay. So a question on coal. We understand some of the pressures, but seeing so much more weakness in your volumes relative to BNSF, is there any color you can provide on - maybe there is a big market share loss or customer loss that we should be thinking about, and when that began? Are you starting to see any pressure from the utilities on a pricing standpoint?", "Lance Fritz", "I'm going to let Eric answer that question.", "Eric Butler", "As we mentioned at last quarter, Scott, we do think we came into this year a different place than our western competitor in terms of inventory levels of our key customer utilities, and we do think that that has had an impact. We also think, as we mentioned in our comments, that some of the flooding and track outages that we experienced particularly in June, had an impact that you probably won't see in the numbers of our western competitor. One of the other impacts that we have seen is that there are probably a couple of specific customers that have had outages, that have had challenges in their energy markets in terms of them competing that are probably disproportionately impacting us than our competitor. We think over time, that kind of works its way out. Certainly in the second quarter it had an impact. We always compete for business. We think we have a market value. We are continuing to focus on the strong price in terms of the second part of your question. You know, we feel good about the market value, and the price for our services, and that is reflected in our results in the second quarter.", "Scott Group", "Thanks. The last question, I want to ask about share buybacks. It seems to me for the past several years, you have had this really unique story with the legacy pricing. That's behind us now, but it seems to me, you still have a unique opportunity in terms of having by far the least leverage of any of the rails. Given the weakness in the stock and maybe tougher to grow earnings. Do you start to think about using that optionality more aggressively? And why not?", "Rob Knight", "Scott, you know the guidance we've given in terms of the metrics that we're comfortable with. To your point on the share buyback, if you look at the first half of this year compared to last year's first half, we're up about 10% in terms of our share buyback, and we will continue to be opportunistic, and at the prices that we're seeing right now, we think those are nice entry points. So we will - we are certainly, as we always have, buy more when it's down, less when it's up. Your longer term question, I think is answered in our comfort with our longer term metrics that we've given.", "Lance Fritz", "Scott, this is Lance. I want to react to something that was in your question, which said tougher to grow earnings, going forward. I want to reemphasize what we've constantly focused on with our investors, and that is we've got an industry best franchise. It's got plenty of opportunity for a growth and business development. We've got plenty of opportunity to continue to improve the productivity and efficiency of operations. For the very long term, we feel very good about our long-term guidance.", "Scott Group", "Thank you.", "Rob Knight", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go with your question.", "Ken Hoexter", "Great. Good morning. Just a little follow-up on the coal just for a second. I want to go back to last quarter, you thought coal was going to be down 5%. At that point it was already running down in the mid-teens. I just want to think back to the inefficiencies, as you noted. Have you been slower to cut costs in addition to the inefficiencies? Lance, the question would be, what gets to you move quicker? Thinking about how to balance cutting costs and staying ahead of that, but then if you get that inflection on volumes at some point to still be prepared? How do you think about how quickly you want to cut out some of those additional costs?", "Lance Fritz", "Sure. So Ken, putting this all in context, right? This time last year, second quarter last year, we were behind in resources, experiencing substantial growth, and as rapidly as we could, filling our pipeline with new employees. We came into this quarter or this year and then in the first quarter, as you note, declined 2%, which was not our expectation and then further declined in the second quarter. So as soon as we recognized this year that we need to make adjustments, we've been doing so. The big thing that has us mismatched right now is really two parts, and Rob hit both.", "One is our capital program and the type of capital we're spending is demanding that we have more capital head count. So there's a head count imbalance there that grew year-over-year, and our training pipeline where we were just filling it up in the second quarter last year, and we're now emptying it out in the second quarter this year. As we move into the third quarter, all of that is happening at a rapid pace and will continue to happen. I expect by the end of the third quarter, much more balance as regards to training and as regards overall head count and resources targeted on the transportation product.", "You know, answering your question, could we do things faster? Hindsight is a luxury we typically don't have in planning the business. I certainly wish we had better clarity in what our markets would be doing, what the mix would look like. We certainly would be making adjustments more rapidly if we did. However, in the pragmatic world we're in right now, there is an opportunity for us to be better. We're working very hard right now in trying to figure out ways to be more agile with our resources, to be quicker in recognizing market shifts and being quicker and being able to take those actions. So I think it's a fair question.", "Ken Hoexter", "I appreciate that seems tough to see with some more volatility on the volume side. On the follow up, maybe just throwing it to Eric. On, I think the question before was talking about more on the coal side and the competition. If you are seeing that impacting pricing? It seems like with your positive 4% pure pricing. But I want to understand, are you seeing across the other commodities, as Burlington has improved their service levels, are you seeing increased competition on the volume side? And any thoughts on pricing and what that may do outside of your legacy renewals.", "Eric Butler", "Ken, we always say we have a tough competitor. They always have been. Always will be. Not only is the Burlington a tough competitor, but we compete with other railroads and other markets. We also compete with trucks. Trucks are also a tough competitor, and lower fuel prices are helping them. That being said, we feel good about our value proposition we're continuing to focus on the strategies and initiatives to improve our value proposition. It's our goal to have the best service and value proposition in the industry. If we do that, we think we'll be able to price appropriately for our value.", "Ken Hoexter", "Thanks for the time and insight.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Good morning, everyone.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Rob, can I follow up on this line of questions, here? Just thinking about your OR or your margins in the back half of the year. I think if we look back the last couple of years, you've had quite a bit of sequential improvement and profitability. We're talking a lot of pluses and minuses here. Business mix should be negative, still lower volumes year on year, but sequentially improving. Still getting price. Then you talked a lot about the fuel impact in the second quarter and how that could be incremental headwind. You have wage inflation, but head count reduction. So as you balance all of this out, with the best view right now, how do you feel about the operating ratio heading into the second half of the year?", "Rob Knight", "Yes. There's a lot of moving parts, as you point out. Fuel being a big one, in terms of the impact that that has on the operating ratio itself. But our focus would be that that is an opportunity still for to us make year-over-year improvement. The way things look at this point in time, fuel would probably help in that regard unless it dramatically changes and spikes up. We are focused on, for all of the efficiencies that we plan on taking, the continued focus on price, the diverse opportunities that still will present themselves. We are focused on still improving the operating ratio year-over-year.", "Brandon Oglenski", "That's helpful. Eric, can you comment a little bit on grain markets? There is a big discussion that, if we have another big harvest or relatively large harvest, which I think the government is calling for right now, how much of that can we actually store if folks decide they don't want to sell into a lower commodity price environment? Or is there just not that much storage? Are we going to end up having to move the volume anyways?", "Eric Butler", "The outlook right now is that the yields look strong. Still relatively early in the growing season, so anything could happen from a weather standpoint. Right now, the projections are, while it may not be a record crop like the last two years, it still will be a pretty strong corn and bean crop. As you suggest, storage of crops are relatively high because US grain has not been able to compete as effectively, because there have been strong world grain crops and the strong US dollar. So there is a speculation that says if it is a strong crop, there will have to have the current products or the crop move, and so that would be a positive for us in the second half of the year. You know, there's always uncertainty in our markets, but that is one of the scenarios that could be positive for the transportation system.", "Operator", "Next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein research.", "David Vernon", "Rob, with the weather events that we had this year being a lot worse than last year, is there any estimate for the costs that you may be incurred this quarter that wouldn't be there if weather would have been a little more favorable, or is that too hard to call?", "Rob Knight", "I think it's just too hard to call, David, to be honest. It would be rolled up in those inefficiencies that I called out.", "David Vernon", "From a mix perspective, the revenue tonne mile was - tonne miles were down 14% relative to the car load decline of mid-single digit. Where in the business, Eric, do you see the biggest negative mix on the length of haul right now?", "Eric Butler", "As Rob said there's a lot of ins and outs in terms of mix, and we actually have had ins and outs in terms of mix across the business line. Coal certainly is a negative mix item, as you might imagine, but we have grown our intermodal business, which is a longer haul, so that would be positive. There's always lots of ins and outs.", "David Vernon", "Is the fall off in Frac sand, for example - were those sort of longer length of haul than your average industrial product shipment?", "Eric Butler", "Frac sand is right around the average length of haul for industrial products. Certainly the fall off from that has had a revenue mix impact, as Rob talked about.", "David Vernon", "Alright. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz, with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Good morning. I wanted to ask you about volumes in second half, and I know that, you know it's a directional question. I know it's hard to have tons of granularity on this stuff, but volumes are down 6% year-over-year in second quarter. I think the comparison's maybe just a touch easier in third. The way we should look at this is less worse year-over-year in third quarter. Is that a pretty reasonable assumption? When you look at fourth quarter, a little bit less worse? And how would you - any broad comments on just thinking about modeling volumes, year over year, third quarter and fourth quarter?", "Lance Fritz", "Before I let Rob speak to it in perhaps more detail, the way we're thinking about volumes in the second half, and we said it is - We're expecting a normal seasonal pattern, so seasonally, we see a peak in the second half and the third quarter. But there's a lot of reason for to us think that it's a muted peak. So I think that's sequentially better, but there's head winds against the year-over-year. Rob?", "Rob Knight", "I would just reiterate what we said earlier. And that is, we expect them to be down somewhat in the back half. We're not giving quarterly guidance on the volume, but the thing I would just point out is that I'd like to think that the sequential improvement that we're starting to see that Eric pointed out in coal will help in that third quarter year-over-year look. Then the fourth quarter is a little more of a challenge for us. So we're not calling it. But we're certainly focused and hopeful that things from a year-over-year perspective don't look like a 6% down kind of number, but we're not giving precise guidance on that.", "Tom Wadewitz", "That's good. I appreciate the comments. Then the follow-up question, on the expenses. Obviously, there's a lag on some of these items, so I suppose training expense and maybe in some of your materials expense and some others. How would I look sequentially at some of these categories where you have seen improvement. You know, if I look at purchased services, you are down quite a bit sequentially. Is that down more in third quarter versus second? Another category, rents was kind of flat sequentially. Are some of those categories down more in absolute terms in third quarter versus second?", "Lance Fritz", "Rob?", "Tom Wadewitz", "Thank you.", "Rob Knight", "This probably won't shock you, but you're going to stump me in terms of trying to get into individual expense categories. But I would just say that all of the categories are stones that we are uncovering and looking for opportunities. Labor, of course, shows up across the board, and that I would say, as a large position, is what we're really focused on. That might show up of course in multiple expense categories. As I pointed out, remember we took the $100 million of inefficiency or misalignment in the first quarter down to let's call it $50 million-ish in the second quarter, and we're focused on going after that $50 million, and then some. Our focus is to not just stop there, but continue to achieve as efficient of operations as we possibly can, matching against demand. So long answer to your short question, but would I say it's across the board that we are going to expect ourselves to make improvements.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors, with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.", "Bascome Majors", "Yes, thanks for taking my question here. So clearly, there were a lot of volatility and low visibility in the second quarter relative to where you thought you were in earning the quarter from a demand perspective. I'm curious, now versus two or three months ago, what's your sense from your customers? Are they seeing more stability and low visibility? Is there any conviction that things have stabilized on top of the comments you made on coal earlier?", "Lance Fritz", "Let me start with that, and then we'll get it to the expert in Eric. When you look at our top line, the story that we talked about in the first quarter really is the same in the second quarter, just more acute. That is there are areas of the economy that feel pretty stable and pretty good. It's reflected in the consumer side of the economy and specifically in things like our automotive shipments in the domestic intermodal product, a couple of things like that. This acute impact in the energy side of our business, specifically coal and shale energy-related product, is largely driving that top line problem. Eric?", "Eric Butler", "That's right. I'm not sure there's much to add, but the economy feels pretty good. Most of the macroeconomic indicators are going in the right direction. You know them as well as I do, and we're seeing that in our business. The issue we have is a significant shortfall on coal driven by natural gas, mild weather, and some episodic issues with some large customers of ours. And, frankly, the falloff in our share-related business. But aside from that, the economic indicators and the economy - customers are feeling pretty good. Trend's already up the correct direction.", "Bascome Majors", "Thank you for that. If I could just get one more in on the margin front. You mentioned that the headwinds from operational inefficiencies were about a point less in 2Q versus 1Q. But if I net out the impact of fuel surcharge, you'd have to go back quite a ways to see the net year-over-year margin decline as steep as you saw this quarter. As we try to directionally understand the drivers here. Can you rank order; mix, demand related, and simply a function of what the marketplace is giving you, versus you know, whether it's a timing lag between the shifts you've seen in the marketplace, and you have addressed the resource resizing already, to some extent? How significant is the net fuel headwind for the year that you alluded to in your prepared remarks earlier?", "Lance Fritz", "So Rob, you want to take this one?", "Rob Knight", "Let me try to answer that simply by saying they're all contributors, and they're all challenges that we deal with in our delay daily lives. But I would say, if you look at the second quarter, the biggest hit, if you would, would start with volume driven by coal. Second on the list is the mix impact, which obviously is impacted by the coal fall-off as well. But the mix impact of changing within our business mix, the sand, etcetera; the grains, etcetera, those would be the big drivers.", "Lance Fritz", "What's part disappointing and part encouraging - and Cameron walked us through this. We had areas of real productivity improvement that our team drove, both the commercial and the operating team, from the standpoint of train size improvement to near record levels on almost every product. Continued improvement, and switching efficiency, and it was overwhelmed by this mismatch, this imbalance in resources. We're aggressively going after that, we'll get that right.", "Bascome Majors", "Thanks for that color. I really appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question is Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Clearly a lot going on in the volume aspect. I wanted to talk more about the regulatory front, where there's also a lot going on. I got two transportation spending bills in congress. When you look in the senate version, which may or may not make it, there's actually a whole lot of stuff about rail, PTC, hazardous materials, recording devices, etcetera. So with that and the recent challenge put on the - [Technical Difficulty] standards - if you could give us a high level view - [Technical Difficulty] it's always there; that's always something to look at and be cognizant of, but anything that you are especially focused on for the remainder of the 2015 into next year?", "Lance Fritz", "Brian, you broke up a little bit when you were asking the detail of your question. Let me tell you what I think I heard and you tell me if that's right. You are asking, broadly, there's a lot going on in the regulatory environment, and what do we see coming out of that in the rest of the year and next year?", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Yes that's good. Thanks.", "Lance Fritz", "Okay. Our first primary focus in Washington is an extension on positive train control, or PTC. We've been crystal clear with our regulators and elected officials that we need that, that Union Pacific is not going to make the deadline. There is really no railroad that will make that deadline. The industry needs an extension. I believe everybody understands that. It looks like there's an opportunity to have that happen as maybe part of a highway bill or some other vehicle. The hard part of that is we've got to start making plans in case a PTC extension does not occur. And we'll then have to start communicating to our affected customers and commuter agencies what those plans are and what the timing is. That probably starts up sometime in September. There is a bit of a clock ticking on that.", "The second thing we're focused on intently is HAZMAT regulation, as you pointed out. We are in that dialogue. We think the regulation as published by the DOT has a couple of flaws. More broadly, we're very supportive of a new tank car standard. We've been asking for it, both as a company and as an industry for years. We are working diligently to get that standard right, to make it more safe than it currently is. The last thing we're working pretty hard on is different issues in front of the STB which is our commercial regulator. We're active in that dialogue, and trying to navigate that for the best of our company.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Okay, thanks. That was a good overview. Hopefully I've found a better spot for cell signal for the quick follow-up. I was wondering with all of the stuff going on with coal, as you look into next year, anything - this is another regulatory question, with the Mets ruling being kicked down to the circuit court by the Supreme Court a couple of weeks ago. Do you think that - one, every really had any impact in your service area. And two, if it did, you see any potential benefit from that rule being thrown back for reconsideration.", "Lance Fritz", "I'm going to let Eric answer that specific question on coal emissions regulation. I'll just start with a broad statement. We believe coal needs to continue to be a robust part of electricity generation in the United States. It's low cost, it's abundant, and it can be clean in terms of its emissions. That's very important for the US economy and for the US manufactures to be competitive on a global scale. Eric?", "Eric Butler", "In terms of the specific question, we don't think that the - while we applaud the ruling, we don't think it's going to have a significant impact. Either entities were already planning for it and/or they might still plan for it just because they don't know what might happen on the inevitable appeal that will occur. Or it wasn't going to have a significant issue anyway. So the fact that it was remanded, I don't think is going to have a significant impact one way or the other.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Alright, Lance and Eric, thank you for your time.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Greene", "Hi, good morning. Lance and Rob, I want to just explore a little bit the relationship between OR and the coal franchise. As you know, a lot of investors think of coal as being highly profitable. If coal weren't to come back, or even to go down further from here - in a longer term sense, like a secular decline, does it impede your ability to achieve your long term OR? Or do you feel like productivity and price alone can allow you to achieve that, even if the coal franchise ends up much smaller than it is today?", "Lance Fritz", "I'll let Rob answer more specifically. I'll give you an overarching reaction, and that is, there are lots of puts and takes in our business, over the long term. Our franchise is such that we've always been able to find growth opportunities and take advantage of them, and I'll remind you that our overall business strategy is predicated on an industry best - a demonstrably better service product and pricing for that value. Along with productivity, all of that tells me I am confident in our long-term OR guidance. Rob?", "Rob Knight", "I would reiterate what you just said. First of all, we're not calling for the death of coal as a business unit for us. We're experiencing a bit of a hiccup here. But I would say first of all, obviously that size of a business is a positive contributor to our OR. As it shrinks or any business shrinks, we have, as we've talked and as you know, we have a lot of diverse opportunities in front of us that give us a lot of confidence. That's what keeps us as confident as ever that we could still meet our long-term OR guidance. If we were to see it take a step down, any business unit take a step down, we would have to do the things that we have done over the last decade. That is right size our organization and make sure we are being smart about adjusting our costs accordingly so that we can continue to make progress on our financial results.", "Bill Greene", "Okay, fair enough. A follow-up question is on the dollar. A lot of investors sort of ask me about whether rails were really sort of pseudo commodity plays, and a weak dollar effectively caused a lot of stuff in North America to move, not just sort of by rail, but a broader industrial implication. So do you feel like a strong dollar impedes your ability to get the car loads back to let's say over $180,000 a week? Is this sort of a real risk factor that we need to keep in mind when we think about longer term volumes?", "Eric Butler", "I don't think so. You know, certainly as you know, when you have strong currency moves one way or the other, it could affect commodity flows. We see that in all of our commodity markets. But long term, North America is still kind of a strong, productive, secure, relatively low cost place of production. It's also a huge consumption market. Those things will continue to drive us being in the sweet spot for our transportation services, whether it's export or import. Long term, it doesn't move the needle.", "Bill Greene", "Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is with Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.", "Rob Salmon", "If I could shift it back to the core pricing, I was a little bit surprised that it actually was stable, sequentially, at that up 4% with half a point coming from the legacy, with weaker coal volumes. Robert, could you talk more about what drove that? I would have thought with less coal, it would have been a head wind to core pricing. So any additional color, if it's coming from the 2016 renewal that you got a little bit more of a benefit this quarter, and you are just getting stronger pricing across the franchise?", "Lance Fritz", "I'm going to throw it to Eric, but I'm very proud of the team for their results in the second quarter and a very difficult environment. The effectively priced for the value of the product, and that was a good outcome.", "Eric Butler", "Rob can talk about the legacy impact. But, we are doing what we said. We have a value product, and we're pricing for it.", "Rob Knight", "Specifically to the legacy question, I would say that was comparable to what we saw in the first quarter, where we said about a half point of the four was legacy, roughly. But you are also pointing out, and again, I'm as confident as Lance and Eric, and pleased with that performance. I think it shows that we're getting value in the marketplace. As you are also pointing out, and just to reiterate for others, the way we calculate our core price is if it doesn't move, we don't count it. We're hopeful that if and when coal resumes, some of the volume pick up, that some of those repriced contracts will be positive contributors to our margins as we move forward.", "Rob Salmon", "Rob, can you give us a sense, had coal either been flat or the decline in line with Q1 in terms of overall car loads, what core pricing would have looked like, this past quarter?", "Rob Knight", "I really can't give you that size. And there's a big mix even within the coal line. I'm not giving that level of specificity, but suffice it to say there was some value left there by not moving it.", "Rob Salmon", "Fair enough. Appreciate the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company.", "Jason Seidl", "Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the intermodal franchise. Can you focus on, going forward, just how much you think the competition has increased from the truckload side, as some capacity has crept back into the marketplace? And also longer term, given the issues that the west coast ports have had, do you feel there's a chance that the west coast could lose some permanent market share to the east coast?", "Eric Butler", "Jason, in terms of the first question, clearly lower fuel prices will incrementally, nominally make truckers more competitive, and clearly as the shale play has gone down, there appears to be what we think is a temporary alleviation with some of the driver shortages or a temporary reduction, I should say. There still are long-term driver shortages out there, but some of the move of labor from that to truck drivers has alleviated some of the shortage. So trucks continue to be a competitive option. I would point out in the second quarter, we set, again, another all-time domestic intermodal record. Our volumes set another record. We continue to see huge conversion opportunities, and we think as we have the service, value proposition, we'll continue to be able to penetrate and take advantage of that.", "In terms of the west coast port, clearly that had an impact. Certainly in the first quarter and the second quarter, as some of the backlogs were cleaned up, that had a positive impact. But as we said, we had a tough comp year-over-year because of the free shipping that occurred the previous year. I think one of the things that are instructive is kind of the spread rates, the ocean spread rates between east coast and west coast. The east coast ocean rates have actually increased about $250 on a spot basis over the last couple of months, which basically is making the west coast ports even more competitive than what they were before the strikes.", "So we think that there's some risk that there might be some nominal temporary rerouting as a supply chain risk management approach. I think there's some surveys out there that says companies might move 5% of the supply chain, risk management. We're not really seeing that, and we still think the west coast ports have an economic and a time value for product going pretty deep into the east.", "Jason Seidl", "Thank you for the details. For a follow up, Rob, maybe this is for you. Looking at all of the puts and takes in 2Q and looking forward, barring any other volume, unexpected volume shocks, do you view 2Q as sort of the low water mark for your margins?", "Rob Knight", "There's a lot of moving parts. I would answer that by saying we're focused on making that statement true. Of course we're going to go after, and we are making progress as we pointed out, the inefficiency misalignment, but what we'll have to wait and see is exactly how the volumes play out, and all those variables and what fuel does, et cetera. But, I'd like to believe that that statement will become true.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay, fair enough. Gentlemen, thank you for your time as always.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tom Kim, with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Tom Kim", "With regard to domestic coal, were you impacted at all by coal fire utility plant retirements in the second quarter? Then also, if Nat gases remain stable, would you expect any further coal-to-gas switching for the second half of the year?", "Eric Butler", "There's no impact from coal plant retirements. There's still significant surplus capacity. Both coal and other sources. So there was no impact on the retirement. We do not expect significant incremental switching. I think all of that can switch is switching, given current natural gas pricing.", "Tom Kim", "That's helpful. Then just on the intermodal yields. Can you talk about what drove the sequential Q-and-Q and then year-on-year deterioration in your average intermodal ARPU's?", "Lance Fritz", "ARC. Intermodal ARC.", "Tom Kim", "Yes.", "Eric Butler", "As for all of our businesses in the second quarter, the ARC was really dominated by the fuel surcharge reduction.", "Rob Knight", "I would also say, Tom, and mix - mix within each commodity group can also show up in there. There was no other marquee driver of that change.", "Tom Kim", "Okay. So no change of length of haul, or anything like that. Just mostly that surcharge part.", "Eric Butler", "Right.", "Tom Kim", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.", "Justin Long", "Thanks, and good morning.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning.", "Justin Long", "With your coal volumes down substantially right now, I was curious, does that change your approach to pricing in your non-coal businesses? In other words, do you have the thought process that non-coal pricing now needs to move higher to maintain the return profile of the consolidated business, or do you view the pricing dynamics between coal and non-coal completely separately?", "Lance Fritz", "I'm going to let Eric answer in more detail but our team prices every single move on the value of that move to the customer. Eric?", "Eric Butler", "Nothing else, that's it.", "Justin Long", "As a follow up, as we look into next year, if coal does continue to weaken and you are losing that high margin business, how are you thinking about where CapEx as a percentage of revenue needs to go in order to maintain or improve the current return profile of the business?", "Rob Knight", "This is Rob. As you know, the long-term guidance that we've given on our capital spending is in that 16% to 17% of revenue, and we're not calling for the fall off or significant further declination in coal. But, if it did, we would - as we always do with our costs, we would right size. I would also just point out, your question reminds me that, given what we're seeing this year, we expect that metric of capital spending versus revenue to be a little bit higher this year, given what we're seeing in this fall off. But if you look longer term, we would right size the organization both from an OE and from a capital standpoint. But, that's not the guidance I'm giving, because that's not where we are at this point in time. But we would take those steps.", "Lance Fritz", "Something else to keep in mind, Justin, is we've got plenty of capital capacity already built for the coal network. It's not really driving CapEx today.", "Justin Long", "Thanks. Appreciate the time today.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham research group. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Jeff Kauffman", "Thank you very much. You know, a lot of my questions have been asked, but let me come back to the capital question. Just given the realignment of resources, how are your capital priorities changing, ex-PTC?", "Lance Fritz", "Ex-PTC, we do our capital planning in a similar fashion year after year after year. We take a long term view of what we think markets are going to look like; we see how that lays in the existing network; we find where the hot spots exist from the standpoint of line of road constraint or terminal constraint, and then we target capital on that. There is a little bit of capital that gets spent on things like a specific project or a specific piece of business development, and then of course, there is a very large piece of capital that gets spent on consuming the existing network and maintaining it. And of course, that's driven by volumes and consumption. Cameron, is there - what else do you want to add to that?", "Cameron Scott", "I think you covered it all, Lance. Our focus continues to be on the southern region with a lot of our capacity CapEx. That's being driven by Eric's forecast.", "Jeff Kauffman", "Alright. A little follow-up to that. An unusual outage on the I-10 freight corridor, with the rains in Southern California. Is this an opportunity for the intermodal franchise? Is this forcing a lot of trucking capacity from LA to Phoenix to find alternatives?", "Eric Butler", "That is one of our franchise corridors, as you know. It has been. We've invested in that corridor over time. We are growing, and will continue to grow. The temporary flooding that is happening out there because of the rains - As you know, trucks always have lots of ways to reroute. So there would be no significant incremental impact due to that. That is an area and a market that we're going after with our franchise. We have and we'll continue.", "Jeff Kauffman", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Eric Butler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne, with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Thanks very much, and good morning. Most of my questions have been asked. I was just curious, in terms of the resource imbalance, can you just give a bit of color as to how much of that is head count, and how much is locomotives and other equipment?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, so, we are balancing locomotives real-time to match the transportation plan, which matches what demand is telling us. So local motives from a storage count are very close to being about the right size. Right now, we have something like 900 locomotives in storage. The head count issue, again, is a little bit part capital, which is all about whatever our capital plan is, and part we have too many in the training pipeline, and too many kind of coming out of the training pipeline. That furlough count, which, I think we said was about 1200 at the end of the quarter. You know, depending on what happens with attrition and demand, that will continue to ebb and flow. Right now, it's growing. So we can make the fungible side of headcount, the individuals that are actually working and productive match real-time. It's the mechanism to get qualified trained employees that are taking us a little bit more time to get right.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Okay, that's helpful. That's all for me, thank you.", "Eric Butler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions.", "John Larkin", "Thanks, gentlemen, for taking my question. I wanted to bore into intermodal a little bit more, one of your shining stars in the quarter, volume wise. The truckload carriers on the contract side of their business, at least, are getting in quite a few cases 6%, 6.5% yield improvement, and anecdotally, I've heard from a number of mostly privately held IMC's that you all are putting in some pretty aggressive price actions also, that would in theory still maintain that cost advantage, vis-a-vis, truckload. The pricing is obscured by that fuel surcharge that Eric talked about a minute ago, which depresses the ARC. Can you talk a little bit about whether this is one of your strong initiatives on pricing, and whether you are really getting a lot of follow through with that, or pushback from customers and whether that has moved the profitability of intermodal so that it is on par with the other commodity groups?", "Eric Butler", "No customer ever wants to take a price increase. They are always very tough discussions. We are taking market price increases across our book of business, every segment of our business, based on our value proposition. And we're going to continue to do that.", "John Larkin", "Are the price increases in the vicinity of what the truckload carriers are getting, or are you not going to share that with us?", "Eric Butler", "We reported the 4% core price increase, and we're focused on getting appropriate price increases.", "Rob Knight", "You know we don't break it out by individual commodity group, but as Eric and the team - they are laser focused on improving the profitability in the intermodal group, as they are across the board. We're going to continue to do that.", "John Larkin", "As a follow on, can you talk a little about intermodal service, which had a lot of hiccups in 2014 due to weather congestion in Chicago, growth in the new energy markets, at least. How is intermodal service tracking this year, and when would you expect it to be back at, say, 2012 or early 2013 levels? Once it reaches that level, do you think there's some latent demand out there that will come back onto the railroad once you have more of a truckload-like service product.", "Cameron Scott", "Our first OS - that's our on-time origin departure for intermodal product, continues to increase. We're not quite back to 2013 or 2012 levels, but we're making very good progress. Particularly in Los Angeles and in Chicago. Over the road performance, we're still looking, as you can tell by our AAR velocity metric. We're still looking for a mile an hour. We're properly resourced, we've got great initiatives to go find that mile an hour and deliver it. We just don't have a stake in the ground as to when that will be achieved. We expect to make that improvement throughout the course of the year.", "Eric Butler", "I would say, our goal was to be the best. So, we're clearly not satisfied with where our service is, and we're going to focus where Cam and his team, my team, we're working on. How do we improve the overall customer experience? And it's an intense focus, and I think as we go into the future, our goal is continuous improvement to improve what we take to the market.", "John Larkin", "Thanks very much.", "Eric Butler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question.", "Matt Troy", "Just given the time of year typically from an accounting perspective, people revisit incentive comp and stock based accruals in second and fourth quarter. I was wondering, on a run rate basis, was that a help during the quarter, as we've seen at other railroads, as everyone struggled with the lower volume environment and stock prices, which have declined. If not, when might we expect, in light of the guidance for the lack of earnings growth this year, that that might flow through and help the comp line? I just want to make sure we avoid some of the lumpiness we've seen in other railroads.", "Rob Knight", "I would say that it's a little bit in the second quarter. I'm not calling out or guiding that you are going to see anything lumpy in our numbers. I would say there was a little bit of an impact that showed up actually in our second quarter.", "Matt Troy", "The second piece would be to revisit it in the fourth quarter? Is that typically how it runs? Or how does it go?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, we always look at - each quarter, we look at what is the performance? So we'll stay tuned in terms of what impact that has in the back half. I don't envision it being lumpy, as you are citing.", "Matt Troy", "Okay. And my follow-up - thank you for that, Rob. In light of the $0.01 rally in natural gas today, could you just refresh us, in terms of the switching friction or switching capability of your utility customers? Obviously there's not a singular point or price in Nat gas, let's say, $3.50, where everyone just cuts back. It's more gradated than that. Just wondering if we buck the consensus that gas is going to stay low, and vision or dream that one day gas prices might start to march north? Could you just help us understand what is the band at which people begin to contemplate going back to coal, and where coal might take some share back on the grid, relative to your customer base?", "Eric Butler", "Matt, as you say it is a wide continuum. There are probably utilities that Coal looks favorable as low as $3, some $3.50, some $4. It is a wide continuum.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Cleo Zagrean, with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Cleo Zagrean", "Good morning and thank you. I will follow up on prior questions in terms of pricing for coal and intermodal. Could you help us explain if maybe fuel is a better headwind such that, overall in terms of coal price, performance was close to the average of 4% for the company? Any insight you could help us with would be appreciated.", "Rob Knight", "This is Rob. Let me reiterate that we don't break it out, what pricing we're actually getting within each commodity group. But I would just point out that, to your point on the impact that fuel might have had, we have some 60-plus different fuel surcharge mechanisms. So they do vary from group to group, and the timing of those can be different, and can impact from quarter to quarter what the recorded ARC number looks at. Again, our overall pricing success was 4% core price. We're confident that we're doing all of the right things in all of the commodity groups to improve that.", "Cleo Zagrean", "Okay. Then my follow-up relates to the outlook for coal and your network, longer term. You were saying that it's tough to adjust the network from one quarter to the next, understandably so. But, are you seeing any significant challenges to coal volumes from upcoming gas capacities in 2017, 2018? And since you would have time to prepare for that, how can you adjust the networks to mitigate that potential negative impact? And you are saying also the diversity of the franchise allows for your long-term goals to be maintained. What would be the one main positive offset to a decline? So a continued secular decline in coal? Thank you.", "Eric Butler", "As we said before, the big factors for coal, again, will be the cost of natural gas and weather. Today, there is surplus capacity on coal; there's surplus capacity on natural gas, today. The capacity isn't really as much as a driver as it is the point at which one dispatches versus another. It's different for different utilities. Again, I think $3 to $4 depending on utilities is probably the range that most utilities see today.", "Cleo Zagrean", "Okay. So you're not seeing the need to significantly adjust resources longer term on account of what you see in coal?", "Lance Fritz", "We are adjusting our resources constantly to match both what near-term demand looks like and what we think long-term demand looks like. We'll make those adjustments as the marketplace dictates.", "Cleo Zagrean", "I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ben Hartford, with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ben Hartford", "Thanks. Quick question, Eric. If I look within industrial products and the 35% of the volume that is construction, what is the split between res and non-res construction within that? Do you know?", "Eric Butler", "Yes, so I don't have it, in terms of the overall construction number. If you want to just split out lumber, historically, lumber was two-thirds, one-third. Right now, it's probably closer to half to half. But again, housing starts are improving sequentially. The housing start number for June just came up that was significantly improved, I think 10% improved over the previous month. There's still more multi-family than single family, but the split here recently has probably been more 60%-40% versus 65%-35% or 55%-45%.", "Ben Hartford", "So if I look at the 5% volume contraction within construction, can you help me rectify that in the context of some of the improvement that we have seen, as it relates to housing starts recently?", "Eric Butler", "As I said in my prepared comments, the majority of that was in our rock and our cement, most of which goes on the commercial side. That was really weather-related. The demand is really, really strong. We're seeing that sequentially here, even in the recent weeks. The second quarter there were some heavy rains that impacted the volumes that we saw.", "Ben Hartford", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions.", "John Barnes", "Hey, on the resource side, is there anything in the labor contracts that prevents you from right sizing the labor force faster or more aggressively than what you've done already? And are there any prohibitions about shifting that labor around to spots where it might be in more need?", "Lance Fritz", "So I'm going to start and then I'll pass it to Cam. The short answer is, not really. Our collective bargaining agreements dictate things like rates of pay, what exactly the work needs to look like. Some work environment issues. Typically doesn't have much headwind to us when it comes to right sizing. When we talk about, again, having the training pipeline fatter, if you will, than it was second quarter last year, that's about us making decisions about continuing to train, because we will graduate them into work either immediately or in the near term, and it would be just more disruptive and more costly to take them out of training, and then start over again from scratch two or three or four months from now. Cam?", "Cameron Scott", "I think you answered that perfectly. There is great flexibility, to answer your second question, on flexing appropriate resources to the network as required. So no issue, there.", "John Barnes", "To go back to the intermodal question earlier. If I go back to my notes on your last analyst meeting, you were already talking about the potential for a couple of more percentage points of market share movement from the west coast to the east coast. I understand what you are saying about ocean shipping rates and that kind of thing, but the ILA is already out talking about doing a ten-year labor deal in order to provide, you know, labor certainty to the east coast ports, where the west coast laborer contract is a year shorter, still leaves some very large issues like the Cadillac tax out there, left unnegotiated as of yet. Is there any concern that the severity of the downturn this last time has more permanently impaired the west coast ability to attract that volume back, and is some of that volume shift we've seen more permanent than maybe you would originally have expected it to be?", "Eric Butler", "Yes, so it's always a concern. It's in our franchise interest to have the proportion of business go through the west coast. So that's always something we look at. At the end of the day, we do believe economics win out, and today and we believe in the future, unless there's some substantial change, a difference between east coast, west coast. Today, the west coast option is the economically better option to go deep into the east. We've historically said that the Appalachian mountain chain was a crossover point. Things west of that, typically it's clear. The west coast is a better economic option. Things east of that, the east coast is a better competitor. You know, we'll always look at that. We do not believe anything substantial or significant has changed economically from the historical equation. There may be some minor adjustments for supply chain risk management issues in the short term, but we're not seeing anything significant or sustainable.", "John Barnes", "Okay. All right. Just a follow up on that. If there's any pressure on your international intermodal volumes, are you in a position to more aggressively grow the domestic intermodal piece as a means of offsetting any of that weakness? Thanks for your time.", "Eric Butler", "I'm not sure I would connect the two. The domestic market is where we have been growing. I mean, if you look at it, the international market has been - has had a much smaller slope. The domestic market shares huge truck conversion. You're still going to have a huge investment needed for highways. You can talk about we're not really investing in the highway trust fund. You can talk to getting agreement. You can talk about the driver shortages. You can talk about the economic and the environmental benefit of intermodal versus over-the-road trucks. It's a story that we've been talking about for the last half dozen years. We still think that there's a growth opportunity story, there, on the domestic intermodal side. Again, the second quarter was an all-time record for us on the domestic intermodal side. We think that on a volume basis, we think that there is still opportunities.", "John Barnes", "Okay. Thanks for your time.", "Eric Butler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker, with Morningstar. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "I'd like to ask about a sector I believe there is a little more cause for optimism. And Chemicals are material high ARC segments in the franchise. Excluding crude, I think some classes of chemical carloads do nicely, maybe even double digits in the period. So while natural gas hurts coal, but could you look a little further out, comment on the flip side of cheap natural gas and share some of your expectations for chemical product manufacturing development?", "Eric Butler", "We've talked in the past, and continue to talk about the huge plastic expansion that we're going to see in this country with the low natural gas prices. We think that you are going to see it even with natural gas going up to as much as $5 - $4.50, $5, we think that's still the sweet spot for the expansion that's happening in the Gulf. We have a great franchise. It's a franchise strength of ours to take advantage of it. There's billion, multi-billion dollars of investments going on. And, I think we've said publicly that we think we'll see the benefit of a lot of that starting in 2017 and 2018. But we think that is a franchise strength of ours.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "I'd like to ask a question about operations, on the subject of right-sizing the locomotive fleet. Could you discuss how you think about the value of removing one locomotive from the fleet? Are most of these removed assets going to surge capacity storage rather than being sold or divested, or do they show up in lower lease expense? So just the value of removing a single locomotive, please?", "Rob Knight", "This is Rob. Let me jump in. If Cam wants to add, he certainly can. Keith, I'm not going to break that out, but I would just say that, of course, when we get a new locomotive and we have an opportunity to put another locomotive in storage, or just through efficient operations we have an opportunity to put a unit in storage, we're putting the least efficient of the fleet in. We're always looking at - are there opportunities? For the most part, those go into our storage, and they are there, available for surge. Where there are opportunities for us to discontinue an existing lease or something, we'll do that, but that's not a big driver at this point in time. I think it's safe to assume that, as we free up a locomotive, it's going to be our least efficient from a fuel standpoint, from a maintenance standpoint, and from a DPU standpoint, that goes into that surge category.", "Cameron Scott", "There's an aggregate benefit, that the fewer locomotives we have active in the fleet, the less maintenance we have to do, in aggregate.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you all for your questions and your interest in Union Pacific today. We look forward to talking with you again in October.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2015. This equates to $1.50 per share, which is down 2% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Total volumes decreased about 6% in the quarter, more than offsetting another quarter of solid core pricing gains. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups with coal down the most at 15%. Automotive was the one commodity group with a year-over-year increase in the quarter with carloads up 5% versus 2014.", "On the cost side, we made significant progress aligning our resources to current demand.", "And I am pleased to report a quarterly record operating ratio of 60.3%. Going forward we will be intently focused on generating further productivity improvements. In addition, developing new business remains an important part of our strategy, whether we grow existing markets, develop new business with existing customers or find new market opportunities our commercial team is constantly filling the business development pipeline.", "I'm encouraged with the progress we have made as the men and women of Union Pacific worked tirelessly and safely to serve our customers and deliver value to our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.", "Eric Butler", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the third quarter, our volume was down 6.5%, with gains in automotive more than offset by declines in the other business groups. We generated core pricing gains of 3.5%, but it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and mix headwinds, as average revenue per car declined 4% in the quarter. Overall, the declines in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 10% reduction in freight revenue.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 4% on a 3% volume reduction and a 1% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume was down 11% in the third quarter. The strong US dollar and high worldwide inventories reduced grain exports by 32%. Slightly stronger domestic grain shipments partially offset the export decline. Grain products volume increased 1% for the quarter. July and August saw the largest domestic soybean meal crush on record, resulting in a 17% increase in soybean meal shipments. Partially offsetting this was a 4% decline in ethanol shipments driven by strong 2014 comps of higher production and shipments.", "Food and refrigerator product volumes were flat for the quarter as strength in import sugar and barley were offset by declines in frozen meat and potato shipments.", "Automotive revenue was flat in the third quarter as a 5% increase in volume was offset by a 5% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 5% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 17.8 million vehicles in the third quarter, up 6% from last year. In auto parts, volume grew 5% driven primarily by increased vehicle production.", "Chemicals revenue was down 6% for the quarter on a 3% reduction in both volume and average revenue per car. We continue to see strength in plastics shipments, which were up 7% in the third quarter due to stable resin pricing and strong export volume. However, our volume gains were more than offset by declines in shipments of both fertilizer and crude oil. Lower grain commodity prices and market uncertainty resulted in farmers delaying fertilizer purchases. This resulted in a 10% decline in our fertilizer volume. Crude oil volume, which was down 40% in the quarter continues to be impacted by lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads.", "Coal revenue declined 18% in the third quarter on a 15% volume decline and 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 12% in the quarter. Low natural gas prices continue to put downward pressure on coal demand as coal share of electricity generation declined from 38% in the third quarter of last year to 35% this year. Coal inventories, which are currently 20 days above the five-year average contributed to the sluggish demand. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 32%, driven again by soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. ", "Industrial products revenue was down 16% on a 12% decline in volume and 4% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Our reduction in shale drilling resulted in a 31% decline in minerals volume, primarily driven by a 36% decrease in frac sand car loadings. ", "Metals volume was down 26% as lower crude oil prices suppressed drilling related shipments and the strong US dollar drove increased imports. Demand for construction products resulted in a 1% volume increase in the third quarter, driven by continued demand in road and construction projects in our Texas [Rock] region.", "Intermodal revenue was down 11% in the third quarter on a 4% lower volume and a 7% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic intermodal volume was up 1% in the third quarter. Even though retail sales were down slightly year-over-year, we still achieved a best ever third quarter of domestic intermodal volume. International intermodal volume was down 9% in the quarter as compared to a strong third quarter of 2014, when cargo owners advanced peak season shipments in anticipation of port labor strikes. With relatively high inventories some international intermodal customers have reduced orders and not all east coast diversions have migrated back to the West Coast. I will update you on peak season in just a minute.", "To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In Ag products, although we have had another strong crop year, low commodity prices and abundant global supply created uncertainty in our volume outlook for grain. In food and refrigerator, we expect continued strength in beer, but we are facing headwinds in other markets from increased truck availability year-over-year.", "We expect automotive sales to remain strong for the rest of the year, driving growth in finished vehicles and part shipments. We continue to expect coal demand to remain below year ago levels due to low natural gas prices, higher than average coal inventories and headwinds in the export coal market. As always, a key factor in demand will be weather conditions.", "Most chemical markets should remain steady for the remainder of the year, with strength expected in LPG. We continue to expect that weak oil prices, reduced production, and unfavorable spreads will remain a significant headwind for crude-by-rail shipments. In industrial products, lower crude oil prices will also continue to challenge our minerals and metals volume through the rest of 2015. While the housing market is slowly strengthening, the strong dollar and relatively weak China lumber import market are driving more imports of Canadian lumber to the US. We continue to expect demand for construction products to remain strong particularly in the southern part of our franchise.", "Finally in intermodal, we continue to see highway conversions and we expect this to be the seventh consecutive year of record domestic intermodal volumes. We expect that relatively soft retail sales will cause headwinds in our international intermodal volumes. ", "Overall, we will continue to focus on solid core pricing gains, strengthening our customer value proposition and developing new business across our diverse franchise.", "With that I'll turn it over to Cameron.", "Cameron Scott", "Thank you Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our year-to-date reportable personal injury rates improved 12% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.92. ", "While we continue to make significant improvements, we won\u2019t be satisfied until we reach our goal of 0% incidents, getting everyone of our employees home safely at the end of each day.", "With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 17% to 3.56, driven by an increase in yard and industry reportables. While our reportable rate has taken a step back this year, we are confident that our strategy aimed at eliminating human factor incidents and hardening our infrastructure will put us back on a path of long-term improvement.", "In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased slightly versus 2014 to 2.25. We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through channels including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. Moving onto network performance, our operating metrics showed a step function improvement in the third quarter with net work velocity reaching levels not achieved since 2013. While weather conditions in the quarter were more favorable from an operating standpoint, year-over-year volume swings and business mix shifts continue to create a dynamic operating environment. However, the men and women at Union Pacific proved up to the challenge, diligently leveraging the strength of our franchise that serve our customers proudly. ", "In regards to service, one of the key metrics we use to track our performance is our service delivery index. The measure, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments improved 8% versus the third quarter of last year. We also generated improvement in our local service product to customers with a 95.3% industry [Indiscernible], which measures the delivery or [polling] of a car to or from a customer. Though we know there is still more work to do and we are working hard everyday to further improve service and reduce cost. ", "Adjusting resources to current demand continued to be a key focus area for us in the third quarter. While we noted back in July that we had our locomotive fleet close to being right sized, we have made meaningful progress adjusting our TE&Y workforce over the past couple of months. By the end of September we had around 2700 TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status, compared with 1200 at the end of the second quarter.", "In addition to adjusting the lower volumes, our improvement in network performance has translated into fewer [Indiscernible] resource demands of our network. Overall, our total ", "TE&Y workforce was down 10% in September versus June. Around half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline.", "Our active locomotive fleet is down 140 units from the end of the second quarter. As we currently sit, we still have some work left to do when our resources at the end of the third quarter were more closely aligned with current demand.", "While resource alignment has been a key focus throughout the year, we have not lost sight of other initiatives, which also drive productivity. We ran record train lengths in nearly all major categories, remaining agile and adapting our transportation plan to current demand. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals, as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with 4% decline in the number of cars switched.", "Growth capacity investments, alongside process improvements, have enhanced our ability to generate productivity and have increased the fluid capabilities of our networks. In addition, our progress in adjusting resources to demand has helped enable gains in asset utilization, including locomotive productivity. While the mix headwind from running lower coal volumes largely drove the 1% decline versus the third quarter of 2014, this fleet productivity metric has improved 6% sequentially from the second quarter levels.", "To wrap up, as we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will yield record results on our way to an incident-free environment. And while we gained significant traction throughout the quarter, we continue making operational improvements by leveraging the strengths of our diverse franchise to deliver service products our customers have come to expect. With our resources now closely in line with demand, we will continue our focus on other productivity initiatives to further reduce costs. Ultimately running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increases returns for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Rob Knight", "Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was just under $5.6 billion in the quarter, down 10% versus last year. A decline in volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue, along with negative business mix more than offset another quarter of solid core pricing.", "Operating expenses totaled just under $3.4 billion, decreasing 13% when compared to last year. Drivers of this expense decline were significantly lower fuel expense, along with volume-related reductions and productivity improvements. The net result was a 5% decrease in operating income to $2.2 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $30 million, up from $20 million in 2014. ", "Interest expense of $157 million was up 9% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the last 12 months. Income tax expense decreased about 7% to $781 million, driven primarily by reduced pretax earnings. Net income decreased 5% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share, down 2% versus last year.", "Now, turning to our top line, freight revenue of $5.2 billion was down 10% versus last year. Volume declined about 6%, and fuel surcharge revenue was down $407 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel price was a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year, and this includes the net impact from both the fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. And as we expected on our last earnings call, business mix was a negative contributor to freight revenue for the third quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in Frac sand, steel shipments, and bulk grains, partially offset by a decline in international intermodal volumes.", "Looking ahead, business mix will continue to be a headwind to freight revenue for the remainder of the year. A 3.5% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. While down slightly from first half levels, core pricing continued at levels that are above inflation and reflects the value proposition that we offer in the marketplace. Of the 3.5% this quarter, about 0.5% can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business that we renewed earlier this year, and this includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy contract renewals.", "Moving onto the expense side, Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 2% versus 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and improved labor efficiency, as we continued to realign our workforce. Labor inflation was about 4% for the third quarter, driven by agreement wage inflation as well as high pension and other benefit expense. For the fourth quarter, we expect labor inflation to also be about 4%. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was flat when compared to 2014.", "And excluding our capital related employees, however, our workforce level declined about 3%, and as Cam just mentioned, we made significant TE&Y reductions in the third quarter, and we are more closely in line with current demand. For the fourth quarter, we now expect our total force levels to be down 1% or so when compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. ", "Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $484 million, down 45% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with an 8% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average fuel price declined 40% to $1.81 per gallon.", "Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 9% to $589 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced repair cost associated with our locomotive and car fleet. Depreciation expense was $507 million, up 5% compared to 2014. We still expect depreciation to increase about 6% for the full year.", "Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $302 million, which is down 3% when compared to 2014. Lower locomotive lease and volume related expenses were the primary drivers. Other expenses came in at $205 million, down 15% versus last year. Decreased freight, equipment and property damage costs along with a reduction in general expenses were the primary drivers. We now expect other expense to be close to flat on a full year basis, excluding any large unusual items.", "Turning now to our operating ratio performance, the third quarter operating ratio came in at a record 60.3%, an improvement of 2 points when compared to the third quarter of 2014. The operating ratio did benefit about 1.5 points from the net impact of lower fuel prices in the quarter. Earlier in the year, we challenged the organization to safely and efficiently right size our resources and reduce cost, and I am pleased with the results that we have been able to achieve. Ongoing productivity initiatives, along with pricing above inflation, have been key drivers to improving our overall margins.", "Turning now to our cash flow, year-to-date cash from operations increased to just over $5.6 billion, and we invested around $3.3 billion in cash capital investments through the first three quarters. ", "Taking a look at the balance sheet, we continue our efforts to rebalance our capital structure, while maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating. Our adjusted debt balance grew about $1.6 billion through the first three quarters of this year, taking our adjusted debt to cap ratio to 44.5%, up from 41.3% at year-end 2014. Our adjusted debt to EBITDA has increased from 1.4 times at year-end to 1.6 times at September 30 on a trailing twelve-month basis. This is consistent with our target ratio of 1.5 plus. Longer term we define that to mean less than two times. ", "Our profitability and cash generation enable us to continue to fund both our capital program and cash returns to shareholders. Year-to-date we have repurchased more than 28 million shares. Almost half of these shares were repurchased in the third quarter. Year-to-date spending totaled $2.9 billion. The third quarter alone was up 45% versus last year to over $1.2 billion. This demonstrates our opportunistic approach in the marketplace, and should not be considered a new quarterly run rate.", "Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned $4.3 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of 2015. This represents roughly a 22% increase over 2014. Why we have made good progress in the third quarter we do expect to see some difficult year-over-year comparisons as we close out 2015.", "In the current demand environment, continued lower volumes versus last year and an even more challenging business mix will bothnegatively impact fourth quarter results. And when we compare it to last year, fuel prices will also continue to have a negative impact on earnings for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind we did report a $0.05 positive fuel benefit in the fourth quarter of last year, making the fuel comparison more challenging year-over-year.", "On the plus side, we will continue to focus on achieving solid core pricing gains and building on the progress that we have made with our cost reduction and productivity initiatives. And when you add it all up, we will fall short of last year\u2019s fourth quarter and full year earnings per share records. As for next year, we are still early in the planning process. It looks like we may have opportunities in many of our business segments, but it also appears that our energy related volumes will continue to be challenged.", "Given the uncertain environment, we are taking a hard look at our capital spending for next year. We haven't finalized our plans, so it too early to tell how it will relate to our long-term guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue. But from an absolute dollar perspective we do currently expect that it will be somewhat less than this year\u2019s $4.2 billion, and the plan does include the acquisition of around 200 locomotives as part of a long-term purchase commitment.", "Overall, we will remain intently focused on running a safe, cost efficient and productive operation, and we remain committed to providing our customers with excellent service and our shareholders with strong financial returns. ", "So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thanks, Rob. As you have heard from the team, we have made great progress in meeting this year's challenges. Our operating metrics have improved to more efficient levels, and our resources are now more closely in line with demand. We will continue our unrelenting focus on operating safely and providing a quality service product for our customers. We will also continue to grow existing business and to establish new markets.", "Even so, as Rob said, there are some question marks as we finish 2015 and head towards next year. One uncertainty, of course, is the extension of the positive train control deadline. We continue to believe that Congress will do the right thing for our country and our customers and will vote to extend the deadline. Beyond that, energy prices, the consumer economy, grain markets, the strength of the US dollar, all will be key to future demand. Over the long term, we are well positioned to safely provide our customers with excellent service, while delivering strong value to our shareholders.", "So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Vernon", "Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Rob or Eric could you help us frame the \u2013 how challenging coal could be next year from a volume outlook if we were to assume kind of normal demand patterns, gas prices kind of staying where they are, are we looking at similar declines as we saw this year or something smaller than that?", "Rob Knight", "As we said David, coal demand really depends on a couple of major factors. One the competitiveness against natural gas, and so what the outlook for natural gas pricing is, and certainly the weather and certainly export markets will have an impact on the coal market. Now at this point if you look at natural gas futures, there is no discernible improvement in that natural gas pricing. So you would assume natural gas will remain very competitive versus coal. I don't think you would project any improvement of coal market share against natural gas pricing and the weather is always an open factor.", "David Vernon", "But deterioration, would you expect \u2013 are there things that about your retirements on your fleet or new builds anywhere in the network that will give you some cause for saying that there is going to be material deterioration assuming the competitiveness remains unchanged?", "Rob Knight", "So, again the main driver is kind of the competitiveness of coal. I think you should also look at the current inventories. The inventories as we mentioned are about 20 days above historical five-year average levels. They are actually about 30 days above last year third quarter levels. So you can assume that there would be some desire of utilities to manage those inventories down to a more normal level.", "David Vernon", "Okay, great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on the pricing, obviously we heard a little bit from one of your interchange partners down in the Central South making some discussions on rates to maybe incentivize some coal burn. How do you guys think about that, are you guys changing your thinking about that given the change in competitiveness right now of coal and natural gas?", "Lance Fritz", "We don't about specific customer issues or specific commercial issues with customers. Our strategy has not changed. We think we have a strong value proposition. We are going to price to the value proposition to generate a return for our company. Our strategy has not changed.", "David Vernon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ken Hoexter", "Great. Good morning. Lance and team, great job on the operating ratio, but now that you are kind of at this 60 level, you maybe talk a little bit about what projects you still have that can improve, obviously we saw tremendous improvement in the velocity during the quarter, is that something that you still see can return to even a couple of year ago levels and there is more room to get that into the 50s, and maybe just talk about what projects you have underway that can keep improving that into the next few years?", "Lance Fritz", "Sure Ken. Before I turn it over to Cameron for a little more technicolor, like we have answered historically, there are just almost limitless opportunities for us to continue to improve the business. What you saw in the quarter and what we have reported for an average quarterly fluidity reflected in velocity has been accelerating through the quarter. So as we are stepping into the fourth quarter we feel pretty bullish about the ability to continue to make gain.", "And the other thing to think aboutfrom a service perspective is while the fluidity of the network at this moment in time looks like it has that any previous period from the standpoint of very good. There are still opportunities in specific service products that we can continue to make strides on. So Cameron, I will give it to you to talk a little bit more specifically about projects for productivity.", "Cameron Scott", "We continue to see opportunities in a number of different areas, including variable cost control, train length growth, terminal productivity, see greater fuel efficiency, and engineering and mechanically \u2013 efficiency initiative to help squeeze out as much productivity as possible. And we are gaining traction in all of these areas as Rob mentioned.", "Ken Hoexter", "Great. I appreciate the insight. If I could just have a quick follow-up on the [fuel] pricing, you mentioned that it decelerated to 3.5% from 4%, is that due to more truck competition, I don\u2019t know, Eric, if you mentioned it, I don\u2019t know if their pricing contract's down or what's driving that, but maybe you can dwell into that a little bit.", "Rob Knight", "Ken, this is Rob. Let me jump on that. A couple of points. One, how we calculate price, very proud of it. That is, we only count what actually moves. So, we calculate the yield, the price. So, the point being, volume has an impact clearly on our reported price. Anything I would say is our attitude. Our focus has not changed at all in terms of our commitment and understanding to drive price as a key contributor to what we've been able to achieve up to this point and it will be a key contributor as we move forward, continuing to get that solid core pricing.", "And I wouldn\u2019t read too much, frankly, into the change from the second quarter to third quarter, because there is volume issues, there is the legacy that we called out. And there is some round, we always round the numbers in terms of what we report here. So, there's not as big of a gap if you will from the second to third as you might otherwise think. Again, our commitment and our focus on pricing is unchanged.", "Ken Hoexter", "I appreciate the comment and insight. Thanks, guys.", "Rob Knight", "Thanks, Ken.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jason Seidl", "Now, thank you, and good morning everyone. You guys talked a little bit about some of the east coast business not falling back to not all there at least flowing back to the west coast ports. Do you think it's now permanently based on the east now, do you think peoples change their supply their supply chains?", "Eric Butler", "This is Eric, Jason. Now, we do not. Frankly, as we said last quarter and I think the previous quarter, we do think that ultimately the cheapest best fastest supply chain will win and that still is west coast ports. There are still probably a couple 3% points of share that migrated over to the east coast ports during the port strike that has not migrated back. We think some of that is just some short term risk management, some hedging for the market and retail inventories. But we fully expect that the shortest quickest, most economic supply chain wins in the end and that's the west coast.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay. Now, that's great color. And Rob, just a quick question on pricing. I think you mentioned that about half a point was due to the legacy mix brought forward, just had. So, as we certain looking out to 16, should start just basing our assumptions on about 3% core pricing?", "Rob Knight", "Nice try.", "Jason Seidl", "You can't [blame the guy]?", "Rob Knight", "No, I get it. I mean, clearly we are saying that you can assume that the legacy is not going to continue, but in terms of what happens underneath or beyond legacy, we haven\u2019t given a precise number of guidance, other than our commitment to core real core pricing gains above inflation. And we're not changing our attitude or focus there. What the number actually ends up being, stay tuned.", "Jason Seidl", "Sounds good. Guys, I appreciate the time as always.", "Rob Knight", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Yes, good morning. You been, I was going to ask a couple of questions on price and I guess is understanding, you are saying you're not changing your approach, but the market can change. And so, I'm wondering whether you perceive that what we heard about from just you and presumably another competitor taking a rate down on call. Do you think that the market is changing in terms of more broadly than that or would you say look there are targeted action that you really shouldn\u2019t read into broadly.", "Because I think you're clear on what you're doing, but the market matters as well. I just want to -- what do we think on whether the market is really going to change or not?", "Lance Fritz", "Tom, this is Lance. Historically, we've always focused on providing an excellent product and then charging for the value that that product represents to our customer base. We faced markets that are very difficult, different headwinds and we faced very robust markets and that philosophy doesn't change. So, we are in a very competitive business. We compete aggressively for the business that we enjoy. And at the same time we expect to receive a price that represents the value that we provide and it has to be reinvestable. All that's real, and all that continues to be real as we look into the future.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Is it fair, I guess, if we look at you versus the market or competitor how you want to characterize that? Over the last several years, it's probably you've been a little bit willing to give up some volume, I think there were some contract moved away from you in coal in 20 -- I think 2013 and 2014. And so, you say well that's an example of being formant pricing being willing to give up a little volume. Is it fair to say that then your behavior and that willingness to give up a little volume to keep prices, is that way we should view you saying we're continuing with the same thing?", "Lance Fritz", "Tom, I wouldn\u2019t change my answer to you at all. We expect to be paid for the value that we represent and we expect to be able to reinvest in our business.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Right, okay. Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.", "Rob Salmon", "Thanks. To get back off of Kens' earlier question on the productivity front. It was very impressive that you guys were able to pretty much extent train length across the network and environment where volumes were down about 6%. Can you give us a sense of what sort of siding constraints you guys are have across the network and the opportunity to expand that further?", "Eric Butler", "Both of the train side as you saw there, equates at about 6000 feet and almost 90% of our network is 7200 feet capable. So, we really don\u2019t have any siding constraints and it is up to us to maximize train length and meet customer commitments. So, well, we have a lot of opportunity in that category going forward.", "Lance Fritz", "Yes. I would add, it's very dependent on the lanes around the network. We still do have targeted capital investment that's oriented towards siding length extensions and being able to increase maximum train length on a particular route over and above what you see as average train length here. So, there are always or right now there are opportunities for us to continue to invest targeted capital to make that happen but we're a far way away from being at our average train length threatening our current siding length.", "Rob Salmon", "Thanks, really. I appreciate that color. With regard to PTC, Lance, you had briefly alluded to it in the prepared comments. Can you give us a sense of what the impact across the network would be if Congress doesn't extend it, and any lessons that you learned from the massive uptick in volume we saw on 2014 that you could deploy. Because to me, reading the announcement, the press release you guys had put out on the topic, it would impact a substantial amount of the network.", "Lance Fritz", "Yes. So, Rob, what we've announced, well we said that we would do is there is not an extension. And again, I'm very optimistic that Congress will be prudent and well, has an extension before we have to take any action. But what we've said is around Thanksgiving, in order to remove TIH from our railroad, we would have to start imposing an embargo. And that would be impactful. That means we'd have to stop allowing interchange product onto us of those commodities as well as start working with customers, try to figure out a way for them to ship it an alternative lines.", "Also we said as we approached the end of the year, we would start working with our Amtrak as well as the commuter agencies that we host to stop passenger traffic. Both of them would be very bad for the U.S. economy and for commuters. The TIH includes commodities like chlorine, that's used to clean drinking water. It includes products that go into fertilizer and other manufacturing processes. So, that would all have an impact on the U.S. economy. And then you can imagine in a place like Chicago, if the commuter lines were to stop running January 1, what commutes would be like for the 300,000 people a day that rely on those commuter lines.", "Rob Salmon", "Thanks so much for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Tom Kim", "Hi, good morning guys. Nice quarter. With regard to the cost side, obviously we're seeing them come down year-and-year but also importantly sequentially. I'm trying to get a sense of like the pace of declines we should be anticipating for the -- the fourth quarter? Do you think the run rate we've seen in Q3, is it a reasonable Q-on-Q?", "Lance Fritz", "Rob.", "Rob Knight", "Yes. Tom. I wouldn't take the run rate because we're satisfied that we make great progress, but that was a pretty steep successful decline from the second quarter which we're very proud of. And all I would say to you is we are going to control the things that we can control and as Cam has mentioned we got continuing opportunities while we make great progress, right sizing and realigning the organization; we are not done yet.", "We're going to continue to take initiatives to squeeze that out and be as effective as we possibly can. So, the run rate probably will be different but the success of our -- continue to be realigned and look for every opportunities we can to further that productivity initiative will continue.", "Tom Kim", "Okay that's helpful, thank you. And then -- hearing. And that chuck is our increasingly competitive with the rails. And there is the common suggesting with pricing down for the TL that are potentially conceiving less share. Obviously, that's more of a certainly a remote open. But I'm just wondering with regard to the rest of your book of business, how much could you sort of size up would be potentially at risk of diversion to trucking. I mean, my sense to that be relatively limited but I just would love to hear your thoughts on that.", "Rob Knight", "Yes. I think if you look at what's going on currently in the trucking environment, the lower fuel cost is allowing trucks to be more competitive vis-a-vis rail just by virtue of that fact. Long term trucks still have the same systemic long term issue that they've always had in terms of driver shortages, some of the productivity headwinds that they have with some of the CSA regulations, the road congestion, etcetera.", "So, we are still very confident of our ability to drive truck conversions which we demonstrated even in the third quarter in earning a model business. Certainly trucks are great competitor and there is some competitive impact that we always, [indiscernible] and effort. We are still positive about the position that we are in as a rail and driving conversions from truck to rail.", "Lance Fritz", "And case and point, you grew domestic intermodal in the third quarter by 1%.", "Rob Knight", "Right.", "Tom Kim", "Outside of intermodal, is it much of a threat or something we should be thinking about?", "Rob Knight", "Trucks are always a competitor. We feel very good about our value proposition and our ability to compete.", "Tom Kim", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Scott Group", "Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.", "Rob Knight", "Good morning.", "Scott Group", "So, Rob, why don\u2019t you just follow-up your comment about head count in the fourth quarter being down about 1%. Could that imply a slight sequential increase from the third quarter average, even though ended the third quarter a lot lower than the average. I guess I'm just not throughout follow the down 1%. Are you adding head count back in the fourth quarter?", "Rob Knight", "No. Scott, I just got to take you back. Remember, we had previously guided that we thought we would finish the year flattish with 2014, I think was roughly 48,000 number. What we're saying now given the confidence we have in the progress we've made today is we expect to end the year with the number being down a percent or so. So, I think compared to where we are now, it's flattish but a good volume and other initiatives will dictate exactly where that number lands but okay that's the map.", "Cameron Scott", "Yes. Our job going forward, Scott, is -- Cameron, continued stay focused on getting the housing order from an operating craft head count. We are also in the process of getting our housing order on a non-agreement perspective. Right, we talked about that in an announcement late in the third quarter. And we've got an opportunity in capital head count particularly in light of Rob's discussion that capital is likely to be down next year. As we exit this year, we got an opportunity to make adjustments there.", "Scott Group", "Okay. And then, Rob, you said a couple of times I think 4% labor inflation. What does next year look like?", "Rob Knight", "We haven't finished our planning first next year, Scott, on a number of initiatives. But I think it's safe to say that the labor inflation will be lower than it was this year. Remember, this year we had the double wage, we had other issues that push the labor inflation full year up closer to that we had 5% to 6% in the first half of the year. So, I think it's competent, we're competent, says it's going to be lower than that. Exactly where that number lands at this point in time, again stay tuned.", "Scott Group", "Okay, great. And just, last just a quick thing on the CapEx. Is your comment that it's going to come down but we may not be able to get it down all the way to 16% of revenue or a lots on table, we could get it even lower than 16%, we just don't know.", "Rob Knight", "Yes. What I'm saying there is the absolute number we would expect to come down, but it may not be in that 16 to 17 guidance range, yet, because remember this year because of the fall-off in the revenue, driven largely by the fall-off in the fuel surcharge revenue.", "And as you know and others know, we don't set our capital plan based on revenue. It's just the kind of guiding marker that we provide to you. So, it's possible that we'll quite make it all the way down to that 16 to 17 depending on how the revenue number looks as we work through our planning process and that's what I am suggesting.", "Scott Group", "Okay, great. Thank you guys.", "Rob Knight", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse group. Please go ahead with your question.", "Allison Landry", "Good morning. So, I know there has been a lot of questions on price, but thinking about core prices of inflation, I was wondering if you could give us the sense of what overall rail inflation is currently running at?", "Rob Knight", "Yes. Allison, this Rob. I mean, this year overall inflation again largely driven by that discussion I just had with the labor line is probably in the above three'ish, so maybe slightly higher than three, full year this year. Again, Allison, as you know, we don't set, again that's another marker similar to my discussion on capital. We don't set our pricing based on any one particular period inflation expectation. That's just a marker that we expect to continue to achieve above, that can be lumpy from one quarter to the next or one period to the next. But to answer your question, inflation overall was three-plus'ish this year.", "Allison Landry", "Okay, that's helpful. And then thinking about intermodal, how much of the decline in the segment stems from your main competitor taking some share back as its network recovers and do you expect a further bleed in the fourth quarter given that the end has opened the northern region and added some new expedited intermodal service from Chicago to the PNW?", "Rob Knight", "Yes. So, Allison, as we mentioned, the decline in our intermodal space was really in the international and the mobile space. And there is really a number of different dynamics that are going on in that. One is not to complete remigration if you will from east coast to west coast so that that is progressing. One is as you know in the liner steam ship business there is a number of different dynamics going on there with the different alliances and different entities deciding what lanes they're going to put their ships in.", "And certainly, kind of the suggested softness in China and other parts of the Asian and them all having the impact on that. So, those are really the drivers in terms of our domestic intermodal franchise. As we mentioned, we grew. This will be the seventh consecutive year of record of volumes. We feel great about our franchise, the position of our franchise and the strength of our franchise.", "Allison Landry", "Okay. So, just to be clear on your answer, BN has not taken any of the share back that you may have gained last year or that's just not a significant factor?", "Cameron Scott", "So, as we talked at earlier earnings releases, we did have, I think Rob said a percent to 2% share benefit last year from business with the difficulties at our competitors, we fully expected that to migrate back and elsewhere in a couple of areas, those were intermodal, those were in grain, those were in coal, and we have NRC and those migrate back and backwards aligned with our expectations.", "Allison Landry", "Okay, great. Thank you, very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go proceed with your question.", "Justin Long", "Thanks, and good morning.", "Rob Knight", "Good morning.", "Justin Long", "Maybe just a follow up on intermodal again. I know right now you're facing headwind from tough international comps, there is uncertainty in the retail space. So, I was just wondering bigger picture, when do you feel this business can get back to more of a GDP or a GDP plus growth environment versus the declines we've seen year-to-date?", "Eric Butler", "Eric. Let me take a stab at that. The longer term, we feel very strong, very bullish on the intermodal product in general that in the long run is going to be driven in large part by U.S. consumers and consuming both international product as well as domestic product. It's also predicated on our ability to have a service product that can penetrate against a truck. And all of those secular dynamics are set up positively for the long run.", "In terms of dislocations that are happening in the short term, it's hard to time things out. It is very dependent on what happens in the U.S. economy, what the jobs pictures look like what the earning picture for consumers look like, what the U.S. dollar is doing. Adds then to all that, we're focused on controlling what we can control which is an excellent service product. We got the best franchise from a domestic and international intermodal perspective in the U.S. and that will serve us well over the long run.", "Justin Long", "Okay, great. And maybe then just follow-up on that. Looking at your intermodal business today, I know it varies by lane but what's the average discount for intermodal versus truck in your network today. And longer term, where do you think that percentage could go without causing a significant slowdown in intermodal volume growth?", "Eric Butler", "Yes. We've said historically, a 15% to 20% as a rough we look on, would be part of our core strategy of course, to minimize that as we increase our value proposition.", "Justin Long", "Okay, great. I will leave it to that. Thanks for the time.", "Eric Butler", "Yes, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Alex Saraci with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.", "Alex Saraci", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, you guys have obviously made a lot of progress on aligning the resources in light of the softer volumes. And I know the volume outlook is uncertain in a lot of areas right now and it's tough to actually point to where and what might drive an acceleration. But should volumes actually start beginning to surprise to the upside in 2016 for whatever reason?", "How do we think about your ability to kind of leverage the resources you have right now and do you feel like there is a lot of operating leverage in the business in where your resources are currently or would you anticipate you have to kind of add back pretty aggressively. I know it's kind of depends on what the volumes actually translate but how do we just sort of think about the operating leverage intermodal if volumes actually do surprise the upside?", "Lance Fritz", "Alex, we would welcome nothing more than a surprise on the upside in terms of volume next year. And we are well positioned to be able to absorb that into the existing network. Cameron has got adequate locomotives and crews ready all around the network to be able to handle an uptick. The fluidity in the network would be able to absorb it rapidly.", "He and the operating team have done a great job in terms of getting the terminal and yard productivity up, and we will be able to bring in cars readily into that environment and handle it fluidly. And between Eric and Cameron and the rest of the team, they've done a stupendous job on stabilizing our train plan and making sure that it's robust enough to be able to handle some incremental growth. So, that would have significant leverage for us and we'd welcome it.", "Alex Saraci", "Okay, that makes sense. And then just my second question here on, you suggested that there are some headwinds in the fourth quarter and that earnings per share would probably be down on a year-over-year basis. Can we kind of can you help us think directionally relative to the kind of 2% decline you saw in the third quarter? Can we expect another similar low single digit decline in the fourth quarter or probably a bit of a worse year-over-year move there, given some of the puts and takes?", "Rob Knight", "Alex, this is Rob. What I am calling out there, I mean, we'll see how the world actually plays out in terms of volume. But as we look at this point, we're not giving precise earnings guidance. It does look like we're going to have a bigger headwind in the fourth quarter on mix year-over-year and the reason for that is last year's mix actually was quite favorable. And if you look at the business, we were running sand fairly strong, coal was relatively strong, Ag was a pretty positive mix player. And those are things that we just don't see repeating in the fourth quarter.", "In addition, as I called out, we see a headwind year-over-year in fuel because last year's fourth quarter we got the benefit of about a nickel of the timing of fuel the fourth quarter last year which we don't see that reporting repeating again this year. So, I am calling out that year-over-year, it does look to us like the fourth quarter does have some bigger challenges than frankly the third quarter did.", "Alex Saraci", "Okay, that makes sense. Thanks very much for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Hey, thanks, good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the coal network and the outlook for next year. Obviously, still some challenges particularly market share relative to natural gas. When you think about the network, one of your eastern competitors has started to make some changes in terms of the network, that's a little bit more structural in nature. I guess I'm just curious from your perspective how you think about that as you look out to 2016 and maybe beyond, given the coal outlook. Are there things that need to be done there or things you could do to potentially improve that the value proposition there?", "Lance Fritz", "Chris, before I hand it over to Cameron for a little more technic color, the thing to note about our coal network is it's largely run on a shared network. So, we have made fundamental adjustments in resources that reflect coal being down. You see that in our adjustment to [T&Y] craft, the locomotives, it's also embedded in some of the cars that we've stored. And we're constantly looking at our assets as they are currently deployed to make sure they fit the demand profile for commodity like coal. Cameron?", "Cameron Scott", "You are exactly right, Lance. And our coal network is truly built out. So, for us it's really more of how we manage the tangible assets around locomotives and crews and we'll continue to do that. Having said that, we'll continue to study the assets around our coal network and react appropriately.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay, that's helpful color, I appreciate it. And then, Rob, just coming back to you on the buyback just for a second. Obviously, you talked about it not being a run rate in the third quarter and that makes complete sense to me, I guess. If you could help us maybe think about how you might be opportunistic going forward, I guess I just want to get maybe a rough sense of maybe how you view that proposition as you think about this quarter and next is in terms of the buyback and the run rate we should be expecting?", "Rob Knight", "Yes. I mean, Chris, I mean, you probably could. Right, my answer here and everyone would say, I mean, we're not giving precise guidance, because in terms of what we're in buyback. Because if we don't do that, I mean, we certainly value and understand the value of a continued buyback program.", "And we kind of walked our talk there. And as we've always said, we will be opportunistic in the marketplace, based on factors like the price of the stock. So, all those are factors in terms of how it will look as we play out into the next several quarters. We will continue to take the same mindset if you will, in terms of how we approach the opportunity and approach how many shares we actually do buyback.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay, that makes sense. Thanks very much guys, I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.", "Bascome Majors", "Yes, good morning guys. I want to ask another one on the coal here. How much of the mid team's volume decline that you're tracking towards for this year? Would you attribute to the year-over-year decline in natural gas prices?", "Eric Butler", "Bascome, this is Eric. It varies. I would say the vast majority of the decline is in some way or the other attributable to natural gas prices. As you know, they are different high sell regions that we operate in and the impact of natural gas is different in those regions. But I would say vast majority is attributable at the end of the day to the competitiveness of coal with natural gas with one other factor and that's being our export coal market, just the worldwide export coal prices, that's also a factor.", "Bascome Majors", "Understood, I appreciate that. And just to follow-up, I know there is a lot of significant moving parts here, but say natural gas prices are flat next year, so you don't have that magnitude of a year-over-year headwind on that front and winter is normal. Just roughly speaking, what kind of 2016 coal volume outcome are you looking at here? I mean, is this the situation where you could be down double-digits again or is kind of mid-single digits more of what you guys are planning for?", "Eric Butler", "Hey, Bascome, as I mentioned earlier, one of the other factors that is a factor is the current level of coal inventories that now at the end of the third quarter there are 30 days higher than where they were last year and 20 days higher than the average five year average. So, I would say is their expectation to assume utilities would work those down, not only maybe even to the averages or below the averages, but they're trying to be in inventory management mode.", "Bascome Majors", "Understood. I appreciate the time this morning. Thank you.", "Eric Butler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Yes good morning everyone and congrats on the good quarter here. I know cutting budget can be pretty difficult. So, Lance, by my calculation has been about 12 minutes since you got a question on pricing. So, I'm going to come back to it because I honestly think that's probably the biggest concern for your shareholders right now. But I just want to ask a more general question about the industry right now because it's kind of two parts here.", "If you look across the industrial landscape, we are definitely seeing deflationary pressure for a lot of your companies. Energy CapEx is likely to be down again next year and obviously commodity prices are a lot lower. So, it's just less value to extract from that supply chain when you think about it holistically. But then, secondly, I mean, the industry obviously has an issue here at PTC, we're late relative to while that was probably poorly written, but none the less in this environment where your customers are facing a lot challenges and we do have regulatory issues, how do we balance the reinvestment to service and the price equation such that we try to keep all the constituents happy?", "Lance Fritz", "That's an excellent question, Brandon; one that we are constantly working on. Our primary focus, first and foremost is a robust reliable excellent service product and in that context it's making that service product better than the alternatives. That puts us in a position to be able to secure a price premium. And that represents the value of that service product. So, long as we're in that position, then we can handle the rest of the pressure points appropriately.", "And when it comes to a regulation, our best defense in a regulatory environment is happy customers and customers that are getting an excellent service product. That won't stop the conflict around the pricing discussions that we have, it won't stop regulators from wanting to find ways to regulate us. But it will stop some of the pressure and that's our biggest defense when we focus on those.", "Brandon Oglenski", "I appreciate that. And is there risk here though that if we face further declines, which it feels like we are in the fourth quarter, that this whole process just takes a little bit slower pace in terms of where our margin improvement return improvement, just understanding that we have a lot of other pressures across the industrial landscape?", "Lance Fritz", "We are keenly focused on making sure we generate a really attractive return on our investing capital. Embedded in that is trying to make sure we continue to improve our margins. I think we've outlined today that there are ample opportunities to continue to make that happen. One of them is price, but it's only one of the mechanisms and that's what we're focused on.", "Brandon Oglenski", "I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question's from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Thanks, very much and good morning. So, you cited a high retail inventory levels, the volume impediment for the last couple of quarters and I'm just curious how far along you think we are in drawing down those inventories and putting the inventory correction behind us?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes. We've actually only mentioned it this quarter and little bit last quarter. So, it really depends on the consumer. Consumer confidence does appear to be strong, it does appear to be a trend where consumers are paying down debt and spending on non-product things like data, internet, healthcare services, etcetera. I do think if you talk to a lot of the BCO's and the retailers, they do have an expectation that with consumer confidence remaining strong, there should be a pickup during the holiday season of sales but time will determine whether or not that happens.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just a very quick one on cost. You called out $50 million of inefficiencies last quarter which is down from a $100 million in the first quarter. And wondering what fell in the third quarter, if anything?", "Rob Knight", "Cherilyn, this is Rob. Yes, we made good progress on that. Remember that marker that I was sharing with you in the first and second quarter was against the previous year and we feel very good about as Cam walked through. We feel very good about the quarter progress we made in better aligning our resources. Having said that, we are not done. I mean, that's last year it wasn't the end of the game.", "So, we still see opportunities for us to continue to squeeze out productivity initiatives on multiple fronts and we are going to continue to do that. But in answer to your direct question of compared to what I showed you last quarter on the year-over-year, we made very good progress in taking out those inefficiencies that we showed you in the second quarter.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Okay, thank you. That's my two.", "Rob Knight", "Thank you, Cherilyn.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of John Barnes, RBC Capital Markets. Please go with your question.", "John Barnes", "Hey, thank you. And looking at the couple of the kind of car load outlooks on the positive side that you provided, I need the one they are starting to get a little bit of attention is the auto side. I know right now autos' continues to be very strong but with a soar that is at the historical kind of upper end of the range, any concern there that if you see a bit of a correction maybe a normalize level of production.", "And especially given the case you mentioned, we got retooling going on at a couple of Mexican facilities for GM and Chrysler. Is there any concern that you start to see maybe some of that growth in the auto sector slack off as we go into the new year?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, John. I think that's a great question. Certainly as you mentioned, the SAAR's rate is kind of at a barn burner rate. The amount of debt associated with auto loans is that. I think the auto manufacturers would still be pretty bullish because of the features that they think they're providing to the consumer, and the average age of automobiles out there. But the sales rate is at a high number and so that by definition would indicate a little caution and concern.", "We don\u2019t have too much concern about model changeovers. There is always model changeovers. We see that year-in year-out. We have the benefit of a very broad diverse autos franchise and somewhere there\u2019s always that happening. So, we don\u2019t see that as too big an issue, but certainly the sales rate, the amount debt associated with sales, you could say something there to watch out for.", "Lance Fritz", "Hey, John. Regardless of what SAAR is. What we really are pleased with is the UP Automotive franchise. It\u2019s outstanding, it gives us great access to Mexico, products produced in Mexico, gives us great access to the ports of products produced over season imported. And we have an excellent distribution system for finished vehicles on in the Western United States. We're in a very good place when it comes to the automotive franchise.", "John Barnes", "Yes, no doubt. I\u2019m glad to see you taking advantage of that now. I just with a couple of the other pressure points out there and although having been kind of one of the bright spots I was getting a little nervous about. You need time to see a turnaround, maybe begin to return to normalization. That\u2019s just the reason for the question. One follow-up on the buyback, Rob, you talked about opportunistic in and I\u2019m just kind of curious, have you done buybacks overtime?", "Have you ever gone back in and you done a look at the success of your buyback program as maybe a program done a little bit more ratable per quarter a little bit kind of more consistent in terms of the absolute dollar spend or the absolute shares bought back versus maybe timing it a little bit and being more opportunistic in and if you ever looked at that and doesn't that guide you at all in terms of how you approach your buyback effort?", "Rob Knight", "John, this probably will shock you, but we look at it every day and feel are very comfortable that what we have done to-date works for us. And we're not changing our approach or that how we look at it but I understand the point of your question, but rest assured, we look at what\u2019s the right way to deal with this and we\u2019re confident that we are doing the right thing.", "John Barnes", "Very good. All right, thanks for your time today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Matt Troy", "Thank you. Just a housekeeping question. I noticed in your commentary about expenses specifically on comp and benefits. You did not reference and sent it comping crew. The other railroad, it\u2019s been about tailwind to a two and a $0.2 to $0.6 per quarter. I\u2019m just trying to think about forward modeling in fourth quarter, was there a positive impact that you just didn\u2019t call out or is there potentially a larger crew up that we\u2019d expect to see in the fourth quarter as we round the quarter in the yearend?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, Matt, this is Rob. Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t see any general -- not calling out that there would be any change in terms of the direction we've been and we haven\u2019t changed our approach. And so I don\u2019t anticipate of being any big swing in that.", "Matt Troy", "Okay, thank you for that. And then just the second question would be on coal longer term. Obviously, the eastern rails have had to or and will have to continue to live under the threat of environmental regulations, which basically coin the question of viability of some of their sourcing basins as well as their customers. Some of the pushback we get from investors and union specific is hey those guys are kind of have to live through it to the next five years.", "It\u2019s a long time ahead of us but just wanted to get a sense, have you at very high level looked at whether it\u2019s plants being decommissioned, shutting down, or new gas-fired turbines coming online with your system. What potentially just could be vulnerable of your existing business as we look at over let's call it three to five years basis in terms of just sourcings which is just the viability of certain customers? Thanks.", "Eric Butler", "Hey Matt, this is Eric. We look at that in depth continuously as part of our strategic and tactical analysis of our market. I would say that at a high level, coal continues to represent ongoing forward probably and necessary minimum third of electrical generation in the U.S. short of some new technology, I'll call it Star Trek technology just for short hand purposes.", "Coal, of necessity is going to be a part of the electrical generation of this country for the foreseeable future. And so I think you could perhaps the coal get to a minimum I'll call it a 30% market share but short of some really new generational technology and I think you'll right now for the foreseeable future that\u2019s probably the minimum that will be.", "Lance Fritz", "Matt, this is Lance. So, I want to provide a little editorial comment as well. I think United States is blessed with the coal reserves that we are and our ability to generate electricity with coal, relatively cleanly, and it\u2019s never been as clean as it is today. It would be a mistake from the U.S. economy perspective, our competitiveness globally to continue to regulate that out artificially. I think we have to work on continuous improvement with the emissions from coal fuel generation, but it would be a mistake to artificially retard that too much.", "Matt Troy", "Understood. Thanks for the detail everyone.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.", "Cleo Zagrean", "Good morning and thank you for your time. My first question also on price. Against very strong yield that fuelled this quarter, the relative weakness in automotive and intermodal; could you please comment on the driver there whether it is mainly mix or comparative dynamics and how you expect them to play out into next year? And specifically, do you expect domestic intermodal to grow more strongly than international, with potentially positive impact on price? Thank you.", "Rob Knight", "Hey, Cleo. The numbers that you see in autos and intermodal from kind of in our yield standpoint is really hindered by the fuel cost surcharge reduction. That's more than a 100% of that impact.", "Lance Fritz", "And then, your second question was Mexico versus international on intermodal?", "Cleo Zagrean", "No. Just [indiscernible]. I simply added back an estimated 4% to 5% fuel impact through each of the price boat of ton-mile numbers that we see there and I appreciate that fuel impact would be different across safe categories. But so maybe then you could comment, is that are we missing something by seeing auto and intermodal as weakest in terms of yield but for mile year-on-year? And then my second question was whether domestic should grow faster, domestic overall than international next year and that's get some help to pricing overall from mix perspective. Thank you.", "Rob Knight", "Quick -- Cleo, this is Rob. Let me take that first question. I would caution you not to just use straight line numbers on it because I think the piece to answer to your question what you're missing, I think what you're missing in that analysis is mix. Mix has an impact within each of the commodity groups in terms of what ends up being reported as average revenue per car on top of each of their individual impacts from the fuel surcharge.", "So, I would just caution you that there are differences within each commodity group.", "Lance Fritz", "Yes. And as you know we are not going to give guidance in terms of pricing in the future. We do think that the domestic intermodal market should continue to have strong pricing opportunities in 2000 and as we go into the future.", "Cleo Zagrean", "Okay, but faster or slower than international with all the noise we had this year?", "Rob Knight", "There is a lot of input, a lot of ins and outs that happen. There are lots of dynamics as you know going on in the international intermodal market that are dynamics being driven by other countries and steam ship liner carriers. We feel good about our value proposition. We feel very good about our domestic intermodal franchise and our ability to get price on that.", "Cleo Zagrean", "Okay, I appreciate that. And the second question relates to CapEx. Can you please remind us of the share that you consider discretionary versus maintenance or require renditions given shifts in the geography of demand and highlight for us those discretionary areas in which it appears prudent with step back this time? Thank you very much.", "Rob Knight", "Cleo, we've historically said and I don't think it's changed much to kind of maintain what we've currently got is about $2 billion plus minus number and after that it's things like technology, PTC, capacity additions, commercial facilities, new equipment, etcetera.", "Cleo Zagrean", "Okay. And would you be willing to share any as if you're speaking to an engineer, what areas would you like to you think you see maybe prudent for as best candidate for retrenching next year?", "Rob Knight", "As we are making our capital plans next year, we're just constantly evaluating both capital productivity in terms of dollar per unit that we put in the ground or buy and where exactly we're putting it. So, I won't make any commentary on exactly what those plans look like.", "Cleo Zagrean", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ben Hartford", "Thanks, good morning. Rob, a quick question. I just wanted to use your perspective on the risks to continue to return on asset improvement for the rail line. You've done a great job doubling it over the past seven years. We talked a lot about pricing on this call but if you think about just the three simple factors to drive that higher going forward pricing volume growth and service improvement. In your mind, what is the biggest risk or a point of concern from your perspective as it relates to inhibiting continued ROA improvement for the rail lines of those three kind of fundamental inputs?", "Rob Knight", "Yes. I mean you're exactly right, Ben. That the lever says you've heard us talking as you fully understand the levers that draw this from where we once where to where we are today are productivity which is driven by the service. That sort of has also enabled us to get the right place in the marketplace and volume is always our friend in that calculus.", "We are going to control those that we can best control. So, I would say, frankly, the biggest risk I see at this point is that which we have less control on and that's the economy and what that then gives us in terms of volume to play with. But as I've said many times and you've heard us say, we're not going to use the lack there of volume to slow us down on our initiatives to continue to make progress on that which we can control, but that's what we are going to continue to do as we have over the last decade.", "Ben Hartford", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jeff Kauffman", "Boy, you guys are popular. Congratulations. Question for Eric, kind of broader picture. As we look at the four areas that are kind of the biggest areas of the volume decline right now, so I will throw coal in there, metals, crude and frac, when are you hopeful that you will start to see positive year-to-year comparisons and then I have a follow-on related to that.", "Eric Butler", "I think as we've been saying throughout the call, there is uncertainty about the going forward outlook in all of those and I am not sure our prediction will predict us any better than anyone else. Certainly the strong dollar is impacting our metal steel business, our domestic metal steel business, oil prices will be a direct factor in terms of the amount of drilling the amount of crude by rail and then the natural gas will be a direct driver in terms of the amount of coal. So, at those points, an ability to predict those items and that\u2019s right, have any better ability than anybody else in the marketplace to do that.", "Jeff Kauffman", "Yes. I was just curious in your view, yes. All right. Let me just follow-up on that. The question was asked earlier, you're attacking the variable cost and you are getting a lot more momentum with that. And I think you mentioned we're not going to do much with the fixed cost in the coal network, but as you look at the railroad and how these business units have changed just over the last 12 months, where do you think there are opportunities to attack the fixed cost infrastructure beyond just taking down employees and taking down locomotives and assets dedicated to it?", "Lance Fritz", "Jeff, this is Lance.", "Jeff Kauffman", "Yes.", "Lance Fritz", "I don't think we said we're not going after fixed cost. We focused the commentary on some of the variable cost, but where we have opportunity to for instance reduce our CapEx or for instance reduce the physical footprint of shops that maintain locomotives or other areas like that. We're going to take advantage of those as well.", "I think what we were trying to impart is that our coal network is not isolated and independent from our overall network. And so it would be very hard to tease out individual physical assets hard assets that are completely dedicated to coal and isolated on their own.", "Jeff Kauffman", "Okay. So, hence the shared network term. Lance, thank you.", "Lance Fritz", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Don Brown with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead with your question.", "Don Brown", "Good morning, everyone. Real quick, and I kind of just trying to do some back of the envelope math here in -- look at what has been a 40% decline in fuel and as translated into essentially what is a 7.9% headwind in pricing, if I look at your reduction and yield realized and the core pricing of 3.5% that you stated.", "Would that imply that you would even if you were to go flat from the current levels that at least in the early part of next year you would have to -- he was looking at a 16% decline. I feel you'd have to achieve it essentially at 3.2% or higher core pricing in order for pricing realized to be flat?", "Lance Fritz", "Rob?", "Rob Knight", "Don, you may have stumped me in terms of the actual numbers that you just worked through because I frankly wasn\u2019t probably --.", "Don Brown", "Relatively speaking.", "Rob Knight", "Yes. But I would just say that mix is clearly a factor in that, so just be careful in your analysis to factor that in.", "Don Brown", "Sure.", "Rob Knight", "And again, all I would say about the pricing, is, we are going to continue to focus on driving value to our customers, continue to drive productivity and continue to drive price where we can in the marketplace. And we know that the underlying value of our service product to customers is a key component to that and it all kind of hangs together there. So, we're going to continue to focus on driving as much as we can on it.", "Don Brown", "Well, so, even with the best service available are you going to be able to go to customers whose volumes are down in the high single digit low double-digit range and as far and receive better than 3% pricing?", "Lance Fritz", "Don, this is Lance. There is never a conversation at our commercial team enters into with the customer on price; that's easy. It doesn't matter if their volumes' up or the volumes' down. So, clearly Eric and his team into the environment that we are in right now have secured what in the third quarter 3.5% coal price and then in the previous quarters as much as 4% coal price. Though none of that came easy or was a layout and I expect them to continue that good hard work into next year's securing an appropriate price for the value that we represent to our customers.", "Don Brown", "Fair enough, good luck.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you very much, Rob. And thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific, this morning. We look forward to talking with you again in January.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, the Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the first quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.16 per share, which compares to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 8% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in four of our six commodity groups, with coal and industrial products down 34% and 10% respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot this quarter, with carloads up 7% versus 2015.", "Our quarterly operating ratio [OR] came in at 65.1%, up only 0.3 percentage point from the first quarter last year, as solid core pricing and productivity improvements helped offset the significant decrease in total volumes. In this challenging volume environment, we've continued our intense focus on operating safely and efficiently, managing our resources, and improving our customer experience.", "Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric.", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning.", "In the first quarter, our volume was down 8%, with the gain in automotive and solid chemicals volume more than offset by declines in the other businesses. While we generated core pricing gains of just over 2.5%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharges and significant mix headwinds, as average revenue per car declined 6% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 14% reduction in freight revenue.", "Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 6% on a 4% percent volume reduction and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume declined 7%, as strength in domestic feed markets was more than offset by soft export demand. Domestic feed grain was up 4%, as animal counts increased and there was less local grain available in our key domestic destination markets in the Mid-South and West. Exports declined 26%, as ample worldwide production and the strong dollar continued to hamper U.S. grain exports.", "Grain products volume declined 6% in the quarter. DDGs were down 29%, driven by a decline in exports to China and increased inclusion in feed rations in the Midwest. Soybean meal carloads were down 9%, as U.S. exports declined from last year's record sales. Ethanol volumes were flat despite lower margins and higher inventories. Food and refrigerated product carloads grew 3%, driven by continued strength in demand for import beer.", "Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter, as a 7% increase in volume was more than offset by an 8% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments increased 5%, driven by consumer demand for technology and safety features. The seasonally adjusted annual rate [SAAR] for first quarter automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles, above last year levels of 16.7 million vehicles but below the fourth quarter pace of 17.8 million vehicles. Lower fuel prices sustained increased demand for light-duty trucks and sport utility vehicles over passenger cars. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and the continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 10% increase in volume.", "Chemicals revenue was down 2% for the quarter on flat volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Year-over-year crude oil shipments were down 32% due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Chemical volumes excluding crude oil shipments were up 4% in the quarter. Fertilizer was down 8%, due primarily to weak global potash demand. Soft domestic agricultural economics also was a headwind for fertilizer volumes. Strength in other areas, including growth in industrial chemicals and LPG volumes, offset the declines in crude oil and fertilizer shipments.", "Coal revenue declined 43% in the quarter on a 34% volume decline and a 13% decrease in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin rail shipments were down 38%, and Colorado/Utah volumes were down 35% in the quarter, as the warm winter, low natural gas prices, and soft exports continue to negatively impact coal demand. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this was the warmest winter on record. With natural gas prices around $2.00 or less for much of the first quarter, PRB coal inventory levels are at 108 days, 41 days above the five-year average.", "Industrial products revenue was down 18% on a 10% decline in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Mineral volumes were down 38% year over year for the quarter. Frac sand carloadings decreased 49% due to reduced drilling activity and market shifts to local ground sand. Metal shipments were down 13% due to the strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, reduced drilling, and increased imports. Demand for construction products, particularly rock and cement, improved 5% in the quarter, driven by favorable weather conditions which supported construction activity. Waste volume was also up 14% during the quarter, driven by growth in dirt shipments.", "Intermodal revenue was down 9% in the quarter on 3% lower volume and a 6% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic shipments declined by 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by high inventory levels and continued sluggish retail sales. The U.S. Census Bureau reported business inventories were unchanged during the quarter, and further declines in sales pushed the number of months it would take to clear shelves of inventory to the highest level since 2009.", "International Intermodal volume was down 3% due to trans-Pacific market challenges. Slower global trade continues to pressure trans-Pacific rates, resulting in ocean carrier rationalization, and market share losses by Union Pacific-aligned carriers. The return of competitive premium services at P&W also contributed to our volume declines in Intermodal.", "To wrap up, let's take a closer look at our outlook for the rest of the year. Many economic projections continue to forecast market volatility and a sluggish economy. Although we face economic challenges, our diverse franchise continues to provide growth opportunities. In Ag products, strong worldwide crop production suggests little change to the current export environment, and we expect Gulf wheat will continue to be softer in the first half of the year due to large global wheat supply and U.S. competitiveness in world markets. Partially offsetting global macroeconomic conditions, we anticipate strength in domestic corn, driven by increased poultry production. We also expect import beer growth.", "Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted at 17.8 million vehicles, a 2% increase above the 2015 seasonally adjustable annual rate of 17.5 million vehicles, driving both finished autos and parts, including over-the-road conversions. While we expect low gasoline prices will continue to sustain demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales supporting these levels.", "Due to declines in the demand for coal, we expect volume to be down significantly. High inventory stockpiles and low natural gas prices will continue to impact demand. As always, electricity consumption will be driven by weather conditions.", "Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain steady through 2016, with growth in LPG markets and industrial chemicals. Strained agricultural economics and soft wheat exports are expected to put downward pressure on the fertilizer market this year. Year-over-year weakness in crude shipments is expected to continue for the balance of the year.", "In industrial products, mineral volumes are expected to be down as a result of weak drilling demand. We anticipate strength in lumber and construction volumes, with rock as the biggest driver of growth. The strong dollar could continue to create headwinds for our metals market.", "Finally, in Intermodal, we see growth potential in domestic Intermodal from highway conversions, though muted by high retail inventories and sluggish retail sales. With trans-Pacific market challenges, we expect continued volatility in international Intermodal. As we navigate worldwide economic uncertainties, we will continue to stay focused on strengthening our customer value proposition and cultivating new business opportunities across our diverse franchise.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an operating update.", "Cameron A. Scott - Executive Vice President-Operations", "Thanks, Eric, and good morning.", "Starting with our safety performance, our first quarter reportable personal injury rate improved 12% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75 [incidents per 200,000 employee-hours]. These results continue to validate the effectiveness of our comprehensive strategy in finding and addressing risk in the workplace.", "With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate of 3.23 [incidents per 1 million train miles] increased slightly versus last year. However, enhanced TE&Y [Train, Engine & Yard] training and continued infrastructure investment helped reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet the reportable threshold, to a record low.", "In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.37 [accidents per 1 million train miles], as we took a step backward from last year's solid performance. However, we are confident that our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns will drive improvement in the future.", "In summary for overall safety, the team has carried forward the momentum from last year's record results as we progress towards an incident-free environment.", "In addition to safety, we have continued to make significant incremental progress in our operating metrics. As reported to the AAR [American Association of Railroads], velocity and terminal dwell improved 11% and 7% respectively when compared to the first quarter of 2015. In fact, our first quarter velocity of 27.3 miles per hour was the best ever at the level of volume handled during the quarter. We were able to generate this solid performance even in the face of March flooding events that impacted operations on several key routes in the southern region of our network. To minimize delays and disruptions for our customers, we temporarily utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews, mostly from alternative work status, as our employees worked around the clock to restore operations.", "Moving on to resources, driven by the decline in volume and improved network fluidity, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the first quarter versus the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled some furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed. As a result, the number of TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status has declined slightly from 3,900 [employees] at the beginning of the year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 15% from the first quarter of 2015.", "In addition, we also continue to adjust other aspects of our business to lower demand. At the end of the first quarter, we had around 600 total engineering and mechanical employees on furlough as well.", "While balancing our resources continues to be a key focus, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through many other productivity initiatives. One primary area where we continue to make progress is in train length. While we were unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals, as initiatives led to record terminal productivity, even with a 5% decline in the number of cars switched. Overall, we've continued to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network.", "In summary, we've made solid progress to start off the year and completed the quarter on a strong footing. Moving forward, we expect to further momentum as we focus on those critical initiatives that will drive improvement. First and foremost is safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on our way toward zero incidents.", "While near-term uncertainty remains in the current volume environment, we will continue adjusting our resources to demand while also realizing productivity through other company initiatives to further reduce costs. This includes our capital investments, where we have adjusted our 2016 capital program down by $75 million to $3.675 billion. Over the longer term, we are in a tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will enhance our value proposition with an excellent customer experience.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results.", "Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, a challenging business mix, and lower fuel surcharges more than offset solid core pricing achieved in the quarter.", "Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Strong productivity improvements, along with volume-related reductions and lower fuel costs, drove the 14% improvement compared to last year. The net result was a 15% decrease in operating income to $1.7 billion.", "Below the line, other income totaled $46 million, up $20 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by gains from real estate sales and lower environmental costs. Interest expense of $167 million was up 13% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Income tax expense decreased 17% to $587 million, driven primarily by lower pre-tax earnings.", "Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 15% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share.", "Now turning to our top line, freight revenue of $4.5 billion was down 14% versus last year. Volume declined 8% and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $334 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.10 headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. And keep in mind that we did report an $0.08 positive fuel benefit in the first quarter of 2015.", "As expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative 2.5% impact on freight revenue in the first quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel, and export Ag shipments, partially offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes.", "Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at just over 2.5%. Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace.", "Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was about 1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which was partially offset by pension favorability.", "Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count declined 11% or more than 5,000 when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Remember that we still were realigning our resources and had a number of employees in the training pipeline at this time last year. Sequentially, total workforce levels were also down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year and longer term, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volume. But as always, we expect to offset some of the volume variability with productivity. Labor inflation is still expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by wage inflation and health and welfare, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year.", "Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $320 million, down 43% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices along with a 13% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.25 per gallon.", "Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense decreased 12% to $569 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets.", "Depreciation expense was $502 million, up 2% compared to 2015, driven primarily by a higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.", "Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $289 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, improved cycle times, and lower locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of the decline. Other expenses came in at $249 million, down 4% versus last year. A decrease in personal injury and casualty expenses were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% excluding any large unusual items.", "Turning now to our operating ratio performance, the first quarter operating ratio came in at 65.1%, 0.3 points unfavorable when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Fuel did have a negative 0.5-point impact in the quarter. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, our enhanced focus on productivity, right-sizing our resources to current demand, and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to strong operating ratio performance.", "Turning now to our cash flow, in the first quarter, cash from operations totaled almost $2.2 billion, up slightly when compared to the first quarter of 2015. The timing of tax payments, primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending, along with changes in working capital more than offset the decrease in net income. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $1 billion for the quarter.", "Taking a look at the balance sheet, our cash balance at quarter end was unusually high as a result of our $1.3 billion debt issuance in March. This increased our all-in adjusted debt balance to about $18.3 billion at quarter end. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times, up from 1.7 times at year end, as we continue to target a ratio of less than two times.", "In the first quarter, share repurchases exceeded 9.3 million shares and totaled over $700 million. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased almost 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter.", "So that's a recap of the first quarter results. As we look to the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are a number of factors which will impact our results. Our energy-related volumes, especially coal, will continue to be challenged. We acknowledge that coal volumes in the first quarter finished well below what we had anticipated coming into the year, primarily due to unseasonably warm weather that persisted throughout the winter along with continued low natural gas prices. That said, we are still going to try again to give you our best sense of where we think second quarter coal volumes will be. If volume levels stay where they are today, coal could be down as much as 30% or so for the second quarter versus last year.", "In total, we would expect second quarter volumes to be down around 10% or so. Overall volume comparisons should get easier in the second half. So at this point, for the full year, we expect total volumes to be down in the mid-single-digit range. The impact of fuel prices on net earnings should start to moderate in the second quarter, assuming fuel prices and spreads remain approximately where they are today. While we still expect some mix pressure for the remainder of the year, the magnitude should be less than what we have experienced in the last couple of quarters.", "In addition, as Cam just mentioned, we are tightening the capital plan somewhat and reducing our capital spending by $75 million to $3.675 billion for the full year. This is a reduction of over $600 million from last year.", "We are still counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio for the full year. In an uncertain volume environment, we are focusing our efforts on the steps we can take to make Union Pacific a better company. Key to this is our Grow to 55 plus Zero initiative, which is our effort to drive our operating ratio to 55% over the longer term. The entire organization is energized and aspiring to new and improved levels of performance, in productivity, in innovation, in customer experience, and of course in safety. This is the mindset that will drive not just our operating ratio but ultimately our earnings, our cash flow, and our returns in the years ahead.", "So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Rob.", "As you've heard from the team, 2016 has brought a continuation of many of the same trends that we experienced throughout most of last year. An energy market recession, low commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar and soft global economy, and muted domestic retail demand have all contributed to overall market weakness across many of our business lines. And it's likely that many of these themes will be with us for some time. That said, we are stronger coming into this year than we were a year ago. We've improved the fluidity of our network, with service metrics at all-time bests. We also achieved a record industry-best employee safety rate, as we work toward our ultimate goal of zero injuries.", "It's challenging to do business is such an uncertain market, but we will continue to be agile and adapting to new business environments, making our company more productive, more innovative, and ultimately more successful for the long term. We will continue to leverage the strength and diversity of the Union Pacific franchise to drive new business opportunities, to provide an excellent customer experience, and to generate strong long-term value for our shareholders.", "With that, let's open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question is coming from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for taking my questions. I guess the first is going to be a bigger picture one. You talked about, Rob, I think cost inflation being at around 2% this year. Yet, we have seen some of the core pricing, at least sequentially, trend down to 2.5%. That's not a huge delta for you guys to play with. Where do you see core pricing going forward, and what is pressured sequentially? It looks to me probably to be more Intermodal and coal, but I'd love some commentary on that.", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "Jason, I would remind \u2013 I know you know this, but I would remind everyone that if you look and compare the results to last year, remember we got about say 0.5 point of legacy pricing that was embedded in full-year results. The previous year and as we called out, the legacy activity is pretty much behind us, so that 2.5% is comparable to something legacy-like, if you will.", "Having said that, we don't give specific guidance by commodity group in terms of our pricing. In fact, our commitment still is to be an inflation-plus environment. We're going to continue to work as hard as we can providing a quality service product to our customers so we can continue to garner positive price above inflation as we move forward.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. My follow-up question is going to be on Ag volumes specifically, potentially export Ag. The SOLAS [Safety of Life at Sea] weight regulations are coming up here in July. It seems that basically people \u2013 shippers here in the U.S. seemed to be reacting more negatively toward it, particularly some people on the agricultural side. What's UP's view on it, and do you think it could be a potential negative impact, even if it's just a short-term?", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "So you're right, the regulations just came out here I think in the last \u2013 clarity on the regulations just came out in the last 30 days. And it really put a lot of the requirements for implementation upon the shipping community, which is part of the reaction that you get. Like most regulations, I think the shipping community will figure out a way to manage to that. And long term, if you look at our Ag business, it really is dependent on the fact that the U.S. still is a great producer. Generally speaking, long term it is in the sweet spot in terms of world competitiveness. We have had wins this year with the strong dollar, but it's in the sweet spot, and the U.S. as a producer will continue to be a good producer. And we as a transportation provider will continue to have the benefits of moving that business.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, so there are no real concerns on your part with SOLAS?", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "Not for the long-term, no.", "Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, perfect. Gentlemen, I appreciate the time as always.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Jason.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning. I wanted to ask you on the comp and benefits. So you did well with the head count reduction. And I know, Rob, you say that moves with volume. But how would you think sequentially head count changes? And also, is there anything the per-worker? The per-worker change was pretty low, which was notable in contrast to CSX, which saw more of a mid-single-digit increase in that. So I just wondered if you had any thoughts on those two, on how your head count changed and per-worker.", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "Tom, I would say that first of all on the per-worker, really what drives changes from that from quarter to quarter is largely \u2013 in our case is largely driven by the mix of employees that show up in capital or happen to be working on capital in that quarter or not working on capital. That is generally why you might see swings from one quarter to the next. Because other than that, it's just basically straightforward in terms of the inflation that shows up on the labor line.", "In terms of our head count going forward, as I said and as we've always said, we're going to continue to squeeze out productivity. Headcount will move as volume does, but not one for one because we are continually focused on identifying continuing productivity initiatives. And I think you saw that certainly in the first quarter with an 11% reduction in the head count. That was good productivity initiatives. But we're not done. The whole theme of the G-to-55 initiative is a focus on continued productivity. So I would expect that trend will continue in terms of moving with volume but offset by productivity results.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And as a follow-up, just in terms of pricing, do you think that the pricing environment took a little bit of a step down as you saw on the core price and now it's stable, or would you say that there are pressures that are building a bit further as you look forward on just the contracts that get negotiated through the year? Is that pricing getting worse, or is it just a step down and stable where we are?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Before I turn it over to Eric, this is Lance. Just globally, of course we would prefer an environment like 2014 where volume is growing robustly and there's a lot of demand for our services. That's a more favorable environment to be in. We're in a less favorable environment, but even so, we're still committed to doing what exactly what Rob said, which is pricing for our value, getting a reinvestable return on it, and pricing above inflation. Eric, any more?", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "No, I think that's it. I would say we all know that low fuel prices are allowing trucks to be plentiful. They're very tough competitors. Sluggish retail sales is a headwind to the economy. But within that, we think we have a great value proposition, and we're going to continue to price towards our value proposition.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, well thanks for the time, and nice job on the cost side.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Tom.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe Rob or Cameron, as you think about the drivers of productivity in the drive to 55% as an operating ratio, can you help us frame where that's going to come from? Is it the application of technology? Is it business process? And I know it's a broad question, but I guess some investors have had a little bit of feedback around where is this going to come from. And I'm just wondering if you can give us some color in terms of the big broad-brush strokes where you think this productivity can come from in the business?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Cam, let's start with you.", "Cameron A. Scott - Executive Vice President-Operations", "Okay. We mentioned train size earlier in the presentation. Every commodity group that we have has headroom for additional train size productivity. And we feel very good about our progress. We've made record train sizes in every commodity with the exception of coal, which was fairly optimized for a number of years in a row, and we'll do that again this year.", "Variable costs in every department within the operating team is a very big initiative for us, transportation, mechanical and engineering. And initiatives like recrew rate, where we've made enormous progress over the last 18 months coming down to record recrew performance. So those are some examples.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I also want to add \u2013 let's not shorthand, when Rob is talking about Grow to 55 and Zero, productivity isn't just about cutting heads. It's more predominantly about doing things more efficiently, getting more out of our assets, getting more out of a gallon of fuel. And the growth side is equally important, as Eric and his commercial team, in the context of all the headwinds we see on the energy side of the world, growing all the other commodities where we have opportunity, and there's lots of that opportunity.", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "David, I promise we will not have three responses to every question here, but this is near and dear to all of our hearts. And I would just add to the discussion that Cam and Lance have had is that we're looking at every stone that we can turn over in the company. Cam obviously talked heavily about the operations, which is where the big dollars are and the big opportunities are, but we're not leaving it at that. And Lance talked about the growth opportunities. But aside from that, we're challenging the entire organization, even the administrative groups, to turn over every stone of looking for additional opportunities to be more efficient than ever before. And to your question, yes, technology, where it can enable that, whether it's in core operations or in a support activity, we are certainly looking to leverage that even further.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Excellent. And then maybe just as a follow-up, as you think about some of the stranded asset issues that may come with the coal network running at obviously levels that we've never seen before, at least in the last 10 or 15 years, how much of a headwind should we expect in terms of some assets being stranded out there or costs being stranded out there, with the decline of coal?", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "David, this is Rob. I would say that that's not the case in our network. Again, if you look at \u2013 we don't have stranded assets. We don't envision there will be stranded assets. Because if you look at it again, using coal as the obvious example, we've still got the lines going up to the PRB mines. Those lines, while less volume traveling over them perhaps right now than maybe at their peak, they are still the same lines that we've enjoyed. So we don't have a situation. Now having said that, we're going to squeeze to be as productive as we can on our asset base. You see that in our locomotives and certainly our head count related to that. But as it relates to stranded assets, I don't see that as an issue for us.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Excellent, thanks a lot for the time, guys.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, David.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to ask a couple high-level questions. Eric, you mentioned the strong dollar still a headwind on grain, crudes, and excess inventories in that market. But it's come off from the peak, the dollar has clearly had a nice run for a long time. How long do you think it needs to stay at this level, or roughly how much lower do you think it needs to go before you start to see some relief? And I guess what would be the first place you would expect to see that?", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "I'm not a central banker, but I would say the dollar is still very high in any relative sense. It has dropped a little from the peak, but it still is very high. And as you know, dollars impact the competitiveness of U.S. exports across the board. So whether it's Ag, whether it's things like steel, whether it's things like our iron or metals business or other commodities business, it impacts all of those things. And so I don't have any prediction of how much the dollar needs to fall. It still is very high in any relative historical sense.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. But to clarify, it sounds like you're not seeing anything at this stage?", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "The dollar is still a headwind. The strong dollar is still a headwind to U.S. exports.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. And then to follow up on oil, it's again another macro factor, clearly been moving off the lows. How much upside do you think can be to the frac sand business? Are you starting to see any signs of activity there? I know you had another tough quarter on tough comps. You mentioned some regional sourcing that's starting to work its way into the business. But are you starting to at least hear some more optimism that completions would start to move forward here and get some more sand down the wells? Thanks.", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "I think the public numbers still show drilling rigs down about 45% or 49%, 50%. So, Eric, there's not a lot of drilling activity that has picked back up with the slight bump up in fuel. Certainly when the drilling activity picks back up, we would expect to participate in that in the various markets that we operate in.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "The good news on that is, the shale energy producers have done a tremendous job in getting their own cost structures in line and getting productivity as they had experience with this new approach to drilling. And so the strike price for when activity picks up is lower than it was three or four or five years ago, but we're still not at that point.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks. I appreciate the time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, good morning. Rob, just following up on Tom's question before, you talked about the cost per employee coming down a bit. Would you expect that to increase with incentive comp? Or you mentioned pension reductions. Can those outweigh it? Can you just walk through the pension savings and incentive comp impacts as we move forward through the year?", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "I wouldn't anticipate a material change or much of a change at all in the pension. And incentive comp for us, Ken, is not a big mover because we don't have a wide-based plan that affects a wide percentage of our employees. So if you boil it down, the big driver is going to be \u2013 again, I would use that 2% labor inflation number that we expect for the full year. And again, the timing of that can change quarter to quarter depending on how many employees are actively involved in capital or not involved in capital. That's really going to be what changes that number going forward. So I don't see any big changes.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So nothing that materially changes the productivity gains you saw in the quarter?", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "No, not as it relates to the comp per employee.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then, Eric, just thinking about Intermodal, obviously given the pressures you talked about, maybe one more to throw out at you with the Panama Canal opening up soon. I know that over the past few years, you and Lance have thrown out that you don't expect much change. But as you see plans and new teaming up amongst the container liners that's going on, is there any thought of any shift of capacity given the impact of the port strike a year ago and thoughts on how that distributes the Intermodal volumes?", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "Ken, there are a lot of moving parts, as you know, and there are a lot of ins and outs. I don't think anything substantially has changed our perspective that we've given over the time. A couple of the key factors we always look at is that West Coast port entry still is the fastest option to get to the Eastern markets, usually by two weeks. Another factor is with all of the rationalization going on in the container shipping industry, all of the alliances and the mergers and all that's going on, there does seem to be a migration to the larger ships. About half the new capacity coming on is with ships greater than 12,000 or 13,000 TEUs [20-foot Equivalent Units] on it. Those ships cannot go through even the expanded Panama Canal.", "So I think as you look at this trans-Pacific rationalization, there are even larger ships posting right now on the West Coast that cannot go through even the expanded canal. I think the West Coast ports still will remain a very strong, viable competitor. And fundamentally we're not changing our perspective and our outlook that we've had over the last couple years.", "Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, I appreciate the insight. Thanks for the time.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Ken.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Thanks and good morning. So first question I wanted to ask, there's a lot of noise in the volume numbers right now between volatile comps, the impact of flooding, and what's going on in coal, and it's pretty tough to get a feel for the underlying demand environment. From your perspective through the first three or four months of the year, what's your view on the demand environment and the economy relative to where your outlook was at the start of the year?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Eric, do you want to take a stab at that?", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "So clearly, as Rob said earlier, the coal side was a lot softer than what we anticipated. Again, warmest winter on weather, we did not expect these low natural gas prices. The shale impact is significant. But if you set aside the shale impact, the energy, the coal impact, you do have some variability going on in terms of retail sales that is probably a little softer than what we anticipated. But if you look at net-net everything else, I think it's pretty solid growth and aligned with what we expected and aligned with the slowly strengthening economy. So you have a retail sales, international Intermodal market issue. You've got a shale/coal energy market issue. But if you look at everything else, I think it's pretty aligned and slowly strengthening.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay, thanks, Eric. And as a follow-up, one of the big discrepancies between your year-to-date volume performance and your Western competitor is coming in Intermodal. So I'm just curious if you're seeing more competitive pricing dynamics and any market share shift. Or is there another explanation for this discrepancy?", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "Yes, Justin, I think it's as I said in my prepared comments; that if you look at the international Intermodal side of the business and all of the rationalization that's going on there with the steamship carriers and the alliance changes and some of the mergers, that clearly has had more of an impact on our book of business based on the shippers that we certainly have been aligned with vis-\u00e0-vis our Western competitor.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And, Justin, taking a step back, when you think about Intermodal, you break out international Intermodal and domestic, we still are quite bullish on domestic Intermodal over the long run. There is still a rich opportunity to take trucks off the highway, and we think we're going to be able to grow that product for the foreseeable future.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Thanks, just more a broader question as it relates to CapEx. I know if I go back to 2000 \u2013 2005 timeframe, your volumes today are relatively flat, but your CapEx budget is up 100%. It's doubled, so you're spending twice as much to handle the same level of traffic. I know you've layered in PTC [Positive Train Control]. I know given the long-lived nature of the assets that there's inflation, but I'm just curious. Is it time for you and your rail peers to rethink the brackets or the goalposts in terms of percentage of revenues you're spending on CapEx? I know you've got to take a long 10-year \u2013 20-year view, where most people in the market take a one-month or two-month view. But I'm just curious. In a slower growth environment, which seems to be stubbornly persistent, you took $600 million down year over year, which is impressive. Is it time to rethink more broadly what capital is required to run these railroads? Thanks.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks for the question, Matt. As Rob reminds our investment community all the time, we are constantly reviewing our capital spend in the context of projects that are generating attractive returns, our overall volumes, and where those volumes are moving. If you look at us compared to 10 or 15 years ago in capital, there are a couple of very big moving parts. One is PTC, which...", "Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Right.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "...full year last year was a $300 million or a $390 million number that didn't exist at that time. Another big moving part can be locomotives. We're in the market for locomotives more in the past few years than we were 10 or 15 years ago. And the third big moving part is in maintenance capital. I recall back in those days, we were spending in the neighborhood of maybe $1.2 billion, and in these days we're spending more like a $1.8 billion number. And for that, we have a much more robust network that's operating at very high levels.", "Having said all that, as we look forward, our capital spend will depend on the first three things I mentioned. First and foremost, what's the outlook for volume, what's that environment look like, where is that volume showing up, and what are the projects that we have in front of us that generate attractive returns? In my mind's eye, you're still going to see us spend down in our Southern tier of our network. That's still an area where we would like to continue to enhance our capacity. And you'll still continue to see us invest at a fairly robust level for maintaining the railroad, although that also ebbs and flows with how much we're consuming in GPMs.", "Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "I appreciate the thoughtful answer, and just one follow-up. I'm looking for a silver lining in what is otherwise a choppy volume environment. I was surprised at the strength in industrial chems, up 16%, just given that they historically have had \u2013 rail chemical traffic has had such a high correlation with economic expansion. I was wondering if you could perhaps just put some additional color there given that strength. Was that share driven? Was that new customer driven? Just some greater clarity there would be extremely helpful. Thank you.", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "So as we regularly say, we are continuing to focus on business development. And we have a huge number of business development initiatives underway across the board, which are really overshadowed by the coal and the shale fall-off and some of the rationalization we're seeing in international Intermodal. If you look at our chemicals business, the Gulf Coast franchise, while many of those plastics expansions will not come on till next year, as we've talked about in the past, we still have lots of opportunities in terms of LPG growth. Mexico energy reform, there's a lot of growing interest in terms of moving products there, and we are working on a number of different initiatives with that.", "And so there is general economic strength that we're seeing in our industrial products business in terms of construction coming back, housing coming back. Chemicals has the benefit of plastics going to the automotive industry as you see automotive sales. And so there's a slowly strengthening economy out there and we're doing a lot of business development to go after it, which again is being overshadowed by just the huge volume numbers for coal and shale and the other headwinds we have.", "Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Understood, thank you very much for the time and detail.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks, good morning. Given everything that's happening with coal, similar to what your Eastern peers have done in the past few years, are you having to explore potentially changing contracts with your customers and moving more towards a fixed to variable structure?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Eric, do you want to handle that?", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "So, Allison, as you know, we have a standard answer where we don't really talk about specific contract negotiations. I will say we negotiate aggressively and assertively, and we're in a very competitive environment. And for any particular contract negotiation, we probably have dozens if not hundreds of terms that we're negotiating. And like always, as markets change and we look to be competitive, we evaluate a bunch of those terms and conditions and what works for us and works for our customer base.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, thanks. And as a follow-up question, if we look a little bit out to the future and see volumes will eventually come back to the network, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the operating leverage and earnings power of the company, just in light of the fact that you've taken out a significant amount of costs over the last few quarters?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So as you just lined up, volume is our friend. We're looking forward to the point where we're growing on the top line because it does make it easier to drop that to the bottom line. Having said that, in the place we are right now, we're in the process of getting our overall structure to match where our markets are today. And then from that point moving forward, we'll continue to be aggressive on our productivity, on our efficiency, on our business development, and generally that model is very attractive when we grow.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, thank you for the time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks, good morning. I wanted to touch a little bit on the flooding. You haven't mentioned it on the call. I just wanted to get a sense if you can quantify any impact, if it was material, both from a cost and maybe from a volume standpoint if maybe we see a little bit of lost volumes come back a bit in 2Q. Just give us a sense of how to think about that.", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "Chris, this is Rob. It was yeoman's work by the operating team because it was a significant challenge for them, but they did a fabulous job. I would say that the impact to us was less than $0.01 in terms of EPS for the quarter.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, that's helpful. And then I wanted to follow up on mix. So mix obviously improved from the fourth quarter, and it feels like it was a little bit less bad than maybe some were thinking for the first quarter despite the fact that some of the bulk commodity groups were down pretty significantly. As you think about the rest of the year, how can this trend? Is the first quarter likely to be the low water mark in terms of the headwind for mix? How do we think about that going forward?", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "Chris, this is Rob. You know we don't give guidance on mix. And the reason we don't is because we are in so many different markets, which we're very proud of in terms of the diversity of our network. There are a lot of moving parts, as you know, and there's mix even within each of the commodity groups.", "Having said that, you're right. We are coming off of unusually high negative mix challenges, and we do think our best look at the balance of the year is that will moderate. Again, we're at high water marks here, I would hope, at 2.5% and certainly last quarter's 4% negative impact on mix I would hope is an all-time high water mark. But we do think our best guess is that's going to moderate, but it's difficult to actually put any finer point on it.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the time, I appreciate it.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Chris.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just want to take a longer-term view here and ask you about coal. Obviously another step down in the next couple of quarters. But when you look to 2017, is this a market that can be flat or even up next year, or what's your view there?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me take a stab at that, Ravi. So the way we think about coal is it's facing a large number of headwinds right now: low natural gas prices as an alternative; pretty significant inventory overhang on piles right now; and a weak electricity generating market, some driven by weather.", "So as those headwinds persist, coal is going to continue to have some difficulty. We're going to have to chew up some of this excess inventory before we see coal demand really strengthen. What it might look like two, three, four, five years from now, we still think it's a pretty important part of the overall electricity generating base the United States. It's not going back, we don't think, to where it was four or five years ago. And you can make an argument either way, that it strengthens a bit or that it might decline a bit. Our best guess is we're probably in the relative sphere where it's going operate other than the really significant headwinds that we're facing in this particular timeframe.", "Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And as a follow-up, going back to the flooding, again, we heard there was a lot of cooperation between a number of rails to get everyone out of that mess. But just generally talking about the competitive environment, what are you seeing out there in terms of some of the actions that some of your peers might be taking?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think if you're asking specific to the floods, we did a great job of making sure our customers had alternatives and satisfying their needs and keeping them well informed. If you're asking in terms of the overall operating environment...", "Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Right.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "...we are in a competitive environment. We compete every day for every piece of business that we enjoy. And we compete on the basis of providing our customers the best experience they're going to get in the marketplace, and everything we do every day is oriented towards making that happen.", "Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So a few things I wanted to clarify. Rob, any coal liquidated damages in the quarter, and are you expecting any for the year?", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "Scott, for us I'd say minor, and I would anticipate that it will be minor for the balance of the year.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. So that's just not a number that you guys disclose?", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Your point, Rob, about there was more capital than expense employees in the quarter \u2013 I think that was your point \u2013 is that something that is just a first-quarter event, or does that continue all year where we see comp per employee, because of that, less than the 2% wage inflation you talked about?", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "Scott, the point I was trying to make on that, number one, you can always have those swings depending on what capital projects are going on, but that was more of a sequential comment. Generally speaking, you would start to ramp up some of your capital projects in the first quarter that perhaps you weren't running as you finished the fourth quarter. So that was more of a comment, this particular go-round, relative to the sequential look. Year over year in the first quarter, not as material of an impact, but that can change from time to time. But I think if you look at it, again, the first quarter was pretty clean in my view. When you look year over year in terms of 11% head count reduction, really is representative of very solid, outstanding productivity performance. And of course, remember the year before we had our share of challenges.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "I guess I'm just thinking from a comp per employee, because you talked about inflation of 2%, and comp per employee was down 1%. I'm just trying to understand if that's a number that can continue the rest of the year.", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "I wouldn't give guidance on that. I think probably the best way to think about it is that 2% inflation generally speaking should look like the guidance we're getting on the labor inflation line, which would be closer to 2%.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. If I can just ask one more, Eric, maybe can you let us know? Where are coal stockpiles now relative to targets? And if you think back to last cycle, how long does it take for the stockpiles to come down? Is it one good weather season, is it two, three? I don't know.", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "The actual numbers I think are 108 days, which is about 41 days above, call it a five-year average \u2013 and I think no, 41 days above last year. And how long it takes to come down just depends on all the factors we've talked about.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, look, I believe at some point we're going to see some recovery in volumes. I guess we all hope that, right? But in the meantime, as you go through these cost reduction efforts and align resources with the carload volumes and that type of thing, how long can you do that before you get some ramp up in carloads and protect the profitability of the railroad? Obviously, profitability was down in the quarter, but you did a nice job of protecting the OR and that kind of thing. How long can you continue that until you run out of cost reduction initiatives and start to cut into the muscle of the organization?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "John, we can do it for as long as is necessary. We've demonstrated that we understand how to use attrition as our friend, how to use initiatives like Grow to 55 and Zero. We know how to get our cost structure right. We're in the middle of doing that and we're going to continue to do it. My expectation is that we don't have to do that forever because I do expect us at some point to start growing the top line.", "We're in a unique environment right now with a lot of headwinds. Some of those headwinds represent structural shift, like in coal, where a portion of that book of business is probably permanently reduced. But in the big scheme of things, at some point those headwinds abate, we start growing again. And even in that environment, we're still focused on making sure that we have the structure right, that we have our costs right, and that we're constantly looking for efficiency.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, all right. And then secondly, Rob, you commented in your presentation about a significant increase in the cash balances because of the debt issuance. You've reduced the CapEx budget a little bit, which I would imagine probably juices the cash flow a little bit. Can you just talk a little bit about, I guess with rail M&A off the table, there's no real need to be hoarding cash for some kind of move in that arena? What do you think the plan is on use of cash going forward? Is there any alteration? Should we expect any acceleration in share buyback, just given the cash balances at this point?", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "John, I would say no. I wouldn't read into the fact that we happened to finish the quarter with a high cash balance as a change in anything we're doing. It's going to be the balanced approach. We need the cash for working capital, for taxes, for dividends. And we'll continue to be, as we have been, opportunistic on the share buyback as we move forward.", "John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "All right, very good. Thanks for the time.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.", "Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask one on grain. Because there's so much in storage, you could make case that there's potential upside in the back half just on the basis that some will have to move to make room for this year's harvest. But you still seem pretty cautious, and I'm just curious if that's because it's early in the season or something else.", "Eric L. Butler - Executive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Co.", "This is Eric, Cherilyn. There is a lot of grain in storage. There is about 200 million bushels that were carried out from last year. I think the USDA estimates are that can grow by another 500 million bushels based on the number of acres that are being planted and the types of yields that are expected. So there is a lot of grain out there. We believe that eventually it has to move. And so we are certainly optimistic that when it does move, we're going to get our fair share of that, and it will move. It's just right now, U.S. grain is not competitive on world markets. The strong dollar is an issue. There are other issues in terms of really good crops in other places, growing regions around the world. But we do think it will ultimately will move, and we're going get our fair share of it when it does.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then in terms of the locomotives that you've got in storage, are any of those potential lease turn-back candidates, or are you comfortable with that as a surge fleet?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Cam, do you want to start by talking about locomotives in storage?", "Cameron A. Scott - Executive Vice President-Operations", "We have a really good mix of high-horsepower and low-horsepower in storage. And particularly on the low-horsepower fleet, as we look out over the next three to four years, there are some very nice lease return-backs that we will do. And we're very confident we can hold our low-horsepower fleet size and return those leases without any impact to our customers.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.", "Great, thank you. That's all for me.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting my question in. I know it's been a long call. But, Lance or Rob, you guys did guide to an improved operating ratio this year. So can you just talk about the confidence that you have in achieving that, especially with volume down 10% in 2Q, as well as talk a little bit more about the fuel headwind that you were discussing in 1Q?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll let Rob talk about the fuel headwind. From the standpoint of operating ratio, we wouldn't be reaffirming it and talking about it if we didn't have confidence and faith in achieving it. We believe that given any reasonable outlook, we are going to improve our operating ratio this year.", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "I would just add to that, Brandon, that clearly we'd rather have positive volume. And just as a reminder, we did guide that we think full-year volumes will be down mid-single digits. That's a challenge. But to Lance's point, what we're expressing here is confidence in our ability to continue to be squeezing out productivity initiatives and continue to price appropriately in the marketplace.", "On the fuel, the guidance we're giving on fuel is that while it was a $0.10 headwind in the first quarter, largely driven by the $0.08 benefit the previous first quarter last year, we think that's going to moderate. If fuel prices stay where they are, our expectation would be that that headwind will moderate, largely because we lap the fall-off in fuel from the previous year.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, got you. So that was just the year-on-year impact \u2013 or the lag impact from last year.", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "That's exactly the quarter-over-quarter look, yes.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, and just one real quick one for the model. You did do a debt offering in the quarter. Where should your run rate interest expense be going forward?", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "I would say probably comparable to what we saw in the first quarter.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, all right. Thanks, Rob.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. These go ahead with your questions.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Cameron, thanks for the detail on some of the initiatives behind the Grow to 55. But of the 45 projects that you guys have specifically identified, how many of those have kicked off or are going to kick off this year? And then what's the cadence of the remaining projects over the next couple years? I just want to try to understand the pipeline of opportunities there.", "Cameron A. Scott - Executive Vice President-Operations", "Absolutely. Within the operating department team, we have 12 projects that we've identified that we kicked off late 2014 and into 2015. Many of those projects are gaining very, very good traction into 2016, and we have a couple of others lined up for the end of 2016 going into 2017. So they're broad-based. They're well measured. We feel very confident, to an earlier question, that when we identify one of these productivity projects that we can hold that productivity as volume comes back to us so we have great leverage out into the future.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, that's great. And then, Rob, my follow-up, there just remains a lot of concern over there about the impact of mix, the decline in coal, and what it's doing to the holistic margin profile of the railroad. So I totally get it that you don't give margins by commodity. But how should we think about the stratifications of margins by commodity maybe say versus past? So have they tightened over the past couple years, meaning are they much closer to corporate average today versus maybe a more disparate profile in the past, or is that an oversimplification?", "Robert M. Knight - Chief Financial Officer", "As you know, we don't break it out by commodity, but clearly the mix that we've seen the last few quarters is a challenge. I'm particularly proud of the fact that with reductions in volume and the headwind that we faced in the mix, we have continued to drive outstanding operating ratio performance. So that's the focus.", "Irrespective, you've heard me say this many times. We're going to play the hand that the economy deals us. We're not going to use the challenge that we're facing right now of a mix headwind as an excuse not to make continued margin improvements, and that's what we're all about. That's what driving our initiative of G55. That's what's still driving our plus or minus 60% operating ratio by full-year 2019 focus. We have to live in that world. But clearly, those challenges that we faced here on the mix have been challenges.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, that's great and good job on the costs, thanks.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead with your question.", "Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC", "Obviously, you've done an admirable job in what is a fairly high fixed cost business at managing costs and bringing them down aggressively in line with \u2013 or almost in line with the rate in which you've seen revenues fall. Help me think about this, though. If we see further volume declines, can you be as productive? In other words, I'm assuming that as we furlough 1,400 locomotives, you're not furloughing the youngest, most efficient locomotives. You're furloughing the oldest, most in need of maintenance, least efficient locomotives. So as we make further cuts, is it realistic to expect that you can be as effective in your cost control as you have been so far, or am I thinking about that incorrectly?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, it is reasonable to expect us to continue to be able to be effective at adjusting our cost structure, even in the face of further volume declines. Now we're not saying we anticipate things get worse from where they are right now. But if they were to, we have the ability to continue to adjust our cost structure. We've demonstrated, to this point, there are still levers to be pulled. We'd much prefer to grow, but we will pull those levers as we need to.", "Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC", "But will cost cutting be as productive in the future as it has been in the past?", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "From my perspective, there are ample opportunities to be more efficient everywhere I look on the railroad. We will continue to be able to generate productivity from that perspective. And as we have to take larger chunks of cost out, we'll continue to evaluate that and do that effectively as well.", "Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC", "Fantastic. Thank you, gentleman.", "Lance M. Fritz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.", "Lance M.

Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.36 per share, which compares to $1.50 in the third quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 6% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups, with coal and industrial products both down double-digits.", "Agricultural product volumes were up a robust 11% this quarter versus 2015 as grain shipments finally started to show some strength. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.1%, which was up 1.8 percentage points from the record third quarter last year, but improved 3.1 percentage points from the second quarter of this year.", "Continued momentum from our productivity initiatives, as well as positive core pricing helped partially offset the decline in total carload volumes. While many of the same volume challenges have continued throughout the year, we are keeping a laser focus on our six value tracks. This strategy ensures we provide our customers with an excellent value proposition and service experience, while efficiently and safely managing our resources.", "Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric.", "Eric Butler", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the third quarter, our volume was down 6% with near record agricultural product shipments more than offset by declines in each of the business groups. We generated core pricing gains of 1.5% in the quarter, reflecting the impacts of competitive markets and a weak economic environment, particularly in our energy related and international intermodal businesses.", "Despite these challenges, we continue to achieve solid re-investable returns even in these difficult markets and we remain committed to achieving positive core pricing gains that reflect our value proposition over the long term. The decline in volume in the 2% lower average revenue per car drove a 7% reduction in freight revenue.", "Let's take a closer look at the performance for each of our six business groups. Ag products revenue gained 6% on an 11% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. A robust U.S. grain supply and lower commodity prices generated export strength and let the grain volumes 27% in the quarter.", "Wheat exports rebounded in the second half of the quarter as adverse weather in South America caused significant loses elevating demand for the higher protein U.S. wheat. Grained products carload advanced 5% in the quarter, primarily due to increased ethanol exports and biodiesel shipments.", "Food in refrigerated carloads were flat in the quarter as strong demand for import beer offset softness in refrigerated food shipments and import sugar. Automotive revenue was down 8% in the quarter driven by 2% decrease in volume and a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. ", "Finished vehicle's shipments decreased 7% by sales and production levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific served plants and contract changes we referenced last quarter that will continue to impact that volume through the first part of 2017. In total, finished vehicle sales in the quarter were at a seasonally adjusted average rate of $17.5 million, up 2% from the second quarter, but down 2% from the 2015 third quarter. ", "On the product side, a continued focused on over-the-road conversions drove a 5% increase in volume. Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. We continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 48%, due to lower crude oil prices, regional pricing differences and available pipeline capacity. ", "Chemicals volume, excluding crude oil shipments were up 2% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in other areas, including industrial chemicals, which was up 3% in the quarter. Coal revenue declined 19% for the quarter on a 14% decrease in volume and 6% decline in average revenue per car. Sequentially, however overall coal tonnage increased 40% from the second quarter of this year. ", "Powder River Basin and Colorado Utah tonnage declined 17% and 16% respectively in the quarter as increased demands from a warmer than average summer was unable to offset high coal stockpiles. PRB coal inventory levels in September were 90 days down 13 days from June, but still 27 days above the five-year average. Industrial products revenue was down 13% on an 11% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. ", "Minerals volume was down 22% in the quarter, driven by 26% decrease in frac sand carloadings impacted by lower crude oil prices and decreased drilling activity. Construction products volume was down 8%, due to weather impacted construction activity in the South. The strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, and an increased imports pushed metal shipments down 13% year-over-year. ", "Intermodal revenue was down 9% on a 7% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume declined 2% in the quarter. Excluding headwinds from the previously discussed discontinuation of Triple Crown service domestic was nearly flat. ", "International volumes were down 11% in the quarter as the industry continues to face significant headwinds from weaker global trade activity, softer domestic sales, high retail inventory on the Hanjin bankruptcy. ", "To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook. In Ag products we expect a healthy U.S. harvest and strong world demand for U.S. grain to drive favorable export trends. Grain products will continue to be strong driven by ethanol exports. In food and refrigerated, we expect continued strength in beer imports. ", "Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted to finish 2016 at $17.4 million, down less than 0.5% from the 2015 record rate of $17.5 million. Although we expect sales incentives, low gasoline prices and consumer preference will continue to drive demand. We remain cautious with respect to auto sales sustaining at these levels. A continued focus on over-the-road conversions will support auto parts growth. ", "Our chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable with strength in LPG and industrial chemicals offset by declines in crude oil. Coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels, and export demand. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. In industrial products lower crude prices and reduced drilling activity are expected to continue to challenge minerals volumes. ", "We anticipate a softer year end for metals as imports continue to impact domestic shipments and customers manage year-end inventories. We expect lumber to be stronger in the fourth quarter as housing starts continue to expand. ", "Finally in intermodal, our international volumes will continue to be adversely impacted by a strained ocean carrier industry, offset partially by over-the-road highway conversions. In the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth as the economy slowly improves. We remain committed to strengthening our customer value proposition and driving new business opportunities. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.", "Cameron Scott", "Thanks Eric and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 16% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.77. Included in this was a record low number of severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact. ", "Although we continue to make significant improvement, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate of 3.13 improved 4% versus last year. ", "While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who did not meet the reportable threshold to a new record low. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 13% to 2.55. We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through various channels, including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. ", "Moving to network performance. While the California wildfires and flooding along various parts of our network created some challenges during the quarter, our network proved resilient as we continue to achieve solid operating performance. Effective use of our surge locomotive fleet and TE&Y workforce were critical to minimize the impact of these network challenges. ", "As reported to the AAR, velocity improved 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Terminal dwell also improved 2%, but the benefits of a food network were somewhat offset by productivity gains such as longer train lengths and other network management initiatives. ", "Moving on to resources, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we continue to adjust resource levels to account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 14% when compared to the same quarter last year, but up 2% sequentially from the second quarter to efficiently handle the 8% volume increase experienced since the end of June. ", "We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business with a goal of driving productivity throughout the organization. This includes the rightsizing of our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,900 employees or 9% versus the third quarter of last year. ", "Our active locomotive fleet was down 9% from the third quarter of 2015, but up 2% sequentially to handle the increase in carloads. As you know, we\u2019ve been planning for the acquisition of 230 new locomotives this year. ", "We now expect that number to be 200 locomotives this year with the delivery of 30 units delayed into 2017. This would add to the 70 units previously scheduled in 2017 for a total of 100 next year. We are adjusting our 2016 capital program down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily driven by this change in locomotive deliveries. ", "Turning to network productivity, while we remain focused on effectively balancing our resources, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through several productivity initiatives. Train length is a significant productivity driver and a primary focus area for us. During the quarter, our manifest and grain networks ran at all-time record train length levels, while our automotive network set a third quarter of record. ", "Re-crew rate, a cost incurred when the first crew had insufficient time to complete the trip is an indicative measure of the fluidity and productivity of our network. Our third quarter re-crew rate was 2.3%, a near 2 point improvement from 2015 and a third quarter record. ", "As we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding positive results on our way to an incident free environment. And where growth opportunities arise we\u2019ll leverage that growth to the bottom-line to increase utilization of existing assets, while maintaining our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network.", "With that I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Rob Knight", "Thanks, good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.2 billion. ", "Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions, and strong productivity improvements drove the 4% improvement compared to last year. Operating income totaled almost $2 billion and a 11% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29 million, roughly flat versus 2015. ", "Interest expense of $184 million was up 17%, compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, as well as about $8 million for the fees associated with our recent debt exchange transaction. This increase was partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. ", "Income tax expense decreased about 14% to $674 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled just over $1.1 billion, down 13% versus 2015; while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share. ", "Turning now to our topline, fright revenue of $4.8 billion was down 7% versus last year, primarily driven by a 6% decline in volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $173 million, down $141 million when compared to 2015, but $86 million from the second quarter of this year. All in, we estimate a net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year. ", "The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was about flat, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. Year-over-year growth in agricultural product shipments and declines in international intermodal volumes were positive contributors to mix, which were offset by declines in industrial products and finished vehicles volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 1.5%. ", "Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. As Eric just mentioned, pricing gains this quarter reflect a competitive marketplace and as soft economic environment. Going forward, we remain committed to our focus on positive return driven quarter pricing, which reflects the value proposition that we provide our customers. ", "Moving onto the expense side, Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 6% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies, and fewer people in the training pipeline. ", "General, wage, and benefit inflation partially offset these decreases. Labor inflation was about 3% in the third quarter, driven primarily by general wage increases and health and welfare expense, which were partially offset by some favorable pension costs. We still expect full-year labor inflation to be about 2% and overall inflation to be about 1.5% for the year. ", "As a result of lower volumes, solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, total workforce levels declined 10% in the quarter year-over-year or more than 4,700 employees. Looking sequentially, total workforce levels were down about 1% from the second quarter of this year. For the fourth quarter, we expect our force levels to be similar to the third quarter and also down somewhat from the prior year as comps get a little bit more difficult. ", "Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $392 million, down 19% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices along with a 6% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% to a record 1.075, while our average fuel price declined 13% to $1.57 per gallon. ", "Moving on to our other expense categories, purchase, services, and materials expense decreased 4% to $566 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance costs. Depreciation expense was $512 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. ", "For the full-year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year. Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $282 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes which reduced car hire expense and reduced locomotive lease costs were the primary drivers of this decline. ", "Other expenses came in at $271 million, up $66 million versus last year. We did have a couple of one-time items impacting the other expense category in the third quarter, as well as a few favorable items that we incurred last year. As we discussed back in September, we have written-off the $13 million of accounts receivables associated with the Hanjin bankruptcy. ", "In addition, we also were encouraged $17 million of write-offs associated with in-progress capital projects, which we are no longer pursuing. Higher state and local taxes and increased environmental costs, partially offset by lower personal injury expense also contributed to the negative variance in this category for the quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect the other expense line item to increase close to 10%, including the one-time items that I just mentioned. ", "Turning to our operating ratio, the third quarter operating ratio came in at 62.1%, 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the record third quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.4 points in the quarter. ", "Looking at cash flow, cash from operations for the first three quarters totaled about $5.5 billion, down about $160 million when compared to the same period last year. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to the bonus depreciation on our capital spending. ", "For the full-year 2016, we now expect the net impact of bonus depreciation to be a tailwind of about $350 million. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $1.3 billion year-to-date through the end of September. ", "Taking a look now at the balance sheet, our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.5 billion at quarter end. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of over 1.9 times up from 1.7 at year end. This brings us close to our target ratio of less than two times. For the first nine months of the year, we bought back over 25 million shares totaling about $2.2 billion. ", "Since initiating sales repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased about 28% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned nearly $3.6 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of this year. So that\u2019s a recap of the third quarter results. ", "Looking out to the remainder of the year, volume declines on a year-over-year basis should moderate as the volume comparisons get easier in the fourth quarter. We would expect total fourth quarter volumes to be down in the low single digits and we still expect total full-year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range. ", "While we do not expect to improve the operating ratio this year, we will continue to leverage our G55 and Zero initiatives to generate positive core pricing and strong productivity to achieve the lowest operating ratio possible. And as Cam just mentioned, we now expect 2016 capital spending to be down about a hundred million dollar to just under $3.6 billion, primarily as a result of the delay in the locomotive deliveries. ", "While we have not yet finalized our capital plans for 2017, we still expect our capital spending to be around 15% of revenue. From a productivity perspective, our G55 and Zero initiatives have generated significant efficiency savings for the company thus far this year and we are confident that we will continue to drive further improvements well into the future as we work toward our operating ratio target of 60% plus or minus on a full-year basis by 2019, and longer term we are keeping our eye on the goal of a 55% operating ratio as we gain momentum with our G55 and Zero initiatives. ", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you, Rob. As the team has articulated here this morning we continue to experience a difficult, but improving market environment in the third quarter. While we were pleased to see improving volumes in some of our business lines such as grain and coal, many of our markets still remained at volume levels below a year ago. ", "The macroeconomic environment still has its challenges and unstable global economy, the relatively strong U.S. dollar and continued soft demand for consumer goods. However, certain segments of the economy are showing signs of life. A recent rally in energy prices has crude oil over $50 a barrel and natural gas over $3 per million btu, which are both encouraging for our coal and shale-related businesses. ", "We are also pleased to see strength in the overall grain market. With the record harvest currently underway we are well-positioned with our network and resources to serve an increase in demand from our Ag customers. ", "Closing out 2016 and heading into next year, we\u2019re optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the coming months, we will continue to do what Union Pacific does best, operate a safe, efficient, and productive network while providing an excellent customer experience and delivering solid shareholder returns.", "With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Ken Hoexter", "Great, good morning. Just can you, Rob talk a little bit about the projects you are writing-off, I just want to understand what kind of cost we have going forward and it looks like as the business comes back, you're starting to ramp up your locomotives and employees, but you notice that there are fewer people in the training pipeline, should we see some start-up costs as you start to bring people back in? Thanks.", "Rob Knight", "Yeah, Ken what I commented in the quarter was around 17 million of projects that were started that we have chosen to not pursue and so we\u2019re taking adjustments there. So, I think if you look longer term that\u2019s a number that is not going to repeat, I mean we occasionally will have situations like that, but I think it\u2019s safe to assume that that\u2019s a number similar to the Hanjin receivable write-off that I mentioned that are not going to repeat in that line item. In terms of the cost, we are confident that we are well situated both on locomotives and employees to leverage the volume that we hope does materialize. So we've got fewer people in training line because we've got so many people if you will in furlough status at this point. So, we feel very good about our ability to and we'd love nothing more than to see volume pickup and be able to put resources back to work.", "Ken Hoexter", "Great thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Thanks very much and good morning. With the international shipping lines under continues financial pressures you noted and the prospect of a record grain crop match back is something that I\u2019ve been hearing more about, just curious is that something that you\u2019re facilitating and potentially see as a means to increase market share in intermodal grain or both?", "Lance Fritz", "Eric?", "Eric Butler", "As you mentioned Cherilyn there is a significant volatility going on in the international container ship business. There have been three major mergers, one bankruptcy, there are a number of other entities that are in dire or questionable financial shape. One of the things that all of the container ship companies are looking at doing is finding ways to have match backs or exports from the U.S. to Asia. One of the large historical exports has been grain and in particular the DDGs to China. We are continuing to that look at that as an opportunity to grow our business in terms of the westbound business to Asia. ", "We\u2019re also really excited longer term or mid-term in terms of the opportunity to ship plastics to Asia from the expanding franchise we have in the Gulf and we think that that\u2019s going to be an excellent opportunity for match backs also. So, we think both of those things are great opportunities. Of course, China occasionally as they have right now have tariffs or other governmental policy things that hinder imports like DDGs, but we think long-term that should be opportunity for us.", "Lance Fritz ", "Cherilyn this is Lance. What Eric just outlined is indicative of the franchise strength that the Union Pacific brings to the industry. We've got breadth and coverage in a number of markets that allow us visibility into potential match backs.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Great and just by ways of very quick follow-up, when you say medium-to-long term on the plastics match backs is that sort of 2018 and beyond?", "Eric Butler ", "Yes, I mean as we've been saying for the last several quarters, we think most of the growth will happen in 2018 and beyond. There might be a tale of a small ramp-up towards the end of 2017, but basically 2018 and beyond.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Thank you. That's all from me.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Ravi Shanker", "Hi, thanks good morning everyone. A couple of questions on pricing, you've committed to a positive core pricing, can you also commit to pricing over inflation? And second, can you just help us understand what the driver of the pricing, I would say the deterioration in the gains have been, is it mostly into real competition, is it truck competition, or is it you guys kind of just supporting some of your customers who may be going through a hard time and hoping to get it back little later on?", "Lance Fritz", "Eric?", "Eric Butler", "Hi Ravi. So, one of the things that we're real excited about is the great franchise we have and we have a very diverse franchise. And some components of our franchise obviously as we mentioned, the energy related and the International related are facing both economic weakness conditions and also some competitive conditions. So, we've been talking about the challenges in coal, coal as you know has been greatly challenged not only a demand because of weather and other usage demands, but natural gas has been a great strong competitor to coal. ", "The below $2 natural gas prices has created a headwind for coal in the past. We\u2019re excited or we think that with natural gas being above $3 now and even some of the futures market showing it in the mid-3s that that certainly will improve the competitive condition for coal, but that has clearly had an impact likewise. The three mergers, the one large bankruptcy in the international intermodal, the volatility that we talked about in previous earnings releases has created economic conditions and competitive conditions in international intermodal. ", "Even despite those challenges in those markets, we still have been able to put our market price at re-investable returns and we think that looking at the broadness of our portfolio we are pretty positive in the future about our ability to price for the excellent value we provide and we're going to price above re-investable returns and we have a broad portfolio of opportunities to drive that message.", "Ravi Shanker", "Thanks so much for that color. Can you also, do you have the confidence that you can stay above inflation in pricing?", "Rob Knight", "Ravi this is Rob, let me answer that. I mean clearly long-term that is still our goal. The one thing with these challenges and opportunities that Eric just outlined, you know one things that we haven't finalized yet, but as we look into 2017, at this stage it looks like global insights inflationary numbers are like 2.5% and our number may well be above that from an inflationary standpoint, largely driven by the health and welfare costs on our labor lines. So, still some work to play out there, but longer term absolutely we are as committed as ever to driving that price.", "Ravi Shanker", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the pricing side, you commented how the higher natural gas price is helpful for coal, so that\u2019s obviously a constructive thing, but I'm wondering if you are optimistic if that will - that should help the cold tonnage and obviously if you have a normal winter and so forth, but what about the pricing in coal, if we stay at this gas price will go a little higher, do you think that the, you know you will be able to go transition to better competitive environment where you could raise price for coal transport or is that something that some of that pricing pressure would likely present?", "Rob Knight", "Yeah, so Tom you are asking a couple of different things here, as you know there are always a variety of market conditions that impact price transportation capacity availability and availability on transportation networks for other commodities, as you know competition, weather there are a lot of things, natural gas prices that will effect coal. We are positive that the use of coal should be increasing in the mid-term, if you just look at, again the competition against natural gas, if you look at the economic pick up and the use of energy we are confident that the use of coal should be picking up in the near mid-term and we saw that in the second to third quarter in terms of the sequential use of coal. We will continue to price for re-investible returns based on the value of service that we provide and we are confident in that strategy, we are confident in the value that we are providing and we are going forward.", "Lance Fritz", "Hi Tom, this is Lance. Clearly an environment where natural gas price is increasing, put it north of $3.50 or so and where weather is favorable and where the stock piles have been worked down that is a better pricing and competitive environment that not. So it helps.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Okay I appreciate that and for the follow-up, I don't know if this is kind of Rob or Cameron, but you\u2019ve shown nice improvement in the train length good momentum there, so that\u2019s very favorable, I\u2019m wondering if you look at 2017 and if you do see a volume growth, is there a couple of things play out, let's say you see a couple of points in volume growth, how does that translate to incremental margins? Could you see something that well above the normal 50% incremental margin we\u2019re talking about, could you see something 60% 70% as you expand train length more and see some of the benefit of the cost take-out and so forth, is that a reasonable equation or would you be more cautious about the incremental in 2017 if the volumes come back? Thank you.", "Cameron Scott ", "Rob, why don\u2019t you take that.", "Rob Knight", "Yes Tom. This won't surprise you, but we won't give guidance on the actual incremental margins, but everything you said are certainly opportunities. I mean as you know our G55 and Zero initiatives which are some 15 different areas and our view is we\u2019re looking at every single cost bucket in the entire company and attacking it aggressively with an eye on safety and efficiency and customer values. So, I would just answer that question by saying the scenario you outlined where there is positive volume and a reasonably positive economic environment would give us an outstanding opportunity to continue to drive productivity and staying away from an actual incremental margin calculation we would expect it to be a positive contributor. And by the way for us to go from where we are today to our 60 plus or minus by 2019 and with an eye on getting to 55 or so we're going to have a very healthy incremental margins from here to there. So we're going to certain certainly go after it.", "Cameron Scott ", "Tom as we've opened up the door now to the productivity in your question, I just want to give recognition to the entire UP team who have done a tremendous job in a reduced volume environment of finding ways to grow, for instance manifest train size 5% year-over-year that\u2019s a phenomenal effort, and that\u2019s just one of many in terms of finding productivity on the network. I think the team has done a tremendous job in creating productivity in a pretty difficult environment.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Yes, clearly you guys are doing a great job in that area. That's an impressive performance. Thank you for the time.", "Rob Knight", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.", "Jason Seidl", "Thank you operator. Good morning, gentlemen. I\u2019m going to stick on the price force here for now. As we look at that 1.5% you mentioned, tough volume environment, competitive environment, is this something that you would expect UNP to hover around for a while or what could break it out of that 1.5%? I\u2019m trying to figure out, is this near term are we going to see that throughout 2017 unless things recover from here?", "Lance Fritz", "You know Jason we don't give any guidance on price. Clearly, as we've outlined a little bit here this morning, there are certain markers that make the competitive environment better for pricing. Any time, for instance capacity and alternative modes tightens up that's good. Demand for the core underlying commodities as it increases that\u2019s good. So you just got to keep your eye on what's happening with for instance natural gas prices and stockpiles and weather in the cold world. What's happening on import demand and the financial help of our international intermodal ocean carriers that helps? What happens for industrial production in the United States that helps? What's happening to truck capacity, alternative modes that helps? So all of those are helpful environment for our pricing.", "Jason Seidl", "I appreciate that. I mean I just, even checking my records, I can't remember the last time you guys were below we would call your real cost inflation. Looking at 2017, how does - and I know you guys don't provide guidance specifically, but are you pretty confident that you are going to be able to grow your volumes and 2017 forget what percentage, but just grow the volumes?", "Lance Fritz", "Eric do you want to handle that?", "Eric Butler", "As you say we don't give volume guidance, but if you look at the markets that we have out there and you look at the pickup and different markets that we have. We feel pretty positive that as the economy continues to grow and is slowly strengthening. In many of our markets we feel very positive about the run rate opportunity. The one cautionary area that we have talked about before is in automotive sales, we continue to think those are cautionary, but if you look at even our Mexico franchise we had great growth in our Mexico franchise in the quarter. We still think that there are good opportunities to grow volume.", "Cameron Scott", "If I could just add to Eric's comments Jason, just kind of remind you and everyone else, you know our thesis from this point over the longer period is a positive volume environment and you look out the - as Eric just pointed out, you look at the unique diverse opportunities of our franchise while we are giving precise volume guidance for next year, but we do feel there is great opportunity for us to continue to leverage and over the longer period of time for us to have volume on the positive side of the ledger certainly.", "Jason Seidl", "Well, let me ask you quickly in another way, so if you saw negative volume next year that would mean that something would have to decelerate from here with the trends, is that an accurate statement?", "Cameron Scott", "Yes that's an accurate statement. Generally speaking, we got to be playing in multiple markets, but that\u2019s a fairly accurate statement.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay. Gentlemen I appreciate the time as always.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Hi, good morning everyone and thanks for getting me on the call here. A couple, I think a few months into this year we have been talking about OR improvement even when volumes are down pretty significantly in the first quarter, and I know you guys backed off a bit in 2Q, but I guess as I listen to the call here, it sounds like pricing might be in-line with cost inflation maybe even a little bit below next year and let\u2019s say volumes don't come back tremendously, what can you guys do on the operating ratio that maybe we could instill some confidence again that you guys would break into [indiscernible] territory?", "Lance Fritz", "Let me start Brandon, this is Lance and I\u2019ll remind you that we have confidence, extreme confidence in our ability to continually find opportunities to be more efficient, reduce waste, and increase the value that we are adding. I\u2019ll ask Cameron just to give us a handful of examples of things we're working on when we are going into next year, but our bucket is full of opportunity to be better.", "Cameron Scott", "On train size, the only commodity group that is truly optimized or nearly optimized is coal. Every single commodity that we have out there from manifest to automotive to intermodal to grain or rock all has tremendous opportunities for us to continue with the results that you have seen, so we feel confident that that is going to happen in 2017. The record all-time re-crew rate from a process perspective we feel like we have well in hand and we should continue to see that into 2017 and 2018. And we work on other initiatives like rationalizing our little horsepower for you. We've done a great job of moving to single unit local operations versus two units. There\u2019s a number of initiatives that we have. We\u2019re truly, we're just getting started in framing up the opportunity and getting ready to realize it as we step into the New Year.", "Lance Fritz", "Exactly. And even little things like see [ph] rates that improved 2% year-over-year here, there is plenty of opportunities we look forward to become world-class if you will and in consumption rate for diesel, so there is just a host of issues there Brandon that we can continue to work on.", "Brandon Oglenski", "No, and I appreciate all that you guys probably have gone on that we can see from here, but I guess in retrospect Lance was it just that volume got a lot worse than we thought in the second quarter or was it competitive factors, was it market pricing, what was it that led to the lack of ability to drive OR improvement this year. ", "Lance Fritz", "Let me let Rob handle.", "Rob Knight", "Yes Brandon. I mean your comment is right that we have always said and we do believe that we can make improvements in the operating ratio in spite of the lack of volume growth. And in fact if you look at over the last decade, you know we have taken almost 25 points of our operating ratio without the benefit of positive volume over that time frame. I would say that you are exactly right though, here in the short term this year I would say that the major driver of not likely improving the operating ratio this year is the pace of which we've been chasing volume down. I mean it\u2019s, we never have perfect visibility as to where that volume is going to trough and that makes it difficult so we are always kind of chasing if you will and I think that\u2019s really the answer to what you've seen this year. So as we look forward I think it\u2019s still a fair assumption and it is certainly our drive that we expect to make improvements in our operating ratio in spite of what the economy deals us in terms of what happens with volume now. Having said that as we look out over the next several years we do have volume in our thesis on the positive side of the ledger, but we\u2019re going to not use that as an excuse not to make continued productivity improvements.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.", "Scott Group", "Hi guys good morning. So, wanted to follow up on pricing, Rob your point about inflation picking up to 2.5% next year is that to caution us that pricing could be below inflation or is that you telling us that we have line of sight to inflation getting higher, so we have line of sight to our pricing accelerating to next year, I\u2019m not sure what you are trying to tell us.", "Rob Knight", "Yes Scott, my point on the inflationary comment is, we do expect inflation to go back up if you will to more normal levels versus the below inflation, below normal levels that we enjoyed this year and again 2.5 global insight are numbers because of health and welfare costs might be higher than that, so my point on that is simply to say not unusual against historical numbers, but we do expect inflationary pressures to be back to sort of normal conditions if you will.", "Scott Group", "But because you have line of sight to inflation picking up do you have line of sight to your pricing re-accelerating too?", "Rob Knight", "I would say no. I mean it\u2019s not mechanical as you know the way we price and we play in so many different markets that they are not - it's not a cookie-cutter, it is not a one size fits all, and as Eric outlined. There are opportunities for us to achieve stronger prize than other areas in the short-term, but we will continue to drive service, drive value and price at minimum of re-investable levels as Eric outlined in spite of what that inflationary number turns out to be. So, I would say they are disconnected if you will in terms of the day-to-day pricing initiatives that we take.", "Scott Group", "So maybe just bigger picture, it feels like for the long term you guys have said hey, we're going to get pricing no matter what if you get volume okay, if we don't get volume we don't care and truthfully you haven't had much volume, but you\u2019ve gotten great pricing, is the philosophy changing where you care more about volume now as part of G55 and so there is, it\u2019s less clear you necessarily always get the pricing?", "Lance Fritz", "Scott our philosophy is not changing and as a matter of fact, our top line this quarter reflects that it\u2019s not changing. We are pursuing business in the marketplace that we can price for the value that we represent and that\u2019s re-investable. And if we can't find that we walk away from it. So nothing has changed about that philosophy.", "Scott Group", "Okay and if I can just ask one more just on grain pricing specifically, so as the grain volumes are finally picking up are there opportunities to start raising grain tariff, I was little surprised by the sequential drop in ag revenue per car this quarter, I don't know if that\u2019s mix or lack of pricing there, does anything specifically on grain pricing?", "Rob Knight", "Yes Scott, I think if you sum up pricing as you know is in public tariff, which is publicly available and I think you would see some of that sequential increase in pricing in the public available tariffs that mirror kind of the demand that\u2019s picking up in grain. I think you will also see in some of the secondary markets huge increases in kind of the value in the secondary markets for equipment for grain, so some of that is yet public visibility too and I think if you look at those public things you would see pricing going with the demand increases.", "Scott Group", "Okay, thank you guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.", "Danny Schuster", "Hi good morning this Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thanks for taking my question here. So just coming back to pricing a little bit, I think investors are looking at the downward trend and wondering whether we could eventually see flat pricing at some point, and I think after today we are a little bit potentially closer to that so what can you tell investors to alleviate the concern that flat pricing is not a possibility?", "Lance Fritz", "Just exactly what we\u2019ve said this morning, which is our pricing philosophy is that we\u2019re looking for markets and opportunities where we can price for the value that we represent and if we can't find that and have it re-investable we\u2019ll keep searching. As markets improve, as the competitive environment improves that should translate into an environment where we have more opportunities than not, but our philosophy, our way of conducting business is not going to change.", "Danny Schuster", "Okay great thank you. And just switching gears on the field side, the discount to spot diesel prices seems to have climbed a little bit this quarter back up to around 66%, another 300 basis points up, so should we expect this trend to continue upwards or in other words expect the discount that you received to spot diesel to diminish as field prices go up? Thank you.", "Lance Fritz", "Rob?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, I guess I would answer that by saying it\u2019s hard to say, I mean I can't give guidance as to what that gap may be, but certainly the way I look at is overall as diesel fuel prices increase we will work hard and have good mechanisms in place to continue to - there may be a timing difference, but our surcharge is in place. So from a net impact we work hard to minimize that, but I can't predict exactly what the delta to the spot will be.", "Danny Schuster", "Okay great, thank you for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Justin Long", "Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about the OR, I know you said you are not expecting improvement this year, but do you think we will see year-over-year improvement in the OR in the fourth quarter given what you are expecting for volumes?", "Lance Fritz", "Rob, do you want to \u2026?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, Justin you know as you probably are on top of your - comps get a little bit easier if you will in the fourth quarter number one and number two we can continue to drive the productivity initiatives that we've been successful with this year and volumes get easier and if volumes stay kind of flattish as I outlined in my comments, say even flattish with where they are now, we would see the fourth quarter gap over previous year narrowing. So, having said all that, again without giving specific precise guidance on the OR for the quarter we certainly have an opportunity to do that.", "Justin Long", "Okay, that's really helpful and I don't want to beat the dead horse on core price, but we did see the moderation there and it sounded like in your prepared comments you said it was mainly due to energy and international intermodal, I was wondering if there was any way to frame up how much of a headwind you saw from those two areas of the business like maybe to say that was all 50 basis points of the sequential deceleration that we saw or something like that?", "Rob Knight", "Justin this is Rob, we don't break it out that way, but I would just tell you, I mean again as you've heard me say many times, we don't have just a simple cookie-cutter one price fits all, so all of our markets that we enjoy and again we have more markets because of the diversity of our franchise then many, it gives us opportunities and it\u2019s - the pricing opportunities for us are very diverse, but having said that we don't break out the way you are asking it.", "Justin Long", "Okay fair enough. I\u2019ll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you, Justin.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Thanks, good morning. I do just need to come back to price and I apologies I know it\u2019s been sort of - talked about this morning, but just one thought on renewals, you guys report core pricing be little bit different than some of your peers and I guess I just wanted to get a rough sense of the relationship between inflation and the renewal dynamic and I know it\u2019s not mechanical Rob and you kind of highlighted that, but just generally speaking, higher inflationary environment would you expect that renewals would accelerate as well and how much may be of a lag do you think that there is, I guess I'm just trying to get a rough sense. Regardless of the magnitude, just sort of directionally, I\u2019m guessing they work together, just want to get some color on that would be great?", "Rob Knight", "Yes Chris, I mean just a couple of comments I would make. Number one as I think you and others know we have about 25% of our business if you will that is affected by a list. So over a longer period of time that mechanism sort of may be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but over a longer period of time it tends to reflect what\u2019s happening with rail inflation number one, but I guess I would more broadly say and remind folks the way we calculate price and as you all have heard me say for many years, I\u2019m very proud of the fact that we are very conservative in terms of how we calculate price, it is not a same store sales kind of number, it is a mathematical calculation of how many dollars we yielded in that particular quarter from our pricing actions and the denominator is our an entire book of business. So, it includes contracts that perhaps we didn\u2019t touch certainly in the quarter for pricing. So, having said that there tends to be a little bit of a lead lag if you will in terms of the yield dollars that come from our pricing actions, but again our focus is unchanged from what it\u2019s been at this point in time, you\u2019ve got a couple of markets out there that are particularly challenging, but our commitment to driving value, driving quality service and driving positive price and positive volumes - positive margins has not changed.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay that's helpful, I appreciate that. And then maybe switching gears want to follow-up on the coal side, Eric you had mentioned I think 27 days - inventory is your 27 days above average I believe is what you highlighted there, what you think the right number is in terms of sort of the go forward period, what are the natural gas curve is sort of weather has been over the factor over the summer, we don't know what it'll be like over the winter, but what do you think that right number is, how close are you guys to kind of getting towards normalized inventories do you think?", "Eric Butler", "If you think about Powder River Basin inventories, the five-year average as I said was the low 60, 63, 65, and right now we are still at 90. So that\u2019s how you get to the 27 days. I do think that 60-ish number is probably right. If we have normal weather patterns and normal cold winter, if you look at the natural gas futures curve, I think right now it\u2019s like projecting 340 in the early part of next year. That will drive the inventories down. That will drive usage of coal, coal market share in the quarter was 32%, compared to like 28% I think in the second quarter, so coal market share is grown I think, it will be in the good - placed a good position, you will see coal volumes grow, you will see the opportunity for coal pricing to grow you will see inventories go down and I think we will be in a better place.", "Lance Fritz", "One thing to note, you can get to that days inventory reduction adjustment a number of ways. If you think about what's happening in the coal world in a different perspective, on a stock level of qualitative million tons of SPRB coal we are about 3 million tons higher year-over-year and that represents as Eric says about 25 days of burn. So, it really doesn't take much in both how much you have in stock and how much you\u2019re burning to affect that day\u2019s ratio. You can get there in a number of ways.", "Chris Wetherbee", "That's really helpful and real quick, can you say what the coal outlook was for volume within the low-single digit decline in the fourth quarter?", "Eric Butler", "We didn't Chris, but it\u2019s in the, call it in the low teens, it\u2019s probably a reasonable assumption, down low teens.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay great. Thanks for the time, I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for getting me on the call here. Lance just wanted to get your views on regulatory backdrop, obviously there\u2019s been a lot of things coming over the is STB and their review of the standalone cost that\u2019s an external consultant come out recently, we\u2019ve got some news as the GAO about ECP bricks [ph], but just looking into next year it seems like it will still be fairly busy on the dock, I just wanted to get your thoughts on, if there will be any potential impact changes in regulations in 2017 that you would be particularly focused on?", "Lance Fritz", "Brian thanks for that question. We are focused on the activity at the STB. That\u2019s largely driven by the reauthorization from Congress about a year ago in that reauthorization Congress has essentially encouraged the STB to work through their doc if they had a backlog of a fair number of action items. Our concern is that that\u2019s interpreted as a desire to regulate the industry further. We don't believe that is the desire of Congress, we think Congress' desire was to have the S&P work through the workload. So we've got our eyeballs and are working on different activities, things like the reciprocal switching roles or the reduction of exemptions of different commodity groups. ", "We are touching all the right points and making sure our perspective is known and incorporated into the thought process. There is a lot of moving parts there, so it\u2019s taking a fair amount of work on my part on our legal team and our Washington team. I would say our largest concern would be the overwriting overall impact of each individual regulation. If the STB takes those in isolation, we could end up in an impact that is unintended and unconsidered and so we\u2019re also working hard to make sure that the STB takes into account the full perspective of everything they are working and the knock-on impacts of each as a group. Does that make sense?", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Yes it does. And helpful I think you feel the activity you think potentially activist, but it just seemed like a dock that just needed to move forward a bit. Just one real quick question for Eric on the Hanjin impact, you had mentioned the $13 million write-off, I was just curious if there is any operational issues you have been seeing as there's containers come on onshore and people don't necessarily want to move them, anything from the chassis shortage that we have been hearing a little bit about, if that's a concern, clearly it\u2019s a lot of other puts and takes in the international intermodal side right now? Thank you.", "Eric Butler", "Yes Brian, so you knew specific I think has weathered a lot of what I call the operational fallout from the Hanjin bankruptcy fairly well. At a high level on the day they went bankrupt there roughly had about 100 ships on the inflows around the world, 40 owned, about 60 leased and they had lots of issues in terms of what to do with all of the end traffic flows, it was roughly $14 billion worth of goods and in traffic flows lots of issues about what to do with that. ", "We had a fairly nominal number of boxes in route on our railroad and we've been able to process all of those through - we probably have a couple of dozen left to process through from roughly probably a little over thousand on a day of bankruptcy. So, we navigated that fairly well, there are issues out there in navigating the rest of that and it is an issue for the industry and supply chain in terms of what to do with those boxes both loaded and empty in boxes on chassis what to do with those and that\u2019s something that the industry is going to be struggling with to resolve, but for the Union Pacific side we\u2019ve navigated that fairly well.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Okay, thanks for the detail Eric.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions.", "John Larkin", "Yes thank you very much for taking my question gentlemen. I had a question on coal, Q2 you have said a couple of times that the stockpiles are still well above kind of targeted levels yet sequentially there was a huge step up in coal volume too in theory replenish stockpiles rundown during the harder than normal summer, was that very specific to a few different utilities or what really drove that? It seems a little contradictory to make that comment that coal would be up sequentially even though stockpiles are still on average way above normal?", "Lance Fritz", "Eric can you handle that?", "Eric Butler", "Yeah, the stockpiles have come down, you know if you look at over the second to the third quarter the stockpiles have come down 13 days and it came down to cause the burn increase and so our volumes improved roughly 40% and the stockpiles came down because the burn increased even at a higher percent than that.", "John Larkin", "Okay. So it doesn't sound like the utilities are all that dedicated to driving those stockpiles down that aggressively if they are replenishing still fairly aggressively there in the third quarter, just one more question, the U.S. dollar has been sitting at elevated levels relative to foreign currencies now for a year or longer what\u2019s your outlook on that for the rest of this year and throughout 2017 and the impact it might have on exports, which are so critical and sort of the bulk side of your business?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes John, this is Lance. You are right, the dollar has been strong. We don't make prediction about what the dollar is going to be going forward, but you got to believe all reasonable expectations are it\u2019s going to remain strong. In order to change that you need real acceleration in the global market, which would enhance the strength of other currencies and there is just not a lot of catalyst that you see for that. To your point, a strong dollar does make exports difficult however. Even in today's world you see for instance grain exporting of Pacific North-west and the Gulf Coast and into Mexico despite a strong dollar, so market conditions can still prompt commodity movement in global trade. And the other thing to note is that the U.S. is unique in its ability for its manufacturing base to figure out how to be globally competitive over time. I think the shale energy revolution is indicative of that. Where a couple of years ago people would say $70 a barrel shale oil was competitive and in today's world they say no that\u2019s maybe more like $50 a barrel. So, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts there, clearly we would prefer an acceleration in the global economy which would prompt more global trade, which would mean more U.S. exports that all would be really helpful to us.", "John Larkin", "Got it. Thanks for the explanation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.", "David Vernon", "Hi good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. Rob I know you guys don't want to get too much into predicting price, but maybe could you let us or clarify for us kind of what percentage of the volume right now is under contract or would have a normal inflationary escalator versus those that are going to be subject to more of the competitor over market conditions that are out there?", "Rob Knight", "Yes David, I mean we don't necessarily break it out exactly where you are asking other than I would just remind that overall about 25% of our book of business is touched by the a list index, but to your question of how much do we have sort of under contract or if you will kind of sized from a pricing standpoint, it\u2019s a same answer I would have given you last quarter and that\u2019s about 70%. I mean every day of every week we are negotiating and with the customers and negotiating our deals, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s done each quarter on day one, so it\u2019s an ongoing continuous process and roughly speaking any day of any week we have about 70% of the next 12 months business under contract or sized up.", "David Vernon", "And I guess as you think about kind of your outlooks in your sort of near term to 60 and then the longer term to G55+ does the recent trend in that same store sales price metric make you the CFO sort of rethink the timing of some of those targets or do you think that you see enough opportunity in the cost side here to keep the full momentum on the margin side?", "Rob Knight", "Yes we haven't changed our guidance in terms of a 60 plus or minus by 2019 and then our eyeballs on getting to a 55 and I would just say, don't read that we are like changing longer-term view in terms of our commitment to pricing, we\u2019re not. I mean we\u2019ve got a little bit of the bump off the road because of some of the market conditions that Eric outlined, but as we look longer-term the levers that got us to where we are today that are going to take us to that next rung on the ladder of 60 then eventually 55 or certainly we hope positive volume, but are going to be solid value to our customers, solid core pricing at re-investable levels plus and solid productivity gains.", "David Vernon", "Alright, well I appreciate the color on that it's been a long call. Thanks for your time and we look forward to hearing more about those G55+ initiatives over the coming years.", "Lance Fritz", "Thanks David.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Ben Hartford", "Thanks. Rob quick question for you, you had provided the 15% revenue target that you had talked about in the past for next year, as it relates to Capex, can you envision as you march toward the 55% OR target longer term, can you envision the situation in which Capex does approach D&A on an absolute basis, is that realistic for a relevant period of time or a relevant time horizon?", "Rob Knight", "Ben, probably not, I wouldn't use that as a marker again because of the timing and these are long live assets generally speaking, but to your broader point, I\u2019m very proud of what the team has done to continue to make progress on tightening our capital discipline and I think it\u2019s a significant step of getting to that 15%-ish range if you will from where we have historically been. I mean there\u2019s a lot of great productivity and a lot of great work that goes into getting to that level. So, we will get to that rung next and then we\u2019ll see where we are at that point.", "Ben Hartford", "Okay, that's helpful thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question if from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.", "Walter Spracklin", "Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. So, just on the OR long term your targets as you mentioned, when we started the year we heard the entire, all the railroads each indicate that they would be able to reduce OR despite a challenging environment, you noted the same, most of done so and your OR unfortunately has not followed that trend and I am just looking on a relative basis, when you see the improvement across the group, is it - can you point to something that is specific to your company that be it a business mix, be it some structural challenges that lead you to have that challenge that the others did not and I frame it in a relative question, I know you don\u2019t like looking at peers, but I know your investor do, so I want to be able to understand is there something company specific here or how do you I answer that question when I get that OR question?", "Lance Fritz", "Yeah Walter, this is Lance. So, again I won\u2019t compare ourselves to our peers. We are a unique railroad. When we began the year, we were hopeful we were going to make OR improvement. The topline went away from us as Rob said a little more aggressively than we had anticipated. If you think about our ability to improve OR over the long run we are still confident that we can do it that\u2019s shown in our - maintaining the guidance for a plus minus 60 in 2019. We did start the year with very low operating ratio, it\u2019s still an attractive operating ratio, we\u2019re not pleased that we didn't have the opportunity to improve it this year and again we are just laser focused on all the activity necessary to continue to improve our margins for our shareholders.", "Walter Spracklin", "So coming back to your long-term then, I mean from where you sit today, I mean that\u2019s a 900 basis point improvement, it\u2019s a significant improvement many - several of your peers are there already and many investors are banking on you to achieve that, given the trends that we are exhibiting the reversals on those trends, I'm just trying to understand what confidence that we can be put in a reasonable timeframe, a long-term is a fairly vague definition, a reasonable time frame for evolution toward a 55 OR.", "Lance Fritz", "Rob why don't you take that?", "Rob Knight", "Yes Walter, I guess I would remind you and everyone that we are confident in sticking with our 60 plus or minus target OR by full-year 2019 and as you have heard us talk with eyes on where do we go beyond that to the 55, so while we have put a date on the 55, but I would just say that getting to a 60 is a very enviable spot in my opinion, I mean we\u2019ve made great progress on that. So, I would not read that this one year of perhaps not making OR improvement is a new trend or a new objective or new signal here, it\u2019s not, I mean to get from where we are today to that 60 is going to take all the initiatives we just talked about and it is the same levers that got us 25 point improvement over the last decade. So, we're going to continue to make that progress and we haven't backed off our 60 OR guidance.", "Walter Spracklin", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions.", "Brian Konigsberg", "Yes, hi good morning, thanks for taking my question. A lot of ground has already been covered, maybe just on the bonus depreciation and moving some of the purchases on locomotives from 2016 to 2017, so should we just think of the those two are connected and the carry over into 2017 will show up?", "Rob Knight", "I think I would stick with the guidance I gave on bonus depreciation impact this year of about $350 million. I don't think that\u2019s not going to move much. We haven't finalized what the number is going to look like all in for 2017, but I think I would still just kind of use that assumption of 350-ish for this year.", "Brian Konigsberg", "But conceptually a lot of that bonus depreciation is associated with the purchases of locomotives and is that just the way to think about it generally?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, I mean it certainly impacts that, but I would say it\u2019s still in that 350 range for this year and again we\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll get some - got carryover benefit next year, but we of course have to start paying back previous year, so we haven't finalized we are giving guidance as to what the impact all in net will be next year, but you are right, I mean the locomotive moment will have some impact on what those numbers are?", "Brian Konigsberg", "Understood, thanks. And maybe just touch a little bit on balance sheet, so you are approaching the self imposed leverage limits you talked about, just thought process from here you look to maybe deliver or actively deliver or will you naturally do a three EBITDA growth, how do you see that playing out?", "Rob Knight", "Yeah, I mean actually we've made great progress on that measure over the last several years and at this point in time the biggest opportunity we still have in front of us, which we are laser focused on is driving EBITDA, driving cash flow, and that will give us additional capacity and that\u2019s how we are approaching it. So, we've either do have room as we grow our earnings and grow our cash flow.", "Brian Konigsberg", "I will leave it there, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks very much. With regard, just focusing on the automotive sector, you mentioned the contract changes being a headwind in the 2017, could you just kind of compare and contrast what you think the impact will be as it looks like over the row conversions are good and then obviously there\u2019s a lot of near shoring and lot of development in Mexico and with manufacturing so just if you could compare and contrast within that sector, how you think it, you enter next year, is it going to be a net up or down in that category thanks?", "Rob Knight", "You know Scott, we love our autos franchise, we think we have the premier autos franchise. We think all of the trends in terms of Mexico production is positive for us. In terms of our franchise we think we are in a great spot for over the road auto parts conversions, we have great success this year and we think they will continue in the future. There will always be contract changes and it\u2019s a competitive marketplace and we saw that\u2019s a share and that\u2019s something that will happen across time. The big driver as we\u2019ve been saying my view on the automotive side is the cautionary impact in terms of sales. ", "Sales have been at record or near record levels and there are some indicators out there that should give cautionary lights, it\u2019s the amount of debt inherence in auto loans and leases. Actual sales incentives per car were at an all time record level in the quarter. The highest since 2008 was the previous record, so there is some cautionary signs out there, if auto sales stay strong we have a great franchise and we are in a great spot, I do think there are some cautionary signs out there?", "Scott Schneeberger", "Okay thanks, and just a quick follow on, on Panama Canal, any update there, what are you hearing from customers just [indiscernible]. Thanks so much guys.", "Rob Knight", "No, I think the Panama Canal story is what we\u2019ve been saying for the last several years and certainly I think the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve been mentioning that the amount of traffics hitting the West Coast versus the East Coast did - there was traffic that moved to the East Coast because of the strike and BCO\u2019s trying to diversify their risk and not be dependent upon the West Coast. We did see that phenomena. We have seen some of that business start to come back, but it hasn\u2019t all come back from before the strike. That has probably been a larger factor than any Canal opening factor. The fact that the BCOs are diversifying their flows and a lot of ways just to not have that risk.", "Having said all of that we do believe, I do believe that the West Coast ports are the most economical, the best supply chain in terms of transit time to get goods from Asia to the interior of the country and even into the East Coast. And if you look at some of the technologies at some of the West Coast ports are employee to make themselves more efficient or timing this vehicles and things like that, I think West Coast ports are still going to be positioned to be the best supply chain factor going into the future though you will see people running to do risk mitigation strategies.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you Rob, and thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific.

With me here today in Omaha are Cameron Scott, our Chief Operating Officer, and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd also like to introduce our new Chief Marketing Officer, Beth Whited. Some of you may recall Beth as our Investor Relations officer several years ago. Most recently, she was the leader of our chemicals group.", "This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.39 per share, which compares to $1.31 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 3% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups, while agricultural product volumes were up 8%, as grain shipments continued to be strong in the quarter.", "The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62%, a 1.2 percentage point improvement from the fourth quarter of last year, and about flat with the third quarter of this year. Outstanding productivity achievements along with positive core pricing helped to partially offset the decline in total carload volumes. While full year volumes were down substantially year-over-year, we did see declines moderate in the fourth quarter.", "As we work through the challenges of the year, we remain focused on the strategy we live each day through our six value tracks. The first value track we show is world-class safety, and I'm very pleased to report that Union Pacific had a record safety year in 2016, with our reportable injury rate improving 14% versus 2015.", "Executing on these value tracks enables us to run a safe, efficient and productive railroad while providing our customers an excellent value proposition. Our team will give you more of the details on the quarter, starting with Beth.", "Beth Whited", "Thank you, Lance, and good morning. In the fourth quarter our volume was down 3%, with near record agricultural product shipments more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. We generated positive net core pricing gains of 1% in the quarter with gains offset by challenges, predominantly in our energy-related and international intermodal businesses.", "Despite these challenges, we remain committed to achieving core pricing gains that align with our value proposition. The decline in volume and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car drove a 1% decline in freight revenue. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue gained 7% on an 8% volume increase, and flat average revenue per car.", "Grain carloads increased 22%, as a robust US grain supply and lower commodity prices enabled the US to be more competitive worldwide, resulting in record export volumes. Grain products carloads declined 2%, as a reduction in meal shipments, was partially offset by strength in biofuels.", "Food and refrigerated volumes were down 1%, driven by production changes in our canned and paste market, partially offset by strength in import beer. Looking forward to 2017, we expect high global grain inventories and the strong US dollar to put some pressure on the export grain market. Weather and global crop health will also continue to be factors.", "We expect food and refrigerated shipments will continue to see strength from refrigerated food growth and import beer. In autos, revenue was down 6% in the quarter on a 3% decline in volume, and a 3% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 6%, as a result of contract changes we have previously referenced that will continue to impact our volumes through the first part of 2017. These changes were partially offset by increased production and imports, driven by strong fourth quarter demand.", "The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 18 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, the third highest quarterly sales pace on record. Light truck sales continued to outpace passenger vehicles in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year. On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand drove a 2% increase in volume.", "For 2017, we anticipate sustained demand levels with consistent economic fundamentals and consumer preferences. However, we continue to be cautious due to high inventory levels, dealership incentives, and rising interest rates. On the parts side, however, over-the-road conversions will continue to present new opportunities for additional growth.", "Chemicals revenue was flat for the quarter on a 5% decrease in volume, and 4% increase in average revenue per car. We continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 71%, due to the lower crude oil prices, regional pricing differences, and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume excluding crude oil shipments was up 1% in the quarter.", "Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in other areas including plastics, which was up 11% in the quarter due to lower commodity prices that drove demand in both domestic and export markets. Looking forward, our chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable. Strength is anticipated in plastics, with new facilities and expansions coming online to help offset the continued declines we expect to see in crude oil.", "Coal revenue declined 6% for the quarter on a 9% decrease in volume, and 4% improvement in average revenue per car. Volumes continued to come in closer to year-ago levels. Powder River Basin tonnage fell 16%, while other regions surged 24%. A mild start to the winter, coupled with higher than normal coal inventory levels hindered Powder River Basin volumes. Strength in export shipments drove the improved other region results. We expect coal volumes will be up in the first part of 2017, driven by favorable 2016 comps. The market will continue to be influenced by natural gas prices and weather.", "Industrial products revenue was down 2% on a 5% decline in volume, and a 4% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 1% in the quarter, driven by a 10% increase in frac sand shipments through improved market conditions.", "Construction products volume was down 8% due to weather, and softened rock demand in South Texas. The strong US dollar, weak commodity pricing, and increased imports pushed metal shipments down 5%. Looking forward we are anticipating strength in frac sand shipments. A strong US dollar could continue to impact our metals markets.", "Intermodal revenue was flat on a 1% decline in volume, and 1% increase in average revenue per car. Excluding the impact of the Hanjin bankruptcy, intermodal volume would have been up 2%. Domestic volume grew 2% in the quarter. Stronger fourth quarter retail sales led to growth in both premium and truckload business.", "International volumes were down 4% in the quarter as the industry continued to face headwinds from weaker global trade, overcapacity, ocean carrier financial stress and consolidations. Excluding the Hanjin bankruptcy, international would have been up 3% in the quarter. We expect international intermodal volumes will continue to be impacted by ocean carrier challenges this year. Consumer confidence will continue to impact overall intermodal volume growth.", "To wrap up, slide 12 recaps our outlook for 2017 mentioned in the previous slides. We anticipate strength in several of our business teams, particularly agricultural products, coal and industrial products.", "Our diverse franchise remains well-positioned for growth this year, as the US economy slowly builds momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to strengthening our customer value proposition, and cultivating new business opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.", "Cameron Scott", "Thanks Beth and good morning. Starting with our safety performance. Our full year reportable personal injury rate improved 14% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75%. The team's commitment to successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace continues to generate positive results, as we improve toward our goal of zero incidents.", "With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate of 3.02 decreased 3% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that did not meet the reportable threshold, generating a record low incident rate for the sixth consecutive year.", "At public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 7% versus 2015 to 2.43. Union Pacific has launched a new initiative, the crossing assessment process or CAP, to enhance grade crossing safety in our communities. CAP will couple our comprehensive safety culture with new data analysis to help focus increased attention on the crossings where we can most substantially impact public safety. This big data approach allows us to utilize predictive analysis to identify crossings where incidents may be more likely to occur.", "CAP will be most successful in enhancing crossing safety, with the engaged participation of roadway authorities. Communication and coordination with public agencies is critical to success.", "Moving on to network performance. Once again, we generated solid operating results through the fourth quarter. As reported to the AAR, velocity declined 2%, while terminal dwell improved 1% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.", "Our consistent operating performance has also translated into fewer recrews, lessening the resource demands of our network. The 2.4% recrew rate achieved in the fourth quarter matched last year's fourth quarter record. And for the year, we achieved a best-ever recrew rate of 2.2%.", "Moving on to resources. Coming into the quarter, our resource position was efficiently balanced for the volume levels we are experiencing at that time. Throughout the quarter, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource levels to continually account for volume changes and productivity gains.", "As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 7% in the fourth quarter, when compared to the same period in 2015. Our engineering and mechanical workforce was down a combined 900 employees or 4%. The active locomotive fleet was down 5% from the fourth quarter of 2015.", "As always, we continue to adjust our workforce levels and equipment fleet, as volume and network performance dictate. In addition to efficiently right-sizing our resource base, we continued realizing gains on other productivity initiatives such as train length. Our relentless focus on productivity led to best-ever train size performance in 2016, as we achieved annual records in our manifest, grain, automotive and coal networks.", "Turning to our capital investments. In total, we invested just under $3.5 billion in our 2016 capital program. For 2017, we are targeting around $3.1 billion, pending final approval of our Board of Directors. More than half of our planned 2017 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network.", "You may recall from our third quarter call, that we're planning on acquiring 100 locomotives in 2017 as part of a previous purchase commitment. Our 2017 capital plan now includes about 60 locomotives, with the remainder being delayed into 2018. We also plan to invest an additional $300 million in positive train control. Looking to 2017, our operating strategy is built on initiatives that will drive continuous improvement across our network.", "Above all, this includes safety, where we once again expect record results on our way towards zero incidents. And we will remain agile, adjusting resources to demand, while maintaining focus on other productivity initiatives to further reduce cost, enhance the customer experience, and continue creating value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Rob Knight", "Thanks and good morning. Let\u2019s start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 1% versus last. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled $3.2 billion. The volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 3% improvement compared to last year.", "Operating income totaled almost $2 billion, a 2% increase from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $40 million, up from $28 million in 2015. Interest expense of $174 million was up 6%, compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate.", "Income tax expense increased about 3% to $687 million, driven primarily by higher pre- tax earnings. Net income totaled over $1.1 billion, up 2% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance, declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share.", "Now turning to the topline, fright revenue of $4.8 billion was down 1% versus last year, primarily driven by a 3% decline in volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $187 million, down $31 million when compared to 2015, but up $14 million from the third quarter. All in, we estimate a net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.03 headwind to earnings in the fourth quarter versus last year.", "The business mix impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter was a positive 1.5%. Year-over-year growth in agricultural product shipments and a reduction in international intermodal volumes were positive contributors to this mix, while more than offset declines in finished vehicles. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 1%.", "Let me just take a minute to level-set what this core price reflects. Our core price is essentially a yield calculation. For starters, it excludes fuel surcharge revenue. It takes this quarter's impact from pricing actions over the past 12 months, and divides that benefit by the quarterly freight revenue base from the previous year.", "In other words, it calculates what we actually yielded from our pricing actions during the current quarter. This is the way we have consistently reported core price over the 13 years that I've been the CFO, and I think it's the best way to see what is actually yielded from our pricing actions. Our fourth quarter core price reflects the continued impact of a challenging competitive marketplace in energy and international intermodal, as Beth had indicated earlier. Pricing in other areas has actually been holding up fairly well.", "In fact, if you exclude coal and international intermodal from the calculation, our core price on the rest of our business lines would be in the neighborhood of about 2% to 3%. Given these market dynamics, our core pricing will continue to be challenged throughout the first part of 2017 before beginning to strengthen later in the year, assuming market conditions improve.", "That said, I want to reiterate that our pricing philosophy has not changed. We will continue to price our service product based on the value proposition that it represents in the competitive marketplace, at levels that generate re-investable returns. This should result in real core pricing gains, and contribute toward improving margins over the longer term.", "Turning now to our operating expenses, Slide 22 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 3% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies, and fewer people in the training pipeline. These decreases were partially offset by the labor inflation, which was about 2.5% in the quarter. Full-year labor inflation came in about 2%, while our overall inflation was about 1.5%.", "As a result of lower volumes, solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, total workforce levels declined 5% in the quarter year-over-year or almost 2,300 employees. For the full-year our average work force level was down almost 10% year-over-year. For 2017, we do expect force levels to adjust with volume, but will also reflect ongoing productivity initiatives as well.", "Fuel expense totaled $431 million, up 2% when compared to 2015. Higher diesel fuel prices on essentially the same gross ton miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1%, while our average fuel price increased 2% to $2.65 per gallon.", "Purchase, services, and materials expense decreased 6% to $553 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance costs.", "Turning now to Slide 23, Depreciation expense was $520 million, up 1% compared to 2015. For the full-year 2017, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 4% to 5%.", "Equipment and other rents expense totaled $280 million, which is down 8% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes and benefits from productivity initiatives were more than enough to offset price increases.", "Other expenses came in at $233 million, about flat with last year. For 2017, we would expect other expense to increase slightly, excluding any unusual items.", "Slide 24, provides a summary of our 2016 earnings, with a full year income statement. Operating revenue declined about $1.9 billion to $19.9 billion. Operating income totaled almost $7.3 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to 2015. And net income was just over $4.2 billion while earnings per share were down 8% to $5.07 per share.", "Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the year totaled just over $7.5 billion, up about $180 million when compared to last year. The increase in cash was primarily related to the bonus depreciation on our capital spending, which more than offset the decline in net income.", "Looking ahead to 2017, the net impact of bonus depreciation will be a headwind of about $100 million, as the 2017 benefit is more than offset by cash required for the repayment of prior year programs. This net impact assumes no changes to the current tax laws. Our capital spending program for 2016 totaled just under $3.5 billion down 19% or $800 million from 2015.", "Return on invested capital was 12.7 in 2016, down 1.6 points from 2015, driven primarily by lower earnings. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels the all-in-adjusted debt balance increased to $17.9 billion at year-end. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times up from 1.7 at year-end 2105. This brings us close to our target ratio of less than two times.", "Dividend payments for the year totaled nearly $1.9 billion compared to $2.3 billion last year and this includes a 10% dividend increase which occurred in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, 2015 dividend payments also included the fourth quarter of 2014 dividend of $438 million which we paid in 2015.", "In addition to dividends we also bought back over 35 million shares totaling about $3.1 billion representing 4% over of our outstanding shares during 2016. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased just over 29% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $5 billion to our shareholders for the year, which represented 118% of 2016's net income.", "Before I talk about 2017, let me take a minute to tell you how core price and productivity stacked up against our inflation costs. First of all, our core price for the full year averaged 1.5% for 2016. This generated a pricing benefit that significantly exceeded rail inflation costs, which came in at about 1.5% for the year.", "Now remember, of course, that inflation is on a different base. Remember that we exclude depreciation, fuel, and equipment rents from our rail inflation calculation. On the productivity side, our G55 and Zero initiatives really took hold though out the year. These initiatives produced significant productivity benefits totaling approximately $450 million in 2016, which was also well in excess of our rail inflation costs. That's a big number, which reflects an enormous effort on our entire organization's part that got us behind the drive for improvement, from labor savings, to lower material costs, to operating efficiencies.", "Looking ahead to 2017. Volumes in the first quarter should turn slightly positive, and pricing will continue to be challenged as we mentioned earlier. We should see momentum pick up throughout the year, and we expect full year car loading growth to be up in the low single-digit range. This will be driven largely by more stable coal volumes, which will also see the benefit of easier comps year-over-year. We should also see some strength in other areas, such as domestic intermodal and agricultural products.", "As for inflation, we expect 2017 inflation will be around 3%, which will equate to a cost that is significantly higher than the inflation was in 2016. Given this higher cost and the current pricing challenges, the gap between inflation cost and pricing yield will narrow considerably this year. While exceeding inflation, our core pricing yield will be more challenging this year, but we still expect to achieve that goal. And on the productivity side, we should well exceed inflation again in 2017.", "We plan to achieve approximately $350 million to $400 million of savings this year as we continue our intense focus on our G55 and Zero initiatives. This will turbo charge our margins and returns. So when you add it all up positive volume, solid core price, and significant productivity benefits will all contribute to improved full year operating ratio. We finished 2016 with an operating ratio of 63.5%, and we are well on our target towards a 60% plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. And longer term, we are still focused on the goal of a 55% operating ratio, as we continue the momentum of our G55 and Zero initiatives.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you Rob. As we discussed today, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results in a difficult volume environment. Looking to 2017, we feel pretty good about some of the macro-economic indicators that drive our core business. Higher energy prices, favorable agricultural markets and improving business and consumer confidence all support a return to positive volume growth this year.", "As always, a new year will bring its share of change and uncertainty. We'll be closely monitoring the impacts of potential developments in areas such as corporate tax reform and commerce with our trading partners around the world, as well as the overall strength of the economy.", "We continue to have confidence in the strength and diversity of the Union Pacific franchise, which will position us well to safely and efficiently leverage stronger volumes as our markets begin to rebound. We will continue to execute on our strategic value tracks to provide our customers an excellent service experience while generating strong returns for our shareholders.", "With that, let's open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.", "Justin Long", "Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to start with a question on the OR. I know you said you expect an improvement for the full year, but is there any color you could provide on the quarterly progression of the OR? And specifically in the first quarter with a slight increase anticipated to volumes, do you believe the OR can improve in 1Q?", "Lance Fritz", "Rob, you want to take that?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, Justin, as I said in my comments, we're confident in our ability to drive full year improvement in the operating ratio. And we haven't given specific guidance by quarter, but clearly, it can and likely will be lumpy. And one of the points that you're raising, is in the first quarter alone, remember that we did get \u2013 last year in the first quarter, a fuel \u2013 favorable fuel benefit. So just kind of looking at that alone, that by itself will present likely a challenge as it relates to the operating ratio. So it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But we're focused on the longer term improvement driving the levers that we can, in fact impact over the longer term.", "Justin Long", "Okay. Got it. And maybe one on pricing. So if I think about your commentary, it seems like the message is the pricing environment has likely bottomed in the fourth quarter, and should get incrementally better throughout 2017. So first of all, would you agree with that statement? And second of all, when you think about your guidance to price above inflation, how much visibility do you have to that today? What are \u2013 how many contracts have you already repriced for 2017?", "Lance Fritz", "Hey, Justin, this is Lance. So we don't give forward price guidance, so we are not going to call a bottom. You heard Beth's commentary about the markets that we compete in. There are some headwinds that continue into next year, most notably in the first half of the year. And what we're hopeful for is that as the markets firm, it creates a more attractive pricing environment for us as the year progresses. I think I'll let Rob answer the second part of the question.", "Rob Knight", "Yes, Justin, I guess, I would just kind of build on Lance's point. We don't give specific guidance as Lance pointed out, but we are \u2013 take one message from us here, that while inflation's rising, while we have some challenges in the marketplace as it relates to pricing, we are still committed to pricing at reinvestable levels that are above the overall inflation costs in the year. And that could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter certainly, but we're committed and driven just as we always have been on doing that. And I don't recall, frankly what the follow-up question was. Oh, the visibility. Yes, I mean, Justin\u2026", "Justin Long", "The visibility, yes.", "Rob Knight", "I guess, I would answer that, you've heard me say this many times. No matter what day of the week, or what day of the year you would ask, what looking forward what percentage of our business we have sort of in the book, if you will \u2013 and it's lumpy because we're negotiating deals every day of the week throughout the year, we look at somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% of our business.", "Justin Long", "Okay. Great. I'll leave it at that. Really appreciate the time.", "Lance Fritz", "Thanks, Justin.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to sort of think about 2017, and kind of operating leverage. You've outlined, Rob, a couple of things there, and thank you by the way for the clarification on core price versus inflation. I think it's helpful people understand that. When you think about the gap narrowing a bit, in particularly the first half of the year, but volume kind of coming back, how should we think about all of those inputs into incremental margins historically? And sort of a volume growth dynamic coming out of a downturn, you've been able to generate some pretty solid incremental margins, and to get to your long-term targets, you need solid incremental margins. Just want to get a sense, just sort of how we might be thinking about that relative to historical performance when you look at 2017?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, Chris. As you probably could guess, we don't give and have never given incremental margin guidance but I would just say this. That to get from where we are today to our ultimate target, and if you know we're driving towards \u2013 the organization's driving towards a 55% OR but to get from there, to the 60% by 2019 and then beyond that to the 55%, requires that on an annualized basis you get somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% incremental margin on volume growth. So it clearly will be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on other factors but that's kind of the way I think about it. We've got sort of an over the longer period of time that 50% give or take is generally speaking what it's going to take to drive to our objectives.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up question. From a volume standpoint, when you think about the international intermodal piece of the business just broadly speaking \u2013 and that has been a bit of a headwind from a core pricing standpoint, and volumes have been, I guess, not necessarily fantastic there. I guess, as you think about that as you look out, when maybe do we see that dynamic start to turn? Do you need to see sort of just more broadly positive volumes across the industry, to start to see that capacity kind of tighten up? But or is it something that, as you lap some of these contract losses over the course of the next several quarters, maybe you could start to see that change a bit? I guess, I just want to get an understanding of maybe how we see the international intermodal business playing out over the next several quarters?", "Lance Fritz", "Beth, you want to take that?", "Beth Whited", "Sure. I think the alliances that are happening right now in that international intermodal space are still evolving. There's still a very significant surplus capacity in the marketplace. There's clearly some competition going on between the Panama and the Suez Canal and all of those things are going to play out over the course of the months and quarters ahead and our focus really is going to be on making sure that we have the best service product to handle that business as it comes to us.", "Lance Fritz", "Chris, there's a couple of moving parts there. One is the state of the Trans-Pacific industry itself, the ocean carrier market itself. The other is what's going on with U.S. consumer confidence and consumption. And both are moving parts as you look forward.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay, all right. That's helpful. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.", "David Vernon", "Hey, good morning, guys. So it seems like the mix actually started to turn a little bit positive. And I know you talked a lot about core price and not giving guidance on that. But I guess as you think about the setup for the next three, six, nine, 12 months, it does look like with growth in frac sand, maybe little bit of a less headwind in coal and maybe growth in some of the chemicals business that the mix number we should expect that to continue to be positive coming into 2017. Is that fair?", "Lance Fritz", "Rob, you want to take that?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, David, again, If I sound like a broken record. You heard me say this many times. We would hope that all that plays out as you define. But we've given up trying to give guidance on what mix is going to be because again, I would say probably us more than most we are in so many diverse markets which is a huge strength in the. UP franchise that there's a lot of moving parts and there's a lot of mix within commodity groups. So I would be reluctant to give any kind of guidance on what mix is going to look like going forward.", "David Vernon", "Okay. And then, I guess, as you think about the upside, Beth, on the frac sand business, you mentioned the volumes are kind of trending up 10% here. We've heard some anecdotal evidence that sand prices are also rallying. Would you \u2013 should we expect some better pricing in that business as well, kind of directionally \u2013 and not looking for specific numbers or percentages, just trying to get a sense for, kind of how you guys think about your value proposition into an improving demand for drilling materials, which seem to be routed on your network from Wisconsin to the Permian?", "Beth Whited", "As you know, we don't really give any sort of market specific pricing guidance. But I would say that we're pretty excited about the inflection point we saw in the rigs and them kind of coming up slowly over the second half of last year. A lot of the growth is coming in the Permian Basin which is a strength point in our franchise. So we do expect to see good year-over-year comps in frac sand as the year progresses.", "David Vernon", "All right, thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Danny Schuster", "Hi, good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking our question. We were hoping to dig in a little bit to the chemicals business. So Beth, I know you mentioned that you'll continue to see headwinds on the crude side. And I think your slides imply that it dipped into the mid single-digit thousand volume range this quarter. So I was just wondering first, is that kind of the right range to model going forward into next year on a quarterly basis?", "Beth Whited", "On to the crude oil business will continue to move away from us. As you know, the production is down, pricing is very difficult. There's more pipeline capacity coming along and that will just continue to go away from us as we progress throughout the year, down 71% in the last quarter, probably going to continue to see it fall away.", "Danny Schuster", "Okay. But getting to the point where it it's almost inconsequential at this point and then on the flip side\u2026", "Beth Whited", "I would call it pretty inconsequential, yes.", "Danny Schuster", "And then on the flip side, you have some new facilities coming on the plastic side. I think your slides implied that you had about \u2013 you were moving about 60,000 to 70,000 carloads of plastic a year, a quarter, each quarter this year. How much could the new plastics facilities add and when should we expect to see those come online?", "Beth Whited", "There's a lot of uncertainties and what's going to happen as those facilities come online. And they will start to come on let's call it second half of 2017 and kind of throughout into 2020. It's still unclear how much of that product will move domestically. How much of that product will go to export markets. As it goes to export markets will it leave directly from the Port of Houston. Will it come into an inner point for packaging and then go off to the West Coast. So I don't think we have any prediction to give you there. We're just pretty excited that our Gulf Coast franchise gives us the opportunity to reach a lot of those plastics facilities and we intend to participate to the degree that we're asked to.", "Danny Schuster", "Okay, great. And is the revenue per unit profile similar to kind of the overall business that you have today?", "Beth Whited", "I don't think we're going to make a comment on that.", "Danny Schuster", "Okay. Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Rob, I can understand the challenge of forecasting mix but maybe you or Beth as you look at the high level portfolio of the business you look at, can you give a sense of what percentage of the business is really sensitive to the U.S. dollar, both on an exports and import side including metals, grain and coal you mentioned before. And if I remember from prior fact books I think you\u2019d highlighted roughly about 15% of revenue was tied to exports. So any updated numbers there would be appreciated.", "Lance Fritz", "Hey, Brian. This is Lance. I'll let Beth talk specifically to our international business and what our business looks like in terms of cross-border trade. But in terms of trying to get a sense for how much of our business is sensitive to the U.S. dollar, the answer to that is there's a fair amount of our commodity mix with lots of moving parts that either benefits from a strong dollar or gets hurt by a strong dollar. So you could essentially say to the extent that a dollar and its value internationally impacts the U.S. consumer and U.S. industry, our total book has some exposure to that. But I'll let Beth talk about our international book specifically.", "Beth Whited", "So I think you probably heard us quote some numbers before but just as a refresher, about 40% of our business is international with a fair portion of that being Mexico and then the rest being truly global business. And we do as you said see a lot of grain in that. Clearly there's other grain products as well as a number of our industrial products that participate in that global market. Probably a big chunk is also in the vehicles and parts, mostly going back and forth from Mexico. And so there's some puts and takes with that over time because you'll see some things that are advantaged as you're in a strong dollar position but we certainly have seen some challenges with competitive products worldwide really competing against products that are made in the United States.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Right, right. Yes, I can certainly appreciate the complexity. And I guess, to follow up with even more complexity, and when we look at the cross-border stuff you mentioned going to and from Mexico, and talk of the GOP's border adjusted taxes tied into the corporate tax reform. How do you kind of size the risk potentially, if that were to come into play, and what are you hearing from customers? Do you have any sort of scenario analysis that you're trying to work through now, if that were to come into effect as written? I know it's still early, and we hear a new thing each day, seemingly from President-elect Trump and the GOP. But just how you're thinking about that piece of the network would be helpful? Thank you.", "Lance Fritz", "Sure. So we are paying close attention to all of the talk about potential outcomes as we go forward in terms of impact on either NAFTA or other international trade agreements. Our perspective is that the United States is tightly woven with its trading partners and our consumers benefit greatly from free and open international trade, both from a standard of living perspective, making goods available to them at lower cost than they would be otherwise, as well as creating markets for U.S. goods to be sold into, creating a robust potential growth for U.S. jobs and typically the higher paying U.S. jobs.", "When we look at the cross-border trade let's say specifically with Mexico, when you really dig deep, you see that a large percentage, certainly more than half, a lion's share has value added on both sides of the border and is inextricably linked to our economy. So we've been giving that kind of feedback to our elected officials and regulators for a long time. We'll continue to give them that kind of feedback. And we are prepared and preparing for any of the potential outcomes that might occur. But bottom line, we're optimistic that those decisions ultimately will benefit U.S. trade and the U.S. economy.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Great. Thanks, Lance, appreciate the thoughts.", "Lance Fritz", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.", "Scott Group", "Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. So Rob, just I apologize if I'm slow, I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying on pricing. So if I'm understanding right, you're saying that the dollars from pricing this year will be above the dollars of cost inflation, but don't necessarily expect the headline pricing number to be 3% or better? Is that is kind of what you're saying?", "Rob Knight", "Look Scott, I didn't gave and we won't give the specific percentage increase guidance, but yes, our message is that with the challenges that Beth has outlined in some of our markets and favorable pricing we are still enjoying in the other markets, you combine that against a higher inflation expectation, of course that's calculated as you know on a different base, that our dollars we yield, which is how we calculate our price, the dollars we yield from pricing in 2017 we expect to be above the dollars we expend in the inflation buckets, albeit potentially and likely narrower gap than we saw in 2016.", "Scott Group", "Okay. And given that narrower gap, do you think \u2013 is the path to that 60% operating ratio, does that naturally then become more back-end loaded in 2018 and 2019, or not necessarily?", "Rob Knight", "No, I wouldn't say that. Again, it will be lumpy, but I would say as we have said all along, going back even the days of Project 75, if you look at the progression that we've made, it really is the same levers that we have at our disposal and that's volume, pricing to market, and productivity. And those three levers are still the levers that we wake up every day pushing to our advantage. But they will be lumpy and sometimes markets dictate how much of that lever you're able to pull from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year but I would not say that that changes our \u2013 certainly doesn't change our focus and our commitment to getting to that 60% but from quarter-to-quarter all of those levers can result in a lumpiness between here and there. But we are very focused on that and I would say that a big part of the success that we are enjoying, have been enjoying here of late is that turbo charged if you will productivity result.", "Scott Group", "Okay. That makes sense. And just lastly, for you, Rob or maybe Cameron, did you guys say what you think headcount is going to be in the first quarter, and the year? And do you think we need to start thinking about a more meaningful step-up in resources, as some of the service metrics start to see a little bit of pressure?", "Lance Fritz", "Rob, why don't you take that?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, Scott. We haven't given guidance on certainly not quarterly guidance on operating ratio. But I would tell you that Cam and his team\u2026", "Scott Group", "Sorry, headcount.", "Rob Knight", "On headcount, I'm sorry, did I say\u2026", "Lance Fritz", "Whatever you said, headcount.", "Rob Knight", "Yes, on headcount. But I would tell you that with Cam and his team and the entire organization's continued focus and commitment on productivity we are confident in our ability as volume hopefully recovers to continue to squeeze out productivity. Having said that, I would expect that certainly for the full year 2017, as I said earlier, our headcount will move up or down with volume. We hope it's up. We hope volume's positive but not one for one because there is still an assumption of continued turbo charging our productivity. We are in a position of being very ready if you will with our resources to absorb the single-digit growth in volume that we're anticipating this year. By the way, not just headcount but that stands true for locomotives as well.", "Scott Group", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Rob Knight", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.", "Ravi Shanker", "Thanks, good morning, guys. And also, thank you for the detail on pricing versus inflation going into 2017. Just a couple of follow-ups there. So if inflation is going to go up by 150 basis points this year, and pricing is to be above inflation, that means your pricing probably goes up by something to that magnitude, although you're not formally saying that. If pricing was to improve from here, what are the end markets that will drive it? Are these the same end markets that have been driving the weakness so far?", "Lance Fritz", "Let\u2019s \u2013 of course by not commenting, we're not giving guidance on your first presumptive statement. So let\u2019s just set that aside. And then Beth, why don't you talk about what markets look like as you're moving into 2017.", "Beth Whited", "Yes, as we think about 2017, we will still continue to see some challenges in places like coal and international intermodal. But we would expect to get some momentum as the markets improve with the economy growing. Additionally, as the year progresses, the trucks and our competitors are going to face some challenges with electronic logbooks and hours of service regulations coming into play, which may also provide us with an opportunity.", "Rob Knight", "Ravi, if I can just \u2013 this is Rob. Just kind of back to the first part of your question, I just want to make sure I am clear on what you were suggesting. Lance is right, we're not going to give specific pricing guidance but I would just clarify. That we are not saying don't take from what I have said about our pricing plans against inflation for 2017 as being any kind of an indicator of whether that means pricing's going up or down. I mean what we're saying is that we are still committed to that pricing yield dollar being above the inflation expense but I did say we do anticipate that that gap of the yield above inflation dollars will narrow in 2017. So I didn't say what the pricing will be. And I would not take that to mean pricings going up at some X amount.", "Ravi Shanker", "Okay. I think I understand, but I'll probably follow up offline anyway. Just one follow-up on the call though. When you consider kind of all the factors that are kind of pressuring pricing today, and also the factors driving \u2013 I don't want to say a potential rebound in 2017, but let's say that comes. Are there any UNP specific factors here, or do you think that this is an industry-wide phenomenon, in terms of what you're seeing out there?", "Lance Fritz", "This is Lance. I'll attempt to take that. So the factors that impact pricing are essentially the market factors that Beth had talked about. We have a market we compete in, many markets we compete in across commodity groups. And what we've said is we're fairly optimistic as we look into 2017. First and foremost, on coal, primarily because of easier comps. But there are some other market dynamics that we're going into the year with a stronger grain and ag products market than we had entering 2016.", "Arguably construction markets should be firming up as there's talk of infrastructure and as we see the housing markets improve. Consumer confidence and business confidence appears to be growing, so that looks like that could create some opportunity. So bottom line is as our served markets improve, that should create an environment where we have more pricing opportunity.", "Ravi Shanker", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Ken Hoexter", "Hey, great. Good morning, and great job on the performance, and the OR for the quarter. But, I guess, Beth, maybe you can just talk a little bit more about coal, given the easier comps that we're facing, particularly in the first half? Can you talk a bit about where inventories are, how much they've come down, and kind of what your view is on how pricing is right now? Are you in the money? Are you seeing demand pick up at this point?", "Beth Whited", "So we have seen what I call a very modest fall-off in inventory levels. We're at around 93 days of inventory which is still call it 80 days above historical levels. So still kind of a challenging stockpile environment. We are, though, in a little different situation than we were in part \u2013 in most of 2016, where we have natural gas prices that are considerably higher, $3.40-ish, where last year we spent most of the year in the $2s and even a part of the year under $2. So that gives us some potential for our served plants to be more in the money, and able to burn coal.", "So the weather of course is going to play a role in it in parts of our network and served plants are experiencing some nice cold winter and we love that. So if you kind of put that all together, we've got favorable comps, a better natural gas environment, stockpiles that are still a bit high, and weather is always going to be kind of the swing factor.", "Ken Hoexter", "Just for comparable purposes, a quarter ago, a year ago, you had mentioned that inventories had come down a bit. Can you give us, from what level, to put that in perspective?", "Beth Whited", "We were over 100 days at one point and I can't recall what they were in the first quarter of last year but it's not a substantial decline and it's still well above historic levels.", "Lance Fritz", "Ken, bear in mind, there's two different measurements for inventory. One is an absolute measurement of how much tonnage do you have on the ground. That's moved more dramatically than what your days burn looks like and of course that's because burn has changed over time.", "Ken Hoexter", "Okay. And I think, Beth, just keeping with you for a minute, for my follow-up on grain. Growth, I guess, decelerated here in the fourth quarter from what I guess, is still a record crop. Is there a reason why that is, and maybe your thoughts on that going forward? And then, same with yields, they were flat. Is, I guess, with demand being up, would \u2013 or I guess, printing average revenue per car, is that something, a shift between domestic export, or anything that would impact that?", "Beth Whited", "We do have a pretty large carry-out in the ag markets and we still continue to see pretty strong shipments all through the fourth quarter going to export markets. So I\u2019m not sure what data you\u2019re referencing when you talk about it being down from third to fourth, but\u2026", "Ken Hoexter", "Till not down, just de-accelerating. Sorry.", "Beth Whited", "Okay, sorry. Yes, it was \u2013 we had a very strong fourth quarter, huge carry-out remains in the market. I think the carry-out numbers are up something like 10% across the different grain categories versus year-ago levels. It\u2019s going to be impacted by the same thing it\u2019s always been impacting by, which is world grain capabilities, what kind of harvest we see in the United States this year and then of course this is an area where we do see impacts from the U.S. dollar strength. I don\u2019t know if I got all the pieces of your question. There were multiple parts there.", "Ken Hoexter", "No, yes, it was just on the \u2013 that was the volume side. Just on the yield side I was just wondering why they would be flat in such a strong market. Is that a shift in mix that would cause pricing to be relatively flat year-on-year in terms of average revenue per car?", "Beth Whited", "Okay. Sorry. I didn\u2019t catch that part. Yes, so our grain can move to market in a variety of different ways. It can move all the way by rail to the end destination. Sometimes we\u2019ll see situations where the river is very competitive. So we may move to the river and so that would be a shorter length of haul for us and that might drive some mix changes in the arc. But still very positive yields for us. We wouldn\u2019t say that moving a shorter distance necessarily changes the yield perspective.", "Ken Hoexter", "That\u2019s wonderful. Thank you very much for the insight. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting me in here. So I\u2019m not going to ask about pricing, because I think what\u2019s critical here is that you guys are guiding to an improved operating ratio in 2017. And Lance, I know you guys have been calling for that for the last two or three years, but it has been challenging with top line declining as much as it has. What is the confidence level in 2017 that we are in fact, going to see that improved margin?", "And Rob, I\u2019m going to try it, because if I just straight line your guidance to get to a 60% OR by 2019, I think that implies about 100, 110 basis points of improvement per year. Is there any reason why we shouldn\u2019t be thinking that\u2019s attainable, in a stronger growth environment that we might be seeing in 2017?", "Lance Fritz", "So Brandon, I\u2019ll take the confidence level and then turn it over to Rob. We are confident that we\u2019re going to improve our operating ratio in 2017. The reason why is the three moving parts that we touch that Rob talked about; one is productivity. Rob\u2019s already talked about another strong year of productivity in 2017 and Cameron and the rest of the team have those projects in sight and already working on. That gives us confidence there.", "The second is pricing. We\u2019re going to take what the market gives in terms of pricing for the value that we represent. We\u2019re hopeful that the markets are firming a bit, so we\u2019re hopeful that the third element in terms of volume will cooperate a little bit more in 2017 and we\u2019ve guided to positive volumes in 2017. So we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to be able to improve the operating ratio.", "Rob Knight", "Yes. Brandon, this is Rob. I would just add that we stay away from giving specific OR guidance, but your straight line math is right. But one thing we know is things aren\u2019t going to be straight line, but we\u2019re going to take advantage of every opportunity we have and if we can front end load that we will. If it ends up being lumpier than that or back ended because of factors in the marketplace, that\u2019s the way it will play out.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Okay. I appreciate that feedback. And Cameron, can you just talk a little bit more about the productivity goal this year of $350 million to $400 million. I mean, is that mostly labor related as you think about volumes coming back and maybe not adding one for one?", "Cameron Scott", "Well, your last comment is accurate as Rob mentioned, with the amount of furloughed employees we have as Beth brings on additional volume, we have people ready to take on that volume. And there\u2019s plenty of room on train side, so we expect to see additional volume come on the railroad without any additional starts as far as \u2013 whether it\u2019s purely labor based or other initiatives, most of it is other initiatives.", "Brandon Oglenski", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Yes, good morning. Thank you. Let\u2019s see, Rob, at the risk of asking you something you\u2019ve talked about quite a bit here, just to fine-tune on what you did say on inflation for 2017, did you give us a specific expectation? Or you just said, it\u2019s going to be higher than the 1.5% inflation you had in 2016? I just want to make sure I understand that.", "Rob Knight", "Yes. Tom, I actually said that we expect inflation to be in the neighborhood of 3% full year.", "Tom Wadewitz", "And that\u2019s not just labor, that\u2019s total inflation?", "Rob Knight", "That\u2019s total inflation, yes. Although labor, health and welfare are certainly drivers of that.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Right. Okay. So that\u2019s 3%. In terms of intermodal, I don\u2019t think that you\u2019ve commented a lot on this. What\u2019s the view on intermodal volumes in 2017? You got a lot of moving parts. Do you have confidence that you\u2019ll see growth in the domestic piece, and is it reasonable to think the international is going to be down? Or how would you think about the two pieces, and what the outcome might be in terms of intermodal volumes, up a couple points, down a couple points, just kind of broad brush? Thank you.", "Beth Whited", "Hey, Tom, it\u2019s nice to talk to you again. I would say that we feel really good about our ability to continue seeing domestic intermodal growth. We\u2019re very focused on highway conversions. We have an expectation that there could be some tightening truck capacity later in the year and that could be very beneficial to our intermodal market as well.", "On the international side, I think it\u2019s really hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen in international intermodal this year. As I alluded to before, there\u2019s just a lot of moving parts in that business with the alliances evolving, all the overcapacity and what I\u2019d call some in-fighting about which ports are the ultimate winners.", "We\u2019ve seen the West Coast ports kind of bounce back from the levels that they were at during the \u2013 immediately following the ILWU issues. But the Gulf ports and the East Coast ports are still kind of duking it out. It will be on balance hard to predict what happens in international intermodal I would say.", "Tom Wadewitz", "So you think the net result is a little bit of growth in volume or is that hard to say?", "Beth Whited", "Yes, I don\u2019t think I would be willing to make a bet on that today.", "Rob Knight", "Right.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Okay. Thank you Beth, I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.", "Bascome Majors", "Yes, thanks for fitting me in here. So Lance, I was curious if you could help us understand what drove the Board\u2019s decision to make a leadership change in the sales and marketing team? And perhaps as a follow-up, Beth, if \u2013 can you let us know how, if at all, we can expect UNP\u2019s approach to customers and pricing change, with you running the group there?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, Bascome, this is Lance. The Board supported my decision to change our leadership team around a bit. It was really prompted by one of our executives getting close to retirement, announcing their intention to retire. That allowed me to put Eric Butler into a job that he is exceptionally well suited for. That will benefit the Corporation. That allowed us to put Beth into the Chief Marketing Officer job and she\u2019s going to be tremendous in that role. So it had nothing to do with other than normal, customary and routine succession planning and it\u2019s an execution of our succession plan. And I couldn\u2019t be happier with it and the Board couldn\u2019t be happier with it as well.", "Beth Whited", "As far as I\u2019m concerned, I think that Eric was a wonderful leader for the department. He set a lot of strategies in place that focused our entire organization on pricing and we will continue along that pricing path in the manner that Rob has laid out for you today. In terms of changes, of course we\u2019re always going to try to evolve and change with the marketplaces but we\u2019re going to keep our focus pretty simple. We\u2019re going to keep trying to grow volume on a network. We\u2019re going to try to retain the great customer base that we\u2019ve already got. And we\u2019re going to keep taking price in the marketplace as circumstances allow.", "Bascome Majors", "Thank you both for the color there.", "Lance Fritz", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.", "Amit Mehrotra", "Okay, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had one question on productivity, and just trying to understand whether productivity savings are an absolute reduction in the cost base, or an effort to maybe make the cost structure a little bit more variable, where you lower the decrementals, but also lower the incrementals. If you could just sort of help us understand that a little bit better, so we can get a sense of maybe how some of the productivity actions you have taken and are taking, can maybe impact conversion of revenue growth in the future? Thanks.", "Rob Knight", "I\u2019ll start, and then if Cameron would like to add some Technicolor, he\u2019s welcome to. So Amit, when you think about the productivity that we have, Cameron and team and the rest of the executive leadership team have removed cost from our structure. It\u2019s come out in different ways. Our overhead, management and administrative burden has been reduced. I do not see a need to increase that as we grow into the future, so that\u2019s fundamentally changed how we drop revenue to bottom line to some extent.", "From an operating perspective, Cameron and team have done a tremendous job at reducing what we\u2019ve considered kind of structural wastes like re-crews. That\u2019s where a crew is required to take a train to destination other than the train that originate or the crew that originated with the train. That\u2019s pure waste. And the fact that we\u2019re now at record low levels and intend to stay there has kind of structurally reduced our cost base.", "There\u2019s hundreds of examples like that that tell us that, A, it\u2019s real productivity, real-time, right now; and B, we don\u2019t anticipate it growing back to the same levels it was historically. Now, clearly when our volume declined, there was some just pure volume reduction in costs because we didn\u2019t need as many, for instance, TE&Y or as many mechanical forces to support the business. And as we grow, we expect that to grow back but not one for one as we\u2019ve said before.", "Amit Mehrotra", "Right.", "Rob Knight", "Cameron, you got anything to add to that?", "Cameron Scott", "Amit, I think one of my favorite productivity initiatives is train size. It might give you a sense that we have plenty of head room in productivity as Rob indicated. We\u2019ve set all-time train size records for four years in a row. And we\u2019re not close to optimizing our network. Coal is truly the only network that is very close to being optimized and we still have some room there. Rest of the network is wide open for opportunity, making sure we match up train size with taking good care of Beth\u2019s customer commitment.", "Amit Mehrotra", "Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks for that. Can I just ask one follow-up on taxes? You mentioned it very briefly in the prepared remarks, but I know corporate tax reform is a really tough question to answer today. But if you can generally talk about \u2013 if the industry, or if we do receive any major relief on corporate taxes, how that would translate to the P&L? Do you think some of it could be competed away, either through wage inflation or lower prices?", "And then, also, Rob, I think the Company has over $15 billion deferred tax liability. So I would expect that to be reduced pretty significantly, if we do get any relief. Does that change at all, the Company\u2019s thinking on capital deployment strategy? Thanks.", "Rob Knight", "Yes. This is Rob. Amit, as you obviously know, there\u2019s a lot of devils in the details if you will in terms of how and when and if that will all play out. I would just say you\u2019ve sized it right. And my expectation of any tax reduction benefit that may result would flow to the benefit of the Company. I mean, we\u2019re not sitting here thinking about making \u2013 holding back, making capital investment decisions based on the tax rate as an example. So I would anticipate that that wouldn\u2019t impact sort of how we treat that and I think it would be to the benefit of us and our shareholders if that played out and we would have the expectation of hanging onto it.", "Cameron Scott", "Yes. Just a reminder, right. So job one is create more cash from operations, so job two, we have the opportunity to use it for CapEx for rewarding our shareholders either in the form of buyback or dividend.", "Amit Mehrotra", "Right. I guess, you\u2019re already doing that to a pretty significant degree. So to the extent that you get a windfall or maybe an increase in the book capital as a results of a reduction of deferred tax liability. You would just basically do more of what you\u2019ve been doing, in terms of dividend, share buybacks, is that the correct read?", "Rob Knight", "Let\u2019s answer that from the perspective of would we take a windfall and some how apply it to capital projects that are not funded and the answer is no. We fund the capital projects that we think are appropriate for the business, that\u2019s our first highest order for cash utilization and we\u2019re very satisfied with what we\u2019re spending in capital right now.", "Amit Mehrotra", "Okay. All right. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks for taking the time. Congrats on the good quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Walter Spracklin", "Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I guess, if I could ask one question with regards to the competitive dynamic on the pricing side. If you were to describe your key competitors, both BN and trucking, if you were to describe their behavior in the last, call it three or four quarters, and how that might have changed as we go into 2017, would you say \u2013 I just leave it over to you \u2013 how would you describe that competitive behavior over the last little while?", "Lance Fritz", "Beth, you want to take that?", "Beth Whited", "Sure. I guess what I would say is that we\u2019re always in competitive marketplaces where we have trucks or other railroads who are making decisions about what makes sense for their business and our focus really is on ensuring that we\u2019re getting reinvestable pricing that makes sense to us for our business. Now, from time to time markets change and you\u2019ll see pricing change and we have to make decisions about whether or not we should meet the market where it is and we do that thoughtfully with the idea that our ultimate goal is to make decisions that represent our customer value proposition and what we think the value that we provide in the marketplace is.", "Walter Spracklin", "Okay. Let me \u2013 perhaps if I get a little bit more specific, I guess. You took some actions a couple years ago when BN was struggling in a capacity environment with crude. With the crude coming off, we\u2019ve been hearing that BN has reversed some of that with their own actions on a pricing standpoint. Is that true? And has there been any \u2013 if it is true, has there been any improvement in that dynamic in recent months?", "Lance Fritz", "Walter, this is Lance. I\u2019ll take that. So if you go back to 2014, there were opportunities for us to haul business that typically we wouldn\u2019t see for a number of reasons and we definitely took advantage of those opportunities. That was not a price based decision. That was a market offering us opportunity that we typically don\u2019t enjoy. And we\u2019ve already talked about that and our value proposition allowed us to have some of that be sticky and stay with us and some of it did not.", "Looking at today\u2019s world, Beth\u2019s answer is exactly as it is. There\u2019s competitive dynamics in every commodity market that we serve. Those change over time. The environment clearly has been more difficult in 2016 than in previous years. And what will help that is if the markets themselves start improving, demand starts increasing, excess capacity gets consumed and then our pricing environment will improve.", "Walter Spracklin", "Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I appreciate that color. Just on the second question here, and again I guess, this is for Beth, your franchise has enjoyed a nice lift in ag over the last 12 months. When you look out to 2017, are you forecasting growth on top of what should be a fairly difficult compare, or should we be building in, to be conservative, and to model an average crop year? Should we really be looking at a back half decline in your ag business in 2017?", "Beth Whited", "I wouldn\u2019t say that we still believe that we have opportunities to grow in our ag business that as I mentioned before. And there\u2019s a lot of dynamic that\u2019s have to happen, but the grain carry-out is strong. We don\u2019t know what will happen with the crop yet. We have a lot of grain products, things like biodiesel and ethanol that are moving pretty solid for us and then we continue to have opportunity in our refrigerated business to grow. So I think you have to decide how you want to put that into your model. But in general, we feel pretty good about our ag business in 2017.", "Walter Spracklin", "Okay. Thank you very much for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Thanks very much and good morning.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "The call is running long, so I\u2019ll just ask one on CapEx. Your guidance implies that you\u2019re going to be down just over 10% year-over-year in 2017 versus 2016, and the step-down versus 2015 is obviously even much more substantial. I assume a lot of that is lower locomotive purchases, but can you just call out some of the other areas of major savings?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes. Rob, you want to take that?", "Rob Knight", "Yes. At a high level, Cherilyn \u2013 I mean, you\u2019re right, the big ticket items if you will, if you look at the timeframe that you\u2019re citing would be locomotive and positive train control. I mean, those are two sizable. Beyond that, we always look at kind of a clean sheet approach if you will in terms of capital investments that we\u2019re of confident will drive returns and remember that every year, year in, year out, we spend just north of $2 billion on replacement capital, so everything above that is driven based on commercial decisions and with an eye on returns and capacity expansion, et cetera. So but the big ticket items, I think in terms of the timeframe you\u2019re looking at would be locomotive and positive train control.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "And then, just very quickly, in terms of the freight cars that you\u2019re adding in 2017, is that across the board, or are there particular areas where you\u2019re renewing the fleet?", "Lance Fritz", "Cherilyn, when we make freight car decisions, those are very granular and targeted. Every year we look at what we think the long range plan and the closer years in that long range plan mean in terms of overall fleet. We bounce that against what\u2019s retiring out and we make a judgment call as to what we need to purchase. So those \u2013 what gets purchased in any given year, the mix of freight cars that are being purchased and the quantities change and can change pretty dramatically. I would include that also incorporating containers and chassis.", "Cherilyn Radbourne", "Thank you. That\u2019s all from me.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Jeff Kauffman", "Okay, thank you very much. Can you guys hear me?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes.", "Jeff Kauffman", "Okay, thank you. Just a quick question for Rob. I know it\u2019s been a long call here. Rob, there was no discussion when you were talking about labor inflation, as to what was wage-related, what might be benefit and pension-related. And I know a number of other companies have flagged that pension goes from being more of a headwind to more of a tailwind, given what\u2019s going on in the marketplace. When you gave the labor inflation guidance, was that all-in?", "Rob Knight", "Yes, it is. And just a comment on that; yes, I\u2019m not going to break it out but I would say that the health and welfare component of that is certainly one of the drivers. I mean, there are other drivers but that is a sizable piece of the expectation of overall labor inflation will go up in 2017.", "Jeff Kauffman", "All right. Congratulations and thank you.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you, Jeff.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Daniel Hultberg", "Good morning. This is Daniel Hultberg, squeezing in for Scott here. Thank you for taking my question. Can you guys please elaborate a little bit on the end market outlook in the industrial products segment, and how we should think about the growth there, as we compare to the full year growth volume outlook for 2017? Thank you.", "Lance Fritz", "Beth?", "Beth Whited", "Yes. For our industrial products market, there\u2019s \u2013 as you know, it\u2019s kind of a market basket, has a bunch of different things in it. One of the biggest growth areas we\u2019ll see in 2017 will be frac sand and I mentioned earlier that we\u2019ve really seen rig counts come up and fortunately for us a lot of them are in the Permian Basin and we believe that\u2019s going to give us some opportunity to participate.", "But we do think that as we see the economy get some more legs and momentum, that we should have an in line opportunity to participate in that expansion in things like construction products and lumber specifically. Those are probably the key areas where we see growth. But I would say that we view that whole market basket as being pretty stable to growing in 2017.", "Daniel Hultberg", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Brian Konigsberg", "Yes, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ll just be very quick. The commentary just about the contract changes relates to auto, how do we think about that, if we have a kind of a base assumption for the market this year? Should we think that you\u2019re structurally below that because of the contract changes? Any color there would be helpful?", "Beth Whited", "I would say the SAAR predicts pretty stable volumes for us into 2017, but as you suggest, we will lap that contract that we discussed in the early part of 2017 and so after that you should see us kind of participate in the market as it moves.", "Lance Fritz", "Don\u2019t forget that embedded in automotive for us are automotive parts and we\u2019ve done a really sound job. Eric and Beth\u2019s team have done a really sound job of penetrating that market and growing it. So that\u2019s a moving part there too.", "Brian Konigsberg", "Actually if I could sneak one last one in. I\u2019m sorry, were you adding onto that?", "Beth Whited", "No, go ahead.", "Brian Konigsberg", "I\u2019m sorry. Just last question on inflation, just coming back to that. So 3% is a bit higher than I think some of your peers had suggested for the year. I know, before you did say that health and welfare will be a leading driver of that. I think you said that last quarter. But are other components \u2013 maybe you could talk about some of the other components that are really picking up, that are contributing as well, because I didn\u2019t think that, in aggregate it would reach 3%. It was just kind of the outlier on health and welfare, where that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case now.", "Rob Knight", "Yes. Brian, this is Rob. I would just say that overall our overall inflation, I didn\u2019t call out specially just labor, but labor will be a sizable piece of it, our expectation is 3%. And I would just say, that it will be what it will be. But I frankly not speaking for other railroads, but I think in terms of the labor and the health and welfare I would be surprised that if at the end of the day there\u2019s a difference between us.", "Brian Konigsberg", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you and thank you for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We look forward to talking with you all again in April.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you. And good morning everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Beth Whited, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2017. This equates to a second quarter record $1.45 per share, which is up 24% over last year.", "Total volume increased 5% in the quarter compared to 2016. Carload volume increased in four of our six commodity groups, led by a 17% increase in Coal and a 15% increase in Industrial Products.", "The quarterly operating ratio came in at 61.8%, which was a record for the second quarter and is a 3.4 percentage point improvement over the second quarter of 2016. In addition to the increase in volume, positive core pricing, and solid productivity were key drivers of the margin improvement.", "Guided by our strategic value tracks, our entire team is focused on providing an excellent customer experience while safely and efficiently delivering on our innovative productivity initiatives.", "I'm pleased with our results through the first six months and look forward to continuing our momentum through the remainder of the year. Our team is going to give you more of the details on the second quarter, starting with Beth.", "Beth Whited", "Thank you, Lance and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was up 5%, driven primarily by Coal and Industrial Products with offsets in Automotive and Chemicals.", "We generated positive net core pricing of 1.5% in the quarter with continued energy related and intermodal pricing pressure. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to achieving core pricing gains that offset inflation and align with our value proposition. The increase in volume and a 6% improvement in average revenue per car drove an 11% increase in freight revenue.", "Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our six business groups. Ag Products revenue gained 7% on both the 3% volume and average revenue per car increase.", "Grain carloads increased 11% with continued strength in wheat exports, driven primarily by shipments to the Gulf and Mexico. Domestic corn volumes were up 5% from increased Midwest processor business and strength in the Mid-South poultry market.", "Grain products carloads were down 3%, primarily due to a reduction of soybean oil shipments resulting from soft biodiesel production. Partially offsetting lower volumes were higher ethanol shipments, driven by strong export demand to Brazil and China.", "Food and Refrigerated volumes were up 3%, driven by continued strength in sugar shipments as well as support from a healthy summer demand associated with the brewers and beverage market.", "Looking at the rest of the year, high global production of both seed grains and wheat, coupled with a lower quality domestic wheat harvest will create headwinds in our export markets.", "As always, we're keeping a close eye on the weather to see what the domestic corn and soybean crop will yield. We expect Food and Refrigerated shipments to grow from our cold connect service, sustained strength in sugar, and import beer trending with consumer demand.", "Automotive revenue was up 5% in the quarter on a 1% increase in volume and a 6% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 4%, primarily as a result of softer vehicle sales leading to reduced production and shifting product mix.", "These changes were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and Mexico production growth. The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 16.6 million vehicles in the second quarter, down 3% from second quarter 2016.", "On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand drove a 2% increase in volume. The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for full year 2017 is 17.1 million units, down 2% from the 2016 record rate of 17.5 million.", "We remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to current sales trend, higher inventory, and rising interest rates. The reduced SAR will impact both the finished vehicles and parts with a potential upset in over-the-road conversion opportunities.", "Chemicals revenue was up 4% for the quarter on a 2% decrease on volume and 6% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments declined 20% as we continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments which were down 84% to about 2,200 carloads in the quarter due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity. Chemical volumes, excluding crude oil was up 2% in the quarter.", "Plastics carloads were up 6% due to low commodity prices, which drove increased polyethylene and PVC shipments. Fertilizer was up 13%, driven by increased potash exports. For the second half of 2017, our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable. Strength is anticipated in plastics with new facilities and expansions coming online.", "Coal revenue increased 25% for the quarter on a 17% increase in volume and 7% improvement in average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin and other regions were both up 17% from higher natural gas prices and stronger West Coast exports, which benefited from favorable global economics for Western U.S. coal. Overall, coal stockpiles were down in the quarter and are now below the five-year average.", "Looking forward to the second half of the year, Coal volumes will face tougher year-over-year comps, but we expect absolute volumes to be sustained sequentially if natural gas prices and export demand are maintained. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.", "Industrial Products revenue was up 24% on a 15% increase in volume and an 8% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 73% in the quarter, driven by a 128% increase in sand shipments due to improving well completion and increased proppant intensity per well. Specialized markets volume increased 20% in the quarter, driven by a 29% increase in waste shipments due to West Coast remediation projects.", "Looking forward, we anticipate frac sands volumes to stay strong, although new in-basin brown sand mines might temper the upside. We see growth in military and wind shipments with an offset in roofing and cement volumes due to year-over-year comps associated with weather-related reconstruction and changing market dynamics.", "Intermodal revenue was up 3% on a 2% increase in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic volume grew 2% in the quarter, driven by parcel growth as well as improved truckload market demand in the last half of the quarter. International volume was up 2% in the quarter from stronger west bound shipments and inventory restocking.", "Looking forward, we expect international Intermodal volumes will continue to be impacted by an ever-changing global supply chain. For the domestic market, implementation of electronic logbook will provide opportunities for additional over-the-road conversions.", "To wrap-up, this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of 2017 mentioned in the previous slide. Over-the-road conversions will continue to present opportunities for growth. We also anticipate continued progress in our plastics and Food and Refrigerated markets.", "Our diverse franchise remains well-positioned for growth this year as the U.S. economy continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.", "Cameron Scott", "Thanks Beth and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personnel injury rate increased to 0.76 versus the first half record of 0.70 achieved in 2016. The team remains fully committed to finding and addressing risks in the workplace and I am confident in our efforts as we push towards our goal of zero incidents.", "With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 4% to 3.01. While TE&Y training and infrastructure investments continue to be key pieces of our derailment prevention strategy, advanced data analytics will help us make even greater strides towards identifying and mitigating risks.", "In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 5% versus 2016 to 2.27 as our grade crossing assessment process in collaboration with the public continues yielding positive results.", "Moving on to network performance. Our network performance fell short during the second quarter, which is reflected in the metrics we report each week to the AAR. Second quarter velocity was down 5% and freight car well was up 4% when compared to 2016. Severe spring weather across our served territory along with several service interruptions and outages were the primary drivers of a decline in service metrics.", "Looking at our resources, although our TE&Y workforce was up in about 500 employees in the second quarter while compared to the same period in 2016, we were able to effectively leverage the robust 5% increase in volume with numerous productivity initiatives we have underway. Partially offsetting some of this productivity, however, was an increase in workforce to help manage the network disruptions and outages I mentioned earlier.", "In addition, our engineering and mechanical workforce was down more than 1,000 employees, driven primarily by fewer employees required on capital projects as a result of the productivity initiatives we have implemented.", "All-in, our total operating workforce was down almost 600 employees in the quarter or 2% when compared to last year. As always, we continue to adjust our resources as volume and network performance dictate.", "In addition to being agile with our resource base, the team's persistent focus on productivity continues yielding positive results in other areas such as train size. An example of our relentless focus on productivity is how we have achieved best-ever train size in our manifest trains category for eight straight quarters.", "Our team uses data analytics to dynamically adjust our service schedules to maximize train length while balancing our customer commitments. We were also able to generate productivity gains within our terminals as cars switch per employee day increased 5% during the second quarter.", "Overall, I'm pleased with the productivity we've been able to realize thus far and I'm looking forward to further improvement as we move forward.", "To wrap-up, as we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy will continue to generate positive results on our way to incident-free environment and we will continue leveraging the strength of our franchise to improve operational performance with a focus on productivity and providing an excellent customer experience.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Rob Knight Jr.", "Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 10% versus last year. Higher volumes, an increase in fuel surcharges and positive core price all contributed to the increase in revenue for the quarter.", "Operating expenses totaled $3.2 billion, up 4% from 2016. The increase in fuel cost represented a majority of the increase to the operating expense in the quarter. Operating income totaled $2 billion, a 21% increase from last year.", "Below the line, other income totaled $43 million, down from about $77 million in 2016, which included a $50 million real estate gain that we reported last year. Interest expense of $179 million was up 3% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months.", "Income tax expense increased 20% to $701 million, driven primarily by higher pretax earnings. Net income totaled almost $1.2 billion, up 19% versus last year; while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a record second quarter earnings per share of $1.45.", "The operating ratio was 61.8%, a 3.4 percentage point improvement from the second quarter last year. The combined impact of fuel price and the surcharge lag benefit drove a 0.5 point improvement to the operating ratio and a $0.06 tailwind to earnings per share in the second quarter versus last year.", "Turning now to the topline, freight revenue of $4.9 billion was up 11% versus last year, driven by a 5% increase in volume, along with positive core pricing. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $234 million, up $147 million when compared to 2016, and up about $22 million from the first quarter of this year.", "The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was a positive 1%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand shipments and grain carloadings, partially offset by the increase in Intermodal volumes.", "Core price improved to 1.5%. While we have experienced an uptick in pricing as expected, we do caution that we are continuing to see competitive pressures in our Coal and Intermodal businesses.", "Excluding Coal and Intermodal, pricing in our other business lines was in the 2% to 3% range for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to be on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our rail inflation cost.", "Turning now to the operating expense, slide 21 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 3% versus 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a combination of higher wage and benefit inflation along with higher volume.", "We still expect full year labor inflation to be about 5%; partially offsetting higher volumes were solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, resulting in total workforce level declining 2% in the quarter versus last year or about 800 employees.", "Fuel expense totaled $434 million, up 25% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 10% increase in gross ton-miles drove the increase in fuel expense in the quarter.", "Compared to the second quarter last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 3% while our average fuel price increased 17% to $1.69 per gallon. Purchase services and materials expense increased 5% to $597 million. The increase was primarily driven by volume-related costs, partially offset by lower joint facility expenses.", "Turning now to slide 22, depreciation expense was $525 million, up 4% compared to 2016. For the full year 2017, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 4% to 5%. The increase is primarily driven by higher depreciation asset base, including our positive train control assets put in place to-date.", "We estimate that depreciation on PTC assets will be approximately $130 million in 2017, increasing to around $150 million in the out years, post implementation. And with respect to PTC, in addition to depreciation expense, as we've previously mentioned, we expect the remaining expense line items to increase about $150 million to $200 million annually once PTC is fully implemented.", "Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $273 million in the quarter, which is down 5% when compared to 2016. Lower locomotive and freight car lease expense and mix of traffic were the primary drivers for the reduction.", "Other expenses came in at $219 million, down 10% versus last year. Lower environmental, personal injury and other costs were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2017, we would expect other expense to increase slightly excluding any unusual items.", "Looking at our cash flow, cash them operations for the first half of the year totaled about $3.5 billion, down 2% when compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit, which more than offset the increase in net income.", "Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled about $18.4 billion at quarter end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times, which is close to our target ratio of just under two times.", "Dividend payments for the first half totaled $980 million, up from $925 million last year. In addition to dividends, we also bought back around 15.3 million shares, totaling over $1.6 million in the first half, an increase of around 26% over last year in terms of dollars spent.", "And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased over 30% of our outstanding shares. In between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $2.6 billion to our shareholders through the first half, which represented about 118% of our first half net income.", "On the productivity side, our G55 + 0 initiatives yielded around $110 million of productivity in the quarter. This is an improvement over the $90 million that we achieved in the first quarter and brings our first half total to around $200 million. This benefit was realized across three major categories. The first is network and train operations. This includes things like increase in train length and reducing recrews and other TE&Y expenses.", "The second category is equipment. This includes efforts such as using fewer locomotives and freight cars resulting reduced equipment maintenance cost. And the third category consist of support, supply, and safety where there are multiple opportunities ranging from improving fuel efficiency to reducing purchasing and other administrative expenses. With these results, we continue to progress, as expected and we are on track to meet our $350 million to $450 million productivity goal for the full year.", "Looking forward, we still expect full year carloading growth to be up in the low single-digit range. Third quarter carloads should strengthen somewhat from the second quarter, although they will likely be closer to flat year-over-year given the more difficult 2016 comparisons and this is particularly true for Coal.", "I also want to mention a couple of one-time items that will impact the third quarter. First, we will see a one-time increase in tax expense totaling about $0.04 of earnings per share to reflect a recent increase in the Illinois state income tax rate.", "And on the plus side, we will receive a settlement totaling approximately $0.05 earnings per share as a resolution of an ongoing litigation matter. This amount will be recognized as other income below the line.", "With positive full year volume, positive core price and significant productivity benefits, we are on track to improve our full year operating ratio. In longer term, we are intently focused on achieving our targeted 60% plus or minus operating ratio on a full year basis by 2019. And we remain committed to reaching our goal of a 55 operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continue the momentum of our volume, pricing, and productivity initiatives.", "So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you, Rob. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect uncertainty in some economic sectors and continued strength in others. Overall, as Rob mentioned, absolute basis volume should be stronger in the second half than in the first half, although year-over-year comparisons are going to be more challenging.", "In this environment, we will focus on our growth opportunities. In addition, we'll continue to make progress on our G55 + 0 initiatives as we work to make Union Pacific a stronger, more efficient company. We are confident these efforts will generate topline growth, margin improvement, and greater returns for our shareholders.", "With that, let's open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Group", "Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning.", "Scott Group", "So, wanted to just clarify some of the comments on Coal being flat sequentially. Are you saying that the third quarter average is going to be the same as second quarter? Because we've never seen that, so I just -- I'm not sure I follow what you're trying to say.", "Beth Whited", "No, we weren't saying that. Sorry if that was misinterpreted. Now, we would expect third quarter to follow a traditional pattern and be up sequentially, but relatively flat for last year.", "Scott Group", "Okay, flat on a year-over-year, okay that makes a lot more sense. Okay. And then Rob, just for you on the pricing side, I know it's not an area where you typically like to forecast specific numbers. But maybe just some insights -- we saw a tick up a little bit this quarter. Do you think that -- is it reasonable to expect that trend of kind of rebound continues into the back half of the year just given the better volume environment or tough to have visibility to that at this point?", "Rob Knight Jr.", "Scott, we're going to continue to price-to-market and drive as positive price as we possibly can. And as you know, we're going to stay away from giving a specific pricing number other than to reiterate that we expect to yield above inflation dollars. But we also pointed out -- Beth and I both did, that we continue to face pressures in the Coal and Intermodal groups. So, we'll see how all that plays out.", "Scott Group", "And just given the better volume environment, does the market -- I understand the competitive comments, does the broader markets feel like it's a better from a pricing standpoint just given you've had a few quarters now volume growth or you're not ready to say that.", "Beth Whited", "I would say that there are a lot of competitive factors going on out there on the plus side. We are seeing truck prices just beginning to firm and that gives us some hope that that will continue throughout the rest of the year, especially with ELDs coming online. But the other competitive factors that we see in Coal and Intermodal aren't easy. So, you just kind of have to make your own production about what you think might happen.", "Scott Group", "May I ask just a quick follow-up, how about in just grain with grain prices going up, how does that impact you grain tariffs going forward?", "Beth Whited", "Well, let me see how to answer that. I would say that we certainly want to price and get value in the market at every opportunity. Grain prices going up will, hopefully, bring more volume to us and provide us with a revenue opportunity and we'll just have to see how the pricing opportunities play out from that.", "Scott Group", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Ken Hoexter", "Great. Good morning. Just following-up on the pricing side, on the increased Coal pricing you're talking about. Are there major contracts up for bid that you're seeing this get more intense? Is this more a commentary on a shift of export coal? Just want to see as given that you easy comps that you had now started a little tougher, I want to see where that's heading towards.", "Beth Whited", "Are you asking a volume or a price question?", "Ken Hoexter", "Its price but I want to understand what's leading into that price competition. Is it that you're seeing more new -- or more of bids going on right now, major bids that what you're seeing competitor step up. Is it because of the export side? I just want to understand where you're seeing the pricing competition?", "Beth Whited", "I think that we continue to see competition kind of across the book of business. But we aren't at any sort of unusual level of contract negotiation during this period. It's just kind of -- when you think about our whole base and the contracts that we negotiate overtime as we are renegotiating contracts that market -- it's still very competitive.", "Ken Hoexter", "Yes. And nothing on the export? Is that--?", "Beth Whited", "No, the export business, as you know for us, is relatively smaller.", "Ken Hoexter", "Still smaller.", "Beth Whited", "We have had some nice opportunities, but that's not as -- I mean, it's certainly still competitive, but that's not where we're seeing the most pressure.", "Ken Hoexter", "Great. And then for a follow-up. Great detail Rob on the productivity initiatives that you provided here. Is this -- when you look at the equipment side and the like, is that -- do you see the locomotives -- are you increasing them out that you're parking is part of the productivity and the cars can you talk a little bit about kind of where that stands. You've given those numbers in the past.", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, let's let Cameron address that.", "Cameron Scott", "Several years ago, we started initiative in our low horsepower fleet and that initiative net to about 500 locomotives we'd put in storage. Some of those have been sold. Some of those releases that we returned. We've turned that same group of employees towards our high horsepower fleet. And I don't think we'll achieve quite 500, but there's plenty of opportunity for us to rationalize what we're doing with our high horsepower fleet.", "Lance Fritz", "I want to say Cameron is referencing there from this point forward. He's already got what is in the neighborhood of 1,000 high horsepower locomotive in storage as we speak.", "Ken Hoexter", "Great. Thank you very much for the thoughts.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, just a follow-up on the positive train control comments. Rob, that's very helpful to give us more details. I was wondering if you could just clarify one thing, are those costs included in your long-term OR guidance, I assume they are, but I just want to confirm. And then we hear a lot about the cost, what are some of the benefits maybe, Cam, you think could come out of the system when it's fully operational?", "Rob Knight Jr.", "Yes, let me quickly address the cost question, Brian. Yes, all of those costs are embedded in our targeted 60 OR by 2019 and 55 beyond. So, those are challenges that we have to overcome, but they're embedded in the thought process. And in terms of the benefits?", "Lance Fritz", "Cam?", "Cameron Scott", "We're implementing about 40% of our network at this point. And the technology is working very well. There will always be glitches and bugs that we need to upgrade. But so far, it's a very solid technology.", "As we get fully implemented, we'll be looking for every productivity and efficiency that we can squeeze out of that system. I don't have anything right now to report to you on that.", "Lance Fritz", "Giving you a little bit more techni-color [ph] -- this is Lance. The PTC foundation gives you an umbrella of communication capability because of what's required for PTC in and of itself. And it puts a lot of technology and computing power on to our locomotives that at some point could be used for other purposes in the future.", "It's important to note that it's not -- when we think about productivity from positive train control foundation, we're not talking about taking what already exist and somehow redeploying it in a way that's highly productive.", "Whatever we do is likely going to require an incremental either capital or operating expense investment. And we'll make those decision based on the returns that would be generated from whatever those projects are.", "So, it forms a foundation in your mind to think about that foundation as a robust umbrella of communication capability and computing power. And from that point forward, maybe that's a foundation we can use for the productivity.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Okay, great. Thanks. That's very helpful. I'm just -- the timing I now we've got one year extensions possibly across the Board for the industry if you could just remind us when you -- what's the current prospect for going fully online, is that a 2020 event?", "Lance Fritz", "We're going to be fully implemented -- or installed and able to implement, that is turn on, on every mile that's required late in 2018. And in the way the law is written, if we're in that position, then we can basically request the Department of Transportation an extension to 2020, which we will do because we'll want to use that time to debug the system.", "While Cameron has mentioned that the system is operating and is functional and doing what it's intended to do, it still has bugs that rob us of precious capacity. And so we'll want to take those two years to continue to debug the system.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Okay. And just one quick follow-up on the hiring front. [Indiscernible] almost the same percent as volume realize there is some perhaps one-time items in there. But just in general, Lance, can you tell us what you're seeing trends in hiring? There's some pretty great chunks of growth coming in the areas that might be a little bit more regionalized like perhaps like Coal, and flat to down in slightly other areas.", "So, how hard will you be finding it to get ahead of those recoveries and meet demand in kind of just-in-time with the training programs you have? And should we expect small furlough for the freight recession to really kind of rob you from some productivity as you probably might not get all the same people you have back, but maybe a little bit lower level of experience when you do start to hire again.", "Lance Fritz", "Brian, let's unpack that in three pieces. The first piece is, your right. With TE&Y headcount up 4% in the second quarter versus volume up 5%, that's not quite the kind of productivity we would expect. I think that's accountable to the weather and service related interruptions and a little bit more sluggish network as Cameron pointed out. And he and his team is working diligently to get that back.", "The second point that you were asking about was overall hiring and what's going on in that world. Recall, we came into the year with a fair number of TE&Y employees on furlough. So, the first thing we do is we call them back from furlough or from their alternative work and training board service. We've been doing that and we've also in certain pockets, had to go out and start up a hiring class. That's a relatively small amount in comparison to the amount of employees that we're bringing back on furlough.", "And in terms of are we able to find employees when we do need to hire, the answer is yes. And the TE&Y craft, we have very attractive jobs and in the areas where we want to hire with maybe one or two very specific exceptions, we can find employees that we need.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot for all the detail. Appreciate it.", "Lance Fritz", "Yes.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.", "David Vernon", "Hey, good morning. Cameron question for you on the productivity side. You mentioned there were some network disruptions that added to the incremental headcount. And I'm just wondering if you kind the mentioned that for us? And then also speak to the ability to kind of keep pushing forward with some of these train length initiatives and your productivity initiatives as volume growth moderates in the back half of the year?", "Cameron Scott", "I'll start with train size. Our team, as we mentioned, during eight straight quarters, has demonstrated a capability to find additional opportunities on train size while meeting customer commitments.", "And there is, as I mentioned before, still plenty of headroom in almost every train category in our business, with the exception of Coal. So, there is still a lot of opportunity ahead of us on productivity with train size.", "In relation to some of the outages, probably the best example I can give you was an unfortunate barge strike to one of our key network lanes in Louisiana. We've been out for seven weeks now rebuilding that bridge. That has caused us to wheel our transportation plan around that outage, adding costs, adding locomotives, adding employees that were not intended as we started the year.", "We should get that key route back in service here in the next week and that will normalize not only our cost structure, but our customers will see a more solid service that they expect from us.", "David Vernon", "And in terms of sort of dimensioning that in terms of numbers around the extra heads or impact on earnings, is there any way for us to think about what it could have been here in the second quarter versus what it was because some of these one-time things? Or is it too small to try to adjust out?", "Rob Knight Jr.", "David, let me -- this is Rob, let me try to answer. I mean we're not going to break that out. I mean it's kind of in the mix and we admit it, as Lance indicated that ratio of the 4% versus the 5% volume, is not what we strive for. But exactly, what could have been is hard to put a fine point on.", "David Vernon", "Okay. And maybe this is a follow-up, Beth, with regards to ELDs, what are you hearing from your Intermodal partners on what kind of impact are expecting from this not only just in the U.S. implementation, but I also understand there's some speculation that the Mexican government may follow with an ELD set of guidelines in the 2018 as well.", "Beth Whited", "I don't have a comment on the Mexico piece. I haven't talked to anybody about that at this point. So, that will be a good follow-up for me. But I think everything you read says that they expect full ELD implementation to be kind of 3% to 5% sort of capacity impact.", "I think some people are skeptical about how well it will be enforced. And so you've got a range in there in terms of how much impact it will have. But certainly we're very optimistic that it's going to help drive some tightening in the truck market and consequential price increases with rate increases in trucks, which will give us an opportunity to convert more volume and hopefully, get some price of our own.", "David Vernon", "And we should start to see that in the back half of this year and in the next year or is there going to be a bigger lag?", "Beth Whited", "It feels like it's a pretty late in the fourth quarter event and more of a next year item.", "David Vernon", "Great. Thanks a lot for your time guys.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Allison Landry", "Good morning. Thanks. So, frac sand has obviously seen strength in the last couple of quarters. So, I was hoping you could give us an indication of the mix of white and brown. And I guess more importantly, given some of the expectations for the Permian to be self-sufficient with local brown sand, how do we think about that with respect to your volumes and mix going forward?", "Beth Whited", "So, currently, we would say and you can read different people say different things that the Permian is roughly 15% brown and 85% white sand. And the demand this year, call it 28 million or 29 million tons. We see estimates going into next year where there are proposed mines that would bring on anywhere from 20 million to 40 million or 50 million tons and perhaps demand in the Permian being in that 40 million to 50 million tons.", "I'm not sure how quickly that will happen. We certainly feel good about Permian white sand this year. We're working on solution to try to be a well provider in the brown sand market as well and we do a fair amount of that today from other Texas location.", "I -- certainly it will swing away from white sand as a percentage over -- I think kind of quarter-by-quarter as we move into next year. We don't really have a prediction for what that looks like for us in 2018. But like I said, our focus will be on working to support the white sand guys that are continuing to shift and developing alternatives for the brown sand.", "Allison Landry", "Okay, got it. Thanks. And then if I could ask about the volume guidance, you obviously gave the expectations for flat year-over-year in Q3 and sort of implied a pretty wide range for the fourth quarter. So, I'm wondering if you can help us think through that and maybe handicap whether or not you think volumes could be up in the fourth quarter?", "Rob Knight Jr.", "Allison, this is Rob and we haven't given specific volume guidance in the fourth quarter. But so you're right, it could be a range. I mean we're hopeful that the economy would continue to move in the right direction and our third quarter, as I pointed out in my comments, while we envision that being kind of flattish year-over-year, we do see it sequentially growing from where we are today, where we finish in the second quarter. So, stay tuned in terms of how the world plays out in the fourth quarter.", "Allison Landry", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Colin & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Jason Seidl", "Thank you, operator. Hey, good morning everyone. Two quick questions. Rob, I wanted to talk a little bit about your comments that we are aware the proper level for adjusted debt to EBITDA that you look at. How should we think about your cadence of share repurchases going forward? Is that going to slow a little bit or are you expecting to keep about the same pace?", "Rob Knight Jr.", "Well, Jason, as you know, we don't have a set number. We don't give specific guidance. We'll continue to be opportunistic in terms of the pace at which we buy, so I couldn't begin to give you exactly what that cadence will look like. Markets will dry.", "But I would just tell you that in terms of the focus that we have in the organization is driving more cash. I mean so as we look at the metric, while we're close to that targeted number, as I pointed out, we still have room to go in terms of generating positive cash in the business and that gives us the greatest opportunity to continue to move forward.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay. And I wanted to jump back on your Ag outlook a little bit. Talk about how exports in the quarter impact the arc. So, obviously, you don't talk about pricing, but let's just talk about the overall arc from the mix and what should we expect sequentially going forward about exports and how that would look against your arc in the third and fourth quarter?", "Beth Whited", "So, in the quarter, we did have strong grain exports shipments, especially with wheat. And obviously that's a longer length of haul almost all the time. We do see -- we did see some pretty low barge prices, so we did move a fair amount in the river. So, it impacts our arc positively, but maybe not as much historically has just because of the river move.", "As you move into the third and fourth quarter, you're going to see quite a bit less export grain, particularly in the third quarter because we had a really strong third quarter last year. And we're now going to be challenged by pretty strong global availability of grain in markets where they have a significant currency advantage. So, it'll -- I would say a negative arc impact versus last year in the third quarter. I don't have a [Indiscernible] for you.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay. So, Beth all things being equal, as you look to 3Q and 4Q and comp that versus 2Q likely going to be down compared to 2Q based on the mix?", "Beth Whited", "The arc, I don't know.", "Jason Seidl", "The arc.", "Beth Whited", "I'm sorry. I don't have a prediction of that for you. The volume -- yes, on the export side.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the time as always guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Hey thanks. Good morning.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning.", "Chris Wetherbee", "I wanted to talk about productivity a little bit and understand maybe the cadence for the back half of the year. So, you have $150 million to $200 million left to go. And in the first half, you sort of had a stronger performance and a better volume environment.", "I guess my question is, as you see sort of volume comps get a bit tougher there, what is that variability in cadence for the back half of the year do you think if 4Q doesn't turn out to be positive from a volume standpoint or you're more likely to be in the lower end of the guidance. I'm just trying to get some sensitivity around that for the second half.", "Lance Fritz", "Hi, Chris, this is Lance. I'll let Rob speak specifically to the guidance, which is $350 million to $400 million for the year. But in terms of the mechanics of the productivity, it's Cam and the team and the rest of the organization are constantly working the projects that we have in front of us right now.", "So, that Rob pointed out three big segments. In the transportation side, it's about train lengths and be more productive in switching and locals. It can be more productive in our engineering and mechanical workforces where we've got projects underway and candidly we've been very straightforward and saying I think we've got more opportunity to be more productive in our general administrative and support functions. So, you'll see us take action on all of those in the second half of the year.", "Rob Knight Jr.", "Yes. If I can, I would just add, Chris, that as you've heard us comment many times before we're not going to stop at the $350 million range. And we try not to use volume as an excuse.", "Certainly, volume is our friend and it gives us more optionality in terms of the productivity initiatives. But as we have done for many, many years and that is that we have a mindset that we're still going to aggressively go after the productivity initiatives that Lance outlined that are in front of us that we're aggressively pursuing and in spite of what the year-over-year volume is.", "And again, we still predict, by the way. Our guidance is that volume for the full year is going to be up in the low single-digits. So, the fact that it's, say, flattish in the third quarter year-over-year, I don't think that's going to impact or slowdown any of our productivity initiatives.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay. All right. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then Beth maybe a question on the Coal side. So, you've given some helpful color around the third quarter. I guess I just wanted to make sure I understood how you think about sort of finishing out the year relative to what we've been hearing a little bit from the producer side within PRB coal. And if there is the ability to sort of make commitments to the extent that there's demand there in the fourth quarter depending on what weather does and stockpile do. I guess our sense is that production levels on the mine level might end up falling short of flattish in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to get your thoughts around that if you have any.", "Beth Whited", "Well, at this point, we haven't considered that we would have significant production shortages in the fourth quarter. And we were definitely still thinking looks flattish. I suppose it all depends on what plays out with third quarter demand and hot weather and the producers are in the place where it makes economical sense to them I would guess that they will keep producing in for that.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "Thomas Wadewitz", "Good morning. Wanted to ask you a little more on the Coal and Intermodal competitive pressures that you highlighted. I think -- I want to say it's maybe the third quarter last year that you first started talking about these pressures. And we have seen better Coal volumes certainly over the last couple of quarters in Coal. What you think it's a dynamic you might see for those competitive pressures ease? Is that really a function where the natural gas price is? Is it just a market price is lower for coal transport than what your book is priced at? So, it's really a multi-year headwind and repricing to market? Or how would be think about kind of the drivers that competitive pressure and how long the duration might be?", "Beth Whited", "It's pretty hard to make any sort of prediction about things that are happening in the competitive market when the person you're talking about isn\u2019t yourself. So, I don't probably have any guidance to give you there. Our focus is just going to be on making sure that we're getting a reinvestable price that makes sense to us as we renew deals and go out to bid for new books of business.", "Lance Fritz", "Tom, this is Lance. Of course, anytime the environment improves from a standpoint of more economic opportunity for all the competition in the marketplace, more volume opportunities, anytime that's the case, that's a better environment to compete in. So, we're looking forward to that being the case at some point in the future.", "Thomas Wadewitz", "What about the Intermodal side? I know you had referred in the past about the turmoil with the steamships and the consolidation and obviously with content and so forth. Do you think I guess there's more activity going on, do you have any visibility of that stabilizing and maybe pricing in the international Intermodal stabilizing or is that something that's probably continues for a while?", "Beth Whited", "I think that the steamship lines are still shaking things out. And while I think their economics are better, I don't think they're in a situation where they're making a lot of money and maybe not even making money.", "So, in that environment, I think that the pressure remains for them to try to be very economically competitive in what they do. So, we'll see. I think that may take a little bit longer to shake out.", "Lance Fritz", "Recall, Tom that those are -- that's a moving part from the standpoint of sometimes those consolidations and partnerships benefit us and sometimes they don't. Regardless, we take that competitive landscape and compete for the business that makes sense to us from an economic return and compete aggressively for it.", "Thomas Wadewitz", "Great, great. Okay. And then just a quick follow-on. On the Chemicals side, what's the timing when you really see the impact from the new plants? Are you already seeing that? Or is there kind of a timeframe when that would be a bigger volume impact from the new production coming on in the Gulf?", "Beth Whited", "Yes, so it's going to be kind of a slow start I think. You start to see I think one or two plants really making meaningful production in 2017 and that's really pretty late in the year and with 2018 being a more significant impact.", "Thomas Wadewitz", "Okay, great. Thank you for the time.", "Lance Fritz", "All right.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.", "Amit Mehrotra", "Hey, thanks everybody. Thanks for getting me in here. I wanted to ask you on the outlook for the back half. You do typically see a nice step down in OR sequentially. But obviously, there's some difficult comparisons as you mentioned possible mix challenges as well. Can you just talk about the puts and takes there and maybe your confidence or the company's ability to actually lower OR sequentially against that backdrop?", "Rob Knight Jr.", "Yes, this is Rob. I mean we don't really get specific quarterly OR guidance. You're right. Traditionally, that's the way it plays out. There's a lot of moving parts. We'll see what mix does. It's been favorable thus far this year. We're going to continue to drive pricing as Beth has talked about. We're going to continue to be aggressive on our productivity initiatives as we've all talked about and those are the levers.", "And volume, we think is going to be our friend certainly in the third quarter improving from the second quarter. And we'll just have to see how the numbers play out. But again, we're confident and pleased with the progress we've made thus far this year and confident in our ability to improve the operating ratio year-over-year.", "Amit Mehrotra", "Okay. Maybe just if I could have a follow-up and just be a little bit more specific as it relates to maybe the Automotive business and also the Chemical business as it relates to the auto production.", "I mean, North American light vehicle productions expect to be down about 6% in the third quarter. I think some of that, obviously, has to do with the big three changeovers that maybe you're not as exposed to versus the eastern rails.", "And then if I'm not mistaken, there are significant amount of chemical carloads that are also tied to auto production. So, if you could just help us think about both the Auto and Chemical franchise in light of maybe the sharp drop off in production and maybe the impact it makes there? Thanks.", "Beth Whited", "So, we have seen strength in plastics this year on the PVC and PE side, which -- and PP is really the stuff that goes into auto. So, I would agree with you that there's been a little bit of an impact there. It hasn't been very significant fall off in PC, but the strength is really coming on the PVC and the PE side.", "And I don't think that would be something that we would probably be in a situation where we're calling out later in the year on the straight Auto side. It does feel like there's weakness there and that, that will continue throughout the rest of the year and we'll just have to see if the consumer goes back and start buying cars or not.", "Lance Fritz", "Bear in mind we have an opportunity still and it's a significant opportunity to penetrate further inbound truck for auto parts to auto manufacturing. There's still plenty of opportunity to convert that into Intermodal or box car product. And as the second quarter demonstrated, I think our finished vehicles were down 4%, but auto parts were up 2%. We expect to keep going after that in the second half of the year.", "Amit Mehrotra", "Okay. Thanks. Appreciate the questions. Congrats on a good quarter.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Cameron Scott", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Hey, good morning everyone. And thanks for getting us on the call here. Lance, I wonder if you could just give your investors a little bit of confidence here because we've been hearing a lot about precision railroading and how that can drive significant improvement at one of your peers. But you guys have had some pretty significant OR targets out there for some time now. So, can you tell us -- just what are the drivers to achieve the 60 OR and then even beyond the 55. And how confident are you today versus maybe a couple of years ago?", "Lance Fritz", "Let's start with my confidence level, which is, it's never been higher. That's -- it's really wonderful to be speaking to your question coming off the quarter that we just had where we've demonstrated on what I would consider relatively modest volumes and ability to generate significant operating ratio improvement and productivity.", "So, let's talk about how we're generating that productivity. Getting just a little bit deeper on those three areas that Rob and Cam talked about. When you're thinking about the train network, what we've been doing to this point is we're taking our -- the way our plan is organized and deconstructing it by lane, looking for opportunities to grow train size while maintaining the fundamental aspects of the plan with an eye towards making sure that our customer service product is as good as it possibly can be the best in the marketplace.", "As we look forward, there's an opportunity to co-mingle some of those service products and we're investigating that as we speak, thinking through what does that mean from a service product perspective and from a productivity perspective.", "We think there's pretty good juice there. And so while we've done a great job of growing train size to this point, we think there's some incremental opportunities we look forward in our train network.", "When we think about how we conduct ourselves with our mechanical, our carman employees, our craft professionals in the engineering world and some of the contracting work that we do in both, there's plenty of opportunities and we've got projects in all of those areas looking for ways to take out, for instance, leased and rented equipment, contracting work that's just not high value add or can be done more efficiently and more efficiently finding ways to invest in equipment that allows us to be way more productive on labor components and have a really attractive return on that investment.", "And then when you think about our ability to generate more productivity on the general and administrative and support cost side of our world and inclusive of purchasing material and supplies, we've been making great progress in those areas and there's lots of opportunities to come.", "And we've got plans and clear-eyed opportunities there that we are developing and ultimately will be taken advantage of. So, as we sit here, the team could not be more confident in being able to achieve a 60 plus/minus operating ratio by 2019. And of course, we're going to do that as quickly as we can. And then we\u2019re -- immediately thereafter, we're just going to keep it up on our way to a 55 operating ratio, again, as soon as we can.", "Another thing that gives us confidence is looking backwards at our track record. We had some fits and starts here recently, mostly driven by significant volume drops. But even in that context, we've had good solid operating ratio improvement over a very long period of time and we've demonstrated we know how to do it. We're going to keep doing it.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Lance, I appreciate that. How should investors think about the sustainable rates of improvement on the margin? And you did talk about growth in those comments as well. I mean how contingent is this on growth? Are there still absolute cost buckets that you think you can attack over the next couple of years that would help drive margins higher and the OR lower?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes. So, we talked, Brandon, about three buckets that drive OR improvement. Pure productivity whatever the volume is and we'll continue to get that price, which is related to what the value is that we're bringing to our customers and how we're competing in our markets and we'll continue to generate that and growth.", "Growth certainly helps and we're looking for ways in markets either new ones to penetrate, more business with existing customers, greater geographic reach, however we can maximize franchise and we have. We will be pulling the levers on all three of those areas all the time as we move forward. And it just depends on what the economy brings to us, what we're able to do as to exactly the role with each lever plays going forward.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Walter Spracklin", "Thanks very much. So, just following up on your -- on those three lines and going into pure productivity. You've got a long-term target there. You're kind of the mid-50s and up at around 62 now. What is the timeframe? I mean, just ballpark. Is this a two-year, three-year, five-year kind of productivity attack? Is this something that you can front end load? Are there projects that you're looking on that you're going to pull the trigger on that can really lead to a revamping of the infrastructure that you have right now that applies to the business you run?", "Is there anything that you can give us tangibly that we can kind of look into our models and maybe not into 2019 when you hit 60, but out within a reasonable timeframe after that to be at that mid-50s? Is there anything you can point us to?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, I'm not sure I'm going to be very helpful in building up the model for you. I'll tell you we're going to get there just as quickly as we can. And as we sit here and look at the different opportunities we have in front of us, the projects that we've already got launched are the ones that we're defining prior to launch.", "There's plenty of opportunities and some of those might surprise us and deliver outsized productivity rapidly. And some might be a lot more pick and shovel work that takes a bit more time.", "I can tell you we're scanning the environment regardless of industry, whether it's other railroad peers or any other competitors or customers of ours to find ideas that we can implement in our own environment to both accelerate our productivity and to generate productivity.", "Walter Spracklin", "And is there anything in that scanning that might lead to a step function move? Like a complete overhaul of hump yards and slashing them -- or your hump yards in your opinion, fully utilized. Is there anything that you think that through scanning might lead to not a gradual but a step function move in your infrastructure?", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, we're going to learn from everything we see and observe and deconstruct it and see if it makes sense for our network and our franchise. I'll just remind you that on our network and franchise, we have a very robust manifest product that requires a fair amount of car switching and our lowest cost car switching for us happens to be in our highly utilized hump yards.", "So, at this point, as we look forward, I'm not so sure you're going to see a lot of change in that area. Plus you might see change in other areas like how we define our networks and products and perhaps the co-mingling of some of our service products so that we can both generate a better service product for our customers and more productivity for our shareholders.", "Bear in mind that we've got four stakeholders and we're serving them all at the same time; our customers, employees, the communities that we serve in; and you, our shareholder.", "Walter Spracklin", "Moving on to this other bucket, which is pricing. Now you've noted that you kind of excluding some of the problem areas in coal and others, you are booking 2% to 3% price, which is great.", "In the problem areas, do you tend to be -- you're going to be affected by contracts that have been signed that would probably have some long length to them. Two questions on that. When do those start coming off, the ones that are keeping your pricing down in those problem areas? And at this point, are you booking new contracts in those problem areas above that depressed level in prior periods?", "Beth Whited", "So, I don't think we're going to give any real guidance on past or future pricing in specific contracts. But I would tell you is the competition is as fierce today in Coal and Intermodal as it has been over the last, I guess, we've been talking about this for about a year. So, that's kind of where we are.", "Walter Spracklin", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks very much.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes in the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.", "Justin Long", "Thanks and good morning.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning.", "Justin Long", "So, you said earlier that Coal volumes should be about flat year-over-year in the third quarter. And that translates into a sequential improvement of about 20% in Coal volumes. And that's really all the sequential improvement you need to get for consolidated volumes to be flat on a year-over-year basis in 3Q.", "So, I guess saying it another way, it basically implies that non-Coal volumes stay flat sequentially. With that in mind, could you just give some more color on non-Coal volumes sequentially? And what's you're expecting to get better and what you're expecting to get worse in 3Q?", "Lance Fritz", "Rob, you want to take the guidance part of that, please?", "Rob Knight Jr.", "Yes. Justin I would just say you may be taking two fine slide role to the -- what we talked about. Coal, we're giving some of a directional comment on our overall volumes and on Coal. I wouldn't take that as literally as you have because the factors that will drive coal demand will continue to be gas prices, weather, economy, I mean, all those factors that could change exactly with the cadence is in the third quarter.", "So, I mean our other -- so our guidance, again, to Lance's point, our guidance all-in is kind of flattish. It could be either side of that. We'll see. We want to be as high as possible, but flattish year-over-year with sequential improvement from here.", "Lance Fritz", "And Beth you want to just maybe talk a little bit about other markets and what's going on?", "Beth Whited", "Yes. So, there will be ins and outs in all other markets. There always are. I just remind you Ag was pretty strong last year and -- so the third quarter is a tough comp for that and all the other markets are going to continue to evolve as we move through the quarter. But as Rob said, we expect to be flattish.", "Justin Long", "Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe secondly, Kansas City has talked a lot about the refined product opportunity in Mexico and it sounds like those shipments have ticked up in the second quarter for their business. Do you see this as an opportunity for your network at all or just from a geographic standpoint, is this not really a needle mover?", "Beth Whited", "It's a small and emerging market for us right now. We are doing a reasonable amount of traffic. I wouldn't call it substantial amount of traffic and finish fuels into Mexico both in partnership with KCSM and with the Ferromex. And we were probably a big mover early into the LPG space. And we are still seeing a lot of propane moving into Mexico.", "The finished fuels have been a little slower to take off because there's not a lot of terminal infrastructure in Mexico to handle them. But we see it as a reasonable opportunity over the period until more infrastructure is built in Mexico.", "Lance Fritz", "Justin, I would remind you and all of our listeners at this point, we enjoy robust franchise to and from Mexico because we serve all six major rail gateways. We enjoy about 70% of all rail cross-border traffic to and from Mexico. So we will get our fair share.", "Justin Long", "Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Appreciate the time.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Hi. I'd like to ask a question on your model. In your presentation, you mentioned parcel growth. I don't know that was a unit called out a lot in the past but as a driver for the quarter. Could I ask just in the elaboration on this, the broadly how material are parcels to your franchise? It's trending upward rapidly in line with B2C and downline fulfillment. And can you elaborate maybe challenges or investments you've had to make to serve this?", "Beth Whited", "Yes, so we think about our business in domestic and international, and then within the domestic space, it's kind of truckload and premium and parcel would fall into that premium segment and we have seen some nice growth in it. I think a fair amount of that is being driven by e-commerce. And so that's enabled us to participate in that, and it's been pretty exciting for us.", "In terms of investments that we've had to make to support it, we've been able to utilize to a pretty significant extent the facilities that we already had in place for Intermodal shipments and we also do support it from time-to-time with additional train starts if that investment makes sense for us. So, that's where we are at this point. It's been a fun market for us to watch emerge.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Good. Thank you, Beth. As a follow-up, my second question, I guess, maybe this is for Cameron. A lot of times when you see a big volume influx like we've seen last couple of quarters in coal or this quarter in international -- in industrial products it's -- can compromise margins, yet you've handled it pretty deftly and actually set records in margins. Is this simply more train starts you had available locomotives and personnel furloughed? Or maybe you could elaborate on some of the challenges in bringing that volume on so rapidly?", "Cameron Scott", "It is always our stated objective to take Beth's volume and layer it on top of our current train start network. And as I mentioned before, there is lots of headroom in almost every train category that we have to continue to do that.", "The coal marketplace for us in train size is fairly optimized. There are still opportunities but it is fairly optimized. So, really in stepping up to the plate with beautiful volume growth from Beth in Coal is making sure we're matching appropriate manpower planning and locomotive planning to handle the volumes as they come online. And I think we've accomplished that very nicely here in the second quarter.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Probably industry is a lot more complex than coal, many more destinations and origins than somewhat repeatable business in the coal franchise though. Would just simply having ample capacity to add lengths to trains, Cam?", "Cameron Scott", "Yes, it is. And you are correct. That does become very complex very quickly. And our service design team and our network planning team has done a very nice job, whether it's a regional opportunity or a big system network opportunity to take that growth and layer it right on top of our current program.", "Keith Schoonmaker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeffrey Kauffman", "Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been answered. So, let me just ask one on utilization. I think we understand a lot of the factors that impacted the West Coast flow through in terms of terminal dwell and average train speed. You briefly mentioned it in your comments today. Can you talk about where you're in getting that to the levels you want to? And at what point do you think we start to see more positive year-over-year comps in those two areas?", "Lance Fritz", "Cameron?", "Cameron Scott", "You're absolutely right. In the first quarter, with the Western region impact, we took a pretty substantial hit on both velocity and car dwell. Largely, that velocity in the Western region has returned to us. It's been a little -- taken a little bit longer for us to recover in the Western region than we anticipated, but we feel confident in the second half that Western region will start delivering the extra velocity and improved internal performance that we expect out of them.", "The Southern region, as I mentioned, has a bridge outage that will be resolved here in a week. They also have very heavy renewal capital programming. So, it makes it a complicated network down south. As soon as we get that bridge back in service, we anticipate the southern region will come right back to anticipated velocity as well.", "Jeffrey Kauffman", "One follow-up to that. I could be wrong on my statistics here. But I seem to remember when the weather gets below a certain temperature, you got to slow trains down because rails get brittle. When the weather gets above a certain temperature, you got to slow trains down because the track gets soft. We've had some pretty extreme weather this quarter, particularly in the South and Southwest. Is any of that impacting the system? And can you discuss whether I'm off target on that?", "Cameron Scott", "No, you are correct. Heat orders are applied when we reach certain temperature thresholds and it has been a nice warm summer. About the only area of our business where that becomes impactful is when you're looking at high-premium intermodal product. That does tend to retard the maximum train speed that you'd like to run when it comes to that high-premium Intermodal product. The rest of the network is largely unaffected by those heat-slow orders.", "Lance Fritz", "Hey Jeff, the other aspect of heat is, we're in the outdoor business. So, we really got to help our craft professionals kind of watch their health when it gets to temperatures like we're in right now. And that can slowdown work to some degree because they've got to make sure they take breaks. They got to get out of the heat, be able to keep their body temperature reasonable. And you can just imagine working eight or 10 or 12 hours in the kind of environment we have now. That can have an impact on an individual's productivity.", "Jeffrey Kauffman", "Okay. Well, thank you for your answers and good luck.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International. Please proceed with your question.", "Bascome Majors", "Yes, thanks for fitting me in here this morning. The operating cash flow was down about 2% year-to-date on mid-teens growth in net income. Could you just walk us through if anything there is timing related? And kind of how you expect that to shake out in net income for the full year? And then maybe a similar comment longer term. Do we expect to grow cash flow in line? Maybe a little better than or a little worse than net income over time? Thanks.", "Rob Knight Jr.", "Yes, Bascom, there was a timing issue with when you look at year-over-year. You're right; the reported numbers show it down. There was, call it, $400 million year-over-year delta on the bonus depreciation. And that is kind of front-end loaded for this year. So, we'll see how it kind of plays out for the balance of the year.", "But longer term, our goal is to continue to drive that number positively, clearly. And we have every expectation that given all of the productivity initiatives we have underway that, that will be a very strong base.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you very much. And thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We look forward to talking with you again in October.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Operator", "Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At this the time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operation Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Good morning, everybody. And welcome to the Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call, with me here today in Omaha, are Beth Whited, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion for the third quarter of 2017. This equates to $1.50 per share, which is up 10% over last year. Total volume decreased 1% in the quarter compared to 2016. Carload volume decreased in four of our six commodity groups, driven primarily by a 10% decrease and agricultural products and associated grain carloadings. Partially offsetting this volume was a 15% increase in industrial products, with particular strength in frac sand shipments.", "The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.8%, which was up 0.7 points from the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, our company faced the unprecedented challenge of Hurricane Harvey. I want to thank the men and women of Union Pacific who worked tirelessly and heroically to quickly and safely to restore our network and our operations from the storm and the related flooding. Given these challenges, I'm pleased with our results, and look forward to continuing to build on the foundation provided by our six-track value strategy. Our team will give you more of the details on the third quarter, starting with Beth.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. We announced during the third quarter that effective January 1, we will transition reporting to our newly established four business groups: agricultural, energy, industrial, and premium. Until then, we will continue to report on the six business teams.", "For the third quarter, our volume was down 1%, driven primarily by agricultural products, automotive and chemicals, with an offset in industrial products. We generated positive net core pricing of nearly 2% in the quarter, with continued coal-related and intermodal pricing pressure. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to achieving core pricing gains that offset inflation and align with our value proposition.", "We saw a 4% increase in freight revenue due to a 5% increase in average revenue per car, with a slight offset due to decreased carloads. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group.", "Ag products revenue was down 2% on a 10% volume decrease and a 9% increase in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 19%, primarily driven by a delay in harvest and lower U.S. exports of feed grains in wheat as a result of high global inventories. This was partially offset by domestic strength in the Mid-South poultry and Idaho dairy markets.", "Grain products carloads were down 10%, predominantly due to weaker competitiveness of U.S. exports rail (03:21) shipments to the Gulf Coast. Food and refrigerated volumes were at 5%, driven by continued strength in import beer with strong summer demand. Domestic sugar shipments also remained strong with the movement of surplus inventory to accommodate new crop production. Looking at the rest of the year, we may see some benefit from the delayed harvest. However, high global production of both feed grains and wheat, coupled with a lower quality domestic wheat harvest will continue to create headwinds in our export markets.", "Domestic business is expected to remain stable. We expect food and refrigerated shipments will see growth driven by Cold Connect penetration, weather recovery and tightening truck capacity. We also anticipate sustained strength in sugar and import beer trending with consumer demand.", "Automotive revenue was down 3% in the quarter, on a 5% decrease in volume, and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 9% as a result of lower production levels in response to softer vehicle sales, coupled with high inventories as well as planned outages for model changeovers. These reductions were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and production growth in Mexico.", "The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 17.1 million vehicles in the third quarter, down 3% from third quarter 2016. On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand maintained our parts volume, despite lower overall production levels.", "The US light vehicle sales forecast for full year 2017 is 17 million units, down almost 3% from the 2016 record rate of 17.5 million. For the rest of the year, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to current sales trends, high inventory, and rising incentives. Hurricane replacements may provide some short-term opportunity.", "Chemicals revenue was up 2% for the quarter, on a 5% decrease in volume, and 8% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments declined 17% as we continued to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 82% to about 2,000 carloads, due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume, excluding crude oil, was down 2% in the quarter. Plastics carloads were down 6%, with seven plastics plants impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Fertilizer was up 6%, driven by continued strength in potash exports.", "For the fourth quarter of 2017, our chemicals franchise is expected to grow modestly. We are back to normal pre-hurricane levels. In addition, we anticipate strength in plastics with continued domestic and export demand, coupled with the new facilities and expansions coming online.", "Coal revenue decreased 2% for the quarter, on a 3% decrease in volume, and flat average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin was down 4%, while other regions were up 6%, as coal unit and unloading outages reduced PRB volume. Colorado/Utah loadings benefited from strong export shipments to the West Coast and to the Gulf Coast. Natural gas prices were similar to a year ago and coal stockpiles have been below normal for the majority of the year. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, coal volumes are expected to be flat versus fourth quarter 2016, due to normalized demand. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.", "Industrial products revenue was up 26%, on a 15% increase in volume, and a 10% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 80% in the quarter, driven by a 120% increase in sand shipments, due to improving well completions and increased proppant intensity per well. Specialized markets volume increased 23% in the quarter, driven by a 22% increase in waste, as a result of West Coast remediation projects and a 130% increase in military shipments, due to increased deployments and rotations.", "Looking forward, we anticipate proppant intensity, well completions and business development to drive continued growth through the fourth quarter. We see growth in military and waste shipments, with an offset in rock volumes due to less projects work in the south.", "Intermodal revenue was up 3% on a flat volume and a 2% increase in average revenue per quarter. Domestic volume was down 1%, due to a challenging competitive environment, offset by partial growth. International volume was up 1% in the quarter from stronger west-bound shipments. Excluding the Hanjin impact in 2016, international volume would have been up 5%. We expect international intermodal volume to hover around 2016 levels for the remainder of the year. We have now lapped the effects of the Hanjin bankruptcy, creating easier comps. However, we expect slowing from normal seasonality, as well as headwinds from ocean carrier industry consolidation and increasing overcapacity in the fourth quarter, resulting in lower ocean rates.", "For the domestic market, we remain optimistic that truck capacity will tighten further in the fourth quarter, providing an opportunity to drive higher levels of over-the-road conversions. We are also well positioned for holiday sales growth later in the quarter.", "To wrap up, this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of 2017 mentioned in the previous slides. We anticipate continued progress in our food and refrigerated, plastics, fertilizer and sand markets. Over-the-road conversions in both automotive and intermodal will also continue to present opportunities for growth. Our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth for the remainder of the year as the U.S. economy continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.", "Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thanks, Beth, and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personal injury rate was 0.78, almost even with the year-to-date record of 0.77 achieved in 2016. Although we continue generating near-record safety results, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day. With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 5% to 2.97. And in public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 1% versus the 2016 to 2.52, as we remain focused on improving crossings where we can impact public safety the most.", "Moving on to network performance, as reported to the AAR, velocity declined 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2016. As Lance mentioned, we faced a particularly tough challenge in the quarter, dealing with the impact of Hurricane Harvey. The record-setting rains negatively impacted Gulf Coast operations and our network fluidity system wide.", "In the aftermath of the storm, over 1,700 miles of track were out of service, and more than 2,400 route miles were affected. The team showed tremendous dedication as they worked extremely hard around the clock restoring operations back to normal in only 10 days. Continued implementation and testing of PTC across a growing number of routes in our network also negatively impacted velocity during the quarter. Terminal dwell increased 7% compared to last year. Whereas the effect of the hurricane did contribute to the increase during the quarter, we also see opportunities to improve car connections within our transportation plan.", "Looking at our resources, all in, our total operating workforce was down nearly 550 employees in the quarter when compared to last year. Our engineering and mechanical workforce was down more than 800 employees, driven primarily by fewer employees required on capital projects as a result of the productivity initiatives implemented during our G55 + 0 efforts. While our TE&Y workforce, excluding those in training, declined with volume during the quarter, our overall TE&Y workforce increased as we began to refill the training pipeline. As always, we will continue to adjust our resources as volume and network performance dictate.", "Despite the challenges experienced during the quarter, the team has remained focused on generating solid productivity results. We achieved best ever train size performance in our grain and manifest categories during the third quarter, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of best ever performance in our manifest network. The team also achieved third quarter records in our automotive, intermodal and coal categories. We were also able to generate productivity gains within our terminals as cars switched per employee day increased 3% during the third quarter.", "To wrap up, looking forward, we will continue fine tuning our safety strategy to generate positive results year-over-year. And while we have made solid operating productivity gains throughout the year, our progress is far from over. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable, and efficient railroad creates an excellent customer experience and increases returns for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.4 billion in the quarter, up 5% versus last year. Positive core price and increased fuel surcharge revenue offset the slight decrease in volumes for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.4 billion, up 6% from 2016. This includes the impact from Hurricane Harvey and the one-time expense associated with our workforce reduction plan. Operating income totaled $2 billion, a 3% increase from last year.", "Below the line, other income totaled $151 million, up about $122 million from 2016. This increase includes the impact for both a large land scale and the settlement of a previous litigation matter. Interest expense of $180 million was down 2% compared to the previous year and this reflects the impact of a lower effective interest rate, offsetting a higher total debt balance.", "Income tax expense increased 17% to $789 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings and the impact of the Illinois tax rate increase. Net income totaled $1.2 billion, up 6% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce third quarter earnings per share of $1.50.", "The operating ratio was 62.8%, up 0.7 percentage points from the third quarter of last year. The combined impact of fuel price and the surcharge lag benefit had less than 0.5 point negative impact on the operating ratio, and had a neutral impact on earnings per share in the third quarter versus last year.", "I want to take a minute to recap the one-time items, which we have called out over the past few months. Slide 20 provides a summary of these items, along with the third quarter impact on earnings per share and operating ratio. Above the line, we had the one-time cost associated with our workforce reduction, as well as the negative impact from Hurricane Harvey. Below the line, we had the negative impact of the Illinois state income tax adjustment which was more than offset by the positive impact from the large land sale as well as the litigation settlement. The net impact of all of these items resulted in a $0.06 headwind on our earnings per share and a negative 2.3 points on our operating ratio in the quarter.", "Turning now to the top line, freight revenue of $5 billion was up 4% versus last year, despite a 1% decrease in volume. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $227 million, up $54 million when compared to 2016, and down slightly versus the second quarter of this year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was a positive 2%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand shipments, partially offset by decreases in grain carloadings, finished vehicle volumes and chemical movements.", "Core price was nearly 2% in the quarter continuing the positive trend that we had experienced throughout the year. And as Beth previously mentioned, we are still facing some challenges with our coal and intermodal businesses. Excluding coal and intermodal, our core price was about 3%. For the full year, we continue to be on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our rail inflation costs.", "Turning now to operating expense, slide 22 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 9% versus 2016, including the impact from the workforce reduction plan which represented a majority of this increase. Excluding the workforce reduction impact, comp and benefits expense was up about 2% versus last year. We expect full year labor inflation to be in the 4% to 5% range. Productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce resulted in total workforce levels declining just under 2% in the quarter versus last year or about 700 employees. This does not include the impact of our workforce reduction plan, which will be reflected in our fourth quarter results.", "Fuel expense totaled $450 million, up 15% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 2% increase in gross ton-miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1% while our average fuel price increased 13% to $1.77 per gallon. Purchased services and materials expense increased 9% to $615 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher freight car expense associated with lease turnbacks, subsidiary contract services and hurricane-related costs.", "Turning to slide 23, depreciation expense was $528 million, up 3% compared to 2016. For the full year 2017, we now estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 3% to 4%. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable base, including our Positive Train Control assets that we put in place to date.", "Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $275 million in the quarter, which is down 2% when compared to 2016. Lower locomotive and freight car lease expense were the primary drivers. Other expenses came in at $230 million, down 15% versus last year. The primary drivers were lower state and local taxes and an easier comparison in bad debt expense, given the Hanjin bankruptcy writeoff in 2016. For the full year 2017, we would expect other expense to decrease about 5% versus 2016.", "Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the first three quarters of the year totaled about $5.4 billion, down 1% compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit in 2017 compared to 2016, which was mostly offset by the increase in net income. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled about $19.4 billion at quarter end, up $1.6 billion since the start of the year. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times, which is close to our target ratio of just under 2 times.", "Dividend payments for the first three quarters totaled nearly $1.5 billion, up from almost $1.4 billion last year. In addition to dividends, we also bought back 27.1 million shares totaling $2.9 billion through the end of the third quarter. This represents a 34% increase over last year in terms of dollars spent. Of the 27.1 million shares repurchased year-to-date, we bought back 11.8 million of these shares, totaling about $1.3 billion in the third quarter. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased over 32% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $4.4 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of this year, which represented 127% of net income over the same period.", "On the productivity side, our G55 + 0 initiatives yielded around $70 million of productivity in the quarter. While this number is light relative to the first half of the year, indirect effects related to the hurricane and its impact on overall network operations likely overshadowed some additional productivity momentum. This brings our year-to-date total through the first three quarters to around $270 million. And with these results, we continue to progress as expected, and we are on track to meet our $350 million to $400 million productivity goal for the full year.", "Looking forward to the balance of the year, we expect fourth quarter carloadings will increase slightly year-over-year, and we still expect full year carloading growth to be up in the low single digit range. With positive full year volume, positive core price, and significant productivity benefits, we are still on track to improve our full year operating ratio, including the net impact of all the one-time items that I just mentioned.", "We are intently focusing on achieving a targeted 60%, plus or minus, operating ratio on a full year basis by 2019. And we remain committed to reaching our goal of a 55% operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continue the momentum of our volume, pricing, and productivity initiatives.", "Before I turn it back to Lance, I would like to mention two other items. One, I would like to announce that we will be hosting an investor day on May 31, 2018, in Omaha, Nebraska. More details to follow, but we look forward to seeing you all here in Omaha next May. And finally, as you all know, Mary Jones has announced her retirement effective December 1. She is sitting right next to me right now. And we would like to thank her for her 37 years of service, including a record 18 years as Treasurer. So thank you, Mary.", "And with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thanks, Rob, and thank you, Mary. That was a great tribute.", "Closing out, for the last few months of the year, we expect our business to be similar to this past quarter, with year-over-year challenges in coal and automotive somewhat offset by strength in other areas such as industrial products. As the economy continues to ebb and flow, we will focus on executing our value strategy. We'll use innovation to enhance our customer experience, while continuing to drive resource productivity throughout the organization as we progress our G55 + 0 initiatives. Looking ahead to 2018, our engaged team is laser focused on building on our recent success. Our goal is to continue creating long-term enterprise value for all four of our stakeholders as we improve our top line and progress toward our margin improvement targets. With that, let's open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, please ask one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible.", "Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey, great. Thanks for taking the call. I wanted to talk a little bit about sort of the pricing environment and as you look out into probably not the fourth quarter, but maybe 2018, just get a rough sense of maybe how you're starting to think about it as you're having discussions with customers. It looks like you had some acceleration on the core number this quarter and last quarter. How should we be thinking about just roughly the sort of pricing environment as we move into next year?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Beth.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Chris, we are optimistic that the trucking tightening that we're seeing right now and what may come with the ELD implementation is going to provide an environment where we'll have an opportunity for pricing as well as some volume growth. But at the same time, we still do see that other things that will impact us will be other competitive modes of transportation, what's going on with economic demand, et cetera. As you know, we're still very committed to ensuring that we have pricing in place that offsets our inflation.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. All right. That's helpful. And with the backdrop that we're seeing with economic growth maybe picking up a little bit, we have some tightness. I guess, coupled with the moves you've done with some head count reductions, any sense of how we should be thinking about productivity? I know you need to get productivity every year in order to get to your longer term OR targets, but how should we be thinking about 2018 maybe in relation to 2017?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, we'll let Rob take that.", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, Chris, as you know, as part of our G55 + 0 initiative, we're all about continuing to drive robust productivity numbers as we have this year and as we have the last several years. So without giving you a number, I would just say that the unrelenting focus on continuing to drive productivity is embedded in our organization. And as we've always said, we do find benefit in our productivity initiatives with positive volume growth. And at this point in time, we are believing and hoping that the volume for 2018 will be on the positive side of the ledger.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, absolutely. We would love to see some growth to help us leverage. But in the absence of it, we'll continue to generate productivity.", "Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.", "Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you, operator. And Mary, congratulations, this will be your last call that you'll have to deal with guys like me. Wanted to focus a little bit on the OR in the quarter. Rob, I think you mentioned some of the puts and takes from fuel being about 0.5% (sic) [0.5 point] (27:09) you said, and I think with the other stuff, it looks like if we would draw everything out, you guys are probably closer to a 60% OR. And Lance, I think you describe the fourth quarter as looking very similar to the third quarter. Did I get all those puts and takes right for looking forward?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah. So I'll start with fourth quarter looking like third quarter. That was largely right. You take the unusual items out, we expect continued robust productivity. We talked about slightly positive volumes. And so the environment, as we see the fourth quarter, looks about like the third quarter. Rob, you want to talk about...", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, Jason, I would just say you're right in terms of the way you were doing the math. Fuel was a headwind in the quarter of about 0.3 point and the items that I itemized were 2.3 points of headwind. That's the force reduction in the hurricane impact, which we certainly don't think those two are going to repeat. So if you do that math, you get down to a low 60% core performance, which we're very proud of in the third quarter.", "Now, I wouldn't straightline because fourth quarters are always little bit different. You got different mix, you got different volume. But I would just tell you, we're continuing to be focused on the same initiatives that drove what we think is an outstanding performance in the third quarter to repeat in the fourth quarter. But I wouldn't straightline any of those numbers, per se.", "Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Follow-up I guess is going to be a little bit about the pricing side. The way I look at it, is obviously, you've had pressures in two of your bigger commodity groups, but it looks like one commodity group should at least start to get better here, let's say, in the next quarter or so. Is the way to think about it as more of a slow recovery in both those two groups, one of which is going to be just driven by what's going on in the truck market. And if that's correct, when do you think you'll start seeing the positive impacts from that?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "So I'm assuming the two groups you're referencing are coal and intermodal, which we called out.", "Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "That's correct.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "And certainly coal is more of a rail-to-rail competition than truck. There's not as much truck activity in that segment. And so we'll continue to price into that environment, ensuring that we're reinvestable and getting the kind of returns that we want.", "On the intermodal side, I agree with your assessment. There's lots of different competitors in that space, trucks and rail, IMCs, et cetera, and the tightening of trucks should provide a tailwind, but we are also continuing to keep an eye on what's happening with our competitors in that market space. And at this point, we're pretty hopeful that we're going to see the ability to get additional pricing and volume.", "Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you for the time, as always.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. Good morning. Sorry, I just kind of jumped over to the call here, so I've missed some things, I think. But how would you view, I guess, the volume impact looking into next year as you've got \u2013 the economy feels pretty good, you've got a number of probably kind of puts and takes in terms of maybe frac sand coal, things that could be headwinds. But are you optimistic looking into 2018 that you can see, I don't know, meaningful volume growth, call it, 2% type of volume growth, or do you think that there's some headwinds that are going to make that maybe difficult to achieve?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Hey, Tom. This is Lance. I'll start by kind of sharing our overall perspective and then let Beth fill in some blanks. So overall as we look into 2018, we are somewhat optimistic, right? There's a number of markers that look promising. One is the truck market; it is becoming kind of consensus knowledge that truck capacity might very well tighten, the ELD will have an impact of some kind, and that's a good environment. That's good for us when that occurs.", "It feels to us like the overall economy continues to move along. I'd like to see it accelerate a bit. But consumers feel, to us, like they are buying stuff at a reasonable pace not a kind of a pre-recession normal pace yet. I think that'll show up in housing starts. So there's a number of relatively positive things. There's some continued headwinds, though, as well, right? Coal remains somewhat of a question mark. What exactly happens in the grain markets, and the worldwide feed and grain markets are still somewhat of a question mark. And of course we continue to face a robust competitive environment, notwithstanding that that environment, at its base level, looks like it's improving.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "If you want to talk a little bit more specifically about a few markets we're pretty excited about, we continue to feel good about our ability to grow the new Cold Connect platform that we have, focused on food and refrigerated products. Mexico remains a great opportunity for us. There's certainly uncertainty around what happens with NAFTA, but we believe that market is a growth opportunity for us across a variety of submarkets. And, of course, the plastics expansions will give us some opportunities in 2018 and beyond.", "Frac sand, as you called out, may have some headwinds, but we view it as there's more than one place that oil is being drilled for in the United States and certainly in the Permian, you're going to see some in-basin sand come online, but we do view the entire pie for frac sand as growing. And we think that we have opportunities in other places like the Eagle Ford and Oklahoma, possibly in the Front Range as well for frac sand shipments. So I think we feel pretty good about some potential there. And if we see housing really go up, that would be a great opportunity for us.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "So, I mean, if you put it \u2013 without saying, oh, it's going to \u2013 volumes are going to grow at a certain level, when you put the puts and takes together, do you say, yeah, we got to get to volume growth next year, and maybe it's a couple points, maybe it's plus or minus, but is it reasonable to think you put them all together, it's more positive than negative?", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Tom, this is Rob. As you know, we're not going to give precise numbers around what that volume all adds up to, but we are confident that you add up everything that Lance and Beth just went through, it's going to be on the positive side of the ledger. So we'll work to be as successful in that as we positively can, but I would just reiterate all the things we just said are a fabulous commercial for the wonderful diversity that we have in our network and the strength that that offers us. So we have lots of opportunities to grow our business. And at this point in time, it all adds up to a positive volume assumption.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, great. And then just one quick one, and I apologize if you mentioned this, but how much of your book would you touch in terms of repricing in 2018, what percent?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "We're kind of typically in around a two-thirds under contract or under letter quote environment with more of a one-third that's quoting on either a spot basis or a tariff basis.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "So the letter quote would be one year, presumably? Do you know how much per letter?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, sorry. I should have been clearer about that. Yeah.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "How much (35:13)", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Those have the potential to roll off sometime in the year next year.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Right, so how much would the letter quote be? Is that like (35:20)", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "We're not going to get into those details, Tom.", "Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. It sounds like you've got a lot of the book you could touch next year, so all right. Great. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Thanks. And good morning. So historically, we've always heard a lot from the rails about the addressable market for highway conversions as it relates to the intermodal business, but given the tightness we've seen in truckload, I was just curious if you could speak to what the opportunity looks like within your general merchandise network. Is there any way to frame up that addressable market or growth potential that you see from highway conversions in general merchandise?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, thanks Justin. This is Lance. Taking at a very high level, historically, and we still believe this, we've talked about a very large addressable truck market. Our current product today takes us comfortably down into a market where, if the length of haul is 500 miles-plus, it's an opportunity for us. And there's lots and lots of truckload capability there. What we're focused on is making sure that the experience with us in that journey of shipping product feels as good, if not better, than it feels all along the way with truck. I'll let Beth talk more specifically to the opportunities within that market.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, so we do believe that the intermodal market, and possibly even conversion into boxcar off the highway is a big opportunity for us, and our focus is really on taking advantage of our great franchise where we offer intermodal service in many more lanes than our direct competitor, which we think gives us opportunities to grow at a decent pace as the market turns our way with truck capacity tightening.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And as a follow-up and maybe this one is for you, Beth. I think there's going to be a lot more focus on the chemicals business as we get into next year, could you help us think about the potential growth in your chemicals franchise as we get into 2018 and beyond? And do you think we'll be at a point where that chemicals business can start growing at a pace that's above GDP?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "So there are, as you know, close to $200 billion that have been put into the Gulf Coast chemical franchise to grow mostly plastics, although there are industrial chemicals investments happening as well. And while that is a very substantial investment and a wonderful opportunity for us, it certainly isn't the size of some of our other markets. We would hope to see growth in those markets in the tens of thousands of carloads, not in the hundreds of thousands of carloads.", "And some of the things that'll be a governor for us is not all of that plastics in particular is going to want to move domestically. A lot of it will have an export solution. A lot of it will go out of the Port of Houston, but we will do our best to participate in providing our customers with supply chain solutions, should they not be able to use the Port of Houston because of capacity constraints and want to use a West Coast port where we've developed an opportunity to do that near our Dallas Intermodal facility.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "The good news is \u2013 and Rob talked about this \u2013 our franchise is built for the long run and overall global economic growth for the long run. So you get that beautiful chemical franchise on the Gulf Coast and it'll start out producing and shipping at certain quantity and certain direction, but really, who can make the call over the course of the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, other than we're pretty confident consumption is going to increase worldwide and we've got a wonderful franchise to be able to ship it.", "Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.", "Makes sense. Thanks for the time this morning.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Please proceed with your questions.", "Fadi Chamoun - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Thank you. Good morning. So if we were to think about volume being up, say, 2% next year, how should we think about the head count? I mean, if you're sort of aiming to that kind of 60-ish percent operating ratio in 2019, I would think head count would have to stay kind of flat or even down a little bit to get you to that number. I'm just trying to reconcile a little bit this sort of 2019 target with the outlook for the head count.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, Fadi, without getting into the details, we've outlined the moving parts this morning, so we're going to have pretty substantial reduction in our general and administrative overhead, which we've already talked about. Then as we look at how we react to volume, it's the moving pieces of what we can do on productivity, so that we're not growing our head count one-to-one with volume growth. That's our intent year-over-year, it's what we've been able to do and we're going to continue to do that next year.", "Fadi Chamoun - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on some of the pricing questions. Earlier in the prepared remarks you talked about the fact that you're still seeing some pressure in intermodal and coal, but just given that the core pricing gains have accelerated for two consecutive quarters, is it fair to infer that some of these pressures that you've been facing have begun to ease a little bit? And if yes, maybe if you can talk about what might be driving that.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "We have maybe seen a little bit of easing in the competitive pressure, but it's not substantial. We're still \u2013 I would say that we're getting good pricing, and I think Rob referenced that, outside of those two markets. That's more like a 3%, so that's helping us to continue to put up good pricing numbers.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. And then as a follow-up question, one of your competitors discussed expectations for rail inflation for 2018 and cited something around 1.9%. Is that how you're looking at it as well? And maybe you could just share your view about that. And, Rob, I know you mentioned the labor inflation of 4% to 5% this year, but could you remind us what the expectation for all-in inflation is for 2017?", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yes. Allison, this year \u2013 you're exactly right, this year, we've said that all-in inflation's around 3%, with labor, 4% to 5%. As we look to next year, we haven't finalized our numbers yet, but I would say both are going to look closer to 2%...", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay.", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "All-in and labor.", "Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Excellent. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Lance, I guess I wanted to follow up off of Tom's question about the volume outlook in 2018, and it's really not prescriptive for guidance next year. But when you think about your franchise and we think about railroads in North America, there's clear examples of networks that can drive a lot of growth. It does seem to be a robust economy, both from an intermodal and industrial energy perspective. So I guess as I look back at your slides at your last analyst meeting, there's always this modest volume outlook. Is there anything structurally you can do on the network that can really leverage this low-cost base and really, the irreplaceable assets that you have that can drive a faster growth outlook looking forward? Or are you guys really just capped with the ebbs and flows of GDP?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thanks for the question, Brandon. I'll start backwards and go forwards in the question. We are not capped as either an industrial production growth rate, a GDP growth rate. When you think about our ability to grow, we're not behaving in a vacuum. So part of the equation is how our franchise lays what's happening in the underlying economies that we serve. So fundamentally, our growth is built on global trade, industrial production, the industrial economy, and U.S. consumption of stuff.", "And in that context, then, we face competition, either modal competition or direct rail competition. So when I build that model in my mind, when I'm setting my own expectations, I feel pretty optimistic about how our network lands on areas of potential growth. We serve Mexico; we enjoy virtually 70% of the to and from freight rail business with Mexico. Virtually 40% of our business is originated or terminated outside the United States. We serve very large population and growing population centers in the western two-thirds of the United States. And we touch a lot of different pieces of the economy.", "So from a potential perspective, I feel pretty good about it. After that, it's all about can we find a business that's reinvestable and secure it in the competitive environment. And that's always a wild card and we're always positioning ourselves to be the high value, best option with our customers, and we're going to continue to do that. But to your point, Brandon, nothing would please me more than to see a really strong, robust growth environment because we know how to leverage that very, very effectively.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. I appreciate that. And Beth, I just wanted to circle back to your international intermodal comments. It does seem like we're seeing peak ocean volumes right now, so can you walk us through again why you guys aren't seeing a lot of that expansion? I think it's because you've seen port shifts with the carrier consolidation, but could we talk through that again?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "I would say I believe we are seeing the volume. Last year we still had some Hanjin loads which, of course, they went away and their volume kind of dispersed across the other carriers. So if you took the Hanjin impact out, where we are sitting at a 1%, but if you took that Hanjin out of the comparison, we'd be at 5%, which is pretty commensurate with what's actually happening in the market.", "Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your question.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.", "Thanks very much and good morning.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Good morning.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.", "I wanted to ask one on productivity. The train length question gets asked a lot, but you've also had pretty good gains in terminal productivity year-to-date. Just wondering if you can give us some color on what's driving that?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Cameron?", "Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.", "Inside our terminals, volume remains very predictable and very stable, and that allows you to really bear down on the productivity inside each and every terminal. So that looks very positive as you think about the year 2018. The only area of growth that we see where we might struggle a little bit is out in West Texas, as Beth mentioned. The rest of the network looks very positive.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.", "And then just separately, I appreciate this is low value traffic, but just curious whether China's pending restrictions on scrap are having an impact on international intermodal in so far as they reduce the potential source of back haul traffic?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, it is \u2013 scrap paper is a portion of the back haul traffic and it is, I'd call it, a mild concern. We are pretty actively looking for other match-back opportunities and we've implemented some programs with our customers to \u2013 and with the steamship lines to use their containers for domestic loads in places where we might not have domestic containers, which doesn't give them a match-back all the way to China, but it might give them a match-back to the West Coast. So we're pretty focused on helping them fill that gap and being good partners in that regard.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Cherilyn, that's something we don't talk a lot about but that's a manifestation of \u2013 kind of a granular manifestation of the value of having the franchise that we do is that we have a lot of exposure to match-back opportunities for West Coast exports, and that can be a real value-add for our international steamship partners.", "Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. That's all for me.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for the taking the time. I wanted to ask you a question about the domestic intermodal market and what you guys can maybe do to help capitalize on that conversion opportunity, because the volume growth, on a reported basis, for intermodal has always been a little bit lighter. You guys have done a great job taking up yields.", "I'm just wondering as you think about how you work with your channel partners, how you manage the two box pools that you have, how you take that intermodal product to market through streamline. Is there something you can do that you can sort of accelerate that domestic opportunity? And then as you think about what's happening in the eastern market with one of your partners kind of redesigning maybe some of its intermodal services, if that's going to create some either opportunities of challenges for you. If you could comment on, that'd be great.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, so we continue to be very bullish on the opportunity that intermodal provides domestically for Union Pacific over the long term. And we are unique, as you've described, with our two box programs and the ability to bringing assets to bear and help customers meet their supply chain needs. So we are very focused on \u2013 we're always looking at opportunities to get into new markets, provide new services, provide stronger value proposition to customers, and with that, we work across all the channel partners. We see very strong parcel growth this year. But as you say, the overall domestic has been a little weaker, and that's really been more of a competitive pricing situation. And we are and will continue to be focused on yields.", "We believe that with the tightening of the truck capacity, that's going to open up some opportunities for us. You said a little bit about the CSX's changes in their intermodal network. At this point, I think they're rationalizing some lanes that are local to them that maybe don't make as much sense for them to stay in. And we're just staying in real close communication to make sure that we preserve the viability of that UMAX product and put it in a position where it can grow as we have opportunities.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Recall, David, that we've got those two branded box programs, one each with each of our good partners in the east, the NS and the CSX, and they are both robust potential growths engines.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. And maybe Rob, just thinking about the CapEx, obviously the 3Q numbers probably impacted a little bit by the weather and some idling of work crews. Wanted to get your thoughts on the ability to kind of keep CapEx at a little bit lower level here as some of the growth is in some of the lighter weight traffic areas and you've got some idle capacity from kind of the coal traffic coming off.", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, David, I would just say. I assume you're talking about looking forward 2018 (52:00)", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yeah, long-range. Well, yeah (52:02).", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "I mean we constantly, of course, as a matter of process are always in tune to being as disciplined and wise about every capital dollar we spend, and it's based on a very rigorous evaluation of what the expected returns are. But the guidance I would give you is that 15% of revenue spent. I mean, again, as you know, that's not how we build our budget, but that's still the right way to look at it looking forward.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yeah, and then...", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "And one thing, David, I heard you say that I want to make sure we don't leave you with this impression, and that is all the potential growth is happening in areas where we've got excess capacity. We do have excess capacity in parts of our network, but clearly there are other parts like down in Texas where the capacity is much more constrained.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yeah, no, I was just wondering if there was going to be any need to step up a little bit of growth CapEx to pursue the intermodal opportunity broadly, or if you feel like you can kind of work that through the existing capita in both, obviously addressing bottlenecks as they happen.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, Rob's got it right from the standpoint of long term, we're comfortable with where we've guided.", "J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks a lot for the color.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, thanks. Morning. So I apologize if some of this was addressed, we're bouncing between a couple calls. Hopefully, it can be coordinated better next time. Just for you on sand, what percent of your sand business is going to Permian versus other basins? And then what's the strategy as some of the local stuff comes online, if it's going to come, there's nothing we can do about it, or do you think about changing the pricing on the longer haul stuff to compete with the Permian sand?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Well, I don't think we've ever provided exactly what the percentage is of Permian, but we have a good-sized book of business into the Permian as well as the Eagle Ford, smaller books of business into Oklahoma and the DJ Basin sort of area. And off the top of my head, I couldn't even give you the percentages if I had to. But what I would say is they all provide some growth opportunities. Permian will certainly be challenged by in-basin sand coming on that's of a certain mesh type. We do believe there will be opportunities to continue to bring some of the coarser meshes in from the Wisconsin and Minnesota range and continue to compete in Permian.", "And I would say the Permian overall pie, I think, is still going to continue to grow even with in-basin sand coming on. So we'll certainly be looking to grow there, but we'll be looking to grow in Eagle Ford, Oklahoma, and Colorado as well. And as far as lowering rates to try to compete with local sand, that's a pretty tough proposition. And I think we're always going to stay very focused on being reinvestable and getting a good yield for the assets that we're employing.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, that makes sense. So if I just heard you right, you think even Permian sand volumes are up next year.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "I think the whole Permian sand consumption is up next year. It remains to be seen how much of that will get filled with local sand versus sand coming in from another location.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Oh, okay. That makes sense. Okay. And then Lance, just in terms of the head count reductions, is that \u2013 I guess I'm surprised that that doesn't take up the productivity target for the year, so maybe just a thought there. But more bigger picture, do you think \u2013 is this one of, hey, there's many things like this we can do or is this, hey, this was one specific opportunity and we did it, but don't think that there's lots more like this? I'm just trying to understand if this was a one and done or one of many.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, so Scott, I'll take your first question about productivity targets. We have not changed our productivity targets. This decrease in our overhauled general and administrative head count is going to be absorbed into those. Our communication with you and our drive amongst ourselves has always been we've set out our marker and we're doing everything in our power to get and accelerate productivity, as well as growth, as well as price, so that we can meet or exceed the markers that we've laid out.", "And in terms of this particular action, reducing our overall head count by 800 plus or minus in this one action, clearly, I don't think that we're going to be taking that kind of action over and over and over again. Candidly, it's something we'd prefer not to do if we don't need to. But I would say that we have many granular projects inside of Grow to 55 and 0 [G55 + 0] that have anywhere between some relatively small impact to some relatively large impact that we're pursuing. And that will inform how much productivity we build into our plans in 2018 and beyond.", "Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks very much. So just clarification on the inflation for next year, I know you mentioned labor in there. Can you just break out labor as to what you expect labor inflation to be in 2018? I know you signalled it for Q4, but just wanted to confirm on next year what you were expecting in the labor side.", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, Walter, I earlier said that \u2013 to the question of inflation, and I was talking about 2018, that we expect overall inflation and overall labor to be closer to 2% versus what they're running this year. And at this point, I'm not going to break out the labor component but, of course, not only do you have wages in there, but you also have the moving part of the health and welfare.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Right. Okay. But you're not breaking that out for 2018 yet?", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Not at this point, no.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And just the tax rate is still going to be steady at 37.5%?", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, that's a reasonable assumption, yeah.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Right. And then the last one, the other line \u2013 in your other line in operating expenses, it does tend to move around a lot. I know you've got \u2013 your guidance has been kind of \u2013 was up and now it's kind of down, and just wondering whether is that a line item that we should, when we look at our 2018, look at 2017 as an exceptional year in terms of being down, or is this a representative year now that we can build on some normal growth rate in line with your overall inflation going into next year? Just want to make sure, because that's a lumpy line item, whether there was something in 2017 that made it a little bit not necessarily repeatable for next year.", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, Walter, I'm going to disappoint you, because we're not going to give guidance on that number, not because we're withholding but because there is a lot of moving parts, to your point. And it can and will be lumpy. So stay tuned. But we generally say in the $150-ish million neighborhood is what it's looked like historically for other income. But it can be lumpy. I mean, you have lots of moving parts in there.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Sure. I was referencing your other in the other expenses.", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "(59:44)", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "We expect to be lumpy as well, not maybe as lumpy as other income. But we're not going to give guidance on that because you're right, there are a lot of moving parts. But we've typically said in the $200 million range, but I would caution you that it can move up and down with unusual items.", "Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ariel Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.", "Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good morning, guys. So wanted to start out on the network fluidity metrics, I think we saw a come couple of those tick up in the quarter, I was hoping you could just delineate what might have been due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey versus what you think in terms of fourth quarter and kind of resumption of positive progress, and how you're seeing kind of network fluidity, not only for your network but also kind of interchanges with other carriers.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Interchanges with other carriers look very fluid across the network, up and down the Mississippi. No issues there. Our own velocity was greatly impacted by Hurricane Harvey. In fact, it's one of the larger events that our network has suffered from a weather perspective.", "The opportunity looking towards 2018 lies in our train crews becoming more familiar with the PTC technology that we've rolled out, both on the west and the northern region, and we feel that that is something that we can tackle internally. It's not a technology problem, it's our crews becoming more proficient at using the technology.", "Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay that's helpful. And then just to switch gears a little bit, obviously, there was the land sale this quarter, was hoping you could maybe discuss that in a little bit more detail and what additional opportunities there might be for additional land sales?", "Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, we did announce the land sale earlier, but we announced it because of the size of it and wanted to give some perspective on the financial impact. But we're not going to give any details on that specific transaction. But I would just say that we have a sophisticated professional real estate organization, so our selling real estate, when we find an opportunity, is something we continually do. I mean, again, it can be lumpy, as I indicated in the other income question earlier on the call, but I would say that's something our professional real estate folks are always looking at, but it will be lumpy, and we're continuing looking at where there are opportunities, where it's an asset that is no longer needed, long term, for the benefit of the rail. And that's kind of how we approach it.", "Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I'll tell you what, maybe if I could ask a follow-up and just ask it slightly differently. Where are you, when you look at your network, where would you say you are in terms of resource needs versus where you'd like to be? You said some capacity tightness in Texas but maybe some loose capacity, other areas; across your network, where do you feel are you on just general research needs?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah. So let's just walk you around real quick. The major east-west line from the Pacific Northwest, California, NorCal that runs through Wyoming and on into Chicago; in the Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Chicago areas, we've got a lot of capacity there. It was built up for our coal business, and our coal business is about half of what it used to be.", "If you're over on the West Coast, West Coast has good solid open capacity. We'd love to use that for more shipments up and down the I-5 and growth in Las Vegas, the SoCal area and Phoenix. When you move over down towards Texas, and let's say north-south between Chicago and Texas, and just next Texas and Louisiana themselves, the north-south routes have good solid capacity availability. We still have capacity in certain routes in Texas and Louisiana, but that's the area where when we're focusing on new capacity, when we're focusing on significant capital spend, it is likely to occur there.", "Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's great color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yeah, thanks for taking my question here. I wanted to follow-up on a couple of earlier questions on what a tightening truckload market means for UP? And specifically, do your contractual relationships with your key domestic intermodal partners, do they allow you the flexibility to push a bit harder on pricing next year or in tight years, in general, compared to the last few years that have been weaker? Or are those escalators fairly fixed and really predefined on a year-to-year basis?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Beth?", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Well, we don't typically give a lot of color on specific contractual arrangements with customers, but I would say that we have opportunities out there, most of the bid process for domestic intermodal happens in the spring time, as you know, as they go out to bid for their whole books with beneficial cargo owners. So if truck capacity remains tight and maybe even tightens with ELD, certainly we would hope to see some opportunity to address pricing in that bid period. And we are very hopeful that our long-term partners are able to get pricing in their markets and that that will flow to us as well. And additionally, we really, really would like to see the volume growth along with it.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah. And I think in international intermodal, which it felt like part of your question was towards, that tends to be long-term contracts.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yes. Sorry about that. (01:05:38)", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Understood. So in the domestic business, just to clarify, you should see some benefit in the parts of your business where you own the boxes and control some of the assets, perhaps coincident with the bid season, but some of the longer term contracts, either in international or domestic, may be kind of less flexible to the near-term rise in the market. Is that a fair way to put it or (01:06:04)", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, I think that's a very fair characterization.", "Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "All right. Thank you for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. Good morning and appreciate getting me on the call here. Just a couple of quick ones. Cam, I know you mentioned some of the rollout with PTC have an impact on velocity. Was wondering if you could \u2013 if you have a chance to quantify that, and then also, what sort of milestones you're looking at next. It sounds like you've got a better handle on what you need to do in some of the regions, but are there any other milestones that you're looking at that could be significant, maybe not this year, but perhaps in 2018, getting to going live beyond that?", "Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.", "The velocity impact is somewhere between half mile an hour and mile an hour right now as we see it, because we have rolled out completely on the west and on the north. The vast majority of that opportunity lies within the training and familiarity of the technology with our crews, so it is something we can address.", "Ahead of us is the southern region implementation in 2018. We see no issues with meeting all the federal requirements in that year. And we'll continue to problem solve the technology when we run into areas that need a technology patch to solidify the whole PTC system.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Hey, Brian. Giving you a little kind of color on that velocity number that Cam just shared. That's a very loosey-goosey number, right. We try to parse that together as best we can. It's kind of hard to tease that out specifically. Leave it said that it's a real impact and the most important thing that Cameron has in front of him is we believe the impact is all about crew behavior. So in your mind's eye, if you think about this, there's a screen in front of the crew and inside the PTC system, pretty much all it does is warn you when it's thinking you're going to need to take action.", "So half the time, the screen is flashing at you a warning, and I think human behavior is to not have the screen tell you about a warning. That's a little bit of a design issue that I think the overall industry is going to have to get into, because that drives behavior then to be more cautious than necessary, and that then retards the overall velocity on the system. So it's a pretty complex number of moving parts, it's hard to say exactly what the impact that is. But Cameron's given you a general idea of it is impactful and we've got to route forward to address it.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, so it sounds like it's more user interface and not something in the technology that you've encountered so far.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah. Totally.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on just cross border activity into Mexico. Obviously, we saw a new agreement between a competitor and the KCS at Laredo, was wondering if you've actually seen any sort of impact on your business through that gateway so far? Thank you.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, we continue to grow through that gateway over the long run. We are familiar with all competitive products. And we understand, to our chagrin, we're not going to be able to handle every single carload that is made available to and from Mexico, but we are very pleased with our partners and our products and we're doing everything in our power to profitably grow those products.", "Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks for your time.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, this is Diane on for Ravi Shanker. Thanks for squeezing us in on the call. Just a question regarding the tentative agreement reached between a group of labor unions and the costs on rails. Can you share your initial thoughts on how that agreement stacks up versus your expectations? And also, on the agreement, it looks like it states a 2.5% to 3% pay increase in 2018 and 2019, so wondering why that differs from the 2% labor inflation that you guys expect next year. Thank you.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thanks for the question, Diane. Not surprisingly, I'm not going to be able to make too many specific comments on either the negotiation or this specific tentative agreement. I will tell you that tentative agreement is in industry with about 60% of the industries collectively bargained employment population, and it is out for ratification, as we speak.", "Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Do you have a timeline for \u2013 or what is your expected timeline for the ratification?", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Well, we don't have a specific timeline for it. All I can tell is you that each committee has to ratify vote, and once that's accomplished, then we can call it a done deal and start implementing. I think that's the detail I can give you.", "Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you for the time.", "Operator", "The next is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.", "Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I joined a little late. Sorry if this question was asked and answered, but wanted to just understand the breakdown between contracted and maybe transactional business next year, especially given the expectation for what truck capacity may do next year. Just specifically, how much of next year's businesses are already contracted and maybe how should we expect if there is any lag between your ability to see core pricing growth for the overall enterprise versus maybe the backdrop of the overall market? Thanks.", "Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.", "Yeah, we did get this one earlier and so I'll give you the same answer, which is that we see typically that our business is about two-thirds contracted and then about one-third moving in any particular year.", "Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's easy enough. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thank you, Amit.", "Operator", "Thank you. We've come to the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing remarks.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "Thank you very much, Rob. For the last few months of the year, we expect our business to be similar to this past quarter, with year-over-year challenges in coal and automotive, somewhat offset by strength in other areas such as industrial products. As the economy continues to ebb and flow, we're going to focus on executing our value strategy. We'll use innovation to enhance our customer experience, while continuing to drive resource productivity throughout the organization as we progress our Grow to 55 and Zero initiatives. As we look ahead to 2018, our engage team is laser focused on building upon our recent success.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.", "And with that, thanks, and we look forward to the next time we have an opportunity to speak with you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operation Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available in the Union Pacific's website.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.", "Lance Fritz", "Good morning, everybody. And welcome to the Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha, are Beth Whited, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $7.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 or $9.25 per share. These reported numbers include the previously disclosed adjustments reflecting the impact of corporate tax reform which Rob will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. Excluding these adjustments 2017 fourth quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $1.53 per share. This represents an increase of 5% and 10% respectively when compared to 2016. Total volume increased 1% in the quarter compared to 2016 driven primarily by 17% increase in industrial products and a 5% increase in chemicals. Partially offsetting these volume increases were declines in agricultural products, automotive and coal. Intermodal carloads were flat for the quarter.", "Overall force levels decreased in the fourth quarter both sequentially and year-over-year as we continue to make meaningful progress on our productivity initiatives. The quarterly adjusted operating ratio came in at 62.6% which was up 0.6 points from the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by an increase in fuel price. I'm pleased with the results the men and women of Union Pacific achieved by focusing on our six-track value strategy. While we have room for improvement in many areas that does not include the dedication and hard work of our employees as they build America.", "Our team will give you more of the details on the fourth quarter, starting with Beth.", "Beth Whited", "Thank you Lance and good morning. This will be our final reporting on six business groups as we announce during the third quarter. Effective January 1 we will transition reporting to our newly established four business groups agricultural products, energy, industrial and premium. For the fourth quarter our volume was up 1% driven primarily by industrial products and chemicals, we generated positive net core pricing of about one and three quarters percent in the quarter with continued energy in intermodal pricing pressure. Despite these challenges our focus continues to be on achieving core pricing gains that counterbalance inflation and coincide with our value proposition. The increase in volume and 4% improvement and average revenue per car drove a 5% increase in freight revenue.", "Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Ag products revenue was down 4% on a 7% volume decrease partially offset by 3% increase in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 19% driven by high global supplies and reduced US competitiveness in the world export market. Grain products carloads were down 2% as growth in ethanol exports were offset by reduced mill [ph] shipments to the east. The delayed implementation of the biodiesel tax credit also negatively impacted our oils business. Food and refrigerator volumes were up 2% driven by continued strength in import beer. Growth in refrigerated shipments for frozen fries in Cold Connect.", "Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter on a 4% decrease in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 5% as a result of lower production levels in response to softer vehicle sales high inventories as well as planned outages for model changeovers. These reductions were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and strong shipments into the Texas market for hurricane replacement.", "The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 17.1 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, down only slightly from fourth quarter 2016. On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand minimized the impact of lower overall production levels resulting in a 1% reduction.", "Chemicals revenue was up 7% for the quarter, on a 5% increase in volume, and 2% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments increased 15% driven by stronger diesel and crude oil shipments coupled with strengthen in propane due to Mexico demand, hurricane recovery and inventory build for seasonal winter demand. Plastics carloads were down 4% due to resin tightness and increased commodity prices as a result of residual impact from Hurricane Harvey. Fertilizer was up 11%, driven by continued strength in potash exports.", "Coal revenue decreased 5% for the quarter, on a 3% decrease in volume, and 2% decrease in average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin was down 2%, while other regions were down 1%. Natural gas prices were down 8% from a year ago driving the decrease in domestic demand. Colorado Utah Loadings benefited from strong export shipments to the West Coast and to the Gulf Coast. Coal stockpiles have been below the five-year average for the majority of the year.", "Industrial products revenue was up 28%, on a 17% increase in volume, and a 10% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 71% in the quarter, driven by a 100% increase in sand shipments, due to improving well completions and increased proppant intensity per well. Specialized markets volume increased 20% in the quarter, driven by a 15% increase in waste, as a result of West Coast remediation projects and a 60% increase in military shipments, due to increased deployments and rotations.", "Intermodal revenue was up 4% on a flat volume and a 4% increase in average revenue per quarter. The domestic market increased 1% driven by strong parcel shipment. International volume was down 2% driven by continued headwinds from industry challenges due to overcapacity and consolidations which resulted in increased transloading and changing vessel ports of call.", "Going forward we'll be begin to report on our four business groups agricultural products, energy, industrial and premium. For agricultural products we anticipate continued strength in ethanol exports driven by demand from China, Brazil and India. Continued growth in food and refrigerated shipments due to Cold Connect penetration tightening to our capacity, frozen fries expansions and continued strength and import beer. We anticipate continued uncertainty in the grain market as high global supply and unknown weak crop quality potentially affect our ability to participate in the export market.", "For energy we anticipate continued strength in frac sand with more uncertainty in the second half due to the viability of local sand. As always for coal, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. Industrial is expected to remain stable. We anticipate an increase in plastics as new facilities and expansions come online and resin supply increases. In addition we expect to see strength in both rock [ph] and cement markets. For premium, we truck capacity to continue to tighten providing an opportunity to drive higher levels of over the road conversions. Despite challenges within the international intermodal market, we anticipate new products benefiting the supply chain will drive growth. As for automotive the US light vehicle sales forecast for 2018 is 16.9 million units down 2% from 2017. Production shifts will create some opportunity to offset the weaker market demand and over the road conversions will present new opportunities for additional parts growth.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.", "Cameron Scott", "Thanks, Beth and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable injury rate was 0.79 slightly higher than the full year record of 0.75 achieved in 2016. Although we continue generating near record safety results, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day. With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 3% to 2.94.", "In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 5% versus the 2016 to 2.55, as we continue to reinforce public awareness to community partnerships and public safety campaigns.", "Moving on to network performance, as reported to the AAR, velocity declined 5% and terminal dwell increased 12% compared to the third quarter of 2016. We're not satisfied with this operating performance. Multiple factors play in the network fluidity and we intently focus every day on improving service from these levels. We also have the resources and capacity needed to make this happen.", "In addition as I mentioned on our last earnings call implementation and testing a positive trend control across a growing number of routes in our network continues to drive part of the negative impact on velocity. For a quick update on PTC, by year end about 60% of the total wrap miles requiring PTC were fully implemented and operational. The western region has been completed. The northern region is near completion and we're well underway on the southern region. With these new regions come a new set of challenges both from a technological and training perspective.", "The team is doing an excellent job troubleshooting and building upon the lessons learned from those locations where PTC has been implemented. We will continue working through these challenges as we progress towards the 2018 PTC deadline. Taking a look at our resources, all in our total operating workforce was down more than 200 employees in the quarter when compared to last year. Our TE&Y workforce was up 6% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily driven by an increase of approximately 600 employees currently in TE&Y training. This is predominantly a timing issue with the six and nine-month lead time required for new hires who becomes service eligible. We've begun refilling the training pipeline to accommodate our resource needs for the coming year.", "Our engineering and mechanical workforce was down more than 800 employees driven by a smaller capital program in 2017 and because our G55 and zero initiatives have resulted in greater labor productivity. As always we will continue to adjust our resources as volume and network performance dictate. Moving onto productivity, although a decline in our velocity in terminal dwell metric did negatively impact productivity in certain areas. I'm pleased with the progress we experienced driving productivity elsewhere. We achieved best ever train size performance in our grain and manifest train categories during the fourth quarter. Marking the tenth consecutive quarter of best ever performance in our manifest network.", "The team also achieved fourth quarter records in our automotive and intermodal train categories and with 2017 complete I'm proud to announce that the team achieved four year records in every single train category. We were also able to generate productivity gains within our terminals as car switched for employee day increased 1% during the fourth quarter.", "Turning to our capital investments, in total we invested about $3.1 billion in our 2017 capital program. For 2018, we're targeting around $3.3 billion pending final approval by our Board of Directors. About 70% of our plan 2018 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace all their assets and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. Our 2018 capital program also includes about 60 new locomotives which will complete our multi-year purchase commitment.", "We also plan to invest some additional $160 million in Positive Train Control. On accumulative basis we still expect to spend approximately $2.9 billion on PTC. Additionally we plan to begin construction of new classification yard in Hearne, Texas. This facility will be named Brazos yard and will help support expected volume growth from our customers in the southern region. We will improve service by decreasing car handlings and car cycle times. It will also be the most efficient hump yard in our rail network with the lowest operating cost. Construction is expected to cost approximately $550 million with operations schedule to begin in 2020.", "To wrap up, looking into 2018 we expect network fluidity to return to normalized levels as we work through PTC implementation and shifting volume growth. We will continue to create productivity opportunities through initiatives, design to increase train length, balance resources and improve assets utilization. With the ultimate goal of enhancing the customer experience and creating value for our shareholders. And we'll continuous driving for positive safety results on a way to an incident-free environment.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.", "Rob Knight", "Thanks and good morning. Let's start with the recap of our fourth quarter results. I want to first remind everyone of a couple of non-cash items impacting the fourth quarter and it's full year 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation passed prior to yearend. As we initially disclosed back on January 9, the fourth quarter includes a non-cash reduction in income tax expense resulting primarily from the revaluation of the company's deferred tax liabilities to reflect the recently enacted 21% federal corporate tax rate. After further analysis of the effects of the tax reform, we have revised this estimate upwards to just over $5.9 billion compared to $5.8 billion that we disclosed in our 8-K filing.", "In addition, we also recognize a non-cash reduction to operating expense of just over $200 million related to income tax adjustments at equity method affiliates. This adjustment is primarily driven by our equity ownership in TTX and is reported in the equipment and other rents line of our income statement. Slide 20 shows our adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 reflecting the impact of these items.", "With that in mind, let's take a look at our core performance in the fourth quarter excluding the impact of the corporate tax reform. Operating revenue was $5.5 billion in the quarter up 5% versus last year. Positive core price, increased fuel surcharge revenue and a 1% increase in volume with the primary drivers of the increase in revenue for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.4 billion up 6% from 2016. Operating income totaled $2 billion a 4% increase from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29 million down $11 million from 2016. Interest expense of $188 million was up 8% compared to the previous year and this reflects the impact of higher total debt balance partially offset by a lower effective interest rate.", "Income tax expense decreased 2% to $676 million. Net income totaled $1.2 billion up 5% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combined to produce adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.53. The adjusted operating ratio was 62.6% up 0.6% points from the fourth quarter of last year. The combined impact of fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a 0.6 point negative impact on the operating ratio in the quarter compared to 2016. Fuel had a neutral impact on our earnings per share year-over-year.", "Freight revenue of just under $5.1 billion was up 5% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $293 million up $106 million when compared to 2016 and up $66 million versus the third quarter of this year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter was a positive 0.5%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand and base chemical shipments partially offset by a decrease in grain carloadings. Core price was about 1.75% in the fourth quarter slightly down from the third quarter. However, if we set coal intermodal aside, our core price was around 2.75% in the quarter. And for the full year as we expected the total dollars that we generated from our pricing actions exceeded our rail inflation cost.", "Turning now to operating expense, Slide 23 provides a summary of our operating expense for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 4% to $1.2 billion versus 2016. The increase was driven primarily by a combination of higher wage and benefit inflation along with higher volume and partially offset by productivity achieved in the quarter. Full year labor inflation came in at about 4%, while overall inflation was approximately 2.5%. Productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce resulted in total workforce levels declining 1.5% in the fourth quarter versus last year or about 625 employees.", "For 2018, we expect force levels to adjust with volume especially with respect to TE&Y workforce that Cam just mentioned. But our overall workforce levels will also reflect ongoing productivity initiatives as well. Fuel expense totaled $547 million up 27% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and 3% increase in gross ton miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate was flat while our average fuel price increased 23% to $2.03 per gallon.", "Purchase services material expense increased 6% to $585 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher cost associated with subsidiary contract services. Turning to Slide 24, depreciation expense was $532 million up 2% compared to 2016. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable asset base including our positive train control assets. For the full year 2018, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 5%. Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $276 million in the quarter which is down 1% when compared to 2016. This excludes the equity income tax adjustment of $212 million that I mentioned earlier.", "Other expenses came in at $239 million up 3% versus last year. The primary driver was an increase in state and local taxes and other expenses partially offset by a decrease in personal injury expense. For the full year 2018, we expect other expense to increase around 10% versus 2017 driven in part by the anticipation of higher state property tax expense resulting from the corporate tax reform changes.", "On the productivity side, our G55 and zero initiatives yielded about $75 million of productivity in the fourth quarter. This brings our full year total to just under $350 million. Slide 26 provides the summary of our 2017 earnings with a full year income statement again excluding the impact of our corporate tax reform. Operating revenue increased about $1.3 billion to $21.2 billion adjusted operating income totaled $7.8 billion, an increase of 8% compared to 2016. And adjusted net income was just over $4.6 billion while adjusted earnings per share were up 14% to a record $5.79 per share.", "Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the full year totaled about $7.2 billion down 4% when compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit in 2017 compared to 2016 which was mostly offset by the increase in net income. Our capital spending program in 2017 totaled around $3.1 billion. Adjusted return on investment capital was 13.7% in 2017 up a full point from 2016 driven primarily by higher earnings. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all in adjusted debt balance totaled about $19.5 billion at year end 2017 up $1.6 billion since the end of 2016. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 19 times. Dividend payments for the full year totaled nearly $2 billion up from just under $1.9 billion in 2016. This includes a 10% increase in our declared dividend per share which occurred in the fourth quarter.", "In addition to dividends, we also bought back 36.4 million totaling $4 billion during the full year 2017. This represents 29% increase over 2016 in terms of dollar spent. In the fourth quarter we bought back 9.2 million shares at a cost of about $1.1 billion. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased over 32% of our outstanding shares. And between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned $6 billion to our shareholders in 2017, which represented 129% of adjusted net income over the same period.", "I want to provide you some commentary on how we believe the new tax law changes will impact Union Pacific in 2018 and beyond. Our federal statutory income tax rate will decline from 35% to 21% all in when you include state taxes, our effective income tax rate will be about 25% and from a cash perspective we expect our 2018 cash tax rate to be between 17% and 18%. This cash tax rate reflects the benefits from the lower federal tax rate and immediate expensing of eligible capital expenditures partially offset by the negative impact of prior year bonus depreciation programs.", "In later years, our cash tax rate will likely trend in the direction of the statutory rate. We expect these changes will result in free cash flow by approximately $1 billion in 2018 and we're still in the process of developing specific plans for the uses of cash in 2018 and as you know these plans including our capital budget must be reviewed and approved by our board. But for now, I can assure you that our basic philosophies and priorities regarding cash allocation and distribution have not fundamentally changed. We will continue to employee a balanced approach to capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases.", "First and foremost, we will approximately invest in the business with an eye on earning adequate returns on capital employed. And as Cam mentioned earlier, we plan to spend around $3.3 billion in capital in 2018 and our guidance of reinvesting around 15% of revenue remains unchanged. At this time, after capital expenditures we will continue returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Looking ahead to 2018 from a fundamentals perspective. We expect volumes in the first quarter and the full year to be up in the low single-digit range. And as Beth commented on earlier, we should see strength in several business categories along with uncertainty in other areas.", "We will price our service product to the value that it represents in the market place from an all in pricing perspective we're confident the dollars we generate from our pricing initiatives should well exceed our rail inflation cost in 2018. As for inflation this year, we expect both labor inflation and overall inflation will be under 2% driven primarily by lower expected health and welfare costs. On the productivity side, we plan to achieve approximately $300 million to $350 million of savings this year as we continue to focus on G55 and zero initiatives.", "To wrap it all up, in addition to the significant incremental cash benefit that we expect as a result of the corporate tax reform. Positive full year volume, positive core price and a significant productivity benefits will all contribute to another year of strong cash generation in an improved full year operating ratio in 2018. We're still focused on our targeted 60% operating ratio plus or minus on a full year basis by 2019 and we're confident in our plans to get there.", "In longer term, we're firmly committed to reaching our goal over 55% operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continue to momentum of our volume pricing and productivity initiatives. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.", "Lance Fritz", "Thank you Rob. As we discussed today we delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results setting the table for 2018. We're optimistic the economy will favor a number of our market segments leading to another year of positive volume growth. Increased unit volume combined with inflation plus core pricing and G55 and zero productivity initiatives should result in another year of revenue growth and improved margins. We'll continue to execute our value track strategy to benefit our employees, partner with the communities we serve, provide our customers with an excellent experience and generate strong returns for our shareholders. With that, let's open up the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Van Kegel", "This is actually Van Kegel on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. Lance, Beth could you just kind of give us post mortem on 2017. Your volume was up around 2% versus the industry up about 4% and your competitor being up 5% and historically UNP haven't seen a lot of growth. Could you just talk through some of the headwinds that maybe we don't appreciate from this year and some of the most compelling market opportunities going forward?", "Lance Fritz", "Sure, Van this is Lance. I'll start with just a very broad overview of 2017 and then turn it over to Beth for more specific market discussion. So you're right, we had about 2% volume growth. You combine that with core pricing growth and are about $350 million in productivity and it generates a record EPS of $5.79 now within that. there are some things that we're particularly proud of that is continued productivity improvement, the ability to get price in some of our markets that are relatively difficult having a franchise that makes us open and accessing to number of markets that are looking pretty sharp and good. And then there are some things that I would say I'm either not happy with or disappointed in and that is, in the second half of the year. We saw our operating kind of service product and overall operating performance slip a bit and that's a place that we're not comfortable in and we're working very hard to remedy as we speak. Beth?", "Beth Whited", "Lance mentioned we're very focused on ensuring that we're generating great value and margins for the company and we're maybe less focused on volume as we end and all be all, so we had great growth, wonderful business that we enjoy in frac sand. We saw coal return in the year overall to levels that are probably a little bit more normalized. We had really strong Ag in the first half not so much in the second half compared to the year before and that's really just a global markets perspective and then on the intermodal side, while our domestic parcel business went gangbusters, we continue to see competitive pricing scenarios in both international and domestic intermodal for most of the year that really dampened our growth potential compared to others. We remained really focused on improving margins in intermodal and so we didn't see maybe the same kind of growth that you saw from others.", "Van Kegel", "Great. And then on just quick follow-up on intermodal. I mean domestic up on and international on two and kind of wanted to strongest global trade environment we're seeing. Could you just give some more context around the drivers behind that and maybe either contract loses or some of the shifts that happen with the streamliners and then what you're doing on the sales and marketing side to maybe improve those outcomes. Thank you.", "Beth Whited", "So as I mentioned we were - we had really strong parcel growth in the last quarter, a lot of that ecommerce driven as you would expect. The domestic market seems to be significantly improving with the tightening of truck availability so I would - we're certainly very hopeful that ends up being a good market for us in 2018, on the international side. We did see some decline in the fourth quarter and I think that is largely due to some shifting from the Pacific Northwest US ports into some of the Canadian ports where you've seen some pretty significant capacity expansion.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Group", "So wanted to ask you Rob about just the pricing metric. I think people surprised that it decelerated this quarter even if you exclude coal intermodal decelerated a little bit. So maybe if you can give us some thoughts on why it decelerated. Beth, I think last quarter you said that the coal intermodal competitive pressure maybe starting to ease a little bit and maybe if you can give us an update there. And then Rob, you talked about inflation - pricing dollars well exceeding in inflation so I think that sounds a little bit better than what you've been saying in the past. Maybe do you have, is that just the inflation dollar amount slowing a lot or do you have confidence that the pricing dollars accelerates this year.", "Rob Knight", "Yes, Scott let me take all that in. first of all you noticed that we changed the refind [ph] if you will and I would say being crystal clear and trying to be as transparent as we possibly can the rounding convention to quarter points here. I would say that if you look at the difference between the just under two, that we reported in our pricing in the third quarter to the 1.75 that we're calling out here in the fourth quarter the difference between the third and fourth quarter is really quite small. So I wouldn't read that there is any pricing actions story to be told between the third and fourth quarter there.", "Stepping back though, just to remind you and I know you, you know this but to remind everybody listening. How we calculate price? And we've been doing this for the 15 years that I've been the CFO and I'm very proud of this. It's a very detailed, analytical approach to what did we actually yield from our pricing action. So it's not representative of same store sales that took place this quarter versus last quarter or last year. it really is how many dollars did we yield from the pricing actions that we took since the last 12 months and how many dollars did we yield this quarter that actually went to the bottom line, so it's not again it's not a same store sales type, remember what we did really take to the bottom line and in the fourth quarter that was 1.75 pricing.", "To your point, if you exclude as we called out in both the third quarter and now in the fourth quarter. If you exclude the coal intermodal where we continue to face some challenges I would say and Beth can perhaps elaborate on the intermodal piece of this. I would say that in the fourth quarter we still face those same challenges. Now as you look forward and Beth can comment on this, as you look forward particularly in the intermodal we're feeling better about that obviously but we're still in the competitive challenges I would say in the coal space and then there is one final comment before I let Beth comment on the intermodal on your question about the well exceeding comment that I made as we look to 2018 and what I'm saying there, is our expectation again remember how we calculate price, it's dollars yielded from the pricing actions that we took and comparing that to the dollars we anticipate expending on inflation, both pieces we think are moving favorably, yes we think inflation overall for 2018 will be lower than 2017, we think it's going overall be under 2% and yes, we do have some optimism as we look forward to 2018 in some of our pricing opportunity. So we believe that gap if you will of the pricing actions and yields from our pricing actions in 2018 versus the inflation dollars will be better in 2018, than it was in 2017.", "Beth Whited", "Yes, just building on what Rob said. My perspective is that, our pricing in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter was not different. We were still seeing opportunities to price and I would say growing opportunities to price on the domestic intermodal side, international intermodal and coal continue to be challenges for us competitively, but we definitely do see that truck availability is tightening in the spot market, how that converts into long-term contracts we'll get more and more opportunity to see as we have bid season coming up in domestic intermodal, but it does feel like the pricing opportunities are flowing.", "Scott Group", "Okay, that's helpful and then Rob, I wanted to just ask you what about just the balance sheet and maybe the rationale for being a single A credit. It doesn't seem like there is any sort of meaningful reduction you're seeing in borrowing cost relative to maybe some of the other rail so, so it doesn't just feel like we're optimizing that the cap structure here and now with all the extra cash flow from tax reform. It would seem to be like there is a pretty dramatic opportunity here to ramp up leverage and then obviously would that really ramp up the buybacks for your shareholders. I know you can't give us like the specific numbers today and maybe that will come in May, but maybe can you just because what I'm saying makes sense to you or is there a reason why you feel like you need to be a single A credit relative to what you used to be.", "Rob Knight", "Scott, duly noted. We totally understand your point and others point on this very issue. I would say that, with the new $1 billion of cash flow opportunity we have, it's frankly high class problem for us to evaluate how this is all going to play out. I know we and everyone including rating agencies are going to be digesting what does all this mean. We're comfortable being we drive towards cash flow measures and we've been comfortable with A rating, but even within that Scott to your point, we think there is a growing opportunity for us to both grow our cash flow from the fundamentals and the benefits of the tax reform act give us additional opportunities and as I stated. I'll reiterate it. We're not changing our philosophy we're going to contuse to be very focused on rewarding our shareholders in addition to spending capital, where the returns are there but we do believe this gives us a high class problem as we look at dividend and share repurchases going forward.", "Scott Group", "Okay, all right. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Ken Hoexter", "Rob, you've been at between 63%, 64% OR for four years now and you noted the workforce that was in your commentary will increase with volumes. Is that a change from growing the workforce but not at a pace with volumes and I guess just thinking about 60% OR does that include the shift in pension income and with the rise in the fuel prices impacting the operating ratio.", "Rob Knight", "Yes Ken I mean your point is duly noted in terms of where we are and we're proud that we've, as you know over the years going from high 80s to the low 60s and we're very focused on getting that 60 and ultimately 55. The math behind why it may have kind of slowed the momentum here in the last couple of years is a lot of moving parts in there. But rest assured, we're very focused on continuing to improve year-over-year and we have to drive incremental margins to get to that 60 plus or minus by 2019. And what it's going to take continue focus on our G55 and zero initiatives which still is turning out stellar productivity numbers. High quality service product enables us to continue to get price in the marketplace. Specifically to your point on headcount that's not really a change. What I said here today on headcount and that is that, it will move with volume but not one for one that is not a change we've kind of had that philosophy now for several years and what I'm saying there, is if volume is up x% I would expect that will require us because we think we're right-sized right now that will require us to bring in additional employees depending on what business it is, what makes it etc., but it's not going to one-to-one because the G55 and zero focus on productivity, we're very confident that headcount will not grow at the same pace that hopefully volume does.", "So it's really a combination of factors, but I take comfort that we're very focused and committed to continue to drive to that 60 plus or minus by 2019.", "Lance Fritz", "Ken, this is Lance just two other observations. One is that training pipeline is going to have to be filled just for attrition purposes. We have what mid to high single-digit percent attrition out of TE&Y workforce every year, so that's going to have to be filled for that purpose. As we look forward into next year in growth. The second thing is, growth is another levers that we focus on in making sure that we're able to drive long-term margin improvement and we're very pleased that we got margin improvement this year.", "Ken Hoexter", "Okay, great thanks. Rob I think I was little confused I thought you were shifting and saying that you're going to one-for-one in the original computation. Thanks for that clarification.", "Rob Knight", "Thank you for the clarification, no I'm not saying that.", "Ken Hoexter", "And then my second one, I guess Lance maybe for you the - we've heard now three other rails move to kind of eliminate it seems like almost all of their hump yards and improved operating performance. Now you're looking to spend maybe $500 million on adding another one. Maybe can you just walk through the cost benefit analysis so we can understand the difference of why you looked to add, when other seem to cutting them.", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, absolutely so let's start from the top. Ken, right we use yards whether it's flat switching yards or hump yards to categorize cars in our manifest network and you know we have a very robust large manifest network. When we determined how we want to get that switching done it's all about how many cars can we aggregate and how deep into the network or somebody else's network we can send them that informs for us. The number of large network yards which are hump yards for us that's all driven by car count versus smaller, regional or local yards which are flat switching yards. The reason why we're building a new hump yard in the middle of Texas is that as we look forward both from the volume that's coming out of the petrochemical complexes along the Gulf Coast. Texas itself and overall manifest growth down in that part of our network. We see that our existing infrastructure is going to be overwhelmed at some point in the future. We're doing everything we can to incrementally improve productivity in those areas. You saw Cameron this morning talk about incremental productivity and car switch for employee. We also look for incremental capital that can be spent in existing network yards, but once that string runs out, we have built new capacity.", "When you think about this specific yard, Brazos. It will be the most productive yard on our network. It will be the lowest cost per car switched and the most efficient. And what we will do is, we'll utilize it again for a lot of that two and from business that's down in the Southeast part of our network and we're pretty confident I would scratch that, very confident that now is the right time to build it and it's the right asset to build.", "Ken Hoexter", "Thanks for the thoughts. Appreciate the time.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.", "David Vernon", "Rob, just real quickly in terms of that 10% growth in the other expense guidance. Could you clarify that a little bit more? It sounds like you guys are doing a lot of work on taking cost to out and yet this other line continues to kind of pop up a little bit. So I'm just wondering kind of what's behind that cost increase there.", "Rob Knight", "Yes, David I mean there's a lot goes into the line item as you know and it includes state and local taxes. The equipment property damage, utilities, insurance I mean environmental. A lot of things going into that so it's one of the hardest if you will to try to nail to the wall is to exactly what that's going to be. Your point is duly noted. On every cost bucket rest assured as part of our G55 and zero initiative though we've got an eye on being as efficient and productive as we can and we got to include the other expense, but our best linking at this point in time largely driven by some of the unknowns around the state and local tax is in that 10% category.", "David Vernon", "Okay and then maybe just you guys have done a phenomenal job in terms of managing upper turns and evaluating new business opportunities based on their reinvestability [ph]. As you think about the lower tax rate sort of maybe changing the math on what is investible, what is not investible. Are there any opportunities where you see you might be able to get a little bit more aggressive in terms of driving some volume growth because of a lower tax rate?", "Lance Fritz", "David this is Lance. The lower tax rate and increased cash flow resulting from it does not change the calculus that we used for the returns that are attractive to our shareholders and for reinvesting in the railroad. So I think the short answer is, just because we have increased cash, it doesn't increase the pool of either projects or markets that are effective to us.", "David Vernon", "I mean I guess the one area that's come up in a couple of conversations with some industry folks is the West Coast intermodal freight where obviously the US rail industry is going to be getting a little bit of tax reform benefit that maybe the Canadian rails aren't and you've seen a bunch of freight diversion of north. Would that maybe impact some of the routing decision in some of those moves or is that just something you guys wouldn't even consider.", "Lance Fritz", "Well so those routing decisions right now as we compete for that business right now is all about the service product, the ultimate cost to the end user and which way they want to go, what's most attractive to them. So we compete aggressively for that today. We'll compete aggressively for it tomorrow. In the context of making sure we generate an attractive return outlook.", "David Vernon", "All right. Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Please proceed with your questions.", "Fadi Chamoun", "On the drill back into the productivity little bit. I mean looking back on 2017, we had a pretty good kind of revenue environment you achieved $345 million of productivity savings, the OR moved 50 basis points. So we're starting 2018 with 300 basis point to improve into your target. So 2019, if you can just kind of walk us through what is going to get better in 2018 and 2019 in order to kind of move the productivity momentum stronger and to get you to your target of 60.", "Lance Fritz", "Let me start with that and then I'll let both Rob and maybe Cam add technicolors [ph] appropriate. So Fadi, the game plan really doesn't change as we look forward. The levers continue to be productivity and we've talked about the amount of productivity we think we can get in 2018 and we're just laser focused on delivering that and then moving into 2019 for the same. We see market opportunity for growth and growth is always our friend in terms of leverage and dropping it to the bottom line and then price of course. The thing that gotten away a little bit for even better results from 2017 is that in the second half of the year, the fluidity of the network eroded to a certain degree in some part that's Positive Train Control and the impact of implementing it aggressively across the network you heard those stats. Part of it candidly was just execution in a certain spots around the network that we have all hands on and attention and I'm confident given that we've got the resources and the capacity that will remedy that. So my expectation is 2019, 60 plus or minus operating ratio is still eminently achievable and we have enough in front of us in activity and projects to make it happen.", "Rob Knight", "Fadi I would just add, don't take anything I'm about to say here as excuses, but just recall notably in the third quarter we did have the hurricane impact, we had the force reduction impact, fuel for the full year was a little bit of headwind, so no excuses but some of those things notably the workforce reduction sizable we'll get the benefits of that more in 2018 where we incurred the cost in 2017 and of course things like the hurricane, which frankly we whether extremely well, those are things that we don't anticipate repeating, other than that it really is just a volume productivity and pricing levers that we're going to continue to pull.", "Fadi Chamoun", "Okay, thanks that's helpful and just one follow-up on the pricing side. International intermodal you said that market can remain very competitive, would attribute that competitiveness to the Canadian ports and the Canadian kind of railroads being more aggressive on the market. Was it US competition like?", "Beth Whited", "Fadi, I would say that we see both things being pretty aggressive. It's pretty aggressive coming out as Pacific Southwest in terms of the pricing challenges and it's pretty aggressive coming on Pacific Northwest which is US railroads and Canadian railroads.", "Fadi Chamoun", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Wetherbee", "I wanted to come back to the OR for a second just thinking about the fourth quarter and them maybe looking out to 2018. But within the fourth quarter, we know fuel was a headwind but it sounds like ex-fuel kind of OR was flattish. We had positive volume, positive price. Just want to get a sense from a 4Q perspective. If there is anything specific in the quarter going on from a cost standpoint. That you felt like maybe it was maybe a little bit one-time and make sure maybe that's recurring and then as you move into 2018 particularly the first half. I mean did those things kind of, are there other cost item that sort of drop away. Do you think you can get OR improvement in the first half of 2018? Just trying to get a sense of sort of how things are trending today.", "Lance Fritz", "Hi, Chris I'll let Rob speak to the details of the fourth quarter financials. But just at a high level. I think we would have been generating a better operating ratio and overall results with a more fluid network. Again there is a number of reasons for that, that Rob outlined that we've talked about this morning and there is no reason to think that that is systemic is anyway. That's a completely resolvable issue.", "Rob Knight", "Lance the only thing I would add and Chris as you know, we are focused on improving our operating gross here in 2018, we're going to stay away from breaking out by quarter or first half versus second half. But [indiscernible] Lance from my perspective there is nothing really unusual, you called out fuel that occurred in the fourth quarter other than our disappointment on the cost side. I mean we frankly admit that there is opportunities and we are very focused on doing better on that and that's the big delta in my mind.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay, all right. And that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then just in the context of sort of pricing and it seems like the industry is getting better pricing gradually in 4Q and then moving forward into 2018 with the potential of the much tighter truck market, how much of your business is sort of available and open for repricing. So how much in other words do you think you can kind of capture what's going on in some of those markets, with contracts that are available to be repriced.", "Beth Whited", "I think we've given guidance previously that roughly two-thirds of our business is under some sort of one year or longer term at any given point in time and then you have things that are under, everything else will be kind of under tariff and available for pricing and then you know of course you get roll off the one year deal, so.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay, so somewhere in the sort of the third range is kind of what the shot on goal is for 2018, maybe a little bit more than that.", "Lance Fritz", "No, so listen to what Beth was just saying, at a moment in time a third is available through tariffs overtime the other two-thirds a portion of that, maybe a fair portion of that is in short-term contract. So as they expire they become available for pricing.", "Chris Wetherbee", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Allison Landry", "I guess just following up on the previous question. If we think about the bid season for trucking and assume that TL contract rates are up in the mid-single digits or high single digits during the bid season. Is it fair to assume that UNP would see a step function increase in price in the second half?", "Beth Whited", "Well as you know, there definitely is a timing of the bid season on the intermodal side in particular and then of course we have other business that's truck competitive as well. so as we go into the bid season in the second quarter, we certainly hope that spot high rates that are happening right now and trucks convert to longer term contract capability, but you're right it won't show up until later in the year.", "Allison Landry", "Okay, all right. And then I know that pricing is been - dead horse during the call, but I wanted to ask about the coal pressure. I know that you mentioned that the pressure was similar in Q4 to what it was in Q3. But if we think about new contracts signed in the second half of the year, was the pressure the same as it was for contracts signed in the first half of the year or was there some sequential easing that happened.", "Beth Whited", "I would say that, we're the pressure in the coal markets remains pretty much the same.", "Allison Landry", "Okay, so from the first half to the second half, it was the same.", "Beth Whited", "Yes.", "Allison Landry", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.", "Bascome Majors", "I wanted to focus on few of the CapEx budget items and how they might trend beyond 2018. Specifically the $460 million or so for locomotive equipment that you said this was the last year of your purchase commitment on locomotives. The 160 for PTC since we're at the tail end of that and the 445 that you allotted the capacity investment which seems to be up almost $200 million year-over-year and I'm assuming that's related to the Brazos project that you talked about earlier, but can you just give us sense for how some of those moving parts might move into 2019 and beyond, it would be helpful. Thanks.", "Rob Knight", "I'll probably disappoint you, not getting into quite the level of detail that you're asking and let me just start out by reiterating that our guidance for the long-term is 15% of revenue and as I think you and everyone knows, that's not how we build our capital plan, but that still is a good way of thinking about what we're thinking here as to what the overall expenditures will be when you add it all up. Some of the moving parts so that I will call out. Yes, this is the last year's as Cam pointed out, this is last of our long-term commitment on buying locomotives, so we'll take 60 locomotives this year and we don't have plans at this point in time to take any more locomotives beyond that. We will still have some capital expenditures that go into locomotive programs etc. in there. So the number will come down, but it won't go to zero in our locomotive line PTC.", "Clearly once that's up and running and behind us that number will change. It will go down to probably not zero in the near term, but it will go down as it has dramatically from where it started and beyond that again, so we just talk about Brazos being an opportunity where we're making an investment because we're confident the returns are there. And that's how we look at all investments, so you're right there is some pieces coming down and other than Brazos we're not saying it's necessarily going to be backfilled dollar for dollar, but our guidance at this point in time to kind of answer your question is still at 15% of revenue look.", "Bascome Majors", "I appreciate that color there. Just one more question someone earlier mentioned that the training pipeline will have to be filled to start to backfill some attrition based on the growth you expect over the next few years. Where is the TE&Y pipeline today and can you help size us how many hirers you might need to get that pick where you like it to be?", "Lance Fritz", "Bascome, I don't know we'll give you exact numbers, but I think Cameron can give you a sense for how we're thinking about it.", "Cameron Scott", "For the attrition that Lance mentioned earlier in the meeting, we have filled the pipeline appropriately to meet that attrition and some of the growth that has been highlighted for the southern region and we feel like that's time to pretty accurately. There will be a few additional hirers filtration in the locomotive and engineering side, but we think we've got that pipeline filled appropriately.", "Lance Fritz", "The operating team and we haven't received any questions about this morning, but it was a pretty start [ph] number. They've done a tremendous job on the engineering and mechanical side of achieving productivity both in central operations and in our distributed operations that are throughout the network and I anticipate there is even more opportunity there as we look into 2018 and beyond.", "Bascome Majors", "Great. Thank you for the time this morning.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.", "Tom Wadewitz", "I'll start with one on the cost side. I guess when you talk about inflation I know that probably doesn't map precisely to total operating expense growth, but obviously some broad relationship in the way we model that. you're talking about 2% or less in inflation and on the high side you get the 5% rise depreciation 10% and other expense so, what would be the categories of operating expenses that would be less than 2% and we ought to model at kind of pulling that overall number down to 2% and if I'm thinking about it wrong tell me that, but just want to know where we should model, maybe favorable OpEx items on the P&L. thanks.", "Rob Knight", "Tom, again I'll probably disappoint in terms of giving you the precise line items that you're asking, but I would just start out by saying, every cost bucket we're looking at opportunities to squeeze out efficiency and manage the cost. You've got your comp line, which again I called out that line overall should be less than 2% on the inflation side of the house. You look at rents I mean that's another category where we're hopeful of continuing to manage that effectively, but just and I know you know this. But just to kind of reiterate, when we less than 2% of course we're talking about inflation, the actual cost that flow through the income statement will largely be driven by what volume we actually enjoy and so volume costs albeit not one for one and all the efficiencies that we expect to squeeze out of that will clearly fill up on the line items as well, but as it relates to inflation. I call out I guess comp and rents of two lines that might be lower than overall average.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Okay and then, I know this has been a big topic on the call, but just headroom in pricing as well. how do you think about, like I think about the eastern rails is having more sensitivity to truck market so their pricing is kind probably going to move a little bit more close to the related to the rise in truck. How much of your book do you think is pretty sensitive to truck market, how much do you think that can flow through to help pricing. It seems like the truck markets are super, super tight and that it's kind of hard to resolve your cautious comments on price with that really tight truck market. How do we think about how much sensitivity you have to truck, what parts of the book or how much is the book overall?", "Beth Whited", "We do have several markets that are very truck competitive, intermodal being one of them. Lumber, I think you probably saw the article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday that called out Reefer capability as being very tight right now and we participate in that to obviously lower volume for us, but we do have exposure to that and then of course we serve a lot of bulk markets that aren't as likely to be truck competitive. So when we put all that kind of together in the mixer and we think about what's happening there, we do see that there is a potential for us to have the opportunity to participate with some higher pricing in these markets that are truck competitive. The caution I give you is that, we are continuing to see quite a bit of competitive pressure in big books of business like international intermodal and coal.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Okay, so you want to put a number around it, like 20%, 30%, 40%.", "Beth Whited", "Rob will not let me tell you a number.", "Rob Knight", "Various categories, but we're going to stay clear of giving up precise point on that.", "Tom Wadewitz", "Yes, okay. Thanks for the comments.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question.", "Jason Seidl", "Well let me drag the horse out again, guys. Let me look at it at a different way, so obviously you're saying modest sequential decline and what you report as core price or essentially the same as the previous quarter. When you look at the contracts that you've signed this year or maybe late last year would those be above that core rate that you posted in the fourth quarter. so something similar to one of your competitors reported north of the border [ph].", "Beth Whited", "We really don't talk about individual deals when we do this, we have a very purist mentality about how we calculate price. We are looking at the yields and so one thing you might want to think about is, it really kind of depends on what's going on in your book of business, right. So mix can be very important and the fourth quarter we had the virtually the same price as what we got in the third quarter and we had a lot of changes in that mix of business. So it matters in the way that we calculate price. We still feel good about the pricing that we're getting we're going to take advantage of the opportunities we have as these spot truck rates firm we hope into longer term capability to price there. And as I've mentioned like a few times it feels like a bunch, we still see headwinds in some of our big books international, intermodal and coal being two, I would call out for you.", "Jason Seidl", "Your description of firming at least intrigues me to some extent because what we're seeing in the marketplace on the spot side is really strong price increases and a lot of people talking about potential contractual increases, somewhere between 6% and 10% on the truckload side. Are you guys seeing something different because I would categorize at a strong rate increases is not firming, if you will.", "Lance Fritz", "Jason, this is Lance. We would love for the current truck pricing environment to continue all the way through bid season next year as a potential that it does and it's a great environment for us to be out in the market place pursuing business and repricing business. So I think that's probably the sum total of what we want to say about truck pricing.", "Jason Seidl", "My follow-up is on Mexico, could you talk a little bit about the total exposure in terms of traffic direct from you guys and then maybe any interchange as well as, do you feel that there's been any increase in shipping to and from Mexico ahead of any potential issues with NAFTA.", "Lance Fritz", "I'll take that Jason. So our Mexico business is about 11%, maybe a little bit more of our overall book. We enjoy about 70% of that business to and from Mexico that's shipped by rail and we've not seen anybody's behaviour in our served markets changing pending NAFTA. Having brought up NAFTA of course we're keeping a very close eye on current negotiations, you know we're in the penultimate negotiation up in Montreal. So they're down to the really difficult parts of the deal that need to be negotiated and while I still believe there is a good opportunity for the NAFTA agreement to be solidified, all three parties continue in it going forward. We've got a strong eye on all the what if's and contingency plans and agility to react to whatever would happen.", "Jason Seidl", "Okay, that's good color. Listen, everyone I appreciate the time as always.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt Russell with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.", "Matt Russell", "Just going back to the productivity program and particularly in the context of the current cycle. Is there any trade off here where you think you'll capture less of the volume or the pricing upside and the cycle, just given you have this longer term focus on productivity.", "Lance Fritz", "I'll take a stab at that. so when we think about productivity we don't view that as a trade-off for price and volume productivity to a fair degree is in our control and things that we are consuming, paying for, organized for, in order to provide an excellent customer service which allows us to price in the market place. So I don't think we see it as a trade-off like that.", "Matt Russell", "Okay and just to go back to one of your follow-ups to David's question on capital investment. I would think that the return on any project that you were considering on a previous tax reform would previously tax [indiscernible] would improve here tax and cash flow that are low rate, the immediate depreciation. I guess why wouldn't that increase the pool of investments that will be attractive to you and is it just a factor of even after you adjust for those returns, [indiscernible] hurdle rate.", "Rob Knight", "Matt this is Rob. I would say clearly yes, that's a positive tax reform is a positive in that calculus. What we were saying and Lance addressed earlier is that alone is not going to cause us to, it's not like we have a bunch of pent up capital projects that were sitting on the sidelines just waiting for that extra couple of points have been improving on the ROI and by the way I would remind that we're improving or increasing our capital spend in 2018 versus s2017, so it's all in the mix of things but it's not like to ask opening a floodgate of additional investment that was pent up sitting on the sideline.", "Lance Fritz", "Matt, but so let's take a step back and take a little broader perspective of this tax reform. We do believe and we hear from our customers and our markets that tax reform fundamentally makes the United States more competitive both for direct investment whether it's foreign direct investment or domestic investment and for competing it with either import goods or for export goods. So from our perspective we believe the tax reform will result in more opportunity for us over the longer term which should result in more opportunity for us to invest and to grow and to hire. But that's the string that we see happening basically it will affect the competitiveness of the markets that we serve and then that will drive incremental investment opportunity and incremental hiring opportunity.", "Matt Russell", "Makes a lot of sense, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Ravi Shanker", "Just one straggler here. There's been a change in Canadian grain regulation that potentially allows US rail to maybe access some of that market. Do you see that as an opportunity for you guys?", "Beth Whited", "The change doesn't impact Union Pacific in particular, we do participate in some of the Canadian grain market that would come across desk from one of the Canadian railroads and go to export, but we don't see that - this change in the regulation materially changing anything for us.", "Ravi Shanker", "Got it and just a follow-up on the frac sand market. You said the second half of the year is likely to be challenging given the emergence of some local alternatives. What's your game plan there? I think you guys can [indiscernible] to kind of make your business more competitive or help make white sand more competitive versus brown sand to kind of help defer that impact.", "Beth Whited", "The reason that the brown sand is really emerging is because the logistics cost are so substantial coming from with constant in Minnesota and while there could be fringe markets that you can help make that worse, it doesn't seem like that's solvable by us. However I do think that there are other markets, other shale plays where white sand is desirable that will continue to emerge, so it's not just the Permian there's Eagle Ford, there's the Oklahoma markets are pretty hot you're seeing investment happening in the DJ Basin and Colorado as well.", "Lance Fritz", "And we're pursuing participation in the local markets to the extent that makes sense as well.", "Ravi Shanker", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.", "Justin Long", "I wanted to ask about incremental margins as the fourth quarter was lighter than what we've typically seen in this type of environment, was there anything outside of the fluidity issues you've mentioned that drove this and as we look into 2018, what's your confidence incremental margins can return to levels that are 50% plus?", "Rob Knight", "Justin, you're right on I mean as I pointed out earlier. We were not happy with our performance in the fourth quarter on couple of measures and that showed up in the incremental margins, but it was fully explained by some of the fluidity challenges that Lance and Cam addressed earlier. So there is nothing other behind the scenes on that. and as we look to get to our 60 plus or minus by 2019 we've got annually run in 50% to 60% incremental margin range and that's our focus and we understand that and we're confident in our ability to get there.", "Justin Long", "That's helpful and Lance, you mentioned a couple of times earlier that operating performance did flip in the second half and I wanted to ask if you could address when you think the network can get back to normal fluidity this year and what are the specific action items that are necessary to see this recovery.", "Lance Fritz", "Yes, I'll just briefly take a stab at that question and ask Cameron to provide more. We won't put date certain on when we think the network is \u201cback to normal\u201d. My expectation is, it happened sooner as opposed to later. This isn't something that I think we wait around and see what happens in the first and second quarter. I mean we're actively working on the handful of issues that we need to address and Cameron maybe you want to talk about those specifics.", "Cameron Scott", "Velocity at this particular time is so being impacted as we implement PTC in Chicago, in Kansas city and Houston that's really the last series of implementation that we've ahead of us. There are always challenges when we implement and those big network industrialized heavy areas and we'll work out way through this. We're shipping quickly from implementing PTC to problem solving PTC which requires a technical team to continue to problem solve and that really a human design team to help people become more familiar and try to adapt to the technology that we've asked them to use as they're running trains. So we'll continue to work that throughout 2018 and there are really no other critical issues that's impeding velocity other than that.", "Lance Fritz", "So we've got couple of discrete kind of execution areas that we've got to pick up on but the good news from my perspective is, we got all the resources we need, we got the right team and they're focused on the right stuff. So we - so I expect this to happen sooner not later.", "Justin Long", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "First following up on the PTC comments. You said you're going to the big metropolitan areas. Cam, if you can give us a guesstimate last quarter on how much PTC implementation shaved off velocity for the network so that would be helpful. And as you look ahead to beyond 2018 in the next couple of years, what's your early sense of the other rails, interoperability and is that going to be another potential challenge for rolling out this system after the first couple legs going through here now.", "Cameron Scott", "During the previous earnings call we estimated half of mile an hour to a mile an hour and that still looks like to be a very solid estimate, somewhere in that range. And as we mentioned some of that, as we troubleshoot, problem solve and train our employees will be recovered. You do highlight the challenge for the entire industry which is ahead of us, which is the interoperability, which we've all been working very closely with each other all along. I don't believe there will be any issues with executing that. it is little bit of unknown. We have yet to marry up with BNSF or Norfolk Southern or CN or CP and really run each other's products on each other's railroads that's ahead of us here this year.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Okay and their specific time on when you start to cross tracks or link up the systems as you mentioned.", "Cameron Scott", "I'll give you one example that is time certain if you think about Metra. Being a specific Metro in Chicago that cut over with each other is going to be this July.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Okay, thank you. And Lance just one quick one for you if I could. On just trade flows globally we've seen some news on tariffs being increased but on the flipside we've got a weaker dollar just been down I think 4%, 5% since you last reported earnings. So just what are you hearing from some of the bigger customers, bigger accounts and what's your view on kind of the upside and downside with potentially more tariffs but offset by what could be a continual weaker dollar which will be a pretty nice tailwind for you and for the industry in general.", "Lance Fritz", "Brian, thanks for that question. There's a lot of moving parts as regards to trade and trade is pretty important to us of course. First we need consumer in the United States to feel optimistic and feel wealthy so that they consume stuff, build homes etc. and that looks like it's set up pretty well as long as the risk and global environment don't kind of overwhelm that optimism. Right now consumers are saying they're pretty optimistic and we see wages starting to increase and they feel pretty wealthy. The second thing that needs to happen is we've got to have open markets and free and fair trade and more open markets is better.", "While there is some rhetoric that isn't helpful to that, as we're negotiating NAFTA and as the administration observes other trade relationships as of yet. I've not seen it significantly negatively impact markets that we serve nor in conversations with my counterparts in those markets. Are they saying it's fundamentally changing their behaviour at this point? So there is a lot to pay attention to, now that it's, I think the power of tax reform is it almost can't be overstated to some degree. You think about this, every product produced in the United States that has any kind of supply chain to it, all along the way suppliers build in a 35% tax rate historically that drop in 21% fundamentally alters the landscape for cost of goods sold coming out of the United States and at the same time it makes us very attractive, more attractive for capital investment. All of that is positive for railroads.", "And so I think in the net we're cautious and we're deliberate and diligent on all the moving parts, but I think there is a pretty fair chance that it turns out positive as oppose to negative.", "Brian Ossenbeck", "Okay, thanks Lance. Cameron appreciated.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.", "Amit Mehrotra", "First one is on the share repurchase, the company committed to 30 million I guess share buyback clip through 2020 back in 2016, you ran a little bit above 20% that rate last year by repurchasing a little more than 36 million shares. Now we have tax reform the share price is up more than 50%, since that target was announced. So just given all those factors moving parts can we assume maybe a bit of a cooling off on the pace of buybacks given those factors and also are you still committed to repurchase your 120 million shares by 2020 from the 2017 date. Thank you.", "Rob Knight", "Amit this is Rob. We don't straight line our repurchases. It's - we're opportunistic in terms of the pricing and the opportunity and we will continue to operate that way. But I wouldn't take, I wouldn't interrupt anything that we've said or what the benefits of the $1 billion of additional cash flow from the tax to imply that we will slow down the pace of share repurchases I wouldn't look at it that way and we were still working through all the details of that, but we think it gives us a greater opportunity on dividends and share repurchases frankly.", "Amit Mehrotra", "So the 120 million targets in terms of share, if it's still very much intact maybe even, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but maybe even some upward bias to that, given the inflows and the tax reform.", "Rob Knight", "I think we're still on track, we're still on track for that.", "Amit Mehrotra", "Okay, one other quick one for me and I don't mean to nit-pick on the core pricing, but I just wanted to be crystal clear on the movement as you move from 3Q to 4Q. you did talk about rounding and offering kind of that 1.75% number in the fourth quarter down from 2%. I just wanted to see was that 2% rounded. Again I'm not trying to nit-pick here but I just want to be clear, was it 2.00% or 1.8% or 2.05% any color there so we're just - we're on the same page in terms of that.", "Rob Knight", "Yes fair point, Amit. And as I said earlier, if you recall in the third quarter I said our pricing when you look at what we yield in the third quarter with just under two, then we refined our convention in terms of the routings. So I would say again the story is not the big change from the third to the fourth quarter and it's probably in the 10 or two tenths kind of range in terms of the way the math flew, so it's not a full quarter of point different.", "Amit Mehrotra", "But the and the mix shifts that impacted, the headline number, I would just imagine would probably accelerate over the next 12 months in terms of the coal intermodal volume. So I know you talked about I guess in response to one of the previous questions that 50% to 60% is obviously the walk to get to your long-term target, but how do incremental margins get to accelerate from kind of back half of the year, when some of the mixed challenges accelerate in 2018.", "Cameron Scott", "Amit, I don't think we really talked in detail about mixed challenges. What we were referring or trying to refer to is that mix is a significant contributor to what happens sequentially quarter-to-quarter to pricing. And if you look at incremental margin which we only really talk to for purposes of kind of illustrating full year, last year was something like mid-60s. the fourth quarter was something like high 30s, right. So the fourth quarter from our perspective was all about fluidity and some incremental cost like little elevated recruise, some little elevated overtime, little elevated [indiscernible] more equipment than we would need normally all adding up expense that need to be there.", "Amit Mehrotra", "Got it. Okay. All right that makes sense. Thank you for taking my questions. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.", "Ben Hartford", "I just to come back to service real quickly Lance and Cameron. When you with clears the economic outlook has improved the truck market is tighter. There were some headwinds across the rail space noted in the back half of the year that presented challenges to service you talked about the PTC. And I think Lance you said you expect improvement for the year sooner rather than later, but what in your mind is the biggest risk to service improvement historically would suggest that it's accelerating volume growth across the rail network and I think that's clearly a bias here as we started the year, but it's also well telegraphed. So is it the macro and if not then what is in your mind the biggest risk to incremental service improvement during the course of 2018.", "Lance Fritz", "Sure. I'll start and then turn it over to Cameron. I'll call it a service blip that was reflected in our fourth quarter again is not systemic. Historically when we would get into really difficult times, we get behind the resource curve for locomotives TE&Y other labor and it's really hard to catch up in those environments, it takes quite some time given the lead time, the kind of amount of time it takes to get incremental resources back into the network. We're not anywhere near place like that. we've got 800 or 1,000 locomotive stored. We've got a pipeline full of TE&Y that makes sense to us. So it's not that stuffed.", "From this point going forward service will be about maybe some weather shocks that's always a possibility and making sure we navigate through Positive Train Control effectively that we're problem solving, things that are getting in the way of us being fluid and doing that rapidly. Cam?", "Cameron Scott", "To answer your volume question, which is a good one. Northern region looks sound, western region looks very sound. This really about the State of Texas and very positive growth not only this year but the next several years and that is what is Brazos is meant to address. Plus if you looked under the hood of where we're spending our capacity dollars, it is all pointed at Texas. So we have the right capacity projects pointed at growth to take care of the southern region.", "Ben Hartford", "Okay, that's great. Thank you. And the rather quick follow-up on the other income line item as you looked to 2018, in any direction relative to 2017 on an absolute basis.", "Rob Knight", "Good question, Ben. Because 2017 was an unusually higher year if you remember the third quarter we had couple of larger transactions Kinder Morgan, Seabrook which we called out. So as we looked to 2018 a normal year is closer to call it $150 million range plus or minus rather than you know call it $300 million that we had this year.", "Ben Hartford", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question is from the line of [indiscernible] with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I just wanted to ask a quick one on network performance. Despite mentioning the transportation plan adjustments and I was just wondering if you could clarify whether that was intended to indicate that adjustments to plan impacted network velocity in Q4 or that you intend to make changes to the plan to improve network velocity.", "Lance Fritz", "We always take Beth's forecast and drop it into a model and take a look at a couple basic questions surrounding T plan, whether or not we have enough T plan to offload our terminals and we make adjustments as necessary. So we'll be watching that particularly down on the southern region. Again it's not really a western region or northern region exercise it is focused on the southern region.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. That's all from me. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'll now turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.", "Lance Fritz", "Great. Thank you. And thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific.
