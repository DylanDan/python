My name is Yolanda, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.", "And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, please begin, sir.", "Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available on our website supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide on this call, we will focus on the highlights.", "With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you, Mark. And thank all of you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. You know, it's a very exciting time to be in the Construction Materials business. We have great momentum, and we are as well-positioned as I've ever seen us and we're looking forward to a strong year in 2017 and looking past 2017. Our foundation for sustained growth is as strong as I've ever seen it in my 27 years with the company. Our fourth quarter results didn't match up with the prior year's fourth quarter, which was exceptionally strong in a tough comp. This comparison was affected in a large part because of an earlier end to the construction season in 2016, and also due to continued volume weakness in our California, Illinois and coastal Texas businesses.", "With the exception of these three areas, fourth quarter aggregate shipments were relatively strong compared to 2015. October-November shipments exceeded the prior year's strong comps, before falling off in the second half of December. This is even with a slowdown in new construction starts during the election cycle with its related uncertainty. Lower shipments volumes and production brought lower fixed cost absorption. At the same time, we made the right investments to support the increasing production we see coming in 2017. These basic and necessary investments to support growth in repair and maintenance and stripping, along with variances in end of the year accounting accruals negatively impacted our unit margins.", "But stepping back and looking at the full year and our underlying performance trends, what you see is continued compounding improvements in our execution, our service to customers, and in our profitability. We are of the strong view that we are in a long, multi-year recovery where we will continue to build our profitability, our franchise and deliver for our shareholders, our customers and our people. In fact, a longer recovery will enhance profitability as we benefit from further improvements in unit margins, pricing and operating leverage.", "Here's what we delivered in 2016. 16% growth in adjusted EBITDA, 22% growth in adjusted EBIT, 90% growth in net earnings and 24% growth in cash provided by operations. These numbers reflect our continued success in making meaningful improvements to our underlying profitability, that includes 7% growth in aggregate freight-adjusted average selling prices in 2016, and 14% growth in aggregates gross profit per ton, a record level. We also saw further improvements in asphalt and concrete material margins and a 280 basis point gain in total company gross profit margin, and we achieved important pricing and unit margins across nearly all of our markets. Our 2016 results set us up nicely for 2017 and beyond. Our assets are positioned extremely well to serve the continued recovery in materials demand.", "The pricing climate remains constructive. Our operating disciplines will enable us to grow margins faster than pricing, and we have the financial strength and flexibility to grow, while at the same time returning capital to shareholders. Combining our strong cash generation and incremental debt capacity, we may have approximately $5 billion to either invest for growth or return to shareholders between now and return to mid-cycle shipment levels. I'll comment more on M&A later in the call. Let me just say now that I like what I see with the acquisitions landscape, and our disciplined pursuit of these opportunities. Now, we faced some volume changes \u2013 challenges in 2016 that I don't expect to repeat this year. You might simply say that we should face easier comparisons later in the year, but let me briefly touch on a few examples.", "In Texas, our aggregate shipments were down 10% year-over-year given several large project delays and prolonged bad weather. However, shipments in Texas began to strengthen in the fourth quarter. With our North and South Texas areas running ahead of last year's strong pace, we expect volume growth in Texas in 2017. California continue to lag expectations, although we began to see improvements in shipments in some markets, along with continued improvements in pricing. California's failure to address its declining transportation infrastructure in 2016 along with deferred construction on a number of large non-residential projects contributed to the low in our California business. Recent trends suggest those factors will change in 2017. We expect California like Texas to grow in 2017. Illinois also continued to lag, but not at the same pace of decline and pricing was strong. We believe that our Illinois business will hold steady in 2017.", "The remainder of our business showed strong growth in 2016, on the order of approximately 10% aggregate shipment growth and 6% pricing growth in total. For the most part, we expect that momentum \u2013 the momentum to continue throughout 2017. For example, look at important markets in the Southeast, which enjoyed robust double-digit growth in 2016. South Carolina volume was up 17%, Florida volumes grew by 15%, and Georgia was up 20%. By the way, all of these markets should see double-digit volume gains again in 2017. John will walk us through our expectations for 2017 in a moment. But the bottom line is that we expect another strong year, on track with our longer term, our longer range goals, a year with growth in adjusted EBITDA of approximately 15% to 25%. So we are excited about 2017 and we're excited about the business well beyond 2017.", "As I look across our markets, the foundation is in place for an extended recovery, with growth in public construction spending just beginning to join the growth we have been seeing in private construction. And while I'm encouraged by the attention we see the Federal Government giving to sustain investment in our nation's infrastructure, our views regarding an extended recovery and demand are grounded in what's happening right now. In the November election, continuing a nationwide secular trend, ballot measures passed in Los Angeles County, San Francisco, Greater Atlanta, and South Carolina added $1.7 billion annually in infrastructure spending in these markets.", "Other states are poised for action this year. In California, work is progressing quickly in the Senate and Assembly with support from the Governor to increase transportation funding by $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Tennessee and South Carolina also have announced new highway funding proposals that stand a good chance of being enacted this year. So, the momentum continues to build. Voters across the country are demanding that something be done to catch up on decades of underinvestment in public infrastructure.", "The LA County measure passed with 70% of the vote. That's voters passing a tax increase on themselves, and nationwide, 74% of state and local ballot measures calling for transportation improvements passed during the 2016 election season. Now, certainly more is needed. Federal investment is, in physical infrastructure, as a percentage of GDP is at 0.5%, lower than it's been in decades, and far below levels of investment and \u2013 or in other developed nations. But notwithstanding the need for significant new investment, the foundations for a sustained and extended recovery demand are already in place, and there is no construction materials company in the United States that is better positioned to take advantage of that ongoing recovery than Vulcan.", "Now I'll hand it off to John to walk you through our 2017 outlook. Then I'll close by addressing our M&A activities and other investments in growth. John?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. As you saw outlined in our release, our performance expectations for 2017 line up with the business's trajectory since the second half of 2013, when the recovery in our part of the economy began, as well as with the longer range goals we've discussed previously. To give you a bit more color, I'll check through some of the expectations underpinning our guidance range of $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion in adjusted EBITDA. And I'll provide some comments regarding the timing in what could be a back-half-loaded year with uneven quarterly comparisons.", "I'll start with aggregate shipments, where we anticipate volume of between 190 million and 196 million tons or between 5% and 8% growth over 2016. Consistent with the preliminary outlook we shared during our September Investor Meeting in Atlanta, we expect year-over-year shipment growth across all end-use segments, residential, private non-res, public transportation and other public infrastructure and in nearly all of our geographic units.", "Construction materials demand continues to recover and to recover broadly. Longer-term project pipelines, what has been called the water behind the dam, continues to build. As it relates to our ultimate 2017 shipments, the key question may not be around demand per se, but rather around the pace at which the end-to-end construction sector can move to meet that demand. The recent improvement in construction starts we have seen serves as a positive leading indicator, particularly for the second half of the year. However, we still see constrained construction capacity for certain types of jobs in certain geographies. This uncertainty regarding shipment timing drives our wider range regarding 2017 tonnage.", "As Tom noted, the overall pricing climate remains positive. For aggregates pricing, we see a gain in freight adjusted average selling prices of between 5% and 7%. Price increases announced for our fixed plant customers have generally been well-received. The momentum in aggregates pricing reflects the confidence market participants have in the sustained recovery, as well as the continued focus by material producers on earning adequate returns on capital. It also reflects a number of construction markets that are effectively supply constrained in the short term, similar to the pricing dynamics that you see in housing, for example.", "To the extent improved product mix balances, including higher sales rates for fines and base material, negatively impacts reported average selling prices, it should also improve total cash flows. In other words, it would be a good thing. Again, we expect unit margins in our Aggregates segment to expand faster than the rate of pricing growth. For our Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segments, we expect gross profit growth of approximately 15% in total, driven primarily by volume recovery and improving material margins in concrete. We do not expect the recent growth in SAG expenses to repeat in 2017. The SAG increase in 2016 over 2015 was driven primarily by incentives tied to the company's financial performance and stock price, certain investments in sales and customer service capabilities, as well as elevated legal and other outside service expenses.", "Operating and maintenance CapEx for 2017 should be approximately $300 million. This figure includes some carryover from 2016, during which time our expenditures were approximately $250 million as compared to our original guidance of $275 million. These figures exclude our internal growth capital investments, such as opening of new rail yards, railcars or our Panamax-class ships. All in all, we expect another year of strong growth in net earnings, EBITDA and cash provided by operations amidst what for now appears to be an extended recovery in demand in materials shipments. We will persist with our focus on continuous compounding improvements in safety, in our operating performance, in our unit margins, and in our capital productivity. We've entered 2017 in a very strong financial position. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged from those discussed previously, and we're in a position to balance reinvestment in our current franchise, M&A and other growth capital investments, and returning capital to shareholders.", "Now, before handing it back over to Tom, I'd like to offer a few thoughts regarding the timing of revenue and earnings growth throughout the year. We don't give quarterly guidance, as you know, nor do we intend to. However, we do want to remind you that 2017 growth, especially on a quarterly year-over-year comparison basis, could be weighted toward the last three quarters or perhaps even the second half of the year. We expect our shipment momentum to build throughout the year as FAST Act funds begin to drive new construction activity, and as the recent improvement in construction starts begins to impact our business with its typical lag.", "In addition, and I know this is hardly news to most of you listening, the business faces tougher comparisons in the beginning of the year than it does later in the year. For example, last year's first quarter saw a 17% increase in aggregates volume over the prior year, driven by unusually favorable weather and exceptionally strong large project shipments. And in contrast, the fourth quarter of 2016 was obviously not nearly as strong. Per these examples, we continue to encourage investors to focus on longer-term trends in order to understand the performance and value of the business. And from our perspective, those key trends, multiple years of volume recovery, a positive pricing climate, strong operating leverage, and accelerating growth in free cash flows remain substantially unchanged.", "Tom, back over to you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks, John. At Vulcan, we've moved into 2017 with a great deal of confidence. Our business has come a long way over the last three years, and we intend to maintain that momentum. 2016, a year where we grew EBITDA by 16% on only a 2% gain in aggregates shipments really sets us up for a year that won't see the same volume headwinds. Certainly we are encouraged by the discussions taking place regarding infrastructure investment and corporate tax reform. The country needs these changes. Vulcan's working families need these changes, and yes, Vulcan shareholders also stand to benefit. We have the wind at our back. Our job, internally, as always is to focus on what we can control to serve our customers extraordinarily well, to operate safely and efficiently, and to deliver better and better returns from the capital that we deploy.", "At Vulcan, we're not satisfied with tailwinds. We're going to raise our internal expectations. We're going to raise our disciplines and our intensity another notch. We're not waiting for National Policy improvements to make our own business better. That's our job, and that's the job we're going to do. If we do that, we'll help our country grow and regain a competitive edge. We'll create jobs and opportunity for our people and we'll be even better positioned to grow for many years to come. Now, on the topic of growth and in particular acquisition-led growth, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on the M&A landscape as we see it today and our approach to it. You likely saw a number of recent bolt-on acquisitions referenced in our press release.", "This may appear to be a pickup in activity after a period of relative quiet. But I'll tell you, we've been working hard on this all along, and we'll continue to work hard on it. The acquisitions noted in our release represent attractive additions to our positions in markets ranging from Nashville, to Dallas, to Albuquerque. In each instance, we're not only getting bigger, but we're also improving our capabilities to service our customers efficiently and effectively. John noted that we have the financial strength to invest for growth while maintaining the overall flexibility and resilience of our balance sheet. We're first and foremost going to maintain discipline and how we use our financial strength, but I expect you'll continue to see bolt-on acquisitions.", "These will add to our already strong organic growth trajectory and to the lasting value of our market positions over the long-term. And of course, acquisitions aren't the only growth investments we make. During 2016 for example, we invested in five new rail yards in markets such as Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina. So to wrap up, I'll note again that these are exciting times at Vulcan Materials. We're facing an extended recovery with the impact of the FAST Act just beginning to kick in. We're seeing a significant pickup in state and local transportation funding across our footprint.", "The pricing climate for our products remains constructive, and we're going to realize further profit margin improvements with multiple years of continued growth ahead. In addition, we enjoy the financial strength to pursue smart bolt-on acquisitions and other growth investments while also prudently returning capital to shareholders. Add to all of this, the potential for meaningful corporate tax reform and a sustained increase in infrastructure investment, I think it's easy to see why we are very excited about our future at Vulcan.", "And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Certainly. And we'll go first to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, good morning. Congratulations on a very strong 2016. I was hoping you could just step me through the bridge in terms of the sequence of shipments from October, November, December because you guys sounded pretty bullish, I think, on your last update from November 3. And I was also hoping you could kind of give us a bridge on gross profit margin? I think John called out a couple items that affected fixed cost absorption like the timing of repair and maintenance work and stripping expenses, and whether those are like one-time costs that pertain to the quarter or whether kind of a normal incremental profitability that you guys generate will be visible as we move into the new year?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah Bob, it's Tom. I'll start first with the \u2013 how we saw volumes in the fourth quarter. October and November were actually from a rates \u2013 from a shipping rates perspective, were ahead of the prior year and going very strong. The bottom line through it, at least ran out of \u2013 we ran out of time on the construction season. In 2015, we were able to ship all the way to the end of the year. And depending on the market second week, first week, third week of December we just \u2013 the season ended, and it just \u2013 that's what caught us. So I think the demand going forward is there. We're confident in 2017. The works there, in fact, was really exciting. It's going to be when the construction season starts up and who knows when that's going to be. But when it does, we'll start to see the large highway projects, that FAST Act flowing through plus some of the big non-res projects will start shipping.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Bob, I'll take \u2013 I'll start with your second question, but again, just on volume and you probably saw this referred to in our release, total business for the quarter on a shipping rate basis up 2.5%, October-November combined, that's despite the challenges that we had in California and Coastal Texas and Illinois. And just to give you a contrast, December was down 11%. So, really good momentum, particularly in our core markets, if you \u2013 core Southeastern markets, those were actually up in the quarter for the full quarter. They're up about 9% October-November on a shipping rate basis, down 7% in December, just to give you a sense for the fall off relative to last year.", "I'll highlight that because it kind of ties to your second question, Bob. There are really three big things in the quarter that affected unit margins in our Aggregates segment and gross profit margins in our Aggregates segment. And they're really all timing related. So the first thing we would say and call out is that the full year trends are the right trends to look at. The full year trends in terms of unit cost production being up 3% year-on-year, and then full year trends in terms of 14% improvement in unit gross profit margins in our Aggregates segment, those are the right numbers to focus on.", "With that said, let me kind of say what happened in the quarter. Again, really about timing, we noted first in the quarter that our unit cost of production increased 13%. Again, that compares to a 3% increase for the full year. That's all about timing of cost. So that's about $0.89 of cost increase in the quarter, that contrasts to about $0.22 for the year. Again, the $0.22 is the right number. But that timing factor by itself, it was about $30 million impact in the quarter, and it's about a 500 basis point impact to gross profit margin. So that's the big driver, is timing and costs.", "Again, look at the full-year trend, right numbers to look at. Two other factors; one, we called out pricing up. We had about $0.14 in the quarter of negative pricing mix both product and geographic. That's about another 100 basis points of impact on margin, still a very good thing for sales and cash flows, about a 100 basis point impact on stated gross profit margin. And then that volume fall off, it happened in \u2013 at the end of December, losing those incremental tons, which come at a higher rate of incremental gross profit. It had about another 100 basis point negative impact on margin in the quarter.", "Add those up, it's about again $30 million of impact due to timing differences and unit cost of production. That's really the difference between $0.89 and $0.22 across 43 million tons. It's about $6 million with negative mix on pricing. And it's \u2013 on the incremental tons, we think if we lost about 2 million tons, it's probably another 18 million of gross profit with the associated revenue that came with it. So, that's the rough walk-through. That's the way we look at it, that I come back to looking at the full year numbers is the best indication of how the business is doing, 3% growth in unit cost in our Aggregate segment, 14% growth in gross profit per ton in our Aggregate segment. Those are reflective of really what's happening in the business and they're reflective of what you see in our guidance.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's extremely helpful and clarifies what I was trying to understand. One other question, and then I'll turn it over, kind of a high-level question. It seems like you're saying this cycle is going to be stronger for longer and you're talking about mid-cycle profitability, which kind of seems like it shifted out a little bit just due to timing situation but a lot of things are going to come on in the back half of the year. I haven't heard Tom sound this optimistic in a while, and he put that out that $5 billion number there, which is a huge number in terms of balance sheet leverage if you want to buy something and free cash flow generation. What are your thoughts on capital allocation for the next 12 to 24 months? And you guys have any new thinking around that as we move closer towards mid-cycle? Thanks and good luck.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I'll start with kind of a CFO view and then Tom might comment more on just the M&A landscape and how we're approaching it broadly. But our overall capital allocation priorities are unchanged. So we will \u2013 and the thing to take away is we got the flexibility to do all of these things. So it's about balance and not either or for us. We will continue to make investments back in our franchise so that's next year CapEx guidance of about $300 million. Again, that includes some carryover for this year. And again, you'll see accelerating free cash flow in the business.", "We continue to have incremental debt capacity staying within our investment grade parameters. That could be roughly $2 billion of incremental capacity as we move through the recovery part of the cycle. We would expect dividend to continue to grow with earnings but we're very focused on the sustainability of that dividend. As Tom noted, we are actively involved, if not aggressive on the M&A trail. We're going to stay disciplined but we have a lot of really good opportunities there. We'll continue to pursue those. And then, we will continue to look to return excess cash after all those items to shareholders via opportunistic share repurchases that makes sense. Now, all those things with the same priorities we've talked about is just \u2013 we just know that we're entering 2017 in a really good position to pursue all those things. And Tom, I'll hand it off to you, maybe talk about M&A.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, Bob. I think that you saw us close a few that we noted in the press release. Don't be surprised if you see that pattern continue. We have a lot of conviction around the continuing improving cycle. And there is a lot of M&A opportunities out there, some of which we should be the clear owner of those. It's always difficult to predict timing, but what we will say is that we'll say, stay disciplined in our acquisition process. But I think you'll probably see this pattern continue.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Nice work guys. Stay in the course.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Hey, Jerry.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I'm wondering if you could just flesh out for us some visibility that you have into the ramp up into the back half of 2017? You've been very clear that the first quarter is a tough comp for a while now. I'm just wondering, can you just give us some data points either large project bids or whatever underpins visibility on the significant ramp up in the back half of 2017? And within that context, can you just talk about what you're seeing in Texas specifically, that's giving you confidence that Texas will return to growth in 2017?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I think that as we look at 2017, we see broad based growth in, of course, all of our segments and our geographic footprint. The Mid Atlantic and the Southeast continues to be very, very strong. As we look at our confidence \u2013 as far as the timing of that, it's really about when the construction season starts. The work's there. We have visibility of jobs, we backlog the jobs, they're ready to go, it's in every market we have, when does the sun come out and when we start shipping, and when does that begin. So, that will control the timing and that could be first quarter or second quarter, but it's going to start.", "I'd like to touch for a minute on California. And as we said in California, it isn't if, it's really when and we're beginning to see that win come around, it's really going to be driven by the private side in California and we'd been very focused on the private side, particularly the non-residential, and I'm pleased with our team's execution on that. I would tell you in California, our customers are a lot more optimistic than they were a year ago. And we're beginning to see those large projects let and start, and we've backlogged a number of them. I'll give you a couple examples.", "The new Rams Stadium, we'll start to ship in the next couple months, and this is 750,000 tons. The Mid-Coast Trolley extension in San Diego, again, it will start to ship whenever the season starts. It's about 200,000 tons. Silver Lake Reservoir is a really nice project for us because there's a lot of base and fines. And then the Otay Ranch residential project is a good example of the res that's going on in California. It's one of seven different phases of a residential project, and the first phase is 100,000 tons. And then, I'm pleased our team just closed on the LA Street contract, which is a five-year contract for asphalt, million tons of asphalt. So we're seeing California demand pick up, and it's \u2013 but, again, it's going to be driven by the private side. And I got to tell you, I'm feeling good about our execution in California and the team we have in place.", "So moving to Texas, I think we expect good growth, continued growth in Texas. Look, the fundamentals in Texas are all there. It's still growing. We see employment growth in Texas. We see population growth in Texas. The oil bust impact at this point on employment has really about bottomed out. So those headwinds will go away. It has the most healthy highway program probably in the country, and highway work in 2017 is very much in our footprint both in aggregates and asphalt. On the private side, res and non-res continue to grow. We'd probably \u2013 again, we bottomed out in Houston, we'd probably see some small growth in Houston. So, we expect healthy growth in Texas in 2017.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And Tom, can you comment about the Coastal Texas specifically, how much of your exposure is directly or indirectly to large-scale ethylene and LNG projects? Is it possible to tell just so we're appropriately calibrated as those projects eventually roll off?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Sure. I think that, that really affected the compares between 2015 and 2016. We had really big projects in 2015. They really kind of finished out in 2016, and we didn't see them ever flow through again in 2016. And I would tell you, they're probably not going to flow through in 2017. There are some out there, but they're not going to start till 2018. So what's built in here is really based on the highway program and conventional res and non-res growth, not the large energy projects.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And, John, in your prepared remarks, you said the price increases were well-received so far. Can you talk about the magnitude of the price increases in 2017 compared to the price increases that you put in at the start of 2016? And specifically, were you able to put in price increases into markets where volumes were down significantly in 2016?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Sure. I'll offer a couple comments, but I'll hand it out to Tom to kind of give you around the horn on what we're seeing in pricing, because it is really continued positive climate. First thing I'd say, Jerry, because it links into pricing is don't take our comments about back-half loaded as concerns about the underlying recovery at all. They're concerns if anything about timing, but you just heard Tom say, look, California and Texas are returning to growth for us. The rest of our franchise has been growing. Illinois should be flat, not at the same decline it had last year. So we're pretty excited about how we're set up for 2017. We're also just acknowledging a tough first quarter comp, and we're acknowledging the timing uncertainty we've seen with respect to large projects and when they actually take aggregate shipments. But, again, that's about timing, that's not about conviction in the recovery.", "Now, you see that in pricing. The market participants see the demand. It's a big driver. The demand coming is a big driver of the pricing climate. The magnitude of the changes varies across markets. But in total for us, the way we look at it is the compounding margin improvements we've seen should continue and continue apace and consistent with the long-term goals we've laid out.", "I will note in \u2013 sometimes get missed, but even in those markets that we had a lot of volume challenge last year, the Californias and Illinois as examples. We actually had quite healthy price increase. So it's not like all is bad in those markets, it's more of a temporary issue with respect to volumes. But let me hand it off to Tom to give maybe a better around the horn in what we're seeing in terms of the price increases we put in place so far.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, Jerry. With confidence in a long, gradual recovery ahead of us, the environment for price increases continues to be quite healthy. And it's driven obviously by improving demand, but also as we'll tell you, as we've always say, it's driven by the visibility that our customers have in the growing pipeline of work. We're seeing rising prices and/or margin expansions across our footprint and across all product lines. As I look at the numbers without \u2013 I'm not going to get into naming markets, but I'll give you some examples of price increases that we implemented January 1, reading down the list, $1.25, $1.35, $0.50, $1.75, $0.60. Look, these are robust price increases and there just continues to be a lot of confidence in a long sustained recovery, and it's showing up in pricing.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I'm sorry, just to clarify. Even markets like California and Texas that were down in 2016, you are getting significant price increases to start off 2017?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "The answer to the question is, yes. In fact, we had price increases that were very, very healthy in those markets in 2016, and we'll continue to see price increases in 2017.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you very much.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning, Trey.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "One question, I guess is for John on the incrementals. I mean you gave us some good color on how to think about incrementals for the full year this year. And I understand that's the best way to look at the business overall. But you did also highlight the obvious tough comps we're facing here in the first quarter, not just you guys, but pretty much everybody is facing in the 1Q and how this year could be more back-end loaded. I get all that. But just for our modeling benefit, if we could get a little bit more color on how to think about the margins early in the year, especially given \u2013 coming off of a kind of a abnormal margin situation in 4Q and then you'll probably have kind of continued lack of fixed cost absorption in 1Q relative to other times in the year. Just any color, even if it's directionally on how to think about margins would be super helpful.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Trey, I'll try and give you some directional help, but you probably know what I'm going to say, which is we don't give quarterly guidance, and for a variety of reasons, particularly in a low-volume first quarter, let me just start by acknowledging that it's a little bit unpredictable. Okay?", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. And I understand that.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "So I'll try and give you help, but I just want to make sure we're clear about that. I mean, keep in mind that our business as it ramps up, we're running a business now that daily shipment rates, depending where you are in the year, can range from 700,000 to 900,000 tons. It only takes a couple days shifting from \u2013 in the end of March, as an example, to have an impact on first quarter incrementals. So I'd tell you to really focus on trailing 12-month trends, and not over-read the first quarter regardless \u2013 just like we said last year's first quarter, don't over-read the blow-out numbers.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Sure.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "So all that said...", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Yeah.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "...nothing that we see. There is no boogeyman in the business that we see that would lead to a slower overall rate of margin improvement. So there's some timing differences quarter-to-quarter, but there is nothing major negative out there. If I think about some of the factors at play, you already mentioned some. But diesel throughout the year, we'll see how it plays out. Our assumptions for our guidance have diesel a little bit less than $2, so that's a small headwind for us next year.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "And what was the average for 2016? Sorry, just for...", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Probably a $1.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "$1.60.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "$1.60.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got it. Okay.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Rising during the year and the fourth quarter diesel was a slight headwind, but not a major headwind. And the next big factor I'd point out is just the timing of price increases, and how they flow through the work. Again, the first quarter number can be a little bit deceptive that way. But it's really difficult \u2013 our big question in the first quarter really is probably more about volume than underlying margin structure of the business. Now, we get a lot of great operating leverage and a lot of great fixed cost leverage, so without that volume it impacts our incrementals. But this is mostly about timing of volumes as opposed to seeing major changes out there on the cost horizon if that makes any sense.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's super helpful. And the big wildcard obviously being volume in the 1Q, given the tough comp is \u2013 that was kind of the reason for the question, because I know it's not easy for you guys to call, and definitely not easy for us sitting in our chairs with the kind of unique 1Q we're facing.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Once again, I know this isn't that helpful to you and that's why, again, that's why we don't give quarterly guidance. But if you think about full year trends \u2013 that continued double-digit growth in unit margins is something we still feel good about.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. And then, also mix played a role in 4Q \u2013 given the outlook you have for your different geographies and how they might perform, you mentioned seeing California and Texas returning to some growth there. But given that outlook and then also for your end markets, is there any kind of a mix impact, good or bad, negative or positive, I guess, that we should be thinking about as we go through 2017 and any assumptions you've laid out there?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "It's Tom. I don't see a lot of mix impact in 2017, and if it were to come from the base side, we'd be very happy with it. And it would be in additive to the volumes that would be at the high side of the volume guidance. But I think we feel pretty good about how we've looked at it and we do those budgets from the \u2013 those projections from the ground up. So I don't see a lot of mix in those numbers, and again, if it were there, we'd be pleased with it because it'd be fines and base.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "We're referring to healthier product mix which...", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Sure.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "....with \u2013 as you well know, Trey, with some of the new construction coming on, can put a little bit of downward pressure on reported average selling price, but if you look at real like-for-like pricing, that trend is still very positive.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got it. But you guys are reflecting that in the \u2013 in the range you gave?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "We think we are in the 5% to 7%. Again, because our pricing decisions \u2013 you hear us say this all the time \u2013 are made so locally, I mean, some have been made well around this call. It can be a difficult number, but that's included in the range, the 5% to 7%. We don't see \u2013 I'm going to call it any deceleration in the pricing climate per se. We'll have mix effects across the business product and geographic, but the overall climate is \u2013 I mean, it's very consistent with last year.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. The climate is consistent. I think it continues to be healthy and it's not like you're getting price increases in asphalt rock but not in base. It's really across segments, and it's across product lines, and it's across the geographies.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got it. And last one from me, just to kind of touch on that $5 billion that you mentioned earlier, Tom. Just to be clear that I'm making sure I understand that. And that's your expectation for cumulative free cash flow, so net of CapEx, cumulative free cash flow through the years as we kind of progress towards that mid-cycle volume. And I think you pointed to in the past is something like 250 million tons. Is that the right way to think about that $5 billion?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Two parts to it, Trey. It's roughly a $3 billion of cumulative free cash flow.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And $2 billion of incremental debt capacity.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got it.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And think of that incremental debt capacity is 2 to 2.25 times mid-cycle EBITDA. They were then investment grade parameters.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got it. Okay.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "A rough number, but not \u2013 your own modeling will probably come up with something not dissimilar.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Right. I think that's right.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And now, we're not going to get way ahead of ourselves and spend that money before we make it in some kind of crazy way. But it is a \u2013 the business model throws off a lot of cash and you know that, but that's just \u2013 it's worth thinking about.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Sure. All right. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate you taking the question.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks, Trey.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. One is just a follow-up on pricing, as we have also seen pricing momentum improve, but I think just for the reminder for us on the call, could you go through your top five highest per unit priced markets? Because we know that there are some that have perhaps lagged on a volume basis, but it'd be helpful if you could just give us a reminder of those top five per unit priced markets?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, Kathryn, I think there is a little bit of a missed number here. Our top pricing markets are going to be, what we call remote markets. So, they're going to be on the coast where we ship products into them. And some of those may or may not be the top margin markets. Some are, some would lag some of those things. I think that \u2013 we'd tell you, it's such a local business, that's all going to be relative and the top pricing may not be the top margin. But I think the important here is that, we are seeing pretty good price increases consistent across all of our markets in all segments. I think that as those \u2013 as the projects kick in, particularly from the FAST Act and from the new state highway over 2017, 2018, and 2019, it will only continue to support price increases along with the private side, which just continues to grow.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And Kathryn, if you look at it, just building on Tom's answer, and I think \u2013 well, you know this I know, but especially if you look with a two-year or three-year view, there's a pretty good overlap between further remaining growth in the recovery and generally speaking markets that are higher margin, at least, as we sit here today. Now, we'd tell you that for the markets that are on average lower margin we're working hard to move that up, but as the recovery unfolds, that should be little bit of a tailwind to us and that we have a lot of room to go in markets that are attractive on a margin perspective already.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Just want a little bit more color on your higher stripping costs that you noted in the press release. I assume this is \u2013 you're typically building in the winter for the build up in the peak of the construction season in the spring and summer. But is it correct to assume that the higher stripping cost in part is driven by higher backlogs and expected higher demand, particularly for certain key products such as clean stone?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, Kathryn, that's exactly correct. We are making hay while the sun's shining in that we \u2013 while we don't have those shipments and don't have \u2013 well, that fell off in the second half of December gives us an opportunity to go ahead and get some work done, so that we could bank reserves that were stripped for the season that we see coming in, in 2017 and wouldn't have to go outside and maybe pay higher prices for. So this is just prudent long-term operations management.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And Kathryn, those higher stripping and repair and maintenance expenses, just to be clear for everybody, they're in the $0.22 increase in unit cost of sales that we talked about for the full year. The distortion just happens because they occurred in the fourth quarter when we happen to have lower volume.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Yeah. Understood.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And you understand those economics plus our inventory economics.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Yeah. Absolutely. One other subject I want to talk about is your non-resident market. I know there's been a lot of focus on public end market, but one of the things we're focusing on is a little bit more expansive definition of infrastructure under the new administration. Could you break out how much of your non-res end market is more heavy versus kind of your traditional or commercial kind of office type non-res projects? And if you have any view just with the change of administration on how your thoughts on traditional infrastructure versus that more expansive definition? Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I'll take the first part of that. First is that, I think we've seen really healthy growth in the non-res sector in office, lodging, warehouses, distribution. And what's lagged some is manufacturing, institutional, and government. They actually declined somewhat over the year, but I think we are seeing some return in those. The fundamentals ultimately for non-res are in a good shape. You got population growth, you got employment growth. You know the external indicators are showing strength today and you've also got really healthy residential growth, which will pull non-res behind it. I think if you look \u2013 step back and look at our footprint of where we seeing substantial strength in non-res would be the Southeast, the Mid-Atlantic, Southern California, Arizona, Texas, excluding Houston and we think that's, well, actually may show some small growth in the year. But overall, I think we see healthy growth in the non-res segment.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Kathryn, just building on that and talking a little bit about \u2013 I'm not going to call it new administration and discussions. But we probably know one thing that you're very well aware of, which is we're already exceptionally well-positioned against a number of the increases and infrastructure funding that are already happening, particularly at a state and local level. And you know that well, but (52:55) of those increases that are already happening and we're very well positioned against those, whether that's improved maintenance or new road construction or port construction or water improvement or you name it, all those things we're well positioned against.", "In terms of the broader definition of infrastructure and things like longer-term federal programs, one of the great things about aggregates focused business is we serve all those things. So we're absolutely fine and well positioned against a broader definition of infrastructure whether that's airports, intermodal facilities, typical transportation on and on and on and on, we're well positioned to serve substantially all of that increase in demand.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I'd tell you that \u2013 I'd add to that, Kathryn, if that happens, as John said, we're in a great position for that and all of those projects will need our products. And I'd add to that, that \u2013 Vulcan Materials will be essential to building those critical infrastructure projects. I mean, that's what we do. And they don't really happen without us very well.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Great. Thank you. And final just handholding question of the $40 million EBITDA shortfall, how much of that is transitory versus any ongoing type issue? Thanks very much for answering my questions.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Kathryn, if you're referring to the quarter and what might be seen as a shortfall in gross profit margin percentage to that $40 million?", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Correct.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "If I would say that, substantially all of that is transitory or timing and that the right number to look at would be a $0.22 increase in unit cost of sales for the year and not the $0.89.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. A quick question. With all the \u2013 the $5 billion number you mentioned, Tom, it seemed like there was a lot of discussion around bolt-on sorts of acquisitions. Does that mean you're obviously fine with the footprint that's fantastic and you want to fill that in or are there larger acquisitions out there that you \u2013 that I didn't pick up on?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "We'd tell you both and those are \u2013 those, you just had to be optimistic at. When they come around, you will be on top of them. They will, I think over time you will see us do both, the ones that I think that are out there immediately. Right now we're bolt-on, but you'll see the new footprints and larger acquisitions over time. So, this is something we're excited about and we work hard on this all the time. The results although are going to be choppy and that's just a timing issue. I think, as we always talk about, the important piece here is the discipline, where do we have synergies, what's unique to us, what do we pay for them. And then once we get them, you got to go work hard and really fast to integrate them and make them make money.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And kind of turning back to the election, whether it's the lockbox in Illinois or the proposition there in California that you guys kind of mention. When do you think those can start having a meaningful impact on \u2013 well, strictly through the public piece, when can that start to flow through, those additional monies on the public side in the California market? And then, broader thoughts around the lockbox and the ability to help approve kind of the Illinois market?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think for the flow through, it's really \u2013 rule of thumb is always 18 months to 24 months now. You will see in some markets faster than that for repairs or overlays, and that just flows through past us. But by the time you collect the money, figure out which jobs you're going to do, engineer those jobs, let those jobs and they get started, it just takes that much time. And a perfect example of that is what we're going to see in the next few months in 2017 is that's how long it's taken for the FAST Act money and \u2013 states like Georgia, increases in Florida to flow through to shipments. But once they start, they start accelerating pretty fast. And so, the next two or three years or three or four years will be exciting to see the funds that we talked about two years ago flow through, these will just take a little time.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Perfect, guys. Thank you and good luck.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. Thank you. I just had a question on the acquisitions, the bolt-ons you made in the fourth quarter here, early in the first quarter. How much of that is embedded in your 2017 volume guidance? And as a follow-up to that, is there any meaningful EBITDA contribution that we should be thinking about as well?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I'll start, Garik. The acquisitions we announced, the total consideration for those is around $137 million. When it gets ramped up, those businesses in combination should do about $21 million in EBITDA on a kind of annual run rate basis. And obviously growing from there and there's some synergy upside beyond that. But I would assume, for your modeling, that all of that is in our guidance, particularly the EBITDA, just because we're in the process of closing some of these, bringing them on, ramping them up. And so, as we've thought about it, that is in the guidance. Likely gives us some volume upside later in the year, as we get these fully integrated into our platform, and we'll kind of communicate that as the year goes on. But, as Tom said, these are really good extensions of our existing franchise. And we hope to have more of these to talk about as the year goes on.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, I think as we talked about earlier, this is a part of the discipline with acquisitions, and this is where the real work starts, that you got to integrate them fast and accurately and bring them up to speed as fast as we can. And we'll be working hard on that in 2017 to put them in the Vulcan family and get them performing with quality earnings as fast as we can.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So just to be clear, the 5% to 8% volume growth, we should assume that it does incorporate the acquisitions that you just made?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yes.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Just my second question is just on highway demand. You talked quite a bit about that today, but just wanted to drill in a little bit more, because it was a source of frustration in 2016, particularly from a timing standpoint. And now, we're on the federal side in continuing resolutions, some of the leading indicators on highway contract awards have been soft over the last several months. So just wanted to stress test the mid single-digit volume guidance that you have for highway demand in 2017. And any other color or any other leading indicators or any geographical indicators that you can provide us that gives you confidence in that figure versus the risk in 2017 that we could be facing a similar set of disappointing timing issues like we saw in 2016?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, if you think you were frustrated with timing and some of those in 2016, you could imagine how John and I were. But I think \u2013 we stress test that pretty hard. We've looked at this and really said, okay, do we know when it's going to start? And these are projects that \u2013 actually some of them have already started a little bit. I mean, we saw a few of these projects (1:00:58) \u2013 a few thousand tons in the fourth quarter of 2016. But I'm looking at four jobs in Atlanta right now that would have a total of about 3 million tons that we have \u2013 three out of the four have actually just started, just a little bit. And as soon as the construction season starts, those will start. I can think of three in Texas that would total over time probably over a couple \u2013 probably a couple of million tons or over 2 million tons, and those \u2013 actually those are being \u2013 just let or being let, and we know that they'll start in the second and third quarter. So I think we have a lot more visibility and confidence that these jobs are ready to go. We've already shipped a little bit on them, and we're \u2013 as I said earlier, we're really \u2013 the timing here is not what year is it going to ship in, it's when does construction season start?", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, thanks. Just the last question, I might have missed it, but didn't hear much discussion on share buybacks. As it relates to the $5 billion of available capital over the next several years, shares here down a little bit today \u2013 relative underperformers, I guess since the election compared to some of the peers. How are you balancing the view of the share price with your free cash flow versus the M&A opportunities that you talked about today?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Garik, it's John. I think no change, so \u2013 as we discussed, we work through all of our capital allocation priorities. We'll be opportunistic in how we think about share repurchases. No commitment to buy any certain amount at a certain period of time. We'll report on it after the fact. But that said, as this recovery cycle moves forward, we should have the opportunity to balance both reinvestment in the core franchise, investment in growth, both M&A and internal investment for growth, and return on capital to shareholders via mix of dividend and share repurchase. For us, it's about balancing those things given our outlook for things like M&A activity. We did not buy any shares back in the fourth quarter. You kind of saw some M&A activity that we reported on, but no real change. So I would expect through the cycle, you're going to see that investment capacity deployed to good use, and that'll be some mix of growth oriented and returning to shareholders.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Rohit Seth with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the BOLD Act. And I know there's been some developments within the industry to create a successor bill to the FAST Act and there could be some overlap in the timing of when that would kick in, if it does develop as intended. Are you guys seeing any developments there? Is that something you guys are working with the trade group on? And if you have any color on that and what that impact would be on the business, that'd be great.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. The folks who worked on the BOLD Act did an outstanding job with that. It is a great idea. I think as you know right know, there's a lot of positive discussions in D.C. about infrastructure with a lot of people working really hard on solutions to funding infrastructure, which our company desperately needs and we obviously support. How that happens, we don't know yet. There's just a lot of uncertainty to it. We think it's a matter of when, not if. And when it happens, there's nobody better positioned to serve these projects than we are. It's what we do. It's who we are. It's how we started. But I think that overall, if you step back and look at this also, without any of that flowing through, you've got some very healthy highway projects coming in the next three years with increased funding from the FAST Act and from state funding, which is only increasing.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Got you. And then just in the first quarter, can you comment on weather trends that you've seen thus far? Is it in a headwind or a tailwind?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think probably about neutral, with the exception of \u2013 probably a little bit of a headwind. I mean, California was very, very wet, as you well know. But with just two more months of this left and we'll just wait and see and we just don't know. Remember that 2016 was really, really good weather. But our markets look good and the work is there. So, whatever happens with the weather, the work is not going away and we'll ship it when the sun comes out.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Keep in mind that in the first quarter shipments typically accelerate through the quarter as we get more into the construction season. So I wouldn't read too much into January anyway.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And can you comment on some of the bidding activity you're seeing out there in the Southeast and in California, Texas?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. It continues to pick up both in \u2013 particularly in residential, non-residential and highway. The Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic states continue to be very, very good. We've seen Virginia pick up a little bit actually which was \u2013 it was a little bit flat last year and we're seeing it pick up. So, that is very encouraging for us. We spoke to California and Texas, both of those, particularly \u2013 both of those are healthy. Texas is, I guess, what I'd say, remains healthy and both public and private bid activity is very healthy. On the non-res side in California, I think and the res side where we continue to see it pick up and private \u2013 the private construction segment is what will drive growth in California this year.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. That's all I have. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.", "Oh, great. Thanks. You referenced tight construction resources in the U.S. I'm just curious how pervasive that is? And then, thinking about 2017 as a whole, is that something that could push you towards the low end of the volume guidance but maybe the high end of the pricing guidance?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think it depends on the market and when we say it's short, it's really, do they have the crews, do they have the lay down machines, do they have enough ready mix trucks and it's \u2013 it's different in every market. But I think that as you see the bidding work pick up, as the pipelines comes through the starts, that capacity will grow along with it. I think that those \u2013 that is always a healthy piece of pricing, but it is a piece of it. So it creates a healthy environment for pricing or one of things it does, but it's not the only one.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And rather than commenting just on 2017, it is a factor that's at play when we say a longer recovery could and maybe should be a more profitable recovery. But I don't \u2013 the dynamics are such that I wouldn't read too much just into 2017 on that just yet. And also to keep in mind, when we say capacity just to be clear that this really isn't our capacity. This is end-to-end construction sector. Our assets, as we sit here today, from an aggregates point of view have \u2013 they've in a single year produced more than 305 million tons of shipments. So this isn't a capacity issue for us. This is a end-to-end construction sector set of factors.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.", "Okay. And then I just wanted to ask quickly on the acquisitions you've done past four or five months. Are those all pure aggregates or are they vertically integrated? And then what's your thought on making vertically integrated acquisitions?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Well, I think as we \u2013 as some of those are aggregates, some are asphalt, some are both. And I think that as always \u2013 in our foot print, it's really not so much about vertical integration for the sake of vertical integration, it's about markets and how we view the market and how we better serve the market. So as we go forward \u2013 our strategy is always to be, as we say, grounded in aggregates. That's really \u2013 that's our bread and butter and that's what we do. But we will be \u2013 we will look at acquisitions that are vertically integrated, if they fit that whole strategy and if they fit that market.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Typically, we use the word downstream or more specifically asphalt or concrete \u2013 vertically integrated is really how we're actually approaching it.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Hey, Timna. Good morning.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Oh, afternoon. So I'll just leave it to one question, we had a lot of discussion. But I mean, on a high level, we're just wondering and kind of surprised by the pricing guidance because if you look at the 7% that you achieved overall on a high level in 2016 and the guidance of 5% to 7%, that implies that there could be a downside to the momentum in pricing. And when you match that against the potential cost pressures that you've highlighted, whether they be from some of the constraints in getting labor (1:10:00) supply in the industry or diesel, that seem to us then a little bit low. So I was just wondering, is this a conservative guide? Are you trying to be \u2013 you usually have a pretty good track record in forecasting prices, so we're just wondering if there was another dynamic that we're missing?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I don't think there's any other dynamic. I don't think we have anything built in there for big diesel increases and if we did, we'd be fine with that because over time, they help support pricing and help support margin improvements. I think we feel confident in our pricing guidance. Obviously, we're going to work hard every day to better serve our customers and make our products and our services more valuable. I think at this point, we feel pretty confident in our guidance.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So to clarify then, if you do see higher diesel costs or higher labor costs or other costs, could we see that number increase accordingly?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "First of all, yeah, cost will drive \u2013 it will help drive price. It's one of the dynamics that's always there, but from a diesel perspective sometimes it lags a little bit, but it always flows through. From a cost perspective, I think you really got to step back and look at the trend of cost in 2016, which I'd tell you, from a cost perspective over 12 months of \u2013 with very little production increases of only $0.22 and 3%, that's a pretty good trend and I like hearing that into 2017 along with the pricing momentum. So I think at this point \u2013 things will change through the year, but \u2013 and we'll adjust accordingly. But at this point, I think we're pretty confident in our guidance.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Timna, I'd add, since you asked the question this way, about cost and price. We talk about this a lot and I know you know this. We run the business on margin and cash and that's a function of pricing, it's a function of product mix and production efficiency, it's a function of our operating efficiencies and how all those things work together, not just average selling prices. So, I think if you work through the guidance, you're going to see, an implied another year of very healthy unit margin improvement and at a rate faster than pricing at the moment would dictate. So I think, reading any deceleration into margin is certainly not what we see at the moment.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Appreciate it.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. As we look forward to the 2017, so I would coin it as, we're set up well for 2017. Our long-term cost trends are very good. Our markets are showing growth. And our pricing shows the confidence of us and our customers and the whole market in that long-term growth. So thanks again for joining us. And we look forward to you sharing news in 2017. Thank you.", "Operator", "That will conclude today's conference.

At this time, we'd like to welcome everyone to today's Vulcan Materials 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]", "I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Don James, Chairman. Please go ahead, sir.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning, and thank you for your participation in our Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. I'm Don James, Chairman of Vulcan Materials. With me today are Tom Hill, our newly promoted President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McPherson, our newly promoted Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.", "Hopefully, you saw our July 14 press release announcing the election of Tom and John to their new senior leadership positions. These elections were the culmination of a multiyear management succession process by Vulcan's Board of Directors to develop a new senior leadership team with diverse and broad-based experience as well as demonstrated management success and leadership skills. The bios of the 4 members of our new senior leadership team are included in the July 14 press release. Importantly, you should note that each of these individuals has been successful as a line manager in at least one of our regional businesses. We are very pleased that this new team is now in place to lead the company.", "In a moment, Tom and John will take you through our quarterly results and outlook for the remainder of the year as well as respond to your questions. Personally, I'll miss having the opportunity in the future to engage and interact with many of you about what makes Vulcan Materials Company such a great company with lasting value. While Tom and John, along with Mark Warren, our Director of Investor Relations, will be directly engaged with you on investor relations matters going forward, I will continue to be available to you and your organizations as requested.", "I'm excited about the opportunities for Vulcan going forward, led by our new senior management team. Aggregates shipments have increased sharply year-to-date and have improved year-over-year for 5 consecutive quarters. Our price improvement is widespread. More importantly, earnings are growing faster than our top line sales, and margins continue to expand. These results build upon the sales momentum we continue to see across our market footprint and are a credit to our employees. They have done an exceptional job of meeting our customer needs by providing a superior value proposition as we see a broad market recovery. Vulcan is extremely well positioned to benefit from the construction market recovery and to deliver value to our shareholders. And now is a great time to transition to our new leadership team.", "Before we begin with actual results and projections, let me remind you that a slide presentation will accompany this webcast and will be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call.", "Additionally, we remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's second quarter 2014 earnings release and at the end of this presentation.", "Moving now to Slide 3. We had an excellent second quarter, and we're encouraged by the growing momentum in our markets. This slide shows the strong earnings leverage we realized on higher aggregates shipments. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.35 per diluted share, an increase of 52% compared to the prior year second quarter. On a comparable basis, our EPS in the second quarter was $0.37 per diluted share compared to $0.13 per share last year. Net sales increased $60 million or 9%, while gross profit increased $42 million or 32%.", "These results reflect strong performance in our aggregates segment and improving results in our other segments. We remain focused on realizing earning leverage from price improvement, from cost control and from volume growth.", "I'd now like to turn the remainder of the call over to Tom Hill.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thank you, Don. And also, welcome to Vulcan's Second Quarter Earnings Call.", "Before we get into the details of the second quarter results, we would like to highlight the progress that we have made in our efforts to improve profitability.", "Turning your attention to Slide 4. You see that, over the last 24 months, we've improved our EBIT by $169 million on just a 4% increase in aggregates demand. We are very pleased with this growth in earnings, and it highlights our commitment to cost control, pricing and customer service. We've improved our core profitability significantly, and we have positioned ourselves to capitalize on the accelerating volume recovery. We remain acutely focused on our profit-improvement actions and maximizing our strong operating leverage in this time of growing recovery.", "Taking a closer look at the aggregates segment results on Slide 5. You see the resulting revenue and gross profit impact from higher shipments and pricing. Aggregates volumes increased over 10% and pricing increased 3% on a freight-adjusted basis. This, along with our expanded product offering in transportation and materials handling services, led to a 17% increase in segment revenue. In the second quarter, incremental earnings on higher aggregates volumes were in line with our longer-term expectations of approximately 60%. Transportation and material handling services, which are key to our aggregates business, generated higher sales and earnings versus the prior year second quarter.", "Growing our transportation services, mainly truck brokerage services, has been a focus area for revenue and earnings growth. The truck brokerage requires little to no capital. These transportation services add incremental sales and earnings and allow us to better serve the needs of our customers. However, incremental margins are significantly less than earnings on each incremental ton produced and sold. That said, the earnings leverage on increased volume led to 27% higher gross profit in aggregates and a 210-basis-point increase in the percent of sales converted to gross profit. As a result, the key metric of cash gross profit per ton hit an all-time high of $5 per ton.", "The broad nature of our volume improvement is notable. We saw a 10% volume increase for the second quarter. In particular, volumes in Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia exceeded 15%. Florida and Southern California also had above-average volume growth. We continue to experience volume momentum, as we've seen trailing 12-month volume growth of 8%. Our markets are seeing expanding growth in both volume and price. Aggregates shipments were up in virtually all of our sales regions, and the vast majority of our sales regions have realized higher pricing. This is evidence that volume and price growth are widespread.", "Slide 6 highlights the favorable operating leverage in our aggregates business. Trailing 12-month volumes have increased 8% or 12 million tons, while aggregates gross profit improved 29% or $103 million. This is due to higher pricing, cost control and the earnings leverage on volume growth. This type of earnings leverage on modest volume growth is a tribute to our local management teams. Their continued commitment to earnings growth demonstrates their leadership and highlights the opportunities ahead.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.", "John R. McPherson", "Thanks, Tom.", "Now let's take a look at our conversion of incremental aggregates shipments into incremental profits in a bit more detail. Slide 7 compares our growth in aggregates shipments and our growth in segment gross profit for each of the second quarter, first half and trailing 12 months. In the second quarter, for example, we grew aggregates segment gross profits by $35 million over the same quarter a year ago, and we did that on just 4 million tons of increase in shipments. Looked at a bit differently, we added approximately $58 million in incremental direct revenue from aggregates shipments in the quarter, and the gross profit flow-through on those incremental revenues was approximately 60%, as Tom mentioned. Looking over longer periods, you see similar trends. Over the first half of 2014 and the trailing 12 months, we've grown segment gross profits at approximately 3.5x the rate of growth in shipments. As you've heard Tom highlight, our team, of course, remains very focused on growing profits at a rate well in excess of shipments.", "Now let's go to Slide 8 to look at the strong and improving unit margins that underpin these results. This slide highlights our results on a per-ton basis. And as you can see, we've continued to improve our already strong unit margins significantly despite relatively modest price increases in the early stages of the recovery.", "As Tom mentioned, second quarter cash gross profit per ton of $5 was a new record level for our aggregates business. At $4.51, our trailing 12-month cash gross profit per ton is 34% higher than it was at the end of the first quarter in 2006, our prior peak period in volume, when our annual rate of shipments was approximately 130 million tons higher than it is today. Again, these key unit profitability metrics demonstrate the successful efforts of our employees to increase profitability by controlling cost and delivering quality materials at a fair value to our customers. Looking at the second quarter, for example: Our freight-adjusted selling price rose by $0.33 or 3%. At the same time, our cash gross profit per ton increased by $0.36 or 8%, and our gross profit per ton increased $0.49 or 15%. For the quarter, most of the $0.16 differential between our average selling price gain and our gross profit per ton gain came from cost improvements, as our operators were able to offset higher repair and maintenance cost and stripping cost with other production efficiencies and by leveraging fixed cost to sales.", "You will see that similar results hold if you look at the first half or the last 12 months. We believe our unit margins are among the highest and fastest growing in the industry, and we remain intensely focused on delivering strong and improving profits per ton as volumes recover. As a leadership team and as a company, we focus on the actual dollars and cents and not just the short-term percentage fluctuations because this higher unit profitability is what ultimately drives both higher earnings and higher returns on invested capital. And of course, these factors, combined with our presence in higher-growth markets and thoughtful management of our balance sheet, in turn, drive value for our shareholders.", "Vulcan has the assets, people and performance focus needed to deliver similarly strong and improving returns on incremental shipments in the future, particularly as the recovery gets past its early days and as the pricing climate in many of our markets continues to improve.", "Now I'll hand it back to Tom to touch on our other segments and our current outlook for demand.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thanks, John.", "Next I'd like to talk briefly about our non-aggregates results, of which concrete and asphalt are highlighted on Slide 9. In the second quarter, our concrete segment's gross profit improved from a loss of $6 million last year to gross profit of $3 million in the current year. This year-over-year improvement resulted from sales of our Florida-area concrete business in the first quarter, from an 18% improvement in volume and from higher unit profitability in our remaining operations. On a like-for-like basis, volume and price improved, benefiting from growth in private construction activity.", "In our asphalt segment, second quarter gross profit was in line with the prior year. Asphalt volumes increased slightly from the prior year, and material margins improved slightly due mostly to lower cost for liquid asphalt. However, drying costs and depreciation were higher than prior year.", "Next, John and I would like to discuss the full year outlook. I will first give a few comments on our current forecast for aggregates demand by end market, and then John will give some highlights about key assumptions we have made regarding our full year earnings results.", "Turning now to Slide 10. You see a breakdown of our expectations for aggregates demand by each of the major end markets. For construction, both residential and nonresidential continue to lead demand growth. In the private market segment, Vulcan-served markets are growing faster than the rest of the U.S. We expect residential growth to continue to be broad-based across our geography, led by key states such as Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. We're also seeing residential construction activity and aggregate demand recover rapidly in important Vulcan markets such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte and Nashville. In private nonresidential, our markets are beginning to benefit from growth in office and commercial work as well as increased demand for large industrial projects. These industrial projects can represent large quantities of aggregates supplied over several years, and Vulcan is uniquely positioned to serve them. This is particularly true along the Gulf Coast, where we are advantaged by our ocean-shipped stone from Mexico. These projects provide an exciting opportunity for our aggregates business.", "We're also seeing strengthening large-project opportunity in the public arena, including transportation infrastructure. Federally-funded TIFIA projects are beginning to drive additional aggregates shipments in 2014. State-led funding initiatives in several states, including Texas, Florida, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, will improve the highway segment demand.", "We are pleased with the extension of the current highway bill until May 31, 2015, and the additional funding of $10.8 billion transferred to the Highway Trust Fund. Congress continues to work towards the ultimate passage of a new multiyear highway bill. In the meantime, large transportation projects and the growth in contract work for highways in 2013 and 2014 will provide steady growth in the demand for this market segment. Overall, we expect modest growth in shipments in the public end markets in 2014, and we're optimistic with respect to public infrastructure construction in 2015 and beyond.", "Now I'll turn the call back to John.", "John R. McPherson", "Thanks, Tom.", "So as you can tell, we're not only excited by our recent performance, but we're also very confident in the overall momentum we see across our markets, both for the balance of 2014 as well as into 2015.", "Turning to Slide 11. I'll touch briefly on our current outlook for the full year before handing the call back to Tom. For ease of comparison, we formatted the slides similarly to the one in our February earnings call.", "We now forecast full year volume growth to be 7% to 9% above the prior year. That compares to our prior forecast of 4% to 7% growth. Our backlogs and recent sales momentum remain quite strong. And although we remain far below any measure of normalized demand, the recovery appears to be gaining steam, and our local sales teams are doing an excellent job in growing our business.", "We continue to see full year pricing up 3% to 5% over the prior year. Our recent pricing gains have been broad-based geographically, and as discussed, the overall pricing climate is improving across the majority of our markets. We're continuing to see improving prices as we book new business week-to-week and month-to-month.", "We expect our other segments, which include asphalt mix, ready-mixed concrete and calcium, to report $40 million to $50 million of gross profit collectively for the full year, toward the lower end of our prior forecast. Our asphalt volumes in the Western U.S. have trailed plan due to delays in several key projects, pushing the revenue and profitability from those activities into 2015.", "As previously indicated, full year SAG costs should remain in line with the prior year and lower on a percentage of sales basis. We remain very focused on continually improving the productivity of our sales and G&A investments. Full year interest expense remains unchanged at $165 million to $170 million, down from $202 million the prior year, not including the onetime charges associated with our debt tender transaction. We've revised our full year capital spending slightly from $220 million to $240 million. Given our current sales momentum and outlook, we have excellent opportunities to invest further in production efficiencies and distribution capabilities and to do so at very attractive returns. This capital spending will allow us to take advantage of those opportunities now and to prepare for the growth we see ahead of us.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for some final remarks.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thanks, John.", "In closing, we are well positioned to capitalize on the multiyear recovery in demand that we believe is in front of us. And we expect 2014 to be another year of earnings growth. Thus far in this recovery, we have leveraged modest but accelerating volume growth into strong growth in earnings. This is due to the operating leverage in our aggregates business and the disciplined execution of our operations and sales teams. This performance by our teams gives us tremendous earnings upside as volume recovery continues.", "John referenced opportunities to reinvest in our existing assets to enhance our profitability and grow earnings and returns. We are also very active in pursuing value-enhancing acquisitions. In July, we closed on a transaction that added 4 quarries that complement and grow our existing business in the San Francisco Bay Area. We're excited about these operations and look forward to their contributions to Vulcan's future results. We continue to see opportunities for bolt-on aggregate acquisitions. We will pursue these opportunities while staying disciplined in our approach.", "Over the last 3 weeks, our senior management team has been traveling across the country meeting with our management teams throughout Vulcan's footprint. Our people are excited about Vulcan's future. They see what I see: a company that is in a new phase of robust growth that will be strategic and very rewarding to our employees and shareholders. The recovery that is occurring across America is encouraging, but our people are not waiting for recovery. They are making it happen every day, creating new opportunities for Vulcan to grow ever stronger and more profitable. Our people are totally focused on strategic growth, growing our volumes, growing our profitability and growing our footprint in the best markets in America. We are finding new opportunities every day, and our people are making the most of them.", "I want to thank these employees for their outstanding contributions to Vulcan Materials Company. And I want to especially thank Don James for the critical role he has played to grow our business strategically and dramatically in fast-growing and high-potential U.S. markets. Don has led this company in good times and through turbulent times into recovery. Vulcan shareholders can have great confidence in our company. This confidence comes from our unparalleled asset base and from our outstanding people. They run the best and most profitable aggregates operations in the United States, and they are completely focused on building sustained shareholder value.", "And now if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Don, congratulations on an extraordinary career, and we wish you all the best in retirement.", "Donald M. James", "Thanks, Ted. I appreciate that.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was hoping maybe to start with John. John, could you maybe walk through a more detailed bridge of the gross profit improvement in aggregates? Just I know that you referenced to Slide 7, and I don't think the deck's available yet, but maybe if you could just walk us through kind of the impact of pricing volume. You mentioned stripping costs and repair and maintenance were up, but maybe benefits of restructuring and changes in inventory just so we can try and understand the puts and takes.", "John R. McPherson", "Sure. I'll just hit some highlights, and then Tom will chime in. First, just to get to the question of flow-through that many folks have asked: In the quarter, our incremental revenue from direct sales of stone, just as a reminder, was approximately $58 million. And on those revenues, our gross profit was approximately $35 million incremental gross profit, for a flow-through on the order of 60%. So just to answer that question directly, that's where our flow-through was in the quarter. Now going a little more into detail on the improvements in core profitability in the aggregates segment. And apologize, this will be detailed in the deck, if it's not available. Our gross profit per ton in the quarter was up $0.49, and our average selling price in the quarter was up $0.33. And again, that $0.16 differential is, in this quarter, mostly driven by cost improvements. And our operators did a fantastic job of leveraging volumes and driving some additional operating efficiencies. They overcame some headwinds and repair and maintenance costs and higher stripping costs. So we're very, very pleased with those results. We think our total gross profit per ton, when you look at it on a gross profit basis or a cash gross profit basis, is likely the highest in the industry, substantially higher, as in $1 or 30% higher than many others. And we also think it's the best at expanding in the industry. And we're pleased, actually, we're doing that despite relatively modest price growth. So Ted, let me stop there. Ask the additional questions, and Tom can chime in.", "James Thomas Hill", "Ted, I think, if you look at the quarter, we actually spent more dollars on stripping and on repairs, and that was really in preparation for the third quarter, where we'll see higher volumes. And that was to free up our operations to be prepared for that. But if you look at it on a per-ton basis, I think our operating folks did a really nice job with efficiencies. On a per-ton basis, even with the spinning on stripping and repair and maintenance, our per-ton cost was down.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Order of magnitude, could you give us a sense for the combined stripping and repair and maintenance costs just so we appreciate, ballpark, what that number would look like?", "James Thomas Hill", "Stripping was up, I think, about $0.02. And repairs and maintenance was about -- up about $0.045.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. The second thing I was just hoping to touch on is pricing. I know you reported 3%, and you talked about broad-based gains. Could you maybe just help us maybe start by understanding the impact of geographic mix and product mix, to the extent that's possible? And just so we can get at what the underlying improvements and kind of go from there.", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, first of all, I don't think there was a lot of impact from mix. While our pricing in the second quarter was modest, it was broad-based. And we had pricing improvements in all but one of our markets. We think there's a lot of momentum with pricing, and we've had continuous pricing over time. I think, if you look at our trailing 12-month pricing, we were up in all but one market. And if you look back a year ago, trailing 12 months in '13, our prices were all up, all but one market. And then if you look back over time, Ted, we have had price increases in 13 of the past 14 quarters. So our pricing has been very steady. An exciting part about it is we are seeing pricing momentum in all markets, and that momentum is accelerating, so we're excited about that. But I think, ultimately, when it gets down to pricing, you have to put that together to look at margin. And we're really pleased with our teams' coordinated effort in the second quarter to blend price, volume, cost and product mix to maximize profit. And their effort generated a record cash gross profit per ton of $5. And while we're very pleased with that record, based on our pricing momentum and our efficiencies in operations, we're -- we don't think that record is going to stay on long.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. The last thing I'll ask before I get back is a question to come back to the margins. Well, as we look forward to the second half of 2014, would it be reasonable just to think about maintaining 60-plus-percent incrementals on the core aggregates business? Are there trends in cost we should think about? Or just any hand-holding there would be great. And I'll get back in queue.", "John R. McPherson", "I think the answer, Ted, is yes. This is John. 60% is appropriate to think through, through time. As we've said before, it may fluctuate a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but the answer to your question is yes. And incremental revenues, particularly those revenues that come from direct stone sales or revenues that come from trucking-related activities, just to give a reminder, those are lower margin, but they have substantially no capital associated with them, and they effectively serve to add additional profit per ton sold. So for our direct stone revenues, 60% is not a bad number. And again, just to give you a sense, Ted and others, if you take a slightly longer-term view -- again, if you look at the trailing 12 months, our price has been up on the order of 3% average selling price, but our gross profit per ton is up 20%, 19% and change. And our -- and well, actually, our gross profit per ton is up about 20%. So ultimately, that's the money that we can either reinvest or give back to shareholders, dollars and cents per ton, and that's what we're very focused on.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Desi filling in for Bob. Looking at the aggregates business, I think that around 30% of your guys' volumes goes towards nonres construction activity, exclusive of roads, of course. Of that 30%, how much is going towards these energy infrastructure projects that you talked about along the gulf? I'm trying to gauge how much you guys stand to benefit from what's going on around there.", "James Thomas Hill", "I'm not sure I can give you that exact percentage. I'll give you some flavor on nonresidential. We're actually seeing the conventional nonresidential come back strong. When I say that, I mean shopping centers, buildings and things like that. We do have a number of large projects along the coast energy related, but a lot of those are just now getting started off. We're just starting to ship 3 of them on the Texas Gulf. And actually, the ones we had planned on shipping in Louisiana have been postponed to 2015, and while that's not good news for '14, it's excellent news for 2015. But if you kind of step back and look at the traditional nonresidential growth, and these are demands for what we project for 2014 over 2013: San Diego, we project demand to be up 50% in nonres; Baltimore, up 36%; Houston, up 32%; Fresno, up 32%; Miami, up 24%; Phoenix, up 20%; and Chicago, up 20%. So there's a lot of not traditional nonresidential growth out there that we're experiencing and excited about, and the big industrial projects that we're seeing are a bonus on top of that. And like I said, we backlog a number of those, but they're just beginning to ship, and we think we'll see the majority of those big industrial projects in '15.", "Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. That's really good color. And then also, turning to SAG expenses. You guys continue to expect those will be flat year-over-year, which is really impressive given the revenue growth. And as we think longer term and net sales continue to grow, and how much -- what portion of your SG&A expenses are truly variable?", "John R. McPherson", "It's a good question. I think, actually, very little. I think the sales expense component of that, which is, let's call it, roughly $100 million of the total SAG numbers, probably slightly less than that, the sales expense will be more variable. Over time, we'll continue to invest in sales staff and sales-related expense to drive volumes and to critically drive profitability per ton sold to meet the needs of our customers. So that component's, to a degree, variable but still at a much, much, much lower rate. Then we'll grow shipments, and then we'll grow sales, and then we'll grow profits. We absolutely plan for SAG as a percent of sales to continue to decline substantially over the next several years.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "First of all, on pricing, just wanted to follow up in terms of you've seen -- given that you're seeing a greater breadth of projects now, not just an overlay of what you saw 3 to 4 years ago but more new projects and projects in all of your key 3 end markets, res, nonres and public, what is the differential in terms of the magnitude of price increases that you've been able to get for base product versus clean stone? That's part one. And then part two, how do you see that progressing, as we are in the earlier stages of recovery, in the both of the nonres and the public end markets?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think I understand your question. When it comes to base pricing and clean stone, in this part of the recovery cycle, normally, you're able to get higher prices on clean stone than base. This year, we are starting to see that turn, which is a really good sign in that we are seeing price increases, realizing price increases in base. And we're on the cusp of that, so we're very excited about it. The clean stone pricing continues to gain momentum, and the recovery will only help those prices.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Are you seeing a different -- difference in terms of your ability to get a greater percentage increase for base relative to clean stone, just clearly on a percentage-type base?", "James Thomas Hill", "Again, this part of the cycle, base is starting to catch up with clean stone. Clean stone, in prior quarters, has outstripped base price increases, but that is catching up and catching up rapidly.", "John R. McPherson", "And Kathryn, I think -- just to add, I think the answer to your question is yes. I think that the mix, over time, also helps us drive higher profitability per ton. So as you've heard from others, the mix is improving as the recovery goes forward too.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Yes. Shifting over just to public end markets, are you seeing DOT slowing in light of some of the noise we've seen around D.C.? I know we have a short-term fix. Our work certainly is not showing a meaningful change, but what are you seeing in terms of states where you have the greatest exposure, in particular how they're approaching being less reliant on federal and taking more responsibility for their own?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, I think before the extension of the highway bill and the additional funding, there was a lot of nervous states out there. I think, with the extension until May of 2015 and the additional $10.8 billion, those states are much more comfortable and have gone on with their programs. We're seeing, I guess, improvement in a lot of states, in a number of states which I mentioned on the call, particularly Virginia and Maryland. Virginia raised the gas tax. I think they increased funding to $800 million a year. Maryland increased their funding over 6 years by $4.4 million. So we're seeing -- we're -- excuse me, $4.4 billion. We're seeing states take a much more active role in their own destiny when it comes to highway spending. And then you are aware that Florida announced over $10 billion in highway spending for 2014, 2015. And Texas just ended a record spending year for their highway funding. So it's encouraging, but I think the extension of the highway bill and the supplemental funding have helped the states relax their nervousness about highway funding.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Another follow-up question. This is -- can straddle both nonres and public, to some extent. But what are you seeing in your key markets in terms of volumes that are contributing to preparation for the Panama Canal expansion? And how do you see that progressing over the next 18 to 24 months?", "James Thomas Hill", "I'm thinking a lot of planning with not much action, at this point. I'd tell you that most of the ports we're seeing are talking a lot about it. People are -- have projects that they're planning, but not a lot of action at this point. There's also DOTs. For example, in Charlotte, South Carolina, they're talking about expanding the access to the ports. So it's in the very early stages of that and not seeing a lot of activity, more discussion and planning.", "John R. McPherson", "Kathryn, it's John. I think, maybe not in direct response to your question but just to add on, some of the incremental investment we're making in CapEx is focused on our blue-water distribution capabilities, readying our facility in Savannah, beginning to increase in capacity out of our Mexico operations, so forth and so on. So while it's not here just yet, we do see it as an important long-term trend. And we're well positioned and investing accordingly.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay, great. Then final question. On your truck brokerage services, how big do you want that business to be?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, I think we still have growth in that. The focus of that business is to take an active role in managing our logistics. It allows us to save cost, improve customer service, and it also allows us to secure transportation in times when transportation is scarce. We're seeing a little bit of that out there, so we're pressing on. I'm not sure I could quantify the exact number, except for this was part of our Profit Enhancement Plan that we worked on, have been working on for the last 2 years, and just an extension of that.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "First question is just on your volume guidance. I think, previously, something that was maybe holding you back from not having a bigger guidance to start the year was some of these large Gulf Coast projects. You highlighted some are getting underway this year. Some are getting pushed out to next year. Was there any change in the cadence in these big projects that influenced your guidance? And then secondly, I guess, just a follow-up to the guidance question just because I don't believe the slide deck is yet up on the website, if you can just maybe identify which of the end markets is coming in specifically stronger than you had anticipated since the beginning of the year.", "James Thomas Hill", "As far as the large -- the mega projects, I don't think we're seeing a lot of timing differential on any of those. We backlogged a number of those and are very pleased with them. We're shipping some of those in '14. The lion's share will come in '15. But I don't think that's what changed our guidance. It's more the underlying demand in our fundamental markets, particularly nonresidential. When it comes to we upped our -- we increased our demand in the nonresidential markets, and that's really driven by the fundamental stores, buildings, office buildings that we're seeing in all of our major metropolitan markets.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And has there been any...", "John R. McPherson", "And Gary, just to be -- relative to prior guidance, just to add on, I think it's really despite a reduction in our housing outlook, although that's still quite strong and robust; despite some delays in those -- and just for projects in the Gulf Coast not coming through this year. Despite those things, which are still demand right there for '15, we're still raising our forecast. And so I think the message -- just that your takeaway should be that our underlying sales momentum, as Tom said, is very, very strong.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Actually, now I was going to ask about the housing piece, so that helps address it. And I guess just my other question would be related to uses of cash moving forward. If you could just maybe prioritize your view on additional bolt-ons, how that pipeline is looking and how you balance those opportunities versus potentially continuing to up the dividend and maybe taking a look at buybacks.", "John R. McPherson", "I'll start and let Tom chime in. We actually have a very attractive pipeline, as we've said before, of bolt-on acquisition opportunities. And those investments are both attractive in their own right and improve the returns from the rest of our asset base. So we'll continue to pursue those in a very sensible and disciplined way, the recent acquisition in the Bay Area being a very good example. But over time, and I think has been -- as has been the legacy of Vulcan, we'll have a balanced mix between reinvesting capital in the business and returning it to shareholders. The exact form of that return, dividend, share repurchase, what have you, is really a board decision and something we'll work through over time, but you can expect us to have a balance of returning cash to shareholders and reinvesting in what we think is the most valuable aggregates footprint and set of market positions, arguably, in the world.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. I guess just one last question. Just quickly, Tom, you mentioned you're starting to see a little bit of trucking constraints in your transportation businesses, supposedly set to address some of those issues. If you could provide a little bit more color around that issue and how significant of a risk this could be as volumes come back into the system potentially faster than anticipated.", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, in this part of the cycle, I think trucking shortages are always out there. We're hearing some rumblings down in some markets. We don't have a lot of concern about that. We have ample trucking resources, but those -- when those shortages happen, they are cured very quickly. The market responds fast, with trucks coming into the market when prices go up. So we don't think there's significant risk when it comes to trucking. Actually, it's probably an opportunity for us because, if there is a shortage, we control, based on our strategy of truck brokerage, a number of those trucks, so we feel like we'll be served first. As far as transportation shortages in rail, again, in this part of the cycle, that's a possibility. We get comfortable with that because we have so much flexibility on numerous rail line, but also, we control our own destiny in a lot of those markets with brown-water and blue-water sources, where we can mix and match supply.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I'm wondering if you gentlemen are willing to step us through what parts of your network have you rolled out the truck brokerage business model. And for areas where you've rolled it out, what's the penetration rate today versus where it could ultimately be? And perhaps you could calibrate us on the margin profile. I guess the standalone truck brokerage companies are running in the mid to high single-digit range, and I'm wondering if you could calibrate us relative to that benchmark.", "James Thomas Hill", "Our trucking business, like our aggregates business, is a local business. Each one is different. Each one is structured different, and the profitability at each one is different. We are active in California. We're active in Texas. We're active with this in the Midwest. We are active within the Southeast. But as far as trying to put a number on the percentage profitability, again, it varies by market and it varies widely by market.", "John R. McPherson", "It is safe to say it's well below, on a percent-of-sales basis, our core stone business, which is why we're trying to give you some transparency to it. But again, reminder, we're not owning trucks. It's very low capital for us. So we think of it as incremental returns to us and, on that basis, very attractive.", "Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, absolutely. I guess that we're just trying to understand how much runway you have in front of you. Maybe you could quantify what proportion of your shipments do you currently handle with the truck brokerage operation in areas where you're relatively far along that process, just so we can think about what the ultimate opportunity from Vulcan's standpoint is.", "James Thomas Hill", "I think, at this point, it's a small percentage of our aggregates. We have a lot of growth in this area. And most importantly, this is to secure transportation and secure customer service as well as lower cost. But we have a long ways to go from a trucking perspective.", "Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I'm wondering if you could talk about, within aggregates, just the cadence of price realizations from here based on the mix of jobs that you have coming up in the back half of the year. Can you just give us a flavor for what you expect to ship based on visibility that you have and how the pricing levels compare versus a year ago?", "John R. McPherson", "Okay, I'll start and let Tom give a little more flavor. As I mentioned in the script, I think what we're seeing week-to-week, month-to-month in pricing is very positive. The climate -- or pricing climate's improving in the vast majority of our markets. It's always a little bit difficult to predict for us the exact cadence because you've heard -- as you've heard us say before, we don't manage pricing in any kind of centralized way. That said, and Tom can give a little bit more flavor, all of the signs across the vast majority of our market, the lights are flashing green in terms of the improving pricing climate. And so again, we're very pleased with the gross profit per ton improvement our guys have delivered, given steady 3% pricing. And we're pretty darn excited about what those numbers can be when we get higher pricing flowing through.", "James Thomas Hill", "We are excited about the pricing momentum. And when I say that is it continues to grow. And part of that is just the feel from our customer base. They are more confident in the market. They're more confident in their profitability, which allows pricing momentum for the aggregates business.", "Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, I'm wondering if you could just touch on the concrete business that you have remaining in the portfolio, where -- can you talk about the competitive landscape in terms of -- I guess, I would think, with cement capacity utilizations improving, we should see greater pricing momentum in concrete than areas where your competitors are vertically integrated. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing pricing accelerating further in concrete, where you are vertically integrated?", "James Thomas Hill", "In the second quarter, we experienced good pricing increases in concrete. We think that, as the residential and nonresidential, the private sector, grows, the margins in our concrete business will continue to grow, just as in aggregates. And we're excited about it.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital Market.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "First question is, Illinois, you call out for the volume strength there, which I suppose might be a little surprising. What's driving the good volume performance there? Is it just good weather after a tough winter?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, good weather always helps, Jack. But what's really driving those volumes is large projects. We've secured and are shipping on a number of large transportation and infrastructure projects and O'Hare airport projects, which is helping our volumes. But we're starting to see the residential improved in West Chicago and think that will come on strong in the next 6 months to the next 18 months.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. I guess this question might be for John. You made a lot of comments around CapEx and the slight increase there. I know you won't give guidance for CapEx for next year, but I mean, do you see more of these types of projects? Do you think CapEx, given volume recovery trends, up a bit over time? Maybe, directionally, some commentary might be helpful.", "John R. McPherson", "Yes, I think, directionally, CapEx is not going to trend up substantially over time on a per-ton basis. Obviously, we'll raise it as we support higher volumes, but nothing that we see, from a, guess I'm going to call it, replacement operating CapEx view, has changed beyond kind of past experience. So I think those trends will continue. We'll continue to have opportunities to invest in growth: capacity additions, additional reserves, additional distribution facilities. And so I think we'll have smart opportunities for adding to our portfolio and for building out our network, but the core CapEx, the core replacement CapEx, those trends, I think, will remain the same.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. Because it seemed like, the increase, you were calling out some very specific opportunities rather than the need to make some broader investments.", "John R. McPherson", "It's more specific -- yes, thank you, John. Let me be more clear. It's more specific opportunities than it's any kind of fundamental change. We just wanted to be complete in the guidance, frankly. So it is additional capacity in Mexico. It's a rail yard in Savannah. It's some additional land and reserves around things we've recently acquired. It's growth- and profit-adding type capital, not any change in our fundamental operating CapEx.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Getting back to some of the truck brokerage revenues you referred to, can you give us any kind of sense of how much that's grown in the year-over-year in the second quarter and how much in the first half?", "John R. McPherson", "I think, let me give you kind of, I'm going to call them, the revenues that are from all of our transportation-related activities. I'm going to -- so the revenues in our aggregates segment that are not from direct stone sales. And just to give you a rough sense, those revenues in the quarter -- and again, this is the revenues in the segment that aren't from -- that you wouldn't get if you multiplied tons times average selling price. And for the quarter, that was on the order of $112 million of revenue. Prior year quarter, that was about $83 million in revenue, so about a 35% increase.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So a good increase. And what would it be for the year-to-year then?", "John R. McPherson", "I don't -- for the year-to-date, I don't have it right here, but we could easily get it to you. I think, for the 6 months ended, it's about $192 million of revenue versus approximately $143 million of revenue in the prior year.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And if we -- that's close enough. I hear what you're saying.", "John R. McPherson", "But again, just to be clear, that's not all trucking. That includes some shipping-related revenue and some other transportation-related revenue.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "No, you did the -- or what's in the aggregates. That's what the [indiscernible]...", "John R. McPherson", "Yes, yes. And...", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "If we go back several years ago, how much has that revenue grown, and just general sense? You don't have to give me specific numbers. How much, in a general sense, has that grown from pick whatever time. Has it been exponential growth? Or is this recent growth we're seeing kind of new?", "John R. McPherson", "I think the trucking components of it, as opposed to some of the shipping components, is exponential growth but, again, starting off a very low base. So I think what we're focused on is less the revenue growth, given the nature of this, and more the incremental gross profit we derive from it. And at the end of the day, it increases the gross profit that we receive per each ton that we sell. And as Tom said, we've got a good ways to go on that incremental gross profit. We're pleased with the results so far, but we're still in the early stages of this effort.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the second question. We've talked a little bit about the highway bill, with the extension through May of next year. Given that it was another short-term extension, going back to the old days of short-term extensions, what are you hearing from the states as they think about spending for next year? Is this changing their plans at all? Or do they just expect something longer extended after this May patch is done?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, first of all, I don't think we're hearing any negativity from the states based on the extension we got. That's a pretty substantial extension to May with the $10.8 billion. So that buys them a lot of time. I think we're all cautiously optimistic that Congress will get a bill done in 2015. There's a lot of momentum in the capital for getting a highway bill, a long-term highway bill with strong funding. And you're seeing both parties in support of a long-term bill with more substantial and more solid funding. So in the states, you're seeing this also, so I don't -- we don't detect any kind of nervous behavior out of the states at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies.", "Michael Betts", "I had 2 questions, if I could, please. The first is just on asphalt. And it had a great first quarter, not such a good second quarter, which you said was due, I think, to delayed projects in the West. I guess I'm trying to look at the outlook for the rest of the year. Is it likely to be more like the second quarter, with anemic growth with pretty much these big projects delayed? And what has caused those delays, if I could ask, please? And then secondly, you mentioned the 4 quarries you've acquired in San Francisco Bay Area. Can you give us some idea of either size of the investments or size of quarries, what sort of -- what we're looking at there? And with the acquisition costs referred to in the second quarter, were they related to that acquisition?", "James Thomas Hill", "Just taking the asphalt first, the jobs are in California. They were state jobs that actually just delayed for the state. It's not that we won't do those jobs. We're just not going to be able to have those jobs in 2014. We'll service those jobs in 2015. We're pleased with our asphalt performance. Over time, it gives us very nice returns. As far as how we see the year going forward, I think our asphalt business will have better quarters than we did in the second quarter, but again, the volume will affect that. The quarries that we purchased in the San Francisco Bay Area, they were -- there were 4 operations, 2 of which were operational. We acquired about 120 million tons of permitted reserves, which, as you know, is very important and hard to do in California. So we're very pleased with them. It's complementary to our operations in the Bay Area, and we look forward to having those operations in the Vulcan family. As far as our price, that's confidential, and we could not reveal that.", "Michael Betts", "Understood. Can you reveal the sort of annual production? Is it a couple of million tons? Is that the sort of level that you're seeing coming out of those at the moment?", "James Thomas Hill", "Probably a little under 1 million tons at this point.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Most of the questions have been answered. So quickly, for the analyst event coming up in September, can you guys give us any sort of high-level thoughts on what investors should expect as we're heading into the event, by chance?", "John R. McPherson", "I think, as you'd expect, we would like to take the advantage just to, frankly, as a new management team and new leadership team, have a chance to interact with the investment community longer than we can in a call or another meeting. And we'd also like to lay out what our vision is as a management team for what the company can do going forward. You should not expect it to be some dramatic announcement of a strategy shift. That's not it, but we would like to tell you where we think the company can get to in 1, 3 and 5 years. So that's the kind of discussion you should expect.", "Operator", "Thank you. Now I would like to turn today's call back over to Tom Hill for some closing remarks.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. We're excited about the markets and the demand going forward. And we look forward to seeing you and talking to you in the third quarter.

My name is Yvette and I will be your coordinator for today's conference. (Operator Instructions).", "I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman, and CEO. Please proceed sir.", "Donald James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results and our outlook for 2010. I am Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. We certainly appreciate your interest in Vulcan and we hope our remarks and dialog will be helpful to you. A replay of this conference call will be available later today at our website.", "With me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Ron McAbee and Danny Shepherd, our Senior Vice Presidents in our Construction Materials Group.", "Before I begin let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "I would like to begin my remarks by discussing our fourth quarter and full year results and then give some comments about why we think 2010 could be another year of solid cash generation.", "The fourth quarter of 2009 presented a very tough operating environment due to a combination of the weak construction economy and significantly adverse weather in most of our markets.", "As a result, sales volumes in the fourth quarter were sharply lower than the prior year. Nevertheless we achieved EBITDA of $99 million and cash earnings of $67 million in the quarter.", "Fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations were a loss of $13 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Aggregate shipments declined 23% compared to the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter, which reduced our EBITDA approximately $69 million from last year. ", "Extremely wet weather in the quarter contributed to lower shipments in key markets in the Mid-Atlantic States in and Southeast in the Mid-west and in the Southwest.", "Ten of the 12 major metropolitan areas served by Vulcan experienced more than twice the number of wet workdays of a year ago. The most notable effects where in Charlotte, Washington DC, Chicago, Atlanta, Birmingham and San Antonio.", "Additionally, aggregate shipments were negatively affected by the uncertainty regarding the timing and duration of an extension of the Federal highway program, which expired September 30, 2009.", "Construction activity on stimulus funded highway projects varied widely in 2009 across the country and in certain key Vulcan states stimulus pending lagged the rest of the country.", "The average unit sales price for aggregates increased 5% in the fourth quarter reflecting price improvement in most of the Vulcan served markets. Markets on the lower end of the range or price increases were California where the average selling price improved 1% and Texas and Florida were pricing declined 1% and 3% respectively.", "Price improvement from the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter benefited somewhat from a more favorable product mix reflecting proportionally greater levels of aggregates used for highway construction particularly pavement improvement.", "Our managers continue to mitigate some of the cost pressures caused by these significantly lower volumes. They maintained production efficiency and reduced cash fixed cost, an additional 8% below last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "Shipment in asphalt and ready mix concrete declined 12 and 31% respectively from the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter due to the same economic factors affecting aggregates. Fourth quarter segment earnings were lower than the prior year due to lower volumes and to lower material margins in both products.", "Selling administrative and general expenses in the fourth quarter declined $6 million from the prior year. This year-over-year decline in overhead cost is due primarily to reductions in employee related expenses, which more than offset a year-over-year increase in project cost of $2.6 million related to the replacement of our legacy IT system.", "Additionally, the current year\u2019s fourth quarter included the expenses of $8.5 million for the fair market value of donated real estate. The prior year\u2019s fourth quarter result included $5.1 million for similar transactions. Excluding the affects of donated real estate SAG expenses declined a 11% versus the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "The difference between the fair value of the donated real estate and the carrying value which was $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year are recorded as a gain on sale of property plant and equipment.", "Employment levels across the company at the end of the fourth quarter are down 11% from the prior year. This reduction in employment across the company is a result of a continued focus on adjusting our production levels and our cost structure to match the weak demand environment as well as to the early effects associated with the rollout of our new shared services IT platform.", "Before making some comments on our outlook for 2010, let me highlight some aspects of our full year results, that maybe of interest. In 2009, our efforts to tightly manage cost and to maintain price discipline offset some of the earnings effect from lower sales volumes.", "Full year net earnings were $30 million, while our cash earnings were $369 million from continuing operations and an additional $12 million from discontinued operations.", "The decrease in aggregate shipment for reduced full year earnings by $334 million. Aggregates pricing increased 3% in 2009 reflecting the attractive fundamentals of our businesses in most of our markets even in this difficult economic environment.", "Finally, let me highlight our cash generation during 2009. Free cash flow in 2009 was $343 million, a significant increase from the $82 million realized last year. This increase in cash was due to our sharp focus on effectively managing those aspects of cash flow that we can control our inflows.", "Additionally, we reduced total debt in 2009 by $810 million, reflecting cash generation from augmented by proceeds from the June equity offering.", "Overall the factors contributing to a challenging outlook for construction activity are principally the continued weakness in private non-residential construction activity and the uncertainties surrounding the timing and the amount of continued funding for the federal multiyear highway program.", "Highway funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act were portioned in the first week of March 2009. Since May, stimulus related funding has increased highway construction awards significantly.", "For the 12 months ending December 2009, awards for new highway projects in the U.S., were up 7% versus the prior year. Record setting awards from May to August, when contract awards exceeded $6 billion each month, reflected good initial progress by the state transportation agencies and starting shovel ready projects intended to stimulate construction activity and create jobs.", "As a result during the second half of 2009, aggregate shipments in some Vulcan-served states such as Illinois and Tennessee were relatively stronger than in other states due in part to more rapid spending of stimulus related funding.", "Other key Vulcan-served states such as Florida, Virginia, California and Georgia lagged other states in awarding and starting stimulus related highway construction in 2009, and as a result aggregate shipments in these states have yet to benefit as much from stimulus funding.", "The varied spending patterns for stimulus projects in individual states depend on several factors including the number of projects each state have that were shovel ready soon after the funds were appropriated, the types of construction projects that each state has elected to pursue, and the projects are in large urban areas involving metropolitan planning organizations where project planning and execution can be more complicated and time consuming.", "In the fourth quarter however contract awards were highway constructions in Vulcan-served stage increased 13% from the prior year compared to a 2% increase in other states.", "We are optimistic by the increased award activity and are encouraged that stimulus related highway projects in Vulcan-served states after a slow start are now moving forward and will benefit demand for our products in 2010.", "As a result we continue to believe that 2010 will be the biggest year for stimulus related highway construction followed by another solid year in 2011.", "Overall our 2010 outlook for aggregate shipment reflects a 10 to 15% increase in aggregates going in the highway and other infrastructure related construction activity due primarily to stimulus related funding and assuming that the FY10 budgeted levels for the regular highway spending are approved by congress within the next few weeks.", "While we have assumed that regular highway funding for highways will remain at an annualized level consistent with FY2009 under safety loop, congress will need to act quickly to restore fiscal year 2010 levels and contract authority prior to the start of construction season this spring.", "Senate leadership is working to introduce its first jobs bill of this session which in its most recent draft includes restoration of FY10 authorized highway funding at $42 billion as previously budgeted and which provides for an extension of that funding until December 31, 2010.", "As part of the package, Senate leadership is working with key Republicans on the finance and the Environmental and Public Works Committees to also return some $20 billion to the Highway Trust Fund in the form of interest previously owed to the fund.", "We are cautiously optimistic that this Bill can pass the Senate. This would be a very important step for the nation on the path to long-term highway funding stability will occur with the ultimate passage of a multi-year highway bill.", "The Senate has already passed the Jobs Bill in December containing similar provisions as they relate to the Highway Trust Fund.", "Residential construction activity should increase year-over-year in 2010 albeit from very low levels.

For the full year 2010 we expect aggregate pricing to improve 2% to 3%.", "Higher aggregate volumes and pricing in 2010 should more than offset a projected 20% increase in cost for diesel fuel. In 2009 our average cost for diesel fuel was $1.94 per gallon.", "In 2010 we expect to consume approximately 40 million gallons of diesel fuel. At this level of diesel fuel consumption a $0.10 per gallon change in the average cost of diesel fuel impacts operating earnings by 4 million per year.", "In our asphalt business we expect sales volumes to increase approximately 5% from 2009 levels. Pricing for asphalt mix is expected to increase from 2009 levels, but not enough to offset projected higher prices for liquid asphalt and aggregates. As a result we expect lower materials margins in asphalt when compared with 2009.", "In concrete, we expect sales volumes to remain flat with the prior year and pricing to decline modestly, reflecting continued weakness in private nonresidential construction.", "We expect full year SAG expense in 2010 to be slightly lower than 2009 due to continuing cost reduction efforts as well as lower costs related to the replacement of legacy IT systems.", "As discussed previously, we have a major project underway to implement new integrated systems in processes to replace our legacy IT system. Along with the legacy system replacement, we are also redesigning related administrative support functions to reduce cost and improved service.", "The project is proceeding as planned. To-date we have successfully installed our new financial systems at the corporate office and in three of our non-operating divisions. Total cost of this project peaked in 2009 as most of the design and development was completed. Implementation will continue into 2010.", "We expect 2010 to be the final year of significant spending with net expense reductions occurring there after. We expect SAG cost related to the ERP project to be approximately $3 million less in 2010 than it were in 2009.", "Cash interest expense for the full year expected to be approximately $175 million based on the current level of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interests on capital projects.", "We will continue to tightly manage capital spending and as a result to expect to spend approximately $125 million in 2010 up slightly from the $110 million we spent in 2009 but down sharply from the $353 million in 2008.", "This continued operations earnings will benefit from a projected $10 million of cash proceeds in 2010 as part of the 5CP earn-out, this earn-out was included as part of the divestiture of our chemicals business several years ago, and will lend in 2012.", "Finally I would like to provide an update regarding recent permitting activity in the Lake Belt in South Florida. Last week the U.S Army Corps of Engineers issued a record of decision in support of mining in the Lake Belt region. Simultaneously the Corps of Engineers began moving ahead with issuing permits. Vulcan should receive its new permit within the next two weeks.", "Based on the record of decision, the company expects that its permit will be for a period of 20 years, will cover 940 acres, and will allow mining in excess of 80 million tons of limestone.", "In closing, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our aggregates focused business, which has a compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S markets that are expected to experience above average growth and aggregates demand for many years into the future. ", "The current construction economy is weak but the economic stimulus plan will help drive earnings growth at Vulcan over the next 2 years to 3 years. Our available production capacity and ongoing efforts to improve cash margins position Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in the $50 billion to $60 billion of stimulus related construction, including significant remaining portions of the $27 billion for highway and bridges in Vulcan-served states.", "The key determinant of highway construction spending for years to come is of course the multiyear federal highway program, which represents a substantial growth opportunity for Vulcan. We along with many business, industry and labor groups are urging congress to act promptly to sustain the momentum from the $27.5 billion provided for highways and bridges by the economic stimulus plan.", "In order to add and save construction jobs in 2010, this broad coalition is currently urging congress for a formal extension of baseline highway funding at FY10 budgeted level of $42 billion, we are also urging congress to do this in time to impact the 2010 construction season. Such legislation will then set the stage later in the year for the development and enactment of the next multi-year surface transportation program.

I\u2019m trying to get a gauge in particular, of how you might think the first quarter, bad weather, shutdowns, not a lot of private construction, is going to look versus the fourth quarter even?", "Donald James", "Well Jack, I think that\u2019s absolutely correct. Highway contracts are not loaded up with a large backlog and they are going to try to do their work in the most favorable weather environment that\u2019s available.", "And, that\u2019s not - we didn\u2019t see that in the fourth quarter and I don\u2019t expect we\u2019ll see it in the first quarter. So, they will, unlike some prior years, in which they had backlogs and needed to get started early, I don\u2019t expect that to happen this year.", "So, I think Q2 and Q3 will be the heaviest part of the construction year for us and our customers. And, as you pointed out, the weather in the fourth quarter was awful and it looks like the weather in the first quarter is even going to be worse on a comparable basis.", "So, I would expect to see that Q2 and Q3 will be major quarters for us in 2010.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "And with regard to pricing guidance up 2% to 3% for 2010, are there markets where you\u2019re going to get a fresh price increase in calendar 2010 where you\u2019ve implemented a price increase and that\u2019s why you expect overall, you\u2019re going to get a modest improvement?", "Donald James", "I think modest is the right word, but yes. Another factor, which we pointed out is the mix shift as a larger proposition of our work is going into stimulus funded highway projects, those are users of the hardest to make, most expensive aggregate sizes we produce and just that mix shift has a positive impact on the reported average selling price.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "And we forget to -- the fact that the Federal Highway Program has been under a serious of continuing resolutions to this point, have you guys seen disruption in flow of work for, I know we are in winter but contract or customers flow of work that that\u2019s been coming out versus maybe expectations just because the regular highway program as you point out has been a bit disrupted?", "Donald James", "Well I would say, it\u2019s been more than a bit disrupted and certainly the flow of bid lettings and contract awards has been severely impacted by the exploration of the regular multi-year highway program on September 30, 2009 and the, shall I say distraction of Congress over other matters including in particular healthcare, they have just not got into it.", "The result is and this period has been worse than prior periods, the funding extensions are only at a level of about $2 billion a month whereas the regular, the budget is for something like $3.6 billion a month, spread equally across the year.", "So they are two big impacts, number one the amount of money being appropriated has been substantially reduced and there are lot of technical reasons for that all of which would be fixed by the bill now pending in the senate and the one that has have been passed in the house.", "And secondly the DLTs have just said we are going to build and award stimulus project, but until there is some clarity in Washington about whether the U.S. is going to have a highway program or a regular multiyear program, it makes absolutely no sense for us to have bill lettings and award new contracts and that\u2019s been going on since mid year 2009, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that Congress address that issue now before we lose the 2010 construction season.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "", "I\u2019ve been calling for other reasons, but I guess I\u2019m calling for that too. SG&A 2010 versus 2009 looks like 2009 you had donated real estate that inflated the reported number, you expect the IT expenses to be down 10 verus 9.

We don't obviously know what the final cost are going to be but in terms of labor productivity, efficiency, cash, cost at our plants all of those things our folks continue to manage aggressively but the real uncertainty about aggregate production cost in 2010 is all about diesel fuel prices.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs", "So, if you get the two points of price but you're looking forward it doesn't have more than offset the diesel fuel cost or are there were some other --?", "Donald James", "Yes, if we get a little volume growth and our current outlook is -- it will be flat to up five so if we get low volume growth we get the price improvement.", "Our cash margins will certainly continue to improve and Jerry this is Don and in addition as we've noted the cash fixed costs have been coming down in almost every quarter but they have not been decline as fast as the volume has declined. I would expect on the uptick likewise that those cash fixed costs will now grow as fast as volume grows going out of this as well.", "We think that, as we've said to you and others before, we're in great shape with respect to cash margin if we can just get a little bump in volume we will see the results very shortly. It's all about volume for us at this point.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs", "Can you talk about what kind of price increases are you seeing at ready-mixed customers putting through in areas where you're not vertically innovated. Can I absorb that two to three points of price increases that you're targeting for next year or this year?", "Donald James", "Well, we haven't said that the 2% to 3% price increase will be to ready-mix customers.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs", "But I guess there\u2019s a substantial part of the equation where you get --?", "Donald James", " ", "We have said our own ready-mix prices are likely to be down in 2010 compared to 2009. I think the focus of price -- overall reported priced improvement for 2010 will be in highway construction markets.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs", "Can you talk about what kind of price increases you saw in January year-over-year, and now that month is in the books?

We just don\u2019t give monthly pricing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Timna Tanners - UBS.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "", "Just wanted to follow up with some of other questions. If we look at the government spending, it sounds like it's going to be critical for 2010. How important do you think it is for a longer term extension to the safety loop -- a successor have a resolution to the highway trust fund?", "Meaning do we need to have a solution to how we\u2019re going to pay for roads to actually get this extension any longer, I'm wondering.", "Daniel Sansone", "I think the extension can be fully funded. The extension through 2010, that\u2019s part of the jobs bill that passed the house and its part of pending legislation in the senate -- through 2020 the highway trust fund can be fully funded by credit in the interest that was pulled out of the highway trust fund and used in other portions of government.", "So that part is okay, I think to actually get a fully funded new six year federal highway bill there will need to be some revenue streams, the existing revenue streams will have to grow as a result of economic recovery and then all likelihood there will need to be some incremental revenue streams dedicated to the highway trust fund.", "I think that the practical reality isn\u2019t until the economy begins to recover it is very unlikely that congress or the administration is going to advocate any higher fuel tax or other incremental revenue streams in the highway trust fund.", "That\u2019s why we think getting the extension through the end of 2010 is the important first step and then hopefully beginning later this year perhaps in the fourth quarter the conversation about the next six year bill and funding met bill will become key topic.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Then you talked about, it's really interesting that $2 billion a month is being funded in extension where the budget would be for a higher value. The difference between those two numbers, if I understood you right, what happens to those dollars, are they still being saved somewhere or they go away?", "Donald James", "Well part of the problem is the recession that occurred with the exploration of the safety loop in September 30 that had an impact on contract authority. So its, there are lot of technicalities but the reality is twofold.", "One is, without a formal extension the DOTs are sitting and secondly the amount of money currently available for reimbursement to the states is reduced as a result of the - even though it\u2019s in the budget for 2010, because of the technical problems that need to be solved by Congress, that 2010 budgeted number is simply not available to the state DOTs except in a substantially reduced level.", "So, it is a legislative problem that normally gets fixed. I think healthcare, as I said earlier, has diverted the attention and has obviously polarized Congress. And so, we\u2019re hopeful that this Senate portion of the jobs bill, which they are breaking into individual pieces, we think the piece that will contain the restoration and the correction of the highway trust fund, hopefully, will be the first significant piece of bi-partisan legislation that gets passed.", "But, the snowstorms in Washington have slowed that activity somewhat. But it\u2019s on the agenda and hopefully, stay tuned over the next two to three weeks and see how that moves.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "On the Lake Belt discussion that you had, does it sound like we should be thinking about that as a longer-term story in (asphalt) given the situation in Florida? Can you talk a little bit more about that?", "Donald James", "Well, as I indicated the core has moved forward with new permits. Some have already been issued, others are being issued even as we speak to the producers in the Lake Belt. We obviously can\u2019t control, what if anything will happen with respect to any new challenge to those permits, but the court did an extraordinarily good job researching the issues, addressing the issues raised in the prior litigation, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be some further judicial proceedings there.", "One of the other aspects, one of the things the court did to address some of the concerns raised in the prior litigation was to take larger setbacks between the areas to be mined in the Lake Belt and the Everglades and that has taken some slice of the reserve from the long term Lake Belt mining out of the picture, that law become clearer I think once the remaining permits get issued.", "But at this point, mining will be able to resume under the new permits in the Lake Belt, as you know it\u2019s been shut down for most of 2009 and we\u2019ll go from there, demand of course remains very weak, so there is not a huge incentive to crank production up to high levels by any of the producers, we don\u2019t believe.", "But we\u2019ll monitor that, but at this point I would expect as the construction season moves forward we will all see a resumption of production in the Lake Belt quarries.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Finally for me on that goodwill impairment question that people always seem to ask every quarter. Is there anything new to think about there, how you are looking at the Florida rock asset?", "Don James", "Well we have done our impairment testing and we have concluded that we don\u2019t have any impairment issues for 2010 that of course that process goes on every quarter. But the big impairment testing is as of the end the year and we completed that and I believe there is no impairment.", "I think one of the things Timna is a recognition that a substantial portion of the Florida Rock aggregates and assets were not in Florida, though while Florida has been extraordinarily weak, Florida was a portion of Florida Rocks assets and operations, but it was certainly very large portion outside of Florida in Georgia, Virginia, Maryland, Alabama. So it\u2019s not all about Florida.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "", "I think the big question that everyone has today is how we are able to achieve 5% pricing when some of peers were would not able to achieve that and it's going to see to some extent could you discuss how much your in-market mix geography and other item played into pricing, that\u2019s in bottom beyond the highway mix that you talked about in your prepared comments.", "Donald James", "", "Well, I think reported pricing as we've said in previous quarters is a function of not only prices of individual products in individual markets, it\u2019s also a function of geographic mix shift and a product mix shift.", "So I think your question is right on point. We were very happy to see our pricing in California be up 1%, which was good news after some periods of declining pricing. California has very good -- in absolute terms pricing for aggregate and that helped.", "I think as we indicated the mix going into stimulus projects and shovel ready projects is highly focused on (inaudible) asphalt stone as opposed to lot of base material and also relatively low respect material that would be going into housing and things like that.", "So there was a mix shift in 2009 compare to our historical, there will be a mix shift in 2010 compared to '09 into our historical. And I think the mix shift is moving toward highway construction which is our sweet spot and for companies that are most focused on concrete.", "It's a tougher environment for pricing as I drive to indicate in our earlier - we have to keep our concrete customers competitive, and so it's market-by-market, product-by-product, customer-by-customer challenge and our guys have done a really good job looking for places where we can still get modest price increases and I think that\u2019s reflected in our numbers in the quarter and for the full year.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "And thinking of your end market breakout, it's obviously shifted a great deal between res, non-res and public since the peak of the market. Looking to 2010, what is your estimation for the breakout of res, non-res and public as percentage of your total revenue?", "Donald James", " ", "We have not done a precise attempt at calculating that. I would say generally highways and other public infrastructure will be well north of 50% of our projected in 2010. Housing will move up but from a very low base probably in the mid teens. Private non-res will move down probably in the 20% plus or minus range.", "Public buildings have certainly much more streak than the private buildings. So that\u2019s a very rough estimate but I would expect that we will see more than our historical average going into publicly funded projects in 2010, which is a positive for us I think.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "", "Great, and turning to one other follow-up question on the impact of pricing, I know there\u2019s been some talk about managing inventories and base inventories and the overall impact on pricing", "Are you running into any issues and managing overall inventories and no you haven\u2019t said that in prepared comments but it seems to be that you guys are doing a good job on that? Could you talk a little bit about your inventory management, particularly managing that base inventory?", "Donald James", "Well our guys have been aggressively managing inventory levels for at least the last 18 months and setting up their plants to maximize the production of products that are currently in demand and minimizing the production of the products that are not in strong demand.", "And the ability to do that from quarry to quarry depends in part on the geologic formation and depends in part on the plant design and construction and it depends in part on the operating expertise of the plant folks, the plant manager and area manger and the people who work in the plants.", "So it is clear to us that we need to focus our efforts on managing our production processes to maximize the production of what's currently in demand and minimize the production of what's not.", "At this point we don\u2019t see any material impact on our financial results from the shift in demand but that just hadn\u2019t happened automatically that\u2019s been a result of the hell a lot of focus of people who know how to run plants different ways and I can assure you I'm not very helpful in that regard but thank goodness there are lot of people in our organization who are.", "Kathryn, the overwriting inventory guidance through out the company has been, if in doubt (inaudible) the facility for cash generation. So, we have at every turn, opted to, wherever possible, not spend the cash to keep the dollars invested and inventory low, even though to put some inventory on the ground would boost short-term GAAP reported earnings.", "Donald James", "Right, and that\u2019s a real focus. And I want to reiterate what Dan said, and that\u2019s an excellent point. Building excess inventories doesn\u2019t generate cash. It consumes cash. It does help your GAAP earnings, but we\u2019re really focused on cash and we do that historically. But we have really focused on that issue in this downturn.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "And the final question relates to volumes. First, do you see any improvement in volumes in certain markets, certain geographies and how much did weather impact your overall volumes and therefore margins in the previous quarter?", "Daniel Sansone", "Well, the fourth quarter was terrible from a weather standpoint. I guess it could be worse. But we were really wet for extended periods of time in most of our large key markets as I have indicated.", "Weather hadn\u2019t improved quarter-to-date in the first quarter. I think in response to Jack Kasprzak\u2019s question, we certainly would expect -- volumes that didn\u2019t get shipped in the fourth quarter, we don\u2019t expect them to get shipped in the first either.", "So, those will likely - we will hopefully see the results of those beginning in Q2 when a lot of this stimulus work that was slow coming out of the box in a lot of our key states, begins to happen.", "It is really interesting to look at the level of stimulus spending state-by-state as a percentage of total and look at what happened to our aggregates volumes in those states and two of our strongest markets in the second half of 2009 were Tennessee and Illinois and when you look at the stimulus spending as a percent of the total in those two states, they were among the highest in the country.", "There were some other northern states like in New England and the upper Mid-West that also had high spend out numbers. But the warm weather states who were, for various and sundry reasons doing different kinds of work or doing more work in cities rather than rural areas, Florida and California in particular but also as we pointed out Georgia and Virginia.", "The vast majority of their spending is in front of them. So that hold the different spend out patterns is certainly showing up in our markets both plus and minus.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "Then, that we will know that strictly with our DOT work and things had sniffed outside in those states into 2010. I guess my final question, parting question, I know that the appellate courts ruled in favor of the Florida judge what does this really mean for Lake Belt especially in light of the core of engineers issuing permit?", "Donald James", "Take off my lawyer\u2019s hat, which is old and tired now and probably completely irrelevant put on my practical hat, and I think practically the judge's opinion was taken into account and fully addressed by the core of engineer record of decision.", "So at this point we think it is the new core permits that's relevant and that the litigation is essentially behind us.

I just wondering if there was -- what the remedy it could be is there point where you just decided to shut down production or really just how you view those businesses?", "Donald James", "", "Well, I think asphalt is a different story than concrete in 2010. I think asphalt markets will be improved. The issue with asphalt is what liquid asphalt prices are going to do. It\u2019s very much the same as diesel fuel and that is - that\u2019s affected so much by the global economy and by demand for co-products.", "So at this point we\u2019re projecting at least in our outlook we\u2019re projecting much higher or significantly higher liquid asphalt cost in 2010, hopefully that is somehow mitigated during the course of the year but at this point we're looking at a higher numbers.", "But demand for asphalt is expected to be up, it's just the relationship between the cost of liquid asphalt and our ability to pass that through in pricing and the timing differential between those two areas basically we have to buy liquid asphalt now almost on spot basis and we price our material on a contract basis.", "And so there is often a lag between out ability to pass through increases and when liquid asphalt falls it improved our margins because we have priced at higher numbers and the actual spot price goes down and so that's really the story on asphalt.", "Concrete is a - and cement is a function of demand and demand for both of those products are low because private non-risk construction is down. Hopefully, some strength in housing will - in 2010 will help demand for concrete and therefore cement but until we start seeing significant recovery in housing and see a bottoming of private non-risk construction, concrete markets are tough and there's no way around that.", "Daniel Sansone", "", "Let me add one other point that the tail end of your question asked whether or not we would be shutting some of those operations down because of low margins. Let me remind you that virtually every asphalt and concrete operation that we have is tied to a Vulcan aggregate plant and we're selling Vulcan aggregate through those operations.", "So the decisions to operate or shut down one of those downstream facilities; have to include the impact it has back on our aggregates business. And just to put it in perspective, in 2009 the asphalt and concrete segment numbers had an EBITDA margin of around 14%, but embedded in that is the aggregates that are used to produce that product that we also produced and our aggregate segment had a EBITDA margin of around 38% or 39%.", "So there\u2019s a significant pull-through of aggregate's profitability tied to those operations. So the decision to operate or shut down a plant is not solely based on the reported margin for asphalt or concrete.", "Adam Rodrigo \u2013 Wells Fargo", "And then just one quick modeling question, can you provide any guidance on tax rate, 2010?", "Donald James", " ", "I guess the first guidance I would give you is do not think about it as a percentage because when you get down to the relatively small numbers that we\u2019re reporting right now, and you consider some of the permanent differences that this industry enjoys specifically statutory depletion, thinking about a tax rate in percentage terms is pretty difficult.", "The way I would advise you to think about it is more in dollar terms. And let me just try to give you a little color, 2009 -- I'll talk here about the full year number not the fourth quarter, we reported a pre-tax loss of $19 million for the full year, and we reported tax benefit of $38 million.", "The reason for that is that our aggregate business is still profitable and still handsomely profitable, and still generates a significant statutory depletion benefit, which is permanent difference, it's essentially a tax a credit that can be applied back against previous tax payments or carried forward against future tax payments. So we still record that, that was a $20 million benefit that we enjoyed in 2009. ", "So and then, there was - in 2009 there was about another $5 million of tax benefit that\u2019s ongoing if you will referable to accounting for our foreign operations and another 5 or $6 million of a couple of other items that again are generally ongoing.", "So what will happen in the future is assuming our aggregate business rebounds, we'll get some incremental margin from that, obviously will generate some incremental tax on that at the normal 38, 39% kind of a rate but we will also get a sizable amount of additional depletion benefit to offset some of that regular tax.", "So I think the way to model it is, this is kind of roll forward from where we were in 2009 and almost do a line-by-line kind of an estimate of the big components, and the really big components that are going to drive the tax provision in dollars year-over-year will be depletion benefit and tax at the marginal rate kind of offsetting each other.", "When volume comes back a little bit we'll get back into a more steady state where the tax rate in percentage terms is more meaningful. But right now in percentage terms it doesn\u2019t tell you much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Garik Shmois - Longbow Research.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Just quickly, I know you've provided in the past can you offer the average cost for a liquid asphalt during the quarter?", "Donald James", "You mean in the fourth quarter?", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "That\u2019s correct.", "Donald James", "Somewhere in the - little over $400 a ton. Maybe between $400 and $410.", "Daniel Sansone", "Actually it was just a shade under $400. I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right. It was just -- $400 to $410 is the right number.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "", "Okay. So, relatively flat compared to the third quarter if I remember?", "Donald James", "Right.", "Daniel Sansone", "Right. And much lower than a year ago.", "", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "For modeling purposes, would you anticipate the increase in liquid asphalt to occur also in the second and third quarters as seasonally (Multiple Speakers)?", "Donald James", "I can't. I\u2019m not that clever to be able to do it. I think for the full year we\u2019re looking at a 20% - 25% increase in liquid asphalt. Hopefully, that won\u2019t occur, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got built into our numbers.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Lastly, can you just talk about the impact of diesel on the competitive environment? With your expectations it will be up 20% this year. Would you anticipate that it might price out competitors who have been moving into some of your markets, who had been more willing to travel longer distances because diesel was low in 2009? So you think it could reverse it and make the playing field a little bit --?", "Donald James", "Well, I think on the margin, it matters. But, it is only on the margin and I think we believe that higher diesel prices, while they increase our cost, also increase our opportunity to get somewhat higher pricing in there, there is a pass through effect and then there is a delivery cost effect.", "So I think on the margin that may have an impact, but certainly we haven\u2019t built anything into our outlook for 2010 other than the cost impact, we haven\u2019t built any volume or price impact from higher diesel fuel prices in [them].", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace - Avondale Partners.", "Ted Grace - Avondale Partners", "Just as a follow-up on the cost side of things. Hoping you can provide some more color on margins, specifically if you look at fourth quarter aggregate decrementals, kind of a market sequential degradation, on a reported basis they went from 40% decrementals to 48%.", "If you were to just back out the improvement, sequential improvement in pricing you are probably looking at 55% decrementals just in the aggregate piece of the business. So wondering if there is an explanation that you could share, where or some one time items that were kind of hit the quarter or if there is a notable step up, just kind of walk through the puts and takes and similarly going to that same math on the asphalt and concrete side, where you saw something similar?", "Donald James", "I would say it is hazardous to try to compare Q3 cost to Q4. I think it\u2019s much better to compare Q4 to Q4 because as we have said we not only everything we sell is consumed outside but everything we produce is produced outside and the fourth quarter is a tough production quarter as well as a tough shipment quarter.", "I think when you -- it\u2019s a much better to look at cost over the course of a year than from quarter-to-quarter or one or certainly when you start comparing first quarters and fourth quarters you can get distortions. Go ahead Dan.", "Daniel Sansone", "", "Maybe try to give you -- come out at a slightly different way. If you look at what we call our variable margin which is difference between average selling price and our variable cost and again the variable cost in our definition is all cash cost.", "Whether you are looking at the fourth quarter or the full year in comparison to the same periods in 2008, what you see is our variable margin is basically flat. If you go a little deeper into the income statement and look at our cash margin, this is for aggregates -- look at our cash margin for aggregates and the difference there is it\u2019s the selling price less our total cash cost.", "So you are factoring in now the affect of what we would characterize as cash fixed costs. You see that the -- for the full year we had a 1.5 to 2 percentage point margin shrink and I mentioned earlier the phenomenon is that for the year our unit shipments were down 26% and our cash fixed costs were down about 14%.", "So you have that leverage, that adverse leverage effect that\u2019s really volume driven that being -- that\u2019s offsetting the full effect of the average pricing increased and then of course if you go down to the gross profit as we reported just now, the big effect on margin there is going to be just much less absorption of the non-cash depreciation expense.", "Ted Grace - Avondale Partners", "Just in terms of the M&A landscape, any update on kind of what you're seeing there in terms of packages coming on the market, any recent transactions that - have anything notable on them and what's your expectation would be for kind of the first half of this year?", "Donald James", "There seems to be a lot of noise about M&A but almost no deals that are getting close. There is one that I believe is closed, I'll wait on the people involve to announce it if they intent to but.", "So there's some activity that was not something that we had an interest in it overlapped several of our markets but - and there's a little bit of noise floating around but we don't see a whole lot of transactions that are likely to happen at least in the first half of the year.", "We have sold one small non-strategic asset and may have one or two others that we will sell. We bought a couple of quarries in 2009 that we're in markets for us. So there\u2019s some activity but it's not big. Now what happens going forward for the full year, I don't know at this point. But I don't see a whole lot of big deals happening.", "Ted Grace - Avondale Partners", "Sure, based on what you have seen or even just chatter, any sense for kind of where multiples are these days?", "Donald James", "I think for aggregates they remain very high, which is appropriate I think depending on the magnitude of the downstream products and the markets they\u2019re in and that sort of thing, you can get a different EBITDA multiple.", "But if you look in pure aggregates view, you have an EBITDA multiple for transactions, which is comparable to or better than the trading multiple, public companies that are aggregates focused.", "So things are not getting cheaper, which would be silly for anybody to sell something that\u2019s got good long term reserves and a good market at a low price. This too will pass.", "Ted Grace - Avondale Partners", "Sure, and then just a last thing on M&A, are you seeing new entrants? And I guess I've heard anecdotes of certainly much of private equity backed companies as well as some individuals, some of whom you probably knew well. Wondering how you could kind of shape the competitive landscape on them?", "Donald James", "Well, I think probably when it does clears, there will be a couple of acquisitions by private equity funded groups, they\u2019re buying existing facilities. So in that sense it doesn't change the competitive landscape. I would expect private equity funded operations to be very disciplined from the standpoint of pricing and cash flow, which I think on balance, will be helpful.", "So I don\u2019t see it as a problem, I see it as probably on balance a plus, I don\u2019t think you are seeing private equity funds trying to go out and (inaudible) Greenfield quarries, they are just buying ones that happen to be sale for one reason or another.", "Ted Grace - Avondale Partners", "I guess I've heard discussion that Bakers are out doing their own thing and is it true they don\u2019t have a non-compete against Vulcan after selling Florida Rock?", "Donald James", "Well the individual members of the Baker family who do not work for Vulcan, do not have a non-compete, I think that\u2019s correct. We have, we actually sold the Bahamas quarry to a, okay that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s floating around out there. But I don\u2019t know whether the Bakers had actually bought anything or not at this point, I'm not aware that if they have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "", "On the price in the shift and mix, in the move to more highway construction, so Don, you understand that the shift was more towards the asphalt stone as opposed to base material both of which would be used in building a road, but one of which is more expensive and the other is pretty much non expensive, right?", "Donald James", "Well, there is a difference in the price because there is a difference in the production costs. There is certainly a difference in the competitive environment with respect to high spec surface mix, lets say, for over (inaudible) highways compared to base material that go under the highways. So yes, that\u2019s (inaudible).", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "So, as you\u2019re looking forward to 2010 and looking at additional highway work from the stimulus as a tailwind on price with regard to the way the mix goes, that would imply that you\u2019re looking for more overlay type stone and not a big increase in base. Is that a reasonable takeaway there?", "Donald James", "It is to some extent, although, if you look at the projects being built in some of the states that were slow to get started, like Florida, Florida is doing less overlay and more lane additions. And, lane additions use base, whereas overlays don\u2019t.", "So, there are a lot of variations by project type, by state and where they are in their spending. So, it\u2019s not to say that every project that will be built in 2010 is an overlay project.", "There will be some other work, some of which will use base. But I think your premise is largely correct that asphalt will be in significantly greater demand relative to other types of material that we produce.", "", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "So, say a little bit longer term, not focused on 2010, but I mean are we setting up at some point for a real sort of snap back in terms of days coming back as a larger part of the mix, where we get back to kind of a maybe a more normal highway market, if such a thing can be considered to exist anymore.", "And when that happens, I mean do you think that has a potential to really be a drag on reported prices?", "Donald James", "I don\u2019t think so and I\u2019ll refer you back to prior periods in which the economy has come back or the renewal of a multi-year Federal Highway Program which gives the DOTs the opportunity to do bigger projects which use more base as they drill either new lines or new construction.", "In those markets we get much stronger price increases than we are projected to get in 2010. So while there is a mix shift the overall growth in demand really helps our overall pricing opportunity.", "Daniel Sansone", "And it helps our production cost as well because it, a normalized product mix of asphalt material, concrete stone and base material becomes more plant production friendly than the environment we are in right now. So it\u2019s easier to set up the plants and you\u2019ll enjoy better productivity.", "Donald James", "So if you are concerned that a return to normalized highway construction activity will result in declining pricing for Vulcan I believe that concern is misplay.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "Okay, and I was sort of going to lead back around the margin question that Dan just answered, which is that, both in terms of productivity that\u2019s going to help, but to what extent do you feel like you have low cost inventory of base loaded in right now.", "Is it been kind of a perceptible shift downward in your -- in the cost per ton of the base in your inventory at this point?", "Donald James", "", "I don\u2019t think so I mean we\u2019ve been trying to produce less base, but\u2026", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "", "You guys stop capitalizing this cost at a certain point?", "Daniel Sansone", "", "Well, if there is a substantial excessive quantity of one particular size, yeah our procedures well, are such that we will not capitalize those costs, but at the end of the day we as Don mentioned earlier we have not had a dramatic impact on our reported cost to earnings this year as a result of that.", "And when you are not cost individual sizes separately, so there is, we cost all stone at the same at the same unit value.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "", "In the quarter there was a gain on sale to PPNE, can you tell me what was in there?", "Daniel Sansone", "", "Well, we tend to fund our charitable foundation with contributions of appreciated real estate that is a significant tax benefit to do it that way. I think we had about a $8.5 million of fair market value of real estate contributed to our foundation on the fourth quarter compared to about $5.1 million. I think a year ago.", "The way that works is that the fair market value of real estate becomes an SAG expense and then the gain between the book value of the donated real estate and the fair market value becomes a gain on sale.", "So you've got both those things running through there which really essentially offset each other. So there's really not a net gain from those kinds of transactions --", "Donald James", "If you eliminate, if you skip out the donations that are recorded in the gain on sale line in the fourth quarter of 2009 there is only about $6 million or $7 million of other gains and most of that is represented by a single property sale in one of our divisions, the rest are just miscellaneous items.", "So I think the point is, you shouldn't look at property gains and subtract those some earnings unless you also subtract the SAG expense associated with that contribution, so it's almost a watch.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "", "There was also some asset sale for sale on the balance sheet on the balance sheet is that same theme?", "Donald James", "Well, I mentioned we got - we're looking at non-strategic assets and that's one of them.", "Operator", "I will like to turn the call over to Mr. Don James for closing remarks.", "Donald James", "Thank you very much for joining us today. I think the message in the fourth quarter and for full year is, markets are weak, Vulcan's management team is focused on doing what we can to generate cash and manage our business effectively and position ourselves to be able to respond very positively when there is some increase in overall demand as we look forward to 2010 that is most likely to come from public infrastructure projects particularly stimulus projects with some kicker for hopefully improvement in housing construction. Private non-res continues to be weak.", "Overall I think we are well positioned to benefit significantly once we start seeing some overall volume growth. Hopefully we will see that when we report earnings at the end of 2010. But that\u2019s -- the real key to earnings recovery and earnings growth for Vulcan is some recovery in volumes in our markets.", "We are working hard to both manage our production operations, our sales and marketing strategy and in this climate our government relation's efforts to try to get some stability in federal highway funding.", "So thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan and your attendance today in this conference call. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

Morgan", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Vulcan Materials' Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Frances, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.", "We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss our 2007 results and our outlook for 2008. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials Company. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan. We hope our remarks and dialogue will be helpful to you. A replay of this conference call will be available later today at our website.", "Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.", "Description to these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date here of and the company assume no obligation to update such statements.", "Vulcan achieved record results in a challenging economic environment. These record results included net sales of more than $3 billion, operating cash flows of approximately $700 million, operating earnings of $714 million and EBITDA of $982 million.", "Despite weaker demand for our products, principally from residential construction, these results underscore the fundamental strength and resiliency of our businesses. To put this in perspective, a historic look back five years ago might be informative. The comparison to 2002 results is worth noting for two reasons. First, higher earnings on similar levels of aggregate shipments and more importantly what our current profitability could mean to margin improvement when volumes began to recover.", "In 2007, the absolute level of aggregate shipments were similar to 2002's level. Construction activity in 2002 is hampered by an economic slowdown calls by the tech bubble in the 2001, 2002 timeframe. And as a result our aggregates shipments in 2002 had declined 8% from the prior year. Aggregates shipments in 2007 excluding the Florida Rock acquisition were down 11% versus the prior year due to weakness in residential construction, and were slightly more than the shipment levels we had in 2002.", "However, if we look at financial results over the same time period, net sales increased 56%, but more importantly earnings per share from continuing operations more than doubled and operating earnings as a percent of sales increased 410 basis points. I believe this ability to achieve good results during weak demand and better results as demand improves is routed in the fundamental strengths of our aggregates focused business. And even though we expect 2008 to be another year of challenging market conditions, we believe record results were achievable and we will continue to position our business for additional earnings growth when volumes begin to recover.", "Another 2007 highlight is the acquisition of Florida Rock Industries, which we closed on November 16th, 2007. This acquisition which included significant aggregate reserves in attractive markets, continuous our long-term strategy to position our company in markets where reserves are limited and where demand for aggregates is expected to grow at above average rates. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.66 in 2007 reflecting an estimated $0.32 per share reduction referable to the Florida Rock acquisition. Earnings from continuing operations in 2006 were $4.81 per diluted share and included a gain of $0.17 resulting from an increase in the carrying value of the ECU earn-out we received as part of the disposition of our chemical's business. The current year's corresponding gain was $0.01 per share. Exclusive of Florida Rock in the ECU earn-out 2007 earnings per share increased approximately 7% from the 2006 level of $4.97 or $24.97 [ph].", "Vulcan's legacy businesses performed well in 2007 despite lower volumes in all major product lines. Higher earnings and aggregates and asphalt more than offset lower concrete earnings. Net sales decreased approximately 1%. In legacy Vulcan operations aggregate pricing in 2007 increased approximately 13% with all major markets realizing double-digit price increases above the 2006 levels. Aggregate shipments declined 9% from the prior year. Vulcan served markets in Texas, the Midwest and along the Gulf Coast, saw volume declines in the low single digits. Other markets, such as California, Florida, Washington, D.C. and Phoenix were more negatively affected by weakness in residential construction.", "The unit production cost for aggregates increased from the prior year due mostly to higher depreciation expense and the impact of lower production levels. Steps taken during the year to mitigate cost increases associated with lower production levels and higher energy prices helped improve our second half earnings. Depreciation increased from the prior year due to higher capital spending to improve production efficiency and increased production and distribution capacity in key markets. These projects have good returns and will benefit our aggregates business as volumes begin to recover.", "Asphalt earnings increased significantly more than offsetting lower concrete earnings from Vulcan's legacy concrete operations. Asphalt prices increased 12% from the prior year more than offsetting the earnings effect of a 9% decline in volumes and higher cost for the aggregates that we supplied internally. Concrete prices increased approximately 6% from the prior year despite a 30% decline in shipments from 2006 levels. The earnings affect from lower volumes and higher costs for key raw materials such as cement and internally supplied aggregates more than offset the price increase. Although lower earnings were disappointing, the continued resiliency in ready-mix concrete prices is encouraging in the context of weaker demand from residential construction.", "Selling, administrative and general expenses were $290 million in 2007, compared to $264 million in the prior year. The Florida Rock acquisition accounted for approximately $12 million of this year-over-year increase. As I indicated earlier, we closed the Florida rock transaction on November the 16th. Historical comparisons for the Florida Rock business were difficult because we have rapidly integrated the businesses.", "And our results include Florida Rock only for a six-week year-end stub period in the fourth quarter. Generally this period of the year is characterized by seasonally low sales levels. In contrast, depreciation, interest and overhead expense are essentially the same as in other calendar periods of comparable length. Thus the earnings per share impact for such a short period can be distorted.", "2007 earnings impact of Florida Rock includes operating results for the stub period that Vulcan owned the business, interest expense associated with the financing of the transaction, additional shares issued as part of the transaction, one-time expenses associated with executing the transaction and integrating the businesses and depreciation associated with the write-up of assets to fair market value due to purchase accounting.", "Specifically, 2007 results include approximately $0.13 per share due to one-time transaction related items, $0.12 per share related higher interest expense attributable to the additional debt incurred upon the transaction and $0.07 per share due to the effect of additional shares issued in conjunction with the transaction. Of the $0.32 per share dilution for the full year, approximately $0.28 was incurred in the fourth quarter.", "In the fourth quarter legacy Vulcan operating earnings, excluding Florida Rock decreased from the prior-year's fourth quarter due to slightly lower results for aggregates and asphalt and sharply lower concrete results. Pricing in all three product lines increased despite lower volumes. Our prices for aggregates, asphalt and concrete were mostly offset by lower production levels and the sharp increase in energy costs. Aggregate shipments in the fourth quarter decreased 12% from last year's fourth quarter.", "However, some of our markets were relatively stable experiencing flat or slightly better shipping levels when compared with the prior year's fourth quarter. This relatively greater volume occurred in lower price markets of the Midwest in Texas and the Central Gulf Coast and dampened the year-over-year price increase as a result of the shift in geographical mix. For legacy Vulcan, the average price for aggregates excluding freight to remote distribution sites increased 9% from the prior-year's fourth quarter.", "Aggregates unit cost of sales were higher than in the fourth quarter of 2006, due mostly to higher depreciation expense, lower production volumes as well as increased cost for energy. Compared to other industries with large continuous process plants aggregates facility have the flexibility to increase or decrease production relatively efficiently. In response to lower demand, we reduced aggregates production levels 10% compared to the second half of 2006. While this action negatively impacted third and fourth quarter unit cost, it reduced our year end inventory levels and provided us greater flexibility to respond effectively to changes in demand as we move forward. Unit cost for diesel fuel in the fourth quarter increased 41% from the prior year's fourth quarter, lowering pretax earnings approximately $10 million.", "Fourth quarter asphalt earnings declined slightly from the prior-year. Higher prices offset most of the earnings effect from lower volumes, higher unit cost for liquid asphalt, and higher transfer prices for internally supplied aggregates. Legacy Vulcan concrete earnings in 2007's fourth quarter declined sharply from the 2006 fourth quarter level due mostly to lower sales volumes. Concrete prices increased slightly. Higher pricing was more than offset by the lower volumes as well as higher costs for cement, and for aggregate supplied internally from our quarries.", "Before we discuss the details of our 2008 outlook, let me first say that we will now report financial results in three segments based on the product lines of aggregates, asphalt and concrete, and cement. Turning to our outlook for 2008, while market conditions remain uncertain particularly for residential construction, we expect another year of record results for Vulcan Materials. Leading indicators such as contract awards for new project show public and private non-residential construction in Vulcan served markets continued to grow and to lead other US markets.", "Highway awards in Vulcan served markets have increased approximately 15% annually for the last two years in nominal terms. This growth rate compares favorably with other US markets where awards have increased approximately 6% annually. Some of this increased spending for highways is being offset by higher cost for construction inputs including steel and energy-related costs such as liquid asphalt and diesel fuel.", "Contract awards for other public and private infrastructure projects such as sewers, waste water, power and utility projects across the US increased in 2006 and again in 2007. Non-residential building construction awards in Vulcan served markets also outperformed other US market led by office buildings and manufacturing plants. While some private nonresidential categories that are more closely linked to residential activity such as stores, saw contract awards decline in 2007, Vulcan served markets held up better than other US markets.", "Obviously the greatest uncertainty remains in the residential construction sector where 2008 likely will be another year of double-digit declines in activity. However this year-over-year decline will be from a much lower level of construction activity given the historic drop off already realized. As a result, our shipments will be less sensitive to further weakness in residential construction in 2008.", "Let me illustrate this point using our 2007 legacy shipments as the starting point. In 2006, our aggregate shipments to residential construction were about 64 million tons or 25% of our total shipments. In 2007, we estimate that our aggregate shipments into residential construction brought to about 19% of our total shipments or 43 million tons, a decline of 21 million tons out of the total 27 million ton reduction we saw in 2007.", "If aggregates demand in residential construction in our markets were to decline another 15% in 2008, our aggregate shipments would decline 6.6 million tons, far less than the 21 million ton decline from 2006 to 2007.", "Overall, we expect aggregates demand in our markets for infrastructure projects and for non-residential buildings to increase slightly in 2008. The broad use of aggregates and construction and the multi-year nature of highway and infrastructure projects should help to offset continued weakness in residential construction as well as some softening in certain categories of private non-residential construction. Overall, we expect 2008 aggregate shipments from legacy operations to be flat to down 2% versus the prior year.", "Including the Florida Rock operations for a full year should result in an increase in aggregate shipments of 9% to 12%. A market environment that recognizes the higher cost of replacing reserves has been instrumental in price improvement, despite lower volumes. The pricing momentum of 2005 and 2006 continued in 2007. In 2008, we believe this momentum will continue resulting in price improvement of 8% to 10%.", "Earnings for the asphalt and concrete segment should be higher in 2008 due to the Florida Rock acquisition. In legacy operations the average unit price for asphalt and concrete should increase and partially offset cost increases due to lower sales volume and higher prices for key raw materials, including liquid asphalt, cement and internally supplied aggregates.", "Asphalt margins should approximate the prior year, while legacy concrete margin should be slightly lower. Vulcan's 2008 legacy concrete and asphalt operation should approximate 2007 legacy unit volumes. Total concrete volumes for the combined company in 2008 should be in the range of 7 million cubic yard to 7.3 million cubic yards. As a result, we expect consolidated EBITDA for 2008 to be in the range of $1.375 billion to $1.425 billion.", "Consolidated earnings from continuing operations should be in the range of $4.75 to $5.15 per diluted share. Quantifying the earnings per share impact on our 2008 guidance from the Florida Rock acquisition is difficult. As I mentioned earlier as the integration of both Florida Rock and legacy Vulcan operations into one effective organization continues, the bright lines between the two organizations will become further blurred, making year-over-year comparisons difficult as the year progresses.", "As a result, our ability to estimate and update this guidance would be limited. However at this point, we estimate the Florida Rock acquisition could reduce earnings per share from 3% to 4% in 2008. This is included in our guidance of $4.75 to $5.15 per share. We will be working hard to offset this earnings impact through additional opportunities and synergies, we are currently pursuing. This strong earnings and cash generation forecast should allow us to reduce overall debt levels, invest in internal projects with good returns and return cash to shareholders. Debt repayment will be a priority use of cash flows in 2008.", "In 2007, we completed an expansion of our production and shipping capacity at our CALICA quarry on the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico adding about 3 million tons of capacity, which is now on stream. We rebuilt our Kennesaw plant in Atlanta, we built a multi-million ton production plant in Corona, California and completed a new underground mine in the western suburbs of Chicago. We also made other important aggregate related projects that will improve our abilities to serve our markets, and will lower our cost.", "Additionally, we expect a cement plant expansion underway of our Newberry plant in Florida, to be completed by the end of the year. As a result, we believe our capital spending in 2008 will approximate 2007 levels of about $483 million to $485 million and subsequently will trend down to a more normalized levels as these large projects are completed. In February this year, our Board of Directors increased quarterly dividend 6.5% to $0.49 per share. This marks the 16th constitutive year our dividend has increased. All of our products are produced and consumed outdoors and therefore are subject to seasonal weather and construction patterns.", "This seasonality makes predicting the timing of sales and earnings performance from one quarter to the next a challenge. As a result, our 2007 guidance is for our full year and not by quarter. This change is consistent with our management practices in running our business. During the year we will continue to provide quarterly commentary regarding sales and earnings drivers for our business.", "During the first quarter of 2008, we expect to complete the divestiture required by the Department of Justice of nine sites in a series of transactions. We currently expect these divestitures to be a combination of cash sales and asset swaps.", "Our 2008 earnings outlook includes $85 million to $90 million of EBITDA and $0.47 to $0.50 per share of diluted earnings referable to these assets that are subjected to the swaps. The expected EBITDA and per share earnings incorporate gains related to the two divestiture properties owned by legacy Vulcan. Earnings from the divestiture properties prior to their sale, post-divestiture earnings from swap properties were we will receive in exchange for some of the divested properties and lower interest expense arising from the use of cash proceeds to reduce debt.", "In closing, I would like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. Our construction materials businesses have generated good results during times of weaker demand for our products and better results as demand has improved. The foundation of our confidence is the strategy, we have employed to establish an aggregates focused business, that has the great advantage of strategic locations in major U.S. markets, expected to experience above average growth and aggregates demand for many years into the future.", "Our 1999, CalMat acquisition was a continuation of that long-term strategy. Pre-tax earnings from that business have increased over five fold during our ownerships beginning in 1999. The Florida Rock acquisition is also a continuation of that strategy. We believe it will create long-term value for our shareholders by extending our geographic reach and adding increasingly scarce permitted aggregate reserves in fast growing markets.", "We look forward to the long-term value, this merger will provide our shareholders. We remain focused on successfully and effectively integrating the two companies, our continuing to the deliver solid returns. Summarizing the key attributes of our aggregates focused business and how this strategy benefits Vulcan and the shareholders, our 2008 result should benefit from the following attributes. A more diversified regional exposure, the increasing value of permitted reserves in fast-growing metropolitan markets. And the broad use of aggregates in downstream products in diverse end markets, including relatively stable demand from public funding where multi-year construction contracts are typical.", "During 2008, we remain optimistic about State leadership to fund transportation and infrastructure construction. As an example, California's need for additional spending on infrastructure is well documented and the Governor and State Legislature have put in place a 10-year strategic growth plan, which contemplates over $200 billion for infrastructure construction. States such as Virginia have also approved additional funding for highway and infrastructure projects. We believe other states will take a closer look at additional funding sources.", "We thank you for your interest in Vulcan. Now if our operator will give you the required instruction, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning, gentleman.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "On your pricing guidance of 8% to 10%, I guess that includes Florida Rock, but --", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, it does.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So, wondering if you could help us with what you expect for Florida Rock versus legacy Vulcan, just so if we can make apples-to-apples comparison?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the rate of increase in aggregates prices will be higher in Florida than in other markets in 2008. That's already in place, as you know. I don't have a breakdown between, as you know, Florida was also a part of the legacy Vulcan business. And so, it's depending upon where we source the material that goes to Florida, it could be counted as part of the Florida Rock or Florida legacy Vulcan. So, that's one of those distinctions that get increasingly difficult to make. But, our 8% to 10% does include additional volumes in Florida whether sourced from Florida Rock, legacy quarries or Vulcan legacy quarries.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So, I guess, if you could help us understand what you're looking for in Florida? So, legacy Vulcan plus Florida Rock volumes, if you combined that together, what would be pricing just in Florida?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's substantially above the 8% to 10%. But, as you know I guess last year, SYMEX announced a $5 per ton price increase for aggregates in their facilities in Florida. I believe that increase has taken affect and certainly that's depending upon which market you are in Florida and because of the difference between the pricing of imported aggregates and domestically produced aggregates, that rate of increase is different from market-to-market. But, overall it is substantially above 8% to 10% overall price increase. I can't give you a breakdown of exactly how much that is.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "I mean the SYMEX number we all heard was about $5 last year, so is $2 to $3 a fair number to use for all of your operations because the $5 apparently was just in the Miami portion?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think that's correct I think that would apply to Tampa and Jacksonville and Orlando as well. Again we are trying to draw distinctions between whether the price increase is coming from a Florida Rock legacy quarry our Vulcan legacy quarry is just not something, I mean we can guess but as the year progresses those things are going to move around a great deal. Suffice it to say that Florida will have a significantly higher rate of price increase than other markets in the U.S. largely based on the shrinking reserve base there.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "I got it. Moving to volume, residential '07 volume of 43 million could you provide us similar numbers for non-res and the infrastructure pieces please?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we published the percentage that or we will publish it as soon as we put out our 10-K but I'll give you those numbers. In '07 we estimate and I emphasize we estimate because when a truck load of rock leaves our gate we cannot be certain where it ends up but we estimate that 47% of our shipments went to public, publicly funded infrastructure projects of about 19% in the residential both single family, multifamily, 31% in the private non-res, then about 3% in the other which would include railroad ballast and agricultural and chemical uses.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So it sounds like you are assuming 15% decline in residential and low single-digit increases in non-res and infrastructure buckets?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. Lastly on your guidance which includes $0.47 to $0.50 from the divestiture of those nine assets --", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It includes more than that, it includes earnings from sites to be divested until they are in fact divested. It includes the earnings from properties we will get into swaps, it includes interest savings that we project from being able to pay down debt with cash proceeds and it includes gain on the two properties that are legacy Vulcan, as you know, we will not record a gain on the Florida Rock legacy assets to be sold because we will first write them up to fair market value which by definition will be the amount we them selling for. So the\u2026 how well that breaks out is still uncertain we are moving along with the buyers and people who will be swapping for those properties but we do not have firm contracts yet and so that's just an estimate and I don't think we are prepared to try to be any more precise about how much of that is coming from earnings and how much is coming from interest savings and how much is coming from gain. We will give you that information once these transactions are firm and final but at this point, there is a lot of moving parts in that number.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Please proceed.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Hi, good morning.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about infrastructure volumes for '08. And just maybe break it out between some of the states that you are more confident and some of the states that you are seeing a little bit more weakness? And also, if you could discuss just some of the concerns out there with respect to states discussing budgeting problems and if you think that that could be a risk to your infrastructure outlook?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "By far, the most significant state for public infrastructure as we look at '08 is California. You, I'm sure are aware of the bond funding for infrastructure that's been approved. You are aware of the program there that I referenced in my remarks. One of the bright spots of state infrastructure funding is that as we understand it at this point, even though California is projecting a significant budget deficit overall, it will have very little if any impact on this infrastructure program. We expect to see some benefit in shipments resulting from that program, certainly by the second half of '08, but that program has got a lot of momentum, it will have a very significant impact on shipments of construction materials in California for years and years and to the future. And as I've said, it appears at this point that it is not tied to the overall 10% reduction that Governor Schwarzenegger has asked for from the various departments in California State government.", "Virginia as you probably know has substantially increased its commitment to public highway funding. There is some more sensitivity in Virginia, I think to the state budget than in California, but that program is still going forward with substantially increased commitment to public infrastructure spending. On the flip side, the State of Tennessee remains weak and its commitment to highways, most states if you look at the combination of highways and public infrastructure are in the sort of low-single digit increase in demand over '07.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Okay. Thank you for that. And can you talk about your aggregates pricing expectations in California. I know you have been able to achieve some very significant increases there over the years with volumes off. In residential business, there can be infrastructures still holding in there, are you expecting another significant perhaps double-digit price increase in some of your larger California markets?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That is, the rate of increase in California is probably going to be less than it has been historically until the public infrastructure projects pickup, as you know southern California has been one of the markets that has been affected most by the decline in residential construction. We have added new production capacity at Corona, California, which can serve both the L.A Basin and San Diego. That plant is now fully on stream and we have additional capacity to serve the market. Once the infrastructure program start consuming construction materials in California, we expect the price momentum to resume, but at this point with the slowdown in housing it is less than it has been historically.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Okay. And just lastly if you can discuss this expectations for synergies from Florida Rock a year ago when you announced the acquisition for 2008 you were looking at a figure above [ph] $43 million, would you be able to guide us in some direction of what you're expecting for '08?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I think at this point we are right on the projections we gave earlier. We think by the end of '08, we will have in place all of the synergies that would yield annual savings of about $50 million a year. We have achieved or by the end of this month, we will achieve the full $80 million of one-time cash synergies that we projected that has come along very nicely. I think there we're working very hard to identify and achieve additional synergies. They will come largely through operating improvements in both concrete and aggregates as we collect the best scale of knowledge in both companies and put our heads together on ways to work together. There are some additional opportunities that a combined company can pursue in '08 that neither company alone could effectively pursue and we are working hard to get to those. We will give you additional guidance as we can identify and quantify additional synergies, but at this point we are right on track for the $50 million we initially projected.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Great thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes form the line of Dan Oppenheim with Banc of America Securities. Please proceed.", "Mike Woods - Banc of America Securities", "Hi this is Mike Woods. Can you talk about the price increase that you have got towards '08, whether or not that includes any additional increases beyond what you've already announced, the clients generally out there.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I am not sure I follow your question.", "Mike Woods - Banc of America Securities", "I understood, within that expectation there is additional price increases that you are planning to put through mid-year or the shift what you've already announced in January that you expect to take effect over the next few months.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "There will be contributions from both as we I think have tried to explain before, we don't have a company wide pricing strategy. We do have a company-wide pricing strategy. We do not have a company-wide price increases that go into affect at certain times of year. This is a market-by-market, product-by-product, customer-by-customer pricing strategy. And we will have price increases in various markets for various products throughout the year. But, in answer I think, if I understand your question, the 8% to 10% in price improvement we expect in '08, some of that is already in place through announced price increases and some of it will be the result of price increases that occur at different times of the year in different market.", "Mike Woods - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And can you just provide more color on what your thoughts are with converting some of the short terms debt that you took on as a result of Florida Rock. And what we should think about modeling in for interest cost associated with that debt in '08?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me; let Dan Sansone respond to that.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I can answer that question a couple of ways. At this point in time, you probably are aware that we issued about $1.2 billion of debt in December of 2007. That still leaves us today with a considerable amount of short-term debt. Our current plan is that we will term out somewhere in the neighborhood of $600 million to $700 million of additional long-term debt. During the course of 2008, the exact timing of that is going to be really driven more by market conditions than it is anything else. We... in terms of guidance, what I would offer is that, we're looking at... and what's embedded in the earnings guidance we just provided is about $178 million of net interest expense for 2008. And the key assumption there is that we term out the $600 million of additional long-term debt in the middle of the second quarter. To the extent that we deviate from that timing, there will be a modest affect on the interest cost. But, that\u2019s our current modeling assumption in planning, if you... if we do term out $600 million in the middle of the second quarter, and if rates stay where they are today, we would then be looking at a kind of an all in run rate of about 5.6% for all of our incremental financing referable to the Florida Rock transaction. That would be the combination of the long-term debt and the portion that would stay short and is based on current rates.", "Mike Woods - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Martinez [ph] with UBS. Please proceed?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. Hi, thanks for the detail Don and Dan. Wanted to ask on the volume side for a little better color. I'm just trying to understand the macro assumptions that you might be making to get to a 0% to 2% decline. Given that some of the highway budgets, you appointed to the public spending tend to be fairly fixed in nature in terms of the budgets, and given that and assume the 8% to 10% increase, how is it possible that there could be enough, I guess, availability to spend another 10% increase given the rest of the cost that are rising? So, are you assuming a pickup in demand at the second half of the year like Martin planned out?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. In public infrastructure, overall I am not.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, I mean I was pointing out public infrastructure where I think budgets can be tighter but if you could comment on the different segments, particularly non-res and public infrastructure?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well if you break out public infrastructure into highways and other, we think the other is probably going to be stronger than highways. We think buildings whether they are public or private will increase slightly in '08 over in '07 and I'm talking about a tonnage\u2026 tons, more so in dollars than in tons because as you point out, the cost of all building materials including steel and liquid asphalt and other things are moving up. Residential, we think will be down probably another 15%. One of the things that you should factor in of courses is that we have added 3 million tons of production and shipping capacity at our CALICA quarry and that whole thing is basically sold out for 2008. So we will pick up some volume from that, our Corona quarry in Los Angeles now has\u2026 it will give us additional capacity and we\u2019ll pick up some volume from that. I think if you look at as we try to point out the Vulcan served states on both public infrastructure and private non-res, based on contract awards in '06 and \u201807 are stronger than the rest of the country. So when we say flat to down 2%, we take into account the relatively stronger contract awards in our markets, we take into account the additional capacity we now have and we factor in highways being flat to down 1% other public infrastructure being up 3%, public and private buildings being up 1% and residential being down about 15%. That's the basis of our volume outlook.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great that's helpful, and then can you remind us of your exposure to Lake Belt and give us any update on the discussions are going there?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Our exposure to the Lake Belt is a single quarry in Miami that has about 4 million to 5 million tons of production capacity. I think it has never shipped more than about four, it is now continuing to ship from either material that was mined prior to the last court ruling or from material that's mined in a portions of a quarry that are still available for mining. We do not have any update. The case was argued in the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta back in November and there will be some ruling at some point. Then after the court ruling, presumably the core of engineers will then have\u2026 will exercise its jurisdictions over the permitting and issue whatever permits it deems appropriate. But at this point we don't have any prediction for that outcome.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay Great thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning, Don.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Jack.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "On the question of synergies that you addressed a little earlier, I just wanted to ask is that contribution assumed in the '08 guidance?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Some portion of it.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I want to be clear, we are saying by the end of '08, we will have the entire 50 million run rate in place. I think the impact on '08 is less than that, because all of that is not in place on January 1.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Right.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "But substantial portion of it is, but not all of it.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And then with regard to the $0.47 to $0.50 a share, that's included in '08 guidance referable to the various transactions you mentioned, is it the case that there will be some portion of that although we don't know how much that will go away as part of the ongoing Vulcan operations due to the divestiture process unless you could swap a 100% [inaudible] earnings?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me\u2026 there is\u2026 assume for a moment a closing at the end of the first quarter. There will be some earnings contribution from the divested assets during the first quarter, that's included. That will not continue for the rest of the year because those assets will be divested. And we will get some assets in exchange, so we will have nine months of earnings from those assets, then there will be some cash, which we would use at debt reduction, so our interest charges will be reduced for the last nine months of the year, and there will likely be some accounting gain on the legacy Vulcan assets that will be sold even though, as you know, in the miracles of purchase accounting you can sell one quarry and have no gain if it was legacy Florida Rock and you can sell another quarry that\u2019s just like it, that was legacy Vulcan and you will have a gain. So, there will likely be a significant gain from the Vulcan assets that are in the exchange and no gain from the Florida Rock assets that are in the transaction. So, I wouldn't\u2026 you shouldn't\u2026 we are saying that's the full-year impact of all of this stuff working together. So, we believe the $0.47 to $0.50 per share is part of our full-year '08 earnings, some portion of that will be continuing and some portion won't. And at this point, we've got to get deals closed before we can do those calculations, but we will give you some additional guidance on that. But, I wouldn't\u2026 I don't think it's correct to say some portion of that goes away after the transaction, that's the full-year impact to us from all of these\u2026 from the impact of all of these transactions plus the purchase accounting.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And with regard to concrete in Florida, how are prices of ready-mix concrete in Florida, I think the last public release by Florida Rock before you closed the deal, it seems to be holding up fairly well in the face of a severe residential decline? Can you characterize it for us now?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think pricing for concrete (52:04) is going to be a challenge. We certainly don't\u2026 our philosophy is there will not be a single additional house built in Florida if concrete prices are $20 per yard lower than they are today, that's not going to move demand, there are so many other much more significant factors in the determination of whether to build a house than what the concrete prices are. But, we have to be competitive. But, at this point, as I have said in my remarks, we are pleased with the resiliency of concrete prices in the face of substantially lower demand. I think we realize that demand won\u2019t be created by lower prices.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Please proceed.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Good morning. You touched on, after Jack's question, the pricing environment kind of in Florida and then you've also talked about pricing with aggregates. Could you talk a little bit about the demand environment in Florida for aggregates, concrete, and then also cement which in the quarter\u2026 also if you could touch on the\u2026 a little bit of detail on what was going on there, it seems like it came in a little bit weaker than kind of what we would have expected it to come in?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "With respect to aggregate demand in Florida, obviously, aggregate demand in Florida is off significantly from the past few years. But, what is also off significantly is the supply of aggregates in Florida, which is the reason that you're seeing above average price improvement for aggregates in Florida. Housing is obviously very weak, public infrastructure is pretty good in Florida. It's very difficult for us at this point to have any visibility into when the housing market stabilizes and begin to recover. Different economists have different views on that and in our view it would not be any better than the views of others in that regard. With respect to overall demand for aggregates, the fourth quarter is a\u2026 as you know\u2026 the first quarter has so many factors that affect aggregate demand, principally weather and the impact of people either deciding to try to get projects finished or to carry them over. Our fourth quarter shipments were lower than we thought they would be, that is overall, but not of any great concern to us at this point because of the seasonality of our business.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "And you're talking about aggregates there?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. Could you touch more specifically on maybe the non-res, what's going on in Florida there with non-res? I know you touched on housing and then infrastructure a bit.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't have any specific... well... let's see I have got my little sheet here, let me take a look at that. Non-res and that's\u2026 our view is that in North Florida buildings will be up about 2% and in South Florida they will be flat. Infrastructure, which includes both public and private, in North Florida we believe it will be up about 4% and in South Florida up about 1%. These are aggregate tons not dollars of spending. Of course the dollar of spending would have to be higher on a percentage basis because price of aggregates has moved up in those markets. These are our internal demand projections or aggregates by region. As I've said, these are our best estimates, but you know we could... they could vary obviously from these views.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. Thanks Don, it's very helpful. And then just one the cement in the quarter, I know it was a stub period, and you had holidays and so forth going on, but still the revenue seems I guess fairly low coming out of the cement operations and volumes seem lower. Is there something particular going on there, but that's just weak demand or is there something else that happened in the quarter?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. We had our cement plant outage that was scheduled in the fourth quarter and we went ahead and took it.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That was after closing.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That was in the stub period and that's\u2026 you didn't follow us back when we were in the chemicals business, but once or twice a year when we took our chemical plants down for annual maintenance outages you saw a significant impact on earnings in whatever quarter that occurred and you will continue to see that with the cement plant. But, the stub period in the fourth quarter was significantly impacted by the annual maintenance outage, which occurred in the last six weeks of the year in cement. So, that accounts for what you see at revenues.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. Is there any way you could maybe quantify that a little bit?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't have the data in front of me to do that, but...", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And then the other question is you kind of touched on your thoughts that energy would be\u2026 and asphalt cost would be trimming. Could you give us any more color on kind of your expectations and kind of what is baked into guidance as far as your outlook for energy and liquid asphalt for the year?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, just a second. I think\u2026 as we said, the fourth quarter cost of diesel fuel was up about 41% from the fourth quarter of '06. We expect that level to continue, at least that's what we\u2019ve built into our '08 projection that the fourth quarter diesel... fourth quarter '07 diesel fuel pricing will continue throughout '08 to the extent we get some price relief that will improve our earnings. To the extent diesel fuel gets higher than it was in the fourth quarter, it will have some negative earnings impact and predicting diesel fuel pricing with this market is... has a lot of payroll, but that\u2019s what\u2019s build into our projection is, diesel fuel pricing in '08 equal to the fourth quarter '07 level.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks, Don.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Keybanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Chris Manuel - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions for you. First, Dan, just a couple of housekeeping items. Can you tell us what the CapEx and the DD&A and interest rate assumptions are for '08?", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. For CapEx, I would use $485 million.", "Chris Manuel - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "For DD&A, we see that settling in at right about $400 million for the combined company and that includes our best estimates as of today any way with respect to the purchase accounting step up in the Florida Rock assets. What was the third variable? Interest rate, yes.", "Chris Manuel - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Tax rate.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Pardon me.", "Chris Manuel - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Tax rate.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Tax rate, I'm sorry. What I would use for 2008 is 32%. We will be in that neighborhood plus or minus rounding.", "Chris Manuel - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you. And Don, one of the pieces that\u2026 you've given us the synergy and you've given us an update on the synergy target, that appears reasonable. Another piece of guidance at the time of transaction that you gave us was to anticipate, I believe, it was over the '08 to 2010 timeframe of average EBITDA in the $2 billion range per year over that timeframe. Clearly the markets have turned a bit worse with respect to Florida and housing. At this point, it maybe appears, at least by my math, that maybe you can get two or two-ish billion range by the end of 2010. Can you give us a comment or thought as to how you think about the combined entity over the long period at this point?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't have a projection of the combined company, at this point, for the period beyond '08. I think it's a fair statement that our EBITDA projection for '08 today is lower than it was a year ago. That's the result of not only the Florida Rock business, but the bulk and legacy business. We believe the combined company will be a strong cash generating organization, but we certainly can't affirm the three years of average $2 billion EBITDA because our '08 number is lower than what we had in that roll up as we indicated at the time that was an average over three years and it was projected to increase. Certainly, we think there is a lot of upside both the legacy Vulcan business and the legacy Florida Rock business, but more importantly, there is even more upside to the synergies in the combination. But that's\u2026 when we get to that number, it\u2019s going to be largely dependent upon what the markets do and the wild card there is when residential markets began to stabilize and recover. We will have a new President within the year. There is a great deal of discussion already about the under funding of public infrastructure in the US. I think that will... we will see that increasingly as a subject of discussion. There is a lot of stuff going on in Washington about public infrastructure. You are aware of the Commission report, the Commission that was established as a result of the last highway build to talk about funding. We are not sure what the outcome is going to be, but we expect there'll be a great deal of dialog and possibly a very significant change in the way public infrastructure is funded and the levels at which it is funded and that will have a very significant impact on us going forward. We don\u2019t know what the outcome is going to be, but we are certainly going to be engaged in a dialog.", "Chris Manuel - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay, that is fair. And with respect to... I'd like to follow-up on Jack's question earlier from the $0.47 to $0.50, I appreciate that you are... it's difficult to fare it out, each of the individual pieces, but is it safe to assume that a sizable portion of that or was it ... would it be a sizeable portion or a smaller portion that would be represented from the gain on the sale of assets?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "You will be...", "Chris Manuel - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Effectively, what we are trying to get at is, what would be a recurring piece?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think there will be a significant gain, at least, if we close the transactions that we are contemplating at this point, there will be a significant accounting gain on the portion of the divested assets [inaudible] from legacy Vulcan. But that's not all of it, there is continuing earnings from the swap properties, there's reduced interest cost from utilization of cash. But, as I have said earlier, there are a lot of moving pieces in there and until we get these deals closed, we can't tell you...", "Chris Manuel - Keybanc Capital Markets", "I understand and realize there are a lot of moving parts, but directionally would you characterize the gain as greater or less than say half of that amount?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's... it would be more than half.", "Chris Manuel - Keybanc Capital Markets", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Betts with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.", "Michael Betts - J.P. Morgan", "Yes, hi.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Mike.", "Michael Betts - J.P. Morgan", "Hi, Don. I have two or three questions I guess all related to Florida Rock. First one is just to clarify because $0.32 that you indicated hit the fourth quarter earnings or for the year rather, they were all kind of financial items or stuff like that. Was there no operating contribution in the six weeks?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, there was. It was not huge but it was... there was an operating contribution, there was also an offsetting purchase accounting... additional depreciation on all of the Florida Rock assets over and above what would have been had they remained within Florida Rock. As I mentioned, we had our annual cement plant outage that we took in that stub period. Yes, there were some contributions, earnings from the operations in that period, but they were not significant in light of the whole $0.32.", "Michael Betts - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And my second question relating to Florida Rock was, you talked about the synergies, but... and this may be just my view, the managements have been somewhat slow last year to just cut cost to the reflect decline in volumes because you know they were seeing 30% to 50% volume declines. So, even if they hadn't done a transaction with you, you would have expected fairly significant cut-backs. I guess you've been implementing that cost cutting in the last six weeks and you got more to go. Are you able to sort of indicate over and above synergies? What sort of cost cutting you've done within that business to reflect the deteriorate\u2026 the worsening outlook there?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Certainly, there have been cost reductions. I do not have a quantification of that that I can give you my colleagues. The one metric\u2026 and I can't break it down between synergies and cost reduction, but both legacy Vulcan and legacy Florida Rock headcounts are down. Florida Rock, I think, there are about 350 people both hourly and salary that are no longer in the combined organization. Some of that is included in the synergy and some is operating businesses as a result of the issues with demand.", "Michael Betts - J.P. Morgan", "To what percentage that was of the workforce?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "About", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "11% or 12%.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "11% OR 12%", "Michael Betts - J.P. Morgan", "Okay and final question. Because we talked a bit\u2026 we mentioned earlier the ready-mix concrete price issue. Have you announced price increases\u2026 or what's happening I guess is my question is, in Q1 in Florida? I mean, we would begin to see some pressure on ready-mix concrete prices there and I guess more generally in the US. Have you seen any change in trend in that in the first quarter or is there still some downward pressure on ready-mix prices?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think there is a lot of downward pressure that we've been able to see. I think it is likely that by the end of the year '08 compared to '07, because of the contracts with pricing rolling of and new contracts going out that there may be some discernible change there, but I can't tell you at this point what those likely to be.", "Michael Betts - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of with John Fox with Fenimore Asset. Please proceed.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Hi. Good morning everyone.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi John.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Believe it or not I have a few questions left. First, I just want to confirm on all the discussions about tons in terms of guidance of legacy and the percentage of shipments, that's total tons both internal and external?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay great. And then maybe if you could tell us a little bit more about the cement business, you gave some guidance on a concrete shipments combined for '08. Do you have any thoughts on cement shipments, number one? And number two, can you tell us what the CapEx is this year for Newberry?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Cement shipments\u2026 from legacy Florida Rock there are two sources of cement shipments, one is the Newberry plant, the other are imports.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Right.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think the tonnage from imports will be significantly reduced. The tonnage from the Newberry plant will be largely the same. The second line of the Newberry plant will come on stream probably by the end of the year. So, I don't think we\u2019ve built in any incremental volume from that second line in our '08 outlook, but it will be available in '09. Certainly, the volume reduction is in imports. And I think that's been the view all along that the domestic cement capacity in Florida would displace imports because it is lower cost than imports. On CapEx in '08, we're projecting plus or minus $50 million at the Newberry cement plant to get that second line up and running and then the regular CapEx that would be necessary. As you know, it\u2019s a brand new plant, so there is not a lot of other CapEx that would have to spent there.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "So, presumably that go away in '09?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "[inaudible].", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. And then for Dan, you said 178 of net interest expense, is that net of interest income?", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. And you've mentioned $80 million in one-time cash synergies, I think occurred in January?", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "David, they've been occurring since closing. We think by the end of the first quarter virtually all of the items that we identified will have been put in place.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. So, I can add $80 million to the year-end cash balance that's been coming in both last year and this year.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's correct. We have not received all of the... for example, there is one item, $33 million that we'll receive at the end of February, just as a point of illustration.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "John, that\u2019s a net number.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "There is cash out and there is cash in. That's a net number.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Right. I'm just trying to get a cash collections and ability to deliver and that type of thing.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "So, some of that can come in in '08?", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "John, we're reasonably comfortable that we are going to be able to take debt down probably $300 million in '08.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "By the end of '08?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "And that includes the effects of divestitures etcetera?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. That's everything all worked in together, operating cash flow, net cash, synergies we just discussed [inaudible].", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Those cash synergies for the rest of '08. Is there any GAAP accounting gain or is that included in EBITDA or is that a forecast?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Any impact of that is included in our guidance. But, most of it is not going to have a big GAAP accounting impact.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "So, there would not be a significant earnings impact from those cash synergies, is that fair?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's correct. There would not be.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "John, I don\u2019t remember whether you were with us in the years following the CalMat acquisition, but we had the same thing. We were generating a lot of cash that was not showing up as accounting earnings and then at some point it started becoming accounting earnings, as well as cash as the fair market values of the properties started exceeding the purchase accounting write-off. So, we will see that here as well, but for initial year or two you'll see cash but not much GAAP accounting earnings.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no other questions in queue at this time. I like to turn the call back over to Mr. Don James for closing remarks.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan today. We've got a lot of work to do in 2008, but we're excited about the prospects of the continued opportunities of bringing these two businesses together. We look forward to talking with you again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you very much and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you all for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Lacy, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us for this conference call to discuss our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2008. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials Company. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan and we hope our remarks and dialogue will be helpful to you. A replay of this conference call will be available later today at our website.", "Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Before I begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Descriptions to these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and the company assumes no obligation to update such statements.", "Vulcan's first quarter financial results reported yesterday after the market closed include net sales of $772 million and EBITDA of $160 million. Net sales increased 23% from the prior year's first quarter due to the inclusion of Florida Rock. The prior year's EBITDA was a $199 million, which included $43 million from the gain on sale of real estate in California in last year's first quarter.", "Earnings per diluted share were $0.13 versus $0.91 in the prior year's first quarter. Of course, the prior year's first quarter results included $0.26 per diluted share referable to the sale of the California real estate. The earnings in the current year include a $0.06 per share non-cash charge or deprecation and amortization attributable to the write-off of Florida Rock's assets to fair market values under the purchase accounting rules.", "We had included a summary table in the body of our press release, which highlights the major changes from the prior year's first quarter to the current year, which we hope will help you to analyze the changes.", "The economic environment in which these results were achieved was certainly challenging. Housing-related construction has continued to weaken and the credit crisis has begun to affect some private non-residential construction end markets. We are pleased with the resiliency of pricing for all of our products. All major product lines achieved higher pricing compared with the prior year's first quarter in spite of weaker demand.", "We remained focused on positioning our business to benefit from a recovery in demand by effectively managing our cost structure, fully developing the operational and cost synergies from the Florida Rock acquisition and continuing to add reserves in key higher growth markets.", "Before I move into specific comments regarding consolidated first quarter results, let me remind you that the current year's first quarter results include Florida Rock, and of course, the prior year results do not. Historical comparison for Vulcan's and Florida Rock's legacy businesses are increasingly difficult, because we have rapidly restructured and integrated the combined businesses into five of Vulcan's eight divisions. The operations in Georgia and Tennessee we divested on April of the 11th as a result of Hart-Scott-Rodino review are included for the full quarter. The operations in Virginia we divested in late March are included for the period that we owned those operations.", "Generally, from an operational standpoint, our businesses performed well in the first quarter, in light of the much lower volume. Aggregates net sales increased 1% to $490 million. Aggregates EBITDA approximated the prior year's first quarter, as higher pricing offset the earnings impact due to lower volumes. Aggregates pricing increased 9%, with all major markets realizing price increases from the prior year. Aggregates shipments in most legacy Vulcan served markets saw double-digit volume declines when compared with the prior year's first quarter.", "Overall, shipment levels declined 4% after inclusion of Florida Rock's volumes in the quarter. Certain markets such as Texas and along the Gulf Coast are benefiting from large industrial construction projects, which were contributing to growing demand. Other markets in California, Florida and Mid-Atlantic states were negatively affected by weakness in construction activity, particularly in housing and Aggregates shipments in our Midwestern and Mid-South markets were adversely impacted by snow and unusually weather conditions, particularly late in the quarter.", "Unit production cost of sales for aggregates and legacy Vulcan operations increased approximately 12% from the prior year's first quarter, due mostly to higher energy-related costs and the impact on lower production volumes.", "During the quarter, we drove production levels downward to match the lower level of demand. We also saw a sharp increase in energy costs in the quarter. Our plant managers did an excellent job of managing costs in the quarter despite these upward pressures. If energy and the earnings effect from lower production volumes are excluded, their cost reduction efforts resulted in flat year-over-year unit cost of sales for aggregates. These results demonstrate the flexibility of our aggregates plants and our management teams to adjust production levels relatively efficiently to match market demand.", "Diesel fuel prices or costs, that is, unit cost for diesel fuel increased 53% from the prior year, lowering earnings approximately $12 million. While cash fixed costs related to aggregates production were slightly lower than last year's quarter.", "Earnings for the asphalt and concrete segment increased from the prior year's first quarter due to the acquisition of Florida Rock. Material margins in these product lines have been under pressure due to higher cost for asphalt and internally supplied aggregates, as well as weaker volumes. However, higher prices in these product lines were realized versus the prior year and we remain encouraged by our price resiliency in the context of weaker construction activity.", "Asphalt prices increased 3% from the prior year, that is asphalt mix prices. We were not able to move prices up fast enough to offset a 25% increase in the average unit cost for liquid asphalt and the higher cost for aggregate supplied internally through our asphalt plants. The average concrete selling price including the legacy Florida Rock operations increased approximately 4% from the prior year's first quarter. The earnings effect of lower volume and the higher cost for key raw materials such as cement and internally supplied aggregate more than offset the price increase.", "Fixed costs in the asphalt and concrete segment were down over 5% in the quarter, as our managers aggressively focused on costs. Selling, administrative and general expenses in the current year were $93 million versus $74 million in the prior year's first quarter. Legacy Vulcan SAG expenses were $3 million lower than last year's first quarter, but were more than offset by the inclusion of the legacy Florida Rock operations, which accounted for all of the year-over-year increase. As a percent of net sales, consolidated SAG costs were 12% compared to 11.8% last year. Interest expense increased approximately 37 million from prior year's first quarter due to the additional borrowings to fund the acquisitions of Florida Rock.", "Our outlook for 2008 is subject to a great deal of uncertainty, with respect to both the economy and the turmoil in the financial markets. We are seeing a prolonged and severe downturn in residential construction. We also see weaker macro data for contract awards and other end markets. In addition, we see the impact of higher cost for construction inputs and the effect of increasing energy-related costs. In the first quarter, we were able to reduce operating hours and hold cash fixed costs flat. We will continue to evaluate costs in all areas in order to ensure that costs are aggressively managed in light of weaker demand outlook. We continue to expect improved pricing for our products to help offset these higher costs.", "Leading indicator such as contract awards project a continuation of the significant decline in residential construction as well as some weakness in other end markets. In Vulcan served markets, we now expect aggregates demand for residential construction in 2008 to decrease approximately 27% from last year's levels. This decrease is indicative of further weakness that materialize in the first quarter of '08 and compares unfavorably to the roughly 15% decline we forecast at the end of 2007. Certain categories of non-residential construction are also expected to weaken during 2008. These subcategories include stores, retail and institutional construction projects, which are more closely related to the level of residential construction activity and comprise a large percentage of the overall non-risk category of construction.", "Large industrial projects in Texas and along the Golf Coast should mitigate some of this weakness in Vulcan served markets. Highway and infrastructure construction continues to be steady. However, the costs of construction inputs such as liquid asphalt and diesel are consuming a larger proportion of highway and infrastructure construction dollars compared to aggregates. As a result, we now estimate full year aggregate shipments including legacy Florida Rock operations for the full year to be flat to up 4% versus the prior year.", "We expect relatively stronger shipments in the second half of 2008 than in the first two quarters. A pricing environment that recognizes the higher cost of replacing reserves has been instrumental and helping us to achieve price improvements by lower volumes. Additionally, aggregates production continues to be burdened by increasing cost for energy-related and steel-based materials.", "Pricing momentum we achieved in 2005 and 2006 continued in 2007. In 2008, we believe this momentum will continue resulting in price improvements of approximately 8%. We expect to achieve this overall average price improvement in spite of relatively lower shipments in our higher price markets, particularly Florida and California. Overall, we expect a 10% to 15% increase in aggregates segment earnings in 2008.", "Asphalt mix and concrete segment earnings should be 10% to 20% higher in 2008, due to the inclusion of earnings from Florida Rock's concrete segment. Total concrete volumes for the company in 2008 should be in the range of 7 to 7.3 million cubic yards. The average unit price for asphalt mix and concrete should increase in 2008 and partially offset cost increase for key raw materials, including liquid asphalt, cement and internally supplied aggregates.", "For the reasons indicated, we now expect consolidated EBITDA for 2008 to be in the range of $1.170 billion to $1.260 billion. Consolidated earnings from continuing operations should be in the range of $3.85 to $4.35 per diluted share. This 2008 earnings outlook includes $76 million of EBITDA and $0.41 per share of diluted earnings referable to gains related to the two divested properties that were owned by Vulcan, prior to the acquisition of Florida Rock. The integration of Florida Rock is proceeding, as planned, and will help make Vulcan a stronger and more diversified organization for the future.", "We expect an annual synergies level of $50 million to be achieved by the end of 2008. These savings are being realized operationally and through overhead reductions. Our ability to serve our customers effectively in certain markets will be enhanced and the strategic assets received in exchange for the divestitures required by the Justice Department will add to our capability.", "We applied a rail-connected quarry to add production capacity and over 20 million tons of critical reserves to the Greater Sacramento market, where the California Geological Survey estimates they are less than 10 years of permitted reserves to serve that market. We acquired two quarries in Virginia, along interstate highway 81 in the Shenandoah Valley, with over a $130 million tons of reserves that complement our existing operations, but serve markets that we could not reach effectively from our existing points.", "In San Antonio, we added over 85 million tons of valuable permitted reserves to our existing 1604 quarry. In the first quarter, we also acquired a quarry in the western suburb of Chicago, with a 185 million tons of reserves, as part of our 1031 exchange to deferred cash taxes on the divestiture of properties from the Florida Rock transaction. Early in the second quarter, we acquired a quarry outside of Los Angles, with a 159 million tons of reserves, which we also included in our 1031 exchange. Both of these were stock transactions.", "In addition to these strategic assets, we will use the 240 million of cash proceeds to receive this part of the transactions to reduce debt. During the first quarter, we received a 10 million annual earn out payment related to the sale of our chemicals business back in 2005.", "In closing, I would like to reiterate our confidence and future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. Our construction materials businesses have generated good results during times of weaker demand for our products and much better results as demand improves. The foundation of our confidence is the strategy we've employed to establish an aggregates focused business that has the great advantage of strategic locations in major U.S. markets, expected to experience above average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future.", "Summarizing the key attributes of our aggregates focus business and how this strategy benefits Vulcan and its shareholders, our 2008 results should benefit from the following attributes. Aggressive management of our controllable costs, a diversified regional exposure, increasing value of permitted reserves in fast growing metropolitan markets and the broad use of aggregates in downstream products and diverse end markets, including relatively stable demand from public funding or multi-year construction projects are typical, and a strong and consistent focus on cash generation.", "Beyond 2008, we remain optimistic about state and federal leadership to fund transportation and infrastructure construction. As an example, California's needs for additional spending on infrastructure is well documented and the governor and state legislator have put in place continuous strategic growth plan which currently contemplates over a $140 billion for infrastructure construction, with over $200 billion being in the overall long-term plan.", "The debates in Washington over fuel taxes and infrastructure spending places increasing focus on our nation's need for improved infrastructure and a sound system to finance those needs. We believe that debate is healthy for industry and our company, as well as our country and will ultimately lead us to a more dynamic and soundly finance public infrastructure program. We thank you for your interest in Vulcan. Now, our operator will give you the required instructions. We will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first quarter will come from the line of Ajay Kejriwal with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, how are you?", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Good. Thank you. Maybe just to start with, on pricing in the quarter 9%, could you clarify how much of that is due to the high priced Florida Rock stone, and if you could, how much was the pricing on the legacy operations?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Legacy op\u2026 from the price increase in legacy operations was approximately the same, as the overall price increase. Of course, you know, many of the Florida Rock operations are northern Florida, so that pricing was more typical of Vulcan overall. Certainly, the price increases in Florida were among the highest we achieved in the quarter, but, as you know, the volume in Florida is weak, and so the impact of Florida pricing on the overall price mix was very small.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. So, maybe if you could help us with some geographic color, Florida was much higher, but what about California?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "California price increases were not nearly as robust as in the prior six or seven years, as you can imagine, particularly in southern California. Demand was weak in the quarter. The Caltrans projects and the public infrastructure projects that are included as part of the infrastructure program are just beginning to roll out, and so the volume impact from those projects which we hope will offset the weakness in residential and private non-res were certainly not significant in the first quarter, but should increase and be visible by the end of the year. But we had, as I said, price increases all across our footprint. We didn't have any markets where pricing did not increase. Florida was among the higher and California was among the lower regions in terms of price increase.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Maybe moving to volume, and if you could help us understand, what volume did in California? Cemex couple of weeks ago mentioned that volume was down about 25%, so wondering how volume did for you in California?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, volumes are all over the board. Our Gulf Coast markets were up 57%. Now, that's coming, as you know, we added production capacity at our CALICA quarry and added a ship which came in service in mid-year '07. That market is booming. We are.. our entire shipping capacity including our new ship is fully committed for the year and volumes in Texas, the Texas Gulf Coast and the entire Gulf Coast including Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama are booming. Texas generally is booming, and our volumes there were up over 25% in the quarter.", "Our volumes were down most significantly in the cold weather sort of central markets that is the Midwest and the Upper Mid-South markets, where we had volume decreases in the plus or minus 40% range, due significantly to bad weather, but we also believe the demand has slowed there to some extent. In California, our volumes are off, but probably in the 25% range\u2026 20% to 25% range in California and that's varies substantially by market in California, but overall about a 20% to 25%.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Show good color there. Maybe moving to your guidance, wondering what's baked in, in terms of your end market expectations, you've provided good color on residential outlook, but just in terms of what you're thinking volumes for highways and non-res?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, in terms of aggregates tones as opposed to aggregate revenues , we are\u2026 we currently see highway is being down about 7% year-over-year, something in that range, other infrastructure projects about 5% and then buildings probably in the 6% to 7% range down. So, and that's really based on as much on construction award data that just come in, in the last quarter.", "We're seeing some weakness we think, a lot of the weakness and again this is in units and not revenue dollars, as construction input costs go up, the same number of dollars are going to buy newer funds of aggregates, and that's we are seeing that. But we believe we will continue to get price increases, so the revenue trends from these end markets will be relatively stable other than residential.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Capital Research.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Capital Research", "Hi, good morning, gentleman.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good Morning.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Capital Research", "Just wondered if you can expand a little bit on your comment with respect to volumes on the second half of the year growing relative to the first half, is that\u2026 is your expectation of year-over-year improvement in the second half on volumes or is it just relative to second half--?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's relative. We see the first half being relatively weaker against prior year's first half than the second half. We don't expect volume to increase second half over second half, but we don't think the decrease will be as great second half over second half as first half over first half. And that's based on, strong reduction in the rate of decline, particularly in some end markets.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Capital Research", "Okay. Can you care to expand on which end markets, you could expect the rate of decline to soften a little bit?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I believe that highways and public infrastructure ought to be better in the second half, housing is anyone's guess, and then the whole non-res, we think the industrial construction particularly in the Southeast and the Gulf Coast is going to continue to be very strong and grow, but retail, buildings it will probably soften. We've seen a number of large retailers, like Home Depot and others have announced a slowing of the number of new stores they are building, and that's probably showing up in the end markets contract award data.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Capital Research", "Sure. And, can you talk a little about diesel, and are you seeing perhaps a change in the distance that you're willing to ship or competitors willing to ship, based on higher diesel costs. Has that changed perhaps over the several last months and does that impact perhaps your pricing strategy?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, certainly, it\u2026 at the end of the day, the delivered cost of aggregates tends to be what matters to customers and I think as the much, much higher cost for diesel fuel has occurred, the shipping radius for trucks or quarries tends to shrink. The railroads are charging higher rates to offset the higher diesel fuel costs they are consuming and even with barge and ship shipments, the ships are dramatically more energy efficient than any other means of aggregate transportation. But even there, I think, the cost of energy have a certainly a very significant impact on the delivered cost of aggregates and that makes a difference in how far people are willing to move.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Capital Research", "Do you see an opportunity there, giving your--?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Certainly, we've said before that that it is one of the reasons that we are able to get price increases in a weaker market just because the shipping radius is diminished.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Capital Research", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital. Please proceed.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning, Don.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jack, how are you?", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks, yourself?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "I wanted to ask with regard to the comment on credit market issues and effects those issues are having on construction, and did you guys\u2026 are you guys actually seeing projects that you thought the customers are telling, you're going to go ahead being delayed or canceled, I mean, was that a more mediated impact here in the last few months?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think our comment is based on macro data, just tightening of credit standards and then some on reduction in consumer confidence and seeing that playing out in the announced retail construction program of many big retailers. So, I think the financial market impacts have a lot to do with consumer confidence. They have a lot to do with tightening credit standards. But in terms of seeing individual projects being canceled, that's not he bases of our comment. Our comments are based totally on the macro outlook that we are seeing in terms of construction awards and lending standards in the announcements of other company.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "But not seeing projects that we had booked or planned on actually being canceled in our market.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. Also you mentioned that the $10 million earn out related to chemicals business, but that did not affect Q1 '08?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No, that's in discontinued operations.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Jack, there is no earnings impact of that, that has been anticipated, so it was just a cash flow benefit.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. I just wanted to clarify that.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, and that will flip over into earnings from discontinued ops once we\u2026 probably in\u2026", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Probably in '09.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, and then continuing for few years after that.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And I wanted to ask to maybe for Dan, update if you could on '08 CapEx, D&A and interest expense?", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "DD&A for 2008 will be in the neighborhood of $395 million. CapEx will still be at\u2026 Cash CapEx will still be at the $485 million number we indicated previously. That excludes, of course, the two acquisitions that Don referenced in his prepared remarks. Those acquisitions were funded through the issuance of stock, so there will be no cash requirement for those two deals. And the interest expense for the year will be in the $185 million to $190 million range and that does anticipate that we term out another $600 million to $800 million of\u2026 or convertible $600 million to $800 million of short-term debt to long-term debt about the middle of the year.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Chris.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "A couple of questions for you. First, could you give us an update on the Lake Belt and the situation down there?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, at this point the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has not yet ruled. We would not be surprised to see a ruling any day now. The other piece of that is the Army Core of Engineers permit. I believe that the Core of Engineers website indicates that their environment impact works\u2026 supplemental environmental impact statement would be released in sometime in May. I don't know whether that's still a good date or not.", "But at this point, most of the quarries are still operating at full throttle. The ones that are limited are the Vulcan quarry, the Titan quarry and one of the White Rock quarry. So, at this point, we are still in the same status we have been since last year and we are waiting on a ruling to see where we go, it's our outlook for the full year assumes in essence simply no change from the status quo. We believe there will be a change from the status quo, but it would be very difficult for us to predict what that would be in terms of earrings impact for the full year. But, so, it really is as negative for us today, as it can be, in the sense that we are limited, while others are not, at this point.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay, that's helpful. The other questions I had were with respect to I really would say were stop transactions, the one in Chicago and the one out in California.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "As well as, then you did an asset swap with Mark Marietta. Could you give us a stance as to valuations as multiple say of EBITDA for the acquired and divested property?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We have done some numbers in the\u2026 depending upon what you include, the range of EBITDAs for the divested properties for the last 12 months is 10.5 to 11, if you go back to the EBITDAs, at the time, we bought them from Florida Rock, the multiple we got was up in the 14 range. So, we were pleased with the outcome. These are great quarries. They are wonderful assets and I know that Martin Marietta and Luck and Frank Foley then in Columbus, Georgia have gotten very good assets and will do well and we were very pleased with the properties we got in exchange plus cash proceeds.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And then the other two stock transactions?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I don't have that information in front of me.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't have that, I am sorry.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. That's fine. But I am guessing it won't be material different?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know that. I just don't have it. I don't have the\u2026", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "No problem, I'll follow backup.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And then one question for you, with respect to the financing, I think you said you anticipated a mid-year type of term out for the rest of that, for another slug of that debt. Have you seen any change with respect to what do you think rates were either worst or better? I know we have had a couple of cuts in interest rate, but yet credit markets have got worst, can you give us an update there as to how you anticipate that playing out?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "What we've been seeing in the last few weeks is a general improvement in the receptivity of the investment grade bond market to new issuances. We are seeing generally more liquidity than we had seen earlier in the year. We are seeing the longer end of the yield curve creep up and we are seeing a little tightening of spreads. I am not sure that it's translating into meeting for your lower rates, but fortunately as the back end of the yield curve has crept up, we have seen a bit of tightening in spreads.", "So, we are not looking at a dramatically different all in costs than we were contemplating few months earlier. But we do, as of this week, feel very good about the liquidity in the market and the ability to place this debt and one of the areas where that has been coming through is that the new issuance concessions or the new issuance premiums have been coming down a little bit. So, all in all, assuming the wheels don't fly off, we are cautiously optimistic that we will have a fairly smooth offering when we do go to market.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay, perfect. That's all I have. Thank you very much gentlemen.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of John Fox with Fenimore Asset Management. Please proceed.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, John.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "I got a number of questions. First, Don, your answer to the last question that 10.5 to 11, was that the multiple of EBITDA on the properties exchanged with Martin?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That was the total package of all properties exchanged. That included some properties from Luck Stone.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. But that was a multiple EBITDA, not the EBITDA itself?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct, yes, multiple.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. And then for the guidance for this year, the base level for shipments, is that the 231 for last year?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. So, we would be--?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And John one of the\u2026 I've said earlier in response to another question that the question was that we expect volumes in the second half to be higher than in the second half of last year and on legacy, the answer to that is no combined Vulcan, the answer is yes, we expect volumes to be higher in the second half of the '08 than in the second half of '07.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Right due to the inclusion of the Florida Rock asset.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Right, I got that. Okay. For Dan, given if things go according to plan, would you say that, what would be the debt level at the end of the year?", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Our current projections indicate that we will by the end of the year achieve approximately a $200 million debt reduction from year end 2007, which was right at above $3.7 billion of debt at year end '07.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "And that's with--?", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "$400 million.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. Thank you. And I was just curious about, if you could comment on highway funding and lot of noise about gas tax holiday and different things? And if you could just talk about your appropriations and what do you look to see for highway funding in 2009?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. I think the key issues are things that are being debated and are pending in congress right now. One is the projected shortfall in the Federal Highway Trust bond for the '09 fiscal year and it's about $3.7 billion or so which is the projected shortfall.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Right.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "As you are aware, there is a federal aviation reauthorization bill is in the senate, attached to that is a made whole appropriation for the highway trust fund for the '09 fiscal year. That bill is tied up in some debate over some various and sundry taxes that are unrelated to the highway trust fund that are in there.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "But there is a commitment by Congress to fill that void, or projected void, in the highway trust fund for '09. We are, I think, reasonably optimistic that that problem will get solved. The every billion dollars of highway funding at the federal level generates 35,000 to 45,000 jobs and I think that's a\u2026 in addition to the great need for infrastructure improvements, that's very sensitive in Congress. So, we don't foresee that as being a problem, if it is a problem, it is a matter of timing and it maybe that state DOTs until that hole is plugged or sitting on some contracts and that is probably one of the reasons that we are seeing a little bit of weakness in highway contract awards over the last 3 to 6 months, but we think that one will be okay. The other issue that's going on is the gas tax holiday. We obviously view that as being very poor public policy for a whole lot of reasons even beyond our own economic self interest, it just doesn't make sense.", "The projected impact on an average consumer is very low and there is a big question as to whether they would ever actually see a reduction in gasoline prices or fuel tax reduction. Our information is that leaders in the both House and the Senate have no interest in that and it's right now [inaudible] something that presidential candidates get to debate about on philosophical basis, but there is not any legs to it, but we are encouraged that even though let's say that the gasoline tax should be suspended or also coming back and saying whatever impact that would be on the highway trust fund balance which is projected to be in the range of $10 million would need to be restored out of other funds.", "So, we don't think even if that holiday is passed, that it will ultimately affect the highway trust fund. The third big issue is reauthorization, which would begin in FY 2010.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Right.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The report of the commission which the last time bill authorized is come out, I am sure you read it, but it is calling for dramatic increases in pubic infrastructure spending, particularly highways. We also note with some interest, the growing coalition of state and local government leaders that is bipartisan, it has Governor Schwarzenegger, it has Governor Rendell from Pennsylvania, have Mayor Bloomberg and they are basically saying, we have dramatically underspent on public infrastructure spending. This has to change. It should no be a political football, and so we think there is a growing consensus among state and local government leaders and very high profile leaders, like the three I mentioned, to change the mindset, particularly in the White House about what public infrastructure spending also look like in the next six year bill.", "There is a lot of work to be done, a lot of analysis to be done, but we are\u2026 I think, we are bullish on the ultimate outcome and as painful as it is to pickup the newspaper and read about our presidential candidate proposing to spend the gasoline tax, it is forcing the debate and it is forcing the issue in Congress and that is, we think that is ultimately positive.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Please proceed.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Good morning.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Could you guys give us a little bit more clarity on the guidance as far as volume, like you gave us in February where you breakout legacy Vulcan and then with Florida Rock, I understand what with Florida Rock is, but can you break it out what just legacy Vulcan expectations will recognize?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I can do that for the first quarter and legacy Vulcan volume were down about 18%. Legacy Florida Rock volumes including the divested quarries for the first quarter were down something like 27% in aggregate volume. As we go forwarded that becomes increasingly a murky, because we are moving volume to the most efficient quarry location, and so the difference between legacy Florida Rock and legacy Vulcan has essentially gone away.", "Recall every Florida Rock operation was essentially a bolt-on operation to existing Vulcan operations and part of the synergy and the transaction is particularly in a time of very hard diesel fuel cost is optimizing the source of material to customers and project to minimize the transportation costs and that's by barge, by rail, by truck and by ship, all of which were implicated between the Vulcan and Florida Rock ingredients.", "Clearly, Florida volumes, we expect the state of Florida both legacy Vulcan and legacy Florida Rock volumes, we project to be weak throughout 2008. So, overall, it will be increasingly difficult for us as quarters go on to say, legacy volume was up or down. We can do it from individual quarries, but the problem is, we are making conscious shifts to move volume back and forth and that complicates or makes the analysis far less reliable.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. And them just one other question, with the run up of diesel that you guys have talked about quite a bit, that's impacting you guys, the 8%, you have brought your guidance, the pricing guidance to just more of a finite 8%. Does this assume any additional price increases, maybe mid-year or something to help offset diesel or are all those price increases already in place?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "There will be some price increases. As we have said before at Vulcan, we do pricing by product, by customer, by quarry, and not some overall price increase at some point in the year. There will be price increases that will take effect throughout 2008. They are not all in place at this point. We don't\u2026 typically Vulcan does not provide the truck transportation. For our aggregates, we do that only in a couple of markets.", "So in that respect, we would not have any sort of surcharge. Certainly, we provide barge transportation and ship transportation and we typically would not have a fuel surcharge but would have an adjustment as those costs change and the rail movements often times will have a fuel surcharge from the railroads and we would work that out on a case-by-case basis with our customer.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay, thank you. And I just have one last question and I apologize if I missed this. But on the acquisitions that you talked about on the call, not related to the Florida Rock divestitiures and swaps, what kind of impact, if any, do you expect from these acquisitions in the year, and is that I guess in your guidance as well?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It is in our guidance. There will be additional aggregate volume from those operations. They were not\u2026 and I think this is an important point, while those two transactions were not a part of the swap with Martin Marietta or Luck Stone per say, they were done as part of the overall 1031 transaction which allowed us to defer gain on the disposition of the quarries by reinvesting the proceeds in other quarries and that's\u2026 so in that sense, they were part of a larger transaction.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. So, if I understand that right, so they were part of the $0.41 that you guys already talked about?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The $0.41 is just the two operations that were divested that were legacy Vulcan operations.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. I got you.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, the Florida Rock operations were pursuant to purchase accounting, were written-off to whatever we sold them for [ph]. So, there will be no gain or loss on the disposition of legacy Florida Rock operations.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Where the effect of the inclusion of the two acquisitions, the one in Illinois and the one California, have an effect is really in the cash taxes that are paid. It shows up more in the cash flow schedule and not in the income statement, because it is allowing us to differ some of the gain on disposition of the nine operations that we had to sell.", "So, we are not paying as much cash tax on those tax gains and that's where the effect really, really manifested. So, in the entire mix of acquisitions and divestitures by employing the 1031 exchange, we have already differed approximately $30 million in cash tax savings and we still are teeing up additional properties to match against some of that and will have additional cash tax savings. That's all embedded in the debt reduction guidance that I gave earlier.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And for those of you who have followed Vulcan over a longer period of time, you realized we are far more focused on cash flows than accounting earnings and so we have tried to structure the transactions in a way to maximize the cash benefit and not the accounting results.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Aynsley Lammin with Citi. Please proceed.", "Aynsley Lammin - Citigroup", "Hi, good morning.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Aynsley Lammin - Citigroup", "And could you just first one, if you just comment a bit on the kind of cement market in Florida and your expectations for volume and prices this year? And if you could just remind us of the annual capacity you got in cements and the expansion plan. I think it was just the plant in Newberry 2009 coming on, if you can just confirm that. And then secondly just kind of returning back to the aggregates, your expectations of the margins in the aggregates business, is the increase in process you are seeing. Are they just enough to offset the cost or would you expect some margin expansion in the aggregates segment this year as well?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll address the cement question and ask Dan to comment on the margin question. We have about 850,000 tons of domestic production capacity at the Newberry plant. The second phase of that plant will come on stream probably by the end of the first quarter of 2009. Cement production and consumption in the state of Florida now is affected by the dramatic reduction in imports. The increase in production capacity for the domestically produced cement and the decline in the demand have so far been, I think in reasonable balance.", "There are, as our additional 850,000 tons of capacity coming on at the end of first quarter '09 with a couple of other plants that will add to capacity in Florida will in all likelihood create some excess capacity at current levels of demands. Hopefully current levels of demand in Florida are not permanent they will begin to recover in 2009, 2010 timeframe, but the reduction is supply has come largely come from imports. But the\u2026 but I think it's a fair conclusion that the new capacity coming on stream given the current level of demand will create excess cement capacity in Florida. Certainly some of that capacity is now being shipped outside the state. And that will certainly continue as well. Dan can get to your margin question.", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The margins that we see for cement are on a cash margin basis, which would exclude the effect of many of the step up and depreciation charge. As a percent of revenue or on a per ton basis, they are actually about flat with the 2007 comparable levels. And that had to do with the makeshift that Don mentioned and that being we are selling a lot less, imported cement on which we make a thinner margin and a bigger proportion of our cement sales are on produced cement.", "And so the mix affect is actually yielding roughly a comparable cash margin. Of course the growth profit margin, gross profit as a percent of revenues will be lower and a lot of that reduction is attributable to the step up in depreciation growing out of purchase accounting.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "There was a county in earlier, question earlier about the impact of the cost of higher fuel prices certainly the cost of imported cement and Florida is affected not only by those higher fuel costs but also by the weakness of the dollar. So if you are buying Euro based cement, and importing it into Florida with higher fuel cost you can understand why the imports have been\u2026 the supply side that has gone away.", "Aynsley Lammin - Citigroup", "Just one final one if you could just, and give an indication of the price of cements in Florida at the moment please?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No, it's plus or minus $100.", "Aynsley Lammin - Citigroup", "Thanks very much. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line Timna Tanners with UBS. Please proceed.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Hi good morning.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Timna.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "I wanted to ask you a little bit more about what your backlog tells you, just how much visibility do you think it provides currently?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think there is any inconsistency with our backlog and our outlook. We don't\u2026 backlog for us is limited to large projects. We are typical smaller project things are not done by long-term contract they may begin and end in a three month cycle. So we wouldn't have a contractual backlog say for things that might go into the third or fourth quarter of 2008. But for the large projects we have more visibility and only industrial projects.", "I think things are more robust now than they have been in the past and I mentioned particularly things that relate to energy projects, that is refineries and LNG facilities and that relate to heavy manufacturing things like rail cars and automobiles that are increasingly being manufactured in the South-East and the steel, growth in steel business to supply those automobile and rail car facilities, there is very good visibility there. There is almost no backlog based on residential construction, there never is and that's just done on almost spot basis. Highways, large highway projects do have some visibility and we are, I think, we are well positioned there and are confident as I said in our prepared remarks, about the stability of demand for highways.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Okay, great and then just the other question I had with on non-energy related cost. If you could give a little bit more color on the impact of higher explosives in steel costs for you?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, explosives are derivative of natural gas and so they have moved up with natural gas prices. We consume steel in the crushing process and certainly steel prices are up. But the big impact on our cost in the first quarter, were not those items. It was primarily diesel fuel and the fixed cost absorption impact of lower production volumes. Other than those two items, we had very good cost performances in the quarter. Dan, do you have any additional information to attend [ph] this question?", "Daniel F. Sansone - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Drilling and blasting costs did rise, probably in the neighborhood of 10% to 11% on a per unit basis and that again reflects the energy content embedded in those costs. But that's a relatively small proportional of our total cost of sale. So, it is not really moving the total cost picture that far out of whack. It's really the diesel and energy cost that are the most dramatic.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And the real opportunity for us on the cost side is labor efficiency and productivity and cash period cost management, both of which we think our guys did a really good job on the first quarter and are very focused on the remainder of the year.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our final question will come from the line of [inaudible]. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi good morning gentlemen, I had just one question regarding price increase Martin Marietta in its press release mentioned some possible mid-year aggregates price, what do you think about that?", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well as I said in response to an earlier question we will have price increases for some products in some markets through out the year. At this note as I read the Martin Marietta press release that their first quarter prices increased something below 4% and they were projecting, I guess full year may be an 8% price increase, so I would assume from that that they expect to have some price increases throughout the year. At the end of the year we don't know where they will come out or where we will come out, but we are in substantially different markets then they are. So the overall pricing that we achieve and they achieve would be largely independent of each other.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you very much.", "Donald M. James - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much for your interest we look forward to talking with you at the end of the second quarter. We will see you then thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect.

Davidson", "Michael Betts - JPMorgan", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2008 Vulcan Materials' Earnings Conference Call. My name is Dan and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today's call, Mr. Don James, Chairman and CEO. Please proceed sir.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter results and our outlook for 2009. I am Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan and we hope our remarks and dialog today will be helpful to you. A replay of this conference call will be available later today on our website.", "Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mac Badgett and Danny Shepherd, two of our Senior Vice Presidents in Construction Materials.", "Before I begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions to these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "The fourth quarter brings to a close a very challenging year. The economic uncertainty, turmoil in the financial markets and tighter credit standards weakened the construction activity further in 2008. Our employees continue to respond aggressively to weakness in demand for our products by making tough decisions regarding reducing operating hours, rationalizing our production facilities and reducing manning levels.", "To underscore this point, a turn of aggregates in 2008 in our legacy business generated more cash earnings than it did last year in 2007, and over 50% more cash earnings than it be at the peak of the demand cycle in 2005. This fact highlights the sound fundamentals of Vulcan's aggregates business, the capabilities of our organization and the attractiveness of the markets we serve.", "Fourth quarter earnings in our aggregates segment were lower compared to last year. Sharply lower volumes more than offset the earnings effect on price improvement and prudent cost control. The current downturn in demand for aggregates began in the second quarter of 2006. We have since recorded 11 consecutive quarters of lower shipments on a same-quarter basis. Aggregate shipments declined 23% versus last year's fourth quarter. Full year aggregate shipments were 204 million tons, a 12% decline from 2007.", "In the fourth quarter, the average freight adjusted unit sales price for aggregates increased approximately 6% from the prior year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we achieved a 7% increase over 2007.", "During the fourth quarter, we continued to adjust production levels to match the lower level of demand. Key operating parameters that measure labor efficiency at our production sites show that our plant managers through actions mitigated a lot of the cost pressures caused by a significantly lower volumes.", "For the full year 2008, the average unit cost for diesel fuel increased 36% from the prior year and lowered operating earnings approximately $37 million. Excluding energy-related costs, such as diesel fuel and electricity, unit variable production cost in legacy Vulcan aggregates operations for full year 2008 increased modestly from the 2007 levels. Additionally, cash period cost at legacy Vulcan aggregates operations were approximately 13% lower than last year.", "These cost control measures demonstrate the greater production flexibility for an aggregates plant versus continuous process manufacturing facilities used in many other industries.", "Earnings for our asphalt and concrete segment were lower than the prior year's fourth quarter, due mostly to lower sales volume. Asphalt volumes declined 23% from the prior year's fourth quarter and asphalt mixed prices increased 27% from the prior year.", "The average unit price we paid for liquid asphalt in the fourth quarter was 68% higher than the average unit pricing in the prior year. The average price of liquid asphalt peaked in September of 2008 and declined to each subsequent month with the December price 33% below the September level.", "The rapid escalation in liquid asphalt prices during the second and third quarters made it difficult for us to increase our selling prices for asphalt mix fast enough to cover these costs. Fourth quarter pricing actions began to offset some of the margin erosion experienced early in the year, as higher priced projects replaced lower priced projects. As a result fourth quarter unit material margin improved from the prior year's level.", "Concrete sales volumes increased 39% from the prior year's fourth quarter due to the addition of Florida Rock operations. Sales volumes in our legacy concrete business declined 18% from the prior year.", "Selling administrative and general expenses on the fourth quarter of 2008 increased $11 million from the prior year. Lower performance-based compensation was more than offset by the inclusion of legacy Florida Rock businesses by $5 million of expenses for the fair market value donated property and the project cost related to the replacement of our legacy IT systems and the related consolidation of certain administrative support functions. Excluding these items from both periods, SAG expenses declined 8% from the prior year's fourth quarter.", "Before I move into comments regarding 2009, let me say in summary that our management teams are running their businesses well in an extremely tough economic environment. Throughout 2008, we remain focused on aggressively controlling cost while realizing higher pricing for our products to reflect their value in the attractive markets we serve. These actions help preserve profitability reached on the aggregates sold in 2008.", "Turning now to our outlook; cash generation through cost control and pricing discipline and utilizing our cash for debt reduction remain priorities in 2009. Broad based economic weakness and extremely tight credit markets continue to hamper construction activity, and foster greater than usual uncertainty in projecting demand for our products.", "The construction industry has been hard hit by above-average unemployment and weak demand. Reduced levels of contract awards in Vulcan-served markets point toward a lower residential, private non-residential and highway construction activity in 2009, excluding the impact of the Economic Stimulus Plan now pending in Washington.", "The Economic Stimulus Plan being voted on today in the Senate includes much needed funding for transportation and other infrastructure-related projects that will benefit the construction industry. We have ample production capacity located in attractive markets and we have strong unit cash margins. Any increase in demand for our products due to the Stimulus Bill can be met quickly, efficiently and profitably.", "Key Vulcan-served states such as California, Florida and Texas should receive the largest percentage of highway funding out of the Stimulus Plan and are likely targets for above-average funding for other stimulus spending for infrastructure across their large population base. Vulcan sales in these three states should benefit from our aggregate-focused strategy that is complemented by our asphalt and concrete operations in these states.", "Because the passage of an economic stimulus plan should have broad reaching effect on the demand for our products forecast in 2009, sales volumes in aggregate asphalt and concrete including the effect of the stimulus plan, at this point is both challenging and premature. Therefore, my outlook comments on end market demand excludes any impact from the Economic Stimulus Plan. My comments also exclude any impact from the ruling two weeks ago in the Lake Belt litigation which I'll comment on briefly in the future.", "With respect to Vulcan-served markets, we expect aggregates demand in all non-housing related end markets to be down in the mid-single digit range and residential demand to decline as much as 20% in 2009. As a result, full year aggregate shipments for Vulcan are expected to decline 5% to 10% from 2008 levels, exclusive of the Economic Stimulus Plan.", "We expect selling prices for aggregates to rise 6 to 8% in 2009 and to help offset the earnings effects of lower volumes. We expect earnings from our asphalt and concrete segment to increase in 2009 due primarily to a recovery in material margins in our asphalt businesses, where higher selling prices reflect the past year's increases in costs for key raw materials. Asphalt and concrete sales volumes in 2009 are expected to be slightly lower than 2008 levels.", "Segment earnings in cement will be lower in 2009, due to higher cost and weak demand. Our outlook assumes that diesel fuel prices increase modestly from the unit price level at the end of 2008. If prices remain at that level, our average cost of diesel fuel will be approximately $1.40 per gallon, lower than the 2008 average unit price.", "Our sensitivity to changes in diesel fuel prices has diminished some given the current weakness in demand. At the peak of demand, we purchased about 65 million gallons of diesel. In 2009, we expect to purchase about 45 million gallons of diesel fuel. As a result every $0.10 per gallon change in the price effects pre-tax earnings approximately $4.5 million at current demand levels.", "We expect SAG expense to be slightly lower in 2009 that has increased costs related to the replacement of legacy IT systems and the related consolidation administrative support functions are offset by the effects of cost reduction programs. Interest expense in 2009 is expected to be approximately $200 million, based on the current level of short-term interest rates for the short-term portion of our debt.", "As I mentioned earlier, the timing and level of investment for infrastructure that will be contained in the final Economic Stimulus Plan are unknown at this point. Based on our preliminary analysis, we believe Vulcan-served states will receive the majority of the spending.", "For planning purposes, we have begun to analyze the potential volume impact of Vulcan by making high-level broad based assumptions about the volume intensity of the various infrastructure-related projects contemplated in the stimulus plan. We have identified three broad categories of infrastructure in the current stimulus plan which could contain our products. Those categories would include transportation, including highways, transit and airports; water and environmental infrastructure; and building infrastructure which would includes schools, military buildings and medical and other facilities.", "For example, transportation infrastructure is the most aggregates-intensive construction project type. For every billion dollars spent on highways, approximately 14 million tons of aggregate are consumed, assuming a normal mix of highway projects. This factor could increase if ready-to-go projects or more heavily toward resurfacing and lane additions, rather than historical spending patterns which include large multiyear write-away acquisitions and earth moving, which have no aggregate content.", "For Vulcan, our sizeable asphalt and concrete businesses provide additional earnings potential from highway projects. That same billion dollar spend on highways could also lead to four to five million tons of asphalt mix and 150,000 cubic yards of concrete.", "Water and environmental-related infrastructure including clean water projects and other water resource projects can also consume large quantities of aggregates. For every billion spent on water and environmental infrastructure, we estimate 5 to 6 million tons of aggregates could be consumed along with 300,000 tons of asphalt mix and 200,000 cubic yards of concrete.", "Every billion dollar spent on building infrastructure could result in consumption of 2 to 3 million tons of aggregates, 200,000 tons of asphalt mix and 700,000 cubic yards of concrete. However, until such time as the stimulus plan assigned by the President and specific project lifts are available from the respective contracting agencies, it will be difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of the incremental sales volumes and potential earning impact for Vulcan.", "Another development I want to touch on briefly is the status of the Lake Belt Litigation in South Florida. On January 30th, of 2009 the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida issued a ruling invalidating all permits approved in 2002 for limestone mining in the Lake Belt area of Miami-Dade, after being reversed on appeal previously. The ruling pertains The US Army Corps of Engineers issued permits to several companies including the permit issued to Vulcan's Miami quarry.", "The companies in the Lake Belt region affected by the ruling are preparing to appeal as soon as possible. The Lake Belt region historically has supplied as much as 50 to 55 million tons of aggregates to Florida markets, including Miami Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa.", "As I mentioned, Vulcan has one quarry affected by the latest ruling. In 2008, Vulcan's Miami quarry sold approximately 1.5 million tons. The limestone reserves in this region also served as an important source of feedstock for the cement plants in Miami. Vulcan's cement plant in Florida is not in the Lake Belt and is not affected by this ruling.", "Our business has generated significant amounts of cash throughout different economic cycles. In 2008, we generated $624 million of cash earnings despite continued weakness in demand.", "We reinvested $415 million in our plants and equipment, returned $215 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and reduced total debt of $109 million. As we look forward to 2009, we expect another year of solid cash earnings, even without the benefit of the Economic Stimulus Plans.", "Our plants and equipment are in very good condition. Reinvestment in these assets over the last few years has increased production efficiency and capacity and reduced the average age of our rolling equipment. As a result, we expect capital spending in 2009 to be approximately $200 million, down sharply from the 415 in 2008.", "Last week, we issued $400 million of long-term debt to provide additional liquidity to supplement our bank facilities. Berkshire Hathaway was the sole investor in the transaction and we appreciate their confidence in our business. We expect to reduce total debt by $200 million during 2009.", "In closing, I would like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. The confidence comes from our successful strategy to establish an aggregates-focused business that has the compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S markets that are expected to experience above-the-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future. The current economy is weak, but the Economic Stimulus Plan moving through Congress will provide much needed support for creating jobs and getting our economy back on track.", "For Vulcan, our daily discipline focused on cost control, margin improvement and cash generation, along with maintaining our long-term focus on serving our customers, building our business and creating value for our shareholders will lead us through these challenging economic times.", "Our organization is meeting the challenge in preserving the profitability of our business. Vulcan remains in the top quartile for total shareholder returns among all S&P 500 companies for 2008, as well as for the three-year and five-year periods ending in 2008.", "We thank you for your interest in Vulcan. Now, if our operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Please proceed.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Hi good morning. Just first off on your pricing guidance; 60%, pretty impressive for 2009 considering looking at probably for straight year volume declines. Just wondering, if you could talk about, you're obviously confident of that number but what markets are giving you particular confidence and will you be able to achieve that?", "Donald James", "I think, overall we are seeing the opportunities for price improvement. Some markets are weaker than others, but its' not focused on any one market. I would say it is generally overall.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Okay. And just to be clear, your pricing guidance does not include the Lake Belt.", "Donald James", "It does not include any effect from the Lake Belt.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Okay, and just a follow-up on that point; are you seeing any weakness in the pricing in any of your markets?", "Donald James", "Well, yes. I think California has been weaker than normal. Other than that, I think there are some parts of Florida that have weakened, but overall our price increases have been good across the country.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Okay, I just lastly, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, you expect have a mid-single digit volume decline on the combined non-housing end markets. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you are seeing both on the non-res side and on the public works side?", "Donald James", "Well non-res, the buildings part of non-res was down about 8% in 2008, and I think we expect it to be down another 7% in 2009. That includes office buildings and retail hotels. There is not a great deal of strength in that end market.", "Other infrastructures, construction volume was down about 11% in 2008. We see that being down about 6% in 2009. The strong point there is we I think have said publicly is in large industrial and energy projects along the Gulf Coast which have been the bright spot for us over the last year and should continue to be and are continuing to be bright spot for us in 2009.", "Housing was extremely weak in 2008, which should come as no surprise. It was down about 37% and I think we believe it's going to be down about 19 or 20% more in 2009, down 37% in 2008. Highways were down about 9% in 2008. We expect that to be down may be 6%. There are several things working there. Obviously, the stimulus being one of them and the California infrastructure program being another one.", "Hopefully, California Legislature will vote on its budget this week. Right now those projects are stalled because of the budget issues in California. But with the passage of a budget which would free up the bond money, hopefully those projects can restart. But and as I said, all of these are without regard to the effect of whatever stimulus package gets passed in Washington in the next couple of weeks.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Okay, thanks for the detail Don. Just one quick follow-up on the large energy projects that you talked about in Gulf Coast. I know they've been source of stability for you. Are you seeing them continue in '09 or are you seeing actually maybe an influx of new projects that are going to be coming up on the books?", "Donald James", "I think it's the continuation of multiyear projects rather than starting of new project. You could say this Winston crop (ph) plant is just starting in '09 but it's really underway and has been underway in '08. So that will be... those are large multiyear projects. There is a large rail multi-model facility that's starting construction south of Chicago and that should continue for throughout 2009. Those are the two examples.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from KeyBanc Capital Markets, please proceed.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Donald James", "Hi Chris.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "A couple of questions for you. Whenever we think about your debt that you have got sitting here today, what's the maturity schedule over the next six to twelve months that you are looking at?", "Donald James", "We have 250 million of bonds that we will pay off in April and then we don't have a significant bond repayment until the end of 2010 and it's in the $300 million range. There are small amounts of maturities coming due along the way but nothing large other than the weak maturities.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay are there any specific... what are the covenants within there that are most restricted to you? Are there any balance sheet-related covenants for shareholder equities and things ...", "Donald James", "Chris not in the bond transactions. No, in our bank lines of credit, we have a single covenant that debt-to-total capital and not to exceed 65%. Our current level is about 48%, so there is plenty of headroom there. The bond deals due have change to control provisions which are customary. But there is no other financial covenants in those bond deals as well as there is no coupon step-ups in the current outstanding bonds either.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay, last question I had on the finance side is related to your dividend. I think you highlighted that it was about $215 or so million users of cash this past year. In light of... well, I guess we work for banks, so it's invoked the cut dividends. But when you think about usage of cash for the next twelve months, is it more important to you to continue to work down debt or how do you think about that dividend?", "Donald James", "Well, our Board will consider our dividend, quarterly dividend our board meeting end of this week. Certainly a factor we look at in addition to GAAP earnings or cash earnings, we had about $624 million of cash earnings in 2008 to support the $215 million dividend. So our Board will make that decision. But we continue to believe that reducing debt is important, but we also believe returning cash to shareholders when we have cash is an appropriate use of cash. So we will try to balance those priorities.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And last question I had was, in your volume outlook of down 5 to 10% for the full year, from a momentum standpoint coming out of the fourth quarter down I think 23% or so, do you think it's... you have some tougher comps in the first half versus back half or, how would you help us think about the momentum of that working through the year?", "Donald James", "Well, as we've said I think many times before Chris, you really can't draw momentum conclusions much from the fourth quarter or the first quarter, because weather tends to be a big factor in those quarters. Clearly demand is slowing, but as you point out, we will have more favorable comps in the second half of '09 compared to the second half of '08.", "We do our forecast on both a macro basis and a bottom-up basis and they both come in within this range. So we believe that while demand will continue to be weak in '09 that volumes should come in within that range, again ex the impact of an economic stimulus package and without taking into account whether the Lake Belt ruling will increase or decrease our volumes in Florida.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much gentlemen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Kasprzak from BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning, Don.", "Donald James", "Good morning, Jack.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "I wanted to ask first, what sort of tax rate assumptions should we be using for 2009?", "Donald James", "Our tax rate we think will be about 27%.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "And I was going to ask about volumes as well. I guess a follow-up to the last question, ask a little differently. The guidance is down 5 to 10%, but it looks to me like there's no reason to think the first half of '09 would be any better than the second half of '08 when the volumes are down a little more than 20% on a same-on-same basis. Looking at things like housing permits are down as much as 50% right now, when you look at the seasonally adjusted rate. And if that's the case, the first half of '09 is down again 20% just to get to a down 10 for the year, you have to be about flat in the back half. I mean am I... the macro picture, am I missing something or how would that square with the way you guys see the world?", "Donald James", "Well I am not sure I followed your math there. But housing is a dramatically smaller portion of our business going into '09 than it was going into '08 and going into '07. So a large decline in housing has less impact on us now that it has been. Public infrastructure is a larger piece of our business going into '09 than it was going into '08 or '07. And that piece is holding up; holding up as better than most end markets.", "Certainly, and as I said, we did not include any impact of the potential stimulus package but that package will certainly increase the percentage of our shipments that go into publicly-funded infrastructure projects, which is the strongest demand segment, even without the infrastructure package as we move into 2009.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay that's helpful thank you. With regard to your pricing, your guidance above 6 to 8%. Would that be on a same product basis or would there be some mix effect, some mix shift that might be favorable in 2009?", "Donald James", "Well that's the total weighted, total average of our pricing over all products. So the mix shift, any mix shift both in terms of products and geographies is included in that guidance. I would say that we would expect to see greater shipments into public infrastructure projects and lower shipments into housing. There is always some geographic shift and product mix shift that goes on from year-to-year. But the 6 to 8% includes all of that. But I don't think there is any material change that would move that significantly one way or the other in geographic mix or product mix.", "Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Kathryn Thompson, of Avondale Partners. Please proceed.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Hi, thank you.", "Donald James", "Hey Kathryn.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Just a question regarding pricing. I know you gave your full year guidance, but in looking how pricing has trended on to $20 basis it's tended down pretty much of the last four quarters and then looking into '09, assume that there you see a similar trend going to Q1. It would imply fairly significant upside into the back half of the year in pricing. Are we thinking about that correctly or is there another way that you would guide us to think for '09?", "Donald James", "I'm not sure I understand the predicate of your question, pricing has continued to increase.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Don, I was just saying on a dollars basis, so on an unit basis", "Donald James", "Yes. Pricing in dollars is higher in '08 than it was in '07 by 7%.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Sure.", "Donald James", "Now the momentum --", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "That's what I'm taking about", "Donald James", "Has been reduced. But we think ...we think that as we look at '09, the opportunities for pricing will not be the same in every market for every product. But overall, as we roll it up we think the write-up price increase in '09 should be comfortable to that we achieved in '08.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "What I'm asking is do you expect the momentum improve in the back half of the year as opposed to having equal momentum throughout the year. That's really what I was asking?", "Donald James", "I don't have that much insight. I think it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. But we don't really look at it on that basis.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Okay. What is --", "Donald James", "Full year pricing is a much more reliable indicator to us than trying to talk about it quarter by quarter.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Sure. Absolutely, and really we're just looking for trends. I know that you'd announced a price increase and just wondering any color about how these are sticking?", "Donald James", "Are you talking about aggregates or --?", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Aggregates.", "Donald James", "We believe that we will get price increases again, they don't come at different times in different markets for different products and different end users. We have not had pricing... downward pricing pressure except with respect to Southwest Florida. That's been the one place where there's been some significant pricing pressure. In California with all the new work that's been rolling out, there's certainly been an eagerness on our part and everybody's part to build backlogs, which we've done. But we expect if that infrastructure program in California moves forward that the trends in California probably will resume.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Okay. I guess, just to clarify have you had any price increases announced for aggregates, specifically?", "Donald James", "Yes.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Yes. Okay, that's I...", "Donald James", "I'm sorry I didn't understand that. Yes, absolutely.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Alright. Sorry about the confusion there. Regarding volumes, could you just give a little bit of color about trends at the end of the quarter and your perspective on assuming a stimulus package would be passed by the 1st of March, your perspective on the flow of dollars into '09 and to 2010?", "Donald James", "If the first part of your question is asking what we are seeing about volume so far in '09, we don't disclose that until the end of the quarter and we're not a retail store that discloses weekly or monthly sales, I'm not trying to be difficult as just never been our practice, because there's so much seasonality from in our business particularly in the fourth and first quarters it's more misleading than it is helpful depending on how weather has been. With respect to second part of your question, Kathryn was, could you repeat that?", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Really, once again, most of my questions are based on trends and what's your outlook for the economic stimulus package?", "Donald James", "Okay sure. So much of... the reason, I think it's reasonably clear when you study the Senate Bill that will be voted on shortly and in a matter of hours now. In the house built, you can come up with plus or minus about $60 billion of projects that will used aggregate asphalt and concrete.", "We have... as I gave you in my remarks, we have metrics that have been developed over a time over how much aggregate content per billion dollars of spending and how much asphalt content and how much concrete content. What we will need to do to give more specific guidance on that is to look at what the projects are, where they are and what the timing is. It is harder for us to say how much of this is going to occur in the second half of '09 versus '10 than it is to say there is going to be X million tons of aggregate asphalt and yards of concrete.", "So right now assuming the bills pass and are signed by the President and something that is close to the Senate version or the House version, 60 billion of projects that use our material is a fair number. The harder thing is when that spending occurs spread over second half of '09, '10 and perhaps into '11. We'll continue to work on that once we are able to get the list of projects and the timing of those projects. But that's one reason why forecasting in the near term of the impact of that on our business is very difficult at this point.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Of course I understand difficulty. As you know we've been doing a lot of work on it, and it's liking us to say catching jell, it's very difficult. But really just little color on once again trends and flow and not specifics, because we're definitely not trying to manage quarter-to-quarter, just...", "Donald James", "Right, right. Well, just clearly I think I will... one trend we will see is that public infrastructure spending as a percentage of our total or public infrastructure demand as a percentage of total demand is going to continue to increase, which is a good thing for us. Housing will continue to decrease and the private buildings piece will probably also continue to decrease and large privately-funded infrastructure projects hopefully will have some stability for us in 2009, and hopefully, going on into 2010.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Okay. My final question really relates more to aggregate margins specifically. And the fairly wide swing in the quarter just reported and just to get a sense and how we model for the out year and it seems difficult to guess specific EPS guidance given current market. But at least conceptually, is it fair to think that roughly flat margins on the aggregate gross margins, is appropriate for fiscal '09 or any other qualitative color related to that would be very helpful? Thank you.", "Donald James", "As I indicated in our remarks, our cash margin per ton has continued to improve. The issue for us is the allocation of DD&A over a smaller number of tons, our DD&A for 2008 was $389.1 million. We project it will be about $402,5 million in 2009. If our volumes are in fact down 5 to 10% and we have to spread that slightly higher DD&A over larger tonnage, it will impact our GAAP margins. But our cash margins we think still have some opportunity to improve. Hopefully, you'll see improvement in cash margins but you may see the impact of DD&A on smaller production levels having a negative impact on the GAAP margins. If that helps any.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Yes, it does. We want to be completely secured and one has to... it gives us some sense of direction. That's all I have for right now. Thank you very much.", "Donald James", "Thank you, Kathryn.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from UBS. Please proceed.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Hi, good morning Don, Dan.", "Donald James", "Hello Timna.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Just got a few hopefully quick ones, let's on the price side, and I have to follow-up on that. But in the past you have talked a little about January price increases and then sometimes you may deal price increases. Can you give any sense from the 68% how much of that is already known to you from January price increases and how much might be... remain to be seen later in the year?", "Donald James", "I don't have that king of data. I mean we have some price increases that are in effect in January. We'll have some more that will along in the spring, perhaps some more in the summer. But that somebody always ask me that question and we've never been clever enough to figure out how to answer it.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Okay, you wouldn't give a second average of the January price increases are any sense there.", "Donald James", "No because it's all over the board.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Got you, okay. And then on you did give a great detail but we use to have forecast for EPS and I am wondering if you could tell us why you might have excluded that for the upcoming quarter and for the full year.", "Donald James", "Well, there are couple of reasons one is trying to predict the timing of the effect of the stimulus package is very difficult for us. The other is the economy absent to stimulus package is very difficult for us to predict and we decided that it would be better for us to give you price, volume and elements of cost to let you do your own work than for us to try to predict EPS certainly for a quarter but even for the full year.", "As the year progresses, if the stimulus plan passes and if we get to a point where we have some level of confidence that is not or lack of confidence that is not reflected in the analyst estimates, we will consider guidance. But at this point, as you know we were wrong throughout much of 2008. And we need to get to a point where there is some predictability and stability in the economy and demand in order to have confidence in giving you EPS guidance.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "That's fair. And I don't mean to be picky about this but could you give us a level of confidence in your volume and price forecast. As well can... that is sort of the same argument, you just said that at this point in time that to your best estimates of the things the influx?", "Donald James", "Yes, I think that's a fair statement.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Okay, great. And final question from us, on the goodwill side that declined about $600 million quarter-to-quarter. Do we miss something there that you explained?", "Donald James", "What that was Kim is a reclassification of dollars from goodwill end of last year into other intangibles. At year end last year, we were... we had just close the Florida Rock transaction and had very limited time to fully evaluate the whole array of intangibles that were acquired with that business. And as you know, the accounting rules require you to, in a very detailed fashion try to identify all intangibles by items. And so what you're seeing is a shift of dollars out of goodwill which was kind of a holding account, if you will at last year end into an array of other intangibles.", "For the most part those other intangibles have to do with the value... the estimated value of the zoning and permitting that's in place at the aggregate production facilities. And that most of that shift from goodwill into other intangible will be become amortizable through the P&L over time, where as the amount that we made in goodwill will not.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Okay. And then along those lines do you have any comments that you can regarding the potential or the reasons why or why not you'd have to consider any write-down related to Florida Rock.", "Donald James", "At this point in time we've completed our year-end goodwill impairment testing and have not taken an impairment charge. So it's judgment of management that these assets are not impaired. But under the accounting rules that test occurs annually, right at the minimum. So we'll continue to look at it and so right now we've satisfied ourselves that we do not believe there has been an impairment.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Okay great, thank very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Trey Grooms from Stevens Incorporated. Please proceed.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Good morning.", "Donald James", "Hey Trey.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Hey. Just a couple of quick questions. Don one is related to competition; with pull back in diesel that we have seen since summer time, do you have any markets where you are seeing an increase in competition as we have got lower diesel prices and folks are eager to go further to find volume?", "Donald James", "Well that's certainly a possibility and that is some thing we will have to look at. That works both ways. Our shipping radius certainly improves some as do our competitors. So that's just one of the things that our guys have to take into account, every day, every week when they are bidding jobs and quoting prices.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "And I didn't know, when you are looking at your markets, you have got several way you have got great market share and I didn't know if there was just some in particular that you could point to and say yeah, these are the ones that we are worried about where there are some guys on the edges that are I guess kind of neck-neck to edges if you will and as diesel comes down, you can see this increase?", "Donald James", "Not. I don't think there is any particular markets where that's a bigger factor than in others. That's been part of this industry and part of this business for ever is the delivered cost of material and that's just the factor that we take into account in our whole pricing and competitive structure. We have competition in every market and it will then flow for a lot of reasons, including the price of diesel fuel.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Okay, that's helpful. And I know that this next question it gets more difficult as time goes on as you've indicated before, but could you give us an idea what legacy volume was in aggregates in the quarter as far as, how much it was down?", "Donald James", "Yeah, I do have that. Legacy volume was down in the fourth quarter about 26%.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Okay, that's helpful. And then you laid out some detail on kind of what's going on with GAAP margins and it sounds like its mostly a function of the volume there with the DD&A. Can you also give us an idea just where... kind of how the fixed versus variable structure kind of shakes out right now?", "Donald James", "Go ahead Dan.", "Daniel Sansone", "Of the cost of producing a ton of aggregates today, approximately 30 to 35% of that would be considered a fixed cost with a half to two-thirds of that fixed cost probably skewed more towards the two-thirds at the moment being depreciation, depletion and amortization. The rest being cash fixed costs associated with supervision and basic services at the manufacturing facilities.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Okay, that's helpful. And then Don, you gave us some metrics related to demand versus, I guess that would be generated from different amount spent and that was very helpful. But like for example the number that you gave for highway for every billion dollars spent, it was 14 million tons, is that a current prices for aggregates?", "Donald James", "Yes.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Okay and I guess my last question would be on the asphalt side?", "Donald James", "That number can move. I mean that's a number that's based on a lot of highway projects over a lot of years adjusted for throughout the year end '08 aggregate price.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Okay.", "Donald James", "Did that answer your question?", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Yes absolutely.", "Donald James", "How much of that we ultimately get at Vulcan depends on where it is. Whether we gets the work whether we don't, but we'll have a lot better calibration of that if we move down the timeline of when those projects get approved by Congress and when they're put out to bid by the contracting agencies.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Sure. One other question on CapEx, you'd kind of reiterated the $200 million for 2009. How close are we getting at that $200 million level. How close are we getting to kind of have bear bounds kind of maintenance CapEx for you guys?", "Donald James", "Well our five-year average replacement CapEx has been about $160 million about year and that's on legacy Vulcan. Of course we now have the Florida Rock assets as well. But, I think $200 million a year is ample for replacement CapEx. Obviously, other things that will come along to be profit improvement projects or volume improvement projects would not be necessarily included in that number. But, we think we're fine given our current state of our plant and equipment, to be able to maintain that effectively at 200 million a year.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Okay. And then I've just have two other quick questions. One is on price of aggregates. You've mentioned, you expect greater shipment in the infrastructure projects and less in the housing in 2009. Is there a much of a price difference as far on aggregates that going into those different end markets?", "Donald James", "I don't believe we would change our pricing guidance based on whether the stimulus bill passes or does not pass. It really, there is a volume impact but we don't believe there will be a price impact coming from the stimulus package.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Okay. But, so if, I guess if you are looking at it, with the demand being higher for infrastructure projects ex-stimulus, would just in general terms is infrastructure... aggregates that go into the infrastructure projects typically higher or lower or about the same price as something going into some top of the building or some top of residential construction?", "Donald James", "Pricing would generally be higher, because specifications are tighter. And often times we have a better competitive advantage on tight specification projects like federal highways and airports. Housing on the other end just typically would not have as high a specification. So there is a pricing benefit to public infrastructure, but it also cost us more to produce some of that high specification material. So there is not a dramatic margin differential between different end markets although pricing can be higher, it can push our cost.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Okay. And then my last question is just to make sure I understand, I understood one of your comments earlier on the 6 to 8% you'd mentioned that you have price increases out now. But did I hear you correctly that you have price increases now and also expect to have like a mid-year price increase as well?", "Donald James", "I know people can't get their head around this one, but we price material every day, every week and we don't put out a general overall U.S. price increase to all customers for all products on January 1, and another one on July 1. That's just not the way we price products. So, the answer to your question is, we are getting price increases every week somewhere. We generally put out some price increases at the beginning of the year and some at the beginning of the construction season in some markets and some in mid year. But you shouldn't try to force fit our pricing strategy into... we put out a 8% price increase on January 1 and we are able to get 4% of that, that's just not the way this business works.", "Trey Grooms - Stevens Incorporated", "Okay understood. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Fox from Fenimore Asset.", "Please proceed.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Hi good mornings everyone.", "Donald James", "Hi John.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Believe it or not, I have a couple of questions left.", "Donald James", "Good.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Could we get the actual dollar amount for liquid asphalt fourth quarter of '08, and fourth quarter of '07, please?", "Donald James", "Yes, I will get that for you in just a SEC.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay, and the second, while you are working on that I guess maybe for Dan. Do you anticipate and if so how much your contribution for your pension plan in 2009?", "Daniel Sansone", "There will no mandatory contribution for the pension plan in 2009.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. Dan what's the nature of medium-term investments on the balance sheet?", "Daniel Sansone", "Those were some investments that we had back... had made back in 2008 in the reserve money market funds. And when they broke the buck, they slowed down their pace of redemption and that's what that money is. We have... we are continuing to receive distribution and but because it's unpredictable as to when we'll get the money, we have reclassified that out of cash and cash equivalents.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. Do you believe that you will get it all?", "Daniel Sansone", "Okay great.", "Daniel Sansone", "Don... and by the way John, we received some $23 million or $24 million of distribution since the end of the year. So we are beginning to see that fund loosen up.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. Alright great.", "Donald James", "John we buy liquid asphalt in four different states. So I won't give you the average price for'07 and '08.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "That would be fine.", "Donald James", "And you recognize we probably didn't buy single ton of liquid asphalt at this price anywhere, but this is the rollup of a lot of different transactions in lot of different locations. Our average price for liquid in 2007 was $321 and in 2008 it was $541. That price differential impacted our material margins in asphalt, which is the margin we make above the material cost. As I've said in my remarks, we have now been able to get our pricing for asphalt mix up to reflect that higher cost of liquid asphalt and our material margins are improving. We expect that to continue into 2009.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. So, was that the fourth quarter price or the average for those two years?", "Donald James", "Averaged for the year. You want fourth quarter?", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "If you have it.", "Donald James", "In the fourth quarter 2007, it was $342 a ton and for '08 it was $574 a ton.", "John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil from Davenport & Company. Please proceed.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "Thanks guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but just to kind of hit on a couple of things to clarify and make sure I'm not jumping to conclusions. When you refer to price weakness in Southwest Florida and in California, is that to say that prices have... your prices have actually fallen in those markets?", "Donald James", "More than Southwest Florida, I think California it's on a product-by-product basis, we're still getting some price increases. Our mix has shifted somewhat in California and that's changed the overall pricing. But California is okay and will be okay and Florida is going to be interesting with respect to the New Year's Lake Belt ruling what happens later?", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "Well, Don I appreciate that. Could you just saying right into my next question which is, has anybody announced a price increase related to that recent ruling down in Lake belt?", "Donald James", "Not that I am aware of. I think everybody in the Lake Belt has shut down. Nobody is operating, there are a few packets. Some of the quarries that are not covered by the Lake Belt permit including a little bit in our Miami quarry. I think most producers have stockpiled raw materials, which they have mined already in the month pile that can be processed and there is probably a fair amount of inventory. I think everybody in that area is probably having to look at their hand to see what happens demand for cement, feedstock by the two large cement producers in the Lake Belt, will be an issue. But as it sits today, I don't think we know we have any price announcement that we are aware of by any of the producers yet. But it's only been as said about two weeks and it's in a period of low demand about from the economy as well as the time of the year. So I think that will play out over the next few months.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "Okay and do you... any I realize that it's a relatively small issue for you guys. But any thoughts on how long as whatever stockpile you guys have done there will ask to you sell.", "Donald James", "Well we have got... we have several months of inventory on the ground. As you may know we did not run that quarry for a good portion of 2008, because of the prior ruling and then once that was reversed, we could resume production which we did. We also have the distribution and transportation and production capacity to continue to move material into Florida from Mexico, from Alabama and from Georgia as need be by ship and by rail.", "So I think there will be a lot of adjusting by the producers in Florida depending on Vulcan outcome of this. The Corps of Engineers permitting process which is ongoing, I think will also have a significant impact on the future of supply in Florida and that of course is not yet known where The Corp is going to come out on all this.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "Got it. On the liquid asphalt you mentioned that you got all the contracts rolling off and new is coming on. Given that liquid prices have come down, are you now seeing the prices on your sort of newest quoted contracts for asphalt mix also coming under pressure, are they're coming down a little bit sort of follow on liquid price down?", "Donald James", "Well as we've said in 2008, our pricing for asphalt mix or the fourth quarter certainly was up. I think that's every project bid and it's hard to say at this point whether what the relationship between liquid asphalt price and asphalt mix price will be. There's a lot of different dynamics in terms of location and jobs and there is certainly not a direct correlation. Typically we do worse on margins in periods of rising liquid asphalt cost and better on margins in period of declining liquid asphalt cost.", "Daniel Sansone", "The way I would think about it is you have as the cost of liquid asphalt stabilizes, many of the market are just returning to what I would describe as historical levels of margins, not distorted by the pace of the change in that input costs?", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "Got it. And final question, one for Dan. On debt-to-cash covenant; two questions. Is that a net debt covenant or a total debt and how is the goodwill treated under that?", "Daniel Sansone", "Total debt to cap, and goodwill is in the well I mean, yeah I mean its debt in capital, I mean it's debt and equity, so it's in there.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "So, if you had... so I understand that you guys have already tested for this year. But if you did take a write-down that would affect your debt-to-cap ratio.", "Daniel Sansone", "Yes, yes it would.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.", "Okay. Alright. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aynsley Lammin from Citigroup. Please proceed.", "Aynsley Lammin - Citigroup", "Hi, good morning. Just another one, fortunately. But in aggregate, if you could just give us a feel for how much inflation is already in the system and I presume that the year end aggregates price was higher than the average for 2008. And then just secondly on the non-res I think, I heard you right. Kind of expected non-res work for demand in the areas to be down around 7% in 2009, that's been quite surprising given how much restrained the kind of lead indicators and other companies just talk about. How quickly non-res has pulled away. If you could just give us some kind of background for that, expectations will be great?", "Donald James", "With respect to... if I understood your first question has to do with how much of our projected 6 to 8% price increases already in place. Let me say for about the fourth time, I don't know. That's not the way we price our products. So I can't answer that question as I ask. And it's not... it's just because we don't do, we don't have metrics on pricing that's once a year or twice a year or three times a year.", "With respect to the projection for non-residential buildings, we saw some decline in that in 2008. We see some more decline in 2009, but these are our markets, the counties that we serve not the total U.S. so there may be some differential there. And with in non-residential building there are probably some overlap between what I'll call private infrastructure. And the non-residential buildings category includes public building as well.", "So if you've driven through a college campus lately you know there is a tremendous amount of construction generally going on there and than they are state and local facilities as well as federal facilities including the big barrack programs, base realignment and closure programs which are very significant in many of our markets where the military are building new facilities, as they close bases and move things to other bases. So all of that rolled up together is in the non-res building category which is both public and private that may be the place that you are seeing disconnected, if you are not putting the public piece in that category.", "Aynsley Lammin - Citigroup", "Okay, just on the price, I was trying to ask the question of how much do already been kind of price. Just if you have a feel for, how much rolling over was from 2008, or was that probably you are going to --", "Donald James", "Well, some of it clearly is rolling over, meaning is already in place. I can't quantify what that is", "Aynsley Lammin - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions", "Donald James", "Good morning", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson", "Just on the pricing guidance. Obviously, thanks every much for the forecast there in terms of aggregate and asphalt. And it looks like Q4 price for concrete looks a little bit better. Do you have any sense or can you give any direction where you see pricing go into that business or for that product going forward?", "Donald James", "Well, concrete... there has been a large reduction in concrete volume throughout the U.S, first from housing now from at least a privately-funded portion non residential buildings. We expect concrete pricing to be relatively stable in '09. Not any significant opportunity for increases or any pressure for erosion volumes are down there. And until housing begins to recover that's concrete volumes are likely to stay relatively flat.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson", "Okay great. Thank you. And then I guess just a broader question in terms of I mean were there any particular states I guess that surprised you had a positive or negative in terms of recorded volumes in the quarter?", "Donald James", "Well the strongest markets we have had for 2008 as a whole and to try to do it on quarterly basis would be distorted, but the entire Gulf Coast has been our strongest market, from Texas to Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. That's where those have been our best markets. And that surprises a lot of people but that's the reality of where our demand has been strongest.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson", "Okay great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Betts from JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Michael Betts - JPMorgan", "Yes. Good morning.", "Donald James", "Hey Mike.", "Daniel Sansone", "Hi Mike.", "Michael Betts - JPMorgan", "Hi. I had three questions if I could. You will be relieved none of them to do with pricing. The first one is Don, can I just ask you in terms of cost; you have obviously talked about asphalt and diesel. Are there any other pressure on the this year, I mean people across I mean they like it to be fairly flat or general inflation of 2 or 3%. Could you give me some kind of guidance on what sort of cost increases you like to see on the other stuff?", "Donald James", "You know, we'll see some price I mean wage increases for our hourly workforce. We expect to more than make it up with productivity and efficiency. Steel components were a factor in 2007-2008, not so much a factor are in 2009. So, when our... so, I think the things that will move the needle in 2009 will be diesel fuel and liquid asphalt and electricity may have an impact although at lower production levels we hope income manage our demand charges efficiently to try to limit the rate of increase in electricity cost.", "Michael Betts - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "Donald James", "So those will be the major categories.", "Michael Betts - JPMorgan", "My second question to you Don, in the statement and you mentioned when you spoke, you were talking about the legacy businesses' shipments '05 to '08 were down about 30% that was legacy. Do you have any idea how much Florida Rock's volumes have declined during that period?", "Donald James", "I have for the period we've owned Florida Rock which would be basically full year '08 shipments and aggregates were down about 34%", "Michael Betts - JPMorgan", "Okay, thank for that.", "Donald James", "And the vast majority of that would be in Florida. Our other quarries in Georgia, Virginia and Maryland and Alabama that came with part of the Florida Rock acquisition, track of largely our performance in those markets from our legacy operations.", "Michael Betts - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you for that. My final question is probably for you Dan. How much of your debt is now floating rate based on LIBOR and I'm not going to follow-up question once I get that answer from you.", "Daniel Sansone", "I've got that here, just let me look at up Mike. We come out of this way about at this point in time, just under $1 billion of our debt would be floating rate and the remainder of it is going to be fixed rate. We have a total about $3.6 billion. Yes, it's around 60:40 at the moment. 60 fixed, 40 floating.", "Michael Betts - JPMorgan", "Right. I guess what I was coming to Dan is I'm a bit... I mean obviously you've got the debt that you've just fixed, which adds probably $30 million to the interest charge. But I would have thought on the floating there was quite a big benefit from the decline in LIBOR, U.S. LIBOR or LIBOR rates. Am I missing something that you have any hedges or anything else, or I might just wrong on that? Is it more a comparison in terms of yester rates declined for LIBOR in the last three months, but it's probably a function of what it did before that?", "Daniel Sansone", "Well, you're right. LIBOR rates have declined considerably and the recent transaction we did obviously moved $400 million out of floating rate short-term debt into fixed rate and long-term debt. That transaction was done principally to ensure adequate liquidity to meet the refunding, the repayment obligation as we have in 2009 without putting too much strain on our bank lines to give us adequate operating flexibility.", "Michael Betts - JPMorgan", "Okay. But there's no... on you're LIBOR floating debt, it just moves with LIBOR. There's no kind of a hedging that you've done at all on that?", "Daniel Sansone", "That's correct. Our LIBOR-based bank borrowing is just that, it's LIBOR plus a spread.", "Michael Betts - JPMorgan", "Right. That's great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Don James for closing remarks.", "Donald James", "Well thank you for being with us today. We appreciate your interest and your questions. I think, at this point I would urge you to not only pay attention to what's happening in the overall economy but also focus on what will happen in Washington with the stimulus plan and ultimately, pay attention to what happens with the Lake Belt ruling in Florida. Those are probably the things that will have the greatest impact on Vulcan's 2009. Although until we have better visibility in those factors, predicting what that impact will be or quantifying what that impact would be in quantifying the timing of that impact, remains a challenge for us. But those are all significant events for us.", "We look forward to talking with you again after the first quarter to be and hopefully will be able to give you some more information on each of those items at that point.

My name is Shamika and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.", "Don James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2009. As the announcer said, I am Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan, and we hope our remarks and dialog will be helpful to you today. A replay of this conference call will be available later today at our website.", "Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Mac Badgett; Ron McAbee; and Danny Shepherd, our Senior Vice Presidents who run our Construction Materials businesses.", "Before I begin, let me remind that you certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Description of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "Our first quarter was characterized by an extremely weak construction economy and extremely weak demand for construction materials. The current downturn in demand for aggregates began in the second quarter of 2006. We have since seen 12 consecutive quarters of lower shipments.", "As I have previously stated, we have reduced operating rates throughout the company to levels that match current demand. We have taken actions to reduce costs and improve productivity. We also have sharply reduced both production levels and inventory levels. Earnings from continuing operations were a loss of $0.29 per diluted share, including $0.58 per diluted share referable to lower aggregates volumes versus the prior year's first quarter.", "Cash earnings in the first quarter were $70 million versus $112 million in the prior year. EBITDA was $97 million versus $160 million last year. First quarter earnings in our aggregate segments were lower compared to last year. Aggregate shipments declined 30% versus the prior year's first quarter, reducing EBITDA approximately $84 million.", "In the first quarter, the average freight adjusted unit sales price for aggregates increased 2% from the prior year's first quarter, adding $7 million to EBITDA. We experienced wide variations in the level of price increases across our markets. Many markets realized price improvements from the prior year above the 2% average while markets in the far west reported year-over-year declines in their average selling price.", "Excluding these far western markets, aggregates pricing improved 4% from the prior year's first quarter. During the first quarter, our plant managers mitigated much of the cost pressures caused by significantly lower volumes. As a result of their actions, unit variable production costs were flat with the prior year and cash fixed costs decreased 21%. These cost control measures demonstrate the greater production flexibility of an aggregates plant versus continuous process manufacturing facilities used in many other industries.", "In the first quarter, the average unit cost for diesel fuel decreased 47% from the prior year, and increased operating earnings by approximately $13 million. In contrast to typical seasonal operating plans, we reduced production in inventory levels of aggregates during the first quarter of 2009. These decisions penalized first quarter earnings but improved cash generation and better positioned us for improving operating performance as we move forward in the latter parts of the year.", "Earnings from our asphalt and concrete segment were lower than the prior year's first quarter, reflecting improved asphalt earnings, offset by lower concrete earnings. We initiated pricing actions in the fourth quarter of last year to recover the rapid escalation in the cost of liquid asphalt and have offset the margin erosion we experienced last year in our asphalt product line.", "Asphalt volumes declined 27% from the prior year's first quarter, and asphalt mix prices increased 13% from the prior year. Asphalt material margins in the first quarter recovered to more normal levels, reflecting recent moderation in the cost of liquid asphalt. The average unit price we paid for liquid asphalt in the first quarter decreased 10% from the prior year's first quarter.", "Selling, administrative and general expenses in the first quarter of 2009 decreased $13 million from the prior year. Employment levels across the company are down 14% from the prior year, driving reductions in salaries, fringes and other employee-related expenses. Performance-based compensation accruals were lower versus the prior year. These cost reductions more than offset $3 million of project costs related to the replacement of legacy IT systems and their related consolidation of certain administrative support functions.", "In summary, I believe our management teams are running their businesses well in an extremely tough economic environment. As we look forward to the remainder of 2009, reduced levels of contract awards reported during the first quarter point toward lower residential construction activity, albeit from an already low base. Private, non-residential construction activity also has been declining, and is expected to weaken further throughout the rest of 2009.", "Through the first three months of 2009, highway awards were lower when compared to the prior year. However, early reports show that state and local departments of transportation are making good progress using stimulus dollars to make highway investments. In fact, most Vulcan-served states have obligated some portion of their highway stimulus funds in the past two months, and we expect bidding activity to increase both in the number of projects and the frequency of bid lettings during the next few years.", "Key Vulcan-served states such as California, Florida and Texas will receive the largest percentage of highway funding under the stimulus plan. These states are also likely targets for above-average funding for stimulus spending for other forms of infrastructure because of their high growth and large population base. Vulcan sales in these three states will benefit not only from our aggregates focused strategy, but from our complementary asphalt and concrete operations.", "We have identified three broad categories of infrastructure projects in the stimulus plan that will use our products. These categories account for $50 billion to $60 billion of construction spending and include transportation projects, which are the most aggregates intensive. Water and environmental infrastructure projects and buildings, which include those for schools, for the military and for medical and other facilities.", "Another feature of the economic stimulus plan is to provide much needed funding for state and local governments at lower borrowing costs through the implementation of the Build America Bonds program. The program is intended to provide a federal subsidy for a larger portion of the borrowing cost of state and local governments than traditional tax exempt bonds and will be attractive to a broader group of investors.", "Guidelines for this program were announced a month ago by the Treasury. Already, several state agencies, including those in California and Virginia, have issued Build America Bonds successfully. The sale of $5 billion in bonds in California is the largest so far and is allowing the state to restart more than 5,000 projects that have been on hold since December of 2008.", "Yesterday, Governor Schwarzenegger announced that California had already obligated $1 billion of stimulus funds for transportation projects for the State of California, and other states are moving very quickly in that regard. Overall, we expect full year aggregates shipments for Vulcan to decline 10% to 15% from 2008 levels, inclusive of shipments referable to the economic stimulus plan. Our volume outlook for the first year assumes lower aggregates demand versus 2008 levels in all major end markets.", "We have revised our expectation for aggregates demand from residential and private non-residential construction downward due to the additional weakness forecasted in the markets. We expect declines in aggregates demand from highways and infrastructure to be in the low-to-mid single digits versus the prior year, including some projected incremental demand starting in the second half of 2009 from the first of the economic stimulus projects underway are scheduled for bid during the next few months.", "We expect selling prices for aggregates to rise 4% to 6% in 2009 and to help offset the earnings effect of lower volumes. We expect earnings from our asphalt and concrete segment to increase in 2009, due primarily to a recovery in materials margins in our asphalt business where higher selling prices reflect the past year's increases in cost for key raw materials. Asphalt and concrete sales volumes in 2009 are expected to be slightly lower than 2008 levels.", "Segment earnings in cement will be lower in 2009 due to lower shipments. We now expect our average cost of diesel fuel for 2009 will be approximately $1.58 per gallon lower than the 2008 average unit cost. Our earnings sensitivity to changes in diesel fuel prices has diminished given the current weakness in demand. At the peak of demand, we purchased approximately 65 million gallons annually. In 2009, we expect to purchase about 45 million gallons. As a result, every $0.10 per gallon change in the price affects pretax earnings approximately 4.5 million at current demand levels.", "We expect full year [SAG] expense to be slightly lower in 2009 as increased cost related to the replacement of legacy IT systems are more than offset by the effects of cost reduction efforts. Total project costs will peak in 2009 as implementation begins in the fall. Full year IT project costs in 2009 should approximate $16 million.", "Interest expense in 2009 is expected to be about $175 million based on the current interest rate levels. Our plants and equipment are in very good condition. Reinvestment in these assets over the last few years has increased production capacity and efficiency and reduced the average age of our rolling stock. As a result, we expect capital spending to be approximately $200 million, down sharply from last year's levels.", "In early February, we improved our liquidity through the issuance of $400 million of long-term debt. Proceeds of this debt offering reduced short-term bank borrowings, thereby freeing up a like amount of liquidity under our lines of credit. In April, we utilized $250 million of the liquidity under our lines of credit to pay off $250 million of 10-year notes as scheduled. In the first quarter, we reduced debt by $33 million, and we expect to reduce total debt by $200 million during 2009.", "Another development that I want to discuss briefly is the status of the Lake Belt litigation in South Florida. On January the 30th, of this year, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida issued its second ruling, invalidating all of the permits approved in 2002 for limestone mining in the Lake Belt area of Miami-Dade, after its first ruling was reversed on appeal. The ruling pertains to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued permits to several companies including the permit issued to Vulcan's Miami quarry.", "The companies in the Lake Belt region affected in the ruling as well as the plaintiff have filed briefs with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument is currently being scheduled. The Lake Belt region historically has supplied as much as 50 million to 60 million tons of aggregates to Florida markets including Miami, Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa. The aggregates reserves in this region also serve as an important source of feed stock for those companies which have cement plants in Miami.", "As I mentioned, Vulcan has one quarry affected by the latest ruling. In 2008, Vulcan's Miami quarry sold approximately 1.5 million tons. At this point, none of the quarries in the Lake Belt are mining limestone, although most, if not all, are processing stockpiled feed stock. This past Friday, May the 1st, the Corps of Engineers issued its supplemental environmental impact statement, which is the first step in issuing revised permits for the Lake Belt mining. This process will continue to work its way out and is unlikely to be resolved until sometime next year.", "In closing, I would like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to establish an aggregates focused business that has the compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future.", "The current economy is weak, but the economic stimulus plan signed by the President in mid February should help offset some of the economic weakness beginning in the second half of 2009 and provide much needed support for creating jobs and getting our economy back on track. We are focused on the upcoming renewal of the six year Federal Highway Bill by Congress. The next highway bill will play an important role in creating jobs and addressing our aging infrastructure.", "We, along with many businesses and industry groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Trucking Association are urging Congress to act in a timely manner to sustain the momentum started by the economic stimulus plan and to fund the highway programs at levels recommended by the two Congressional Commissions which have studied the needs for our highway infrastructure.", "For Vulcan, a daily discipline with a long-term focus will lead us through these challenging economic times. Our organization is meeting the challenge and preserving the profitability of our business by staying focused on pricing our products to reflect their great value in the attractive markets we serve and by aggressively managing costs, we will continue to create value for our shareholders. We thank you for your interest in Vulcan.", "Now if our operator will give you the required instructions, we will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions ). You have a question from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "First question is on the pricing mix out west. Just wondering if you could quantify what percentage of your shipments were negatively impacted by the ballast in the [fill material] you were shipping.", "Don James", "It is probably in the neighborhood of 1 million tons.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Are these short-term contracts in nature that you expect to roll over here in the near-term? Or should we expect this negative mix to persist through the balance of the year?", "Don James", "No. The fill material was just a byproduct material that did not meet expectations for construction grade material. It does run through our plant, so we count it as production in sales, but we stockpile that material routinely and then when there is a project that can consume it, we will sell it for that project. So I don't imagine we will see the impact of the fill material in anything like the same degree that we saw in the first quarter. Railroad ballast sales will continue. That is a new product line for us in the west.", "We acquired a quarry outside of Sacramento that produces a substantial amount of railroad ballast. It was not in our portfolio in the last quarter. Railroad ballast has actually been one of our stronger product lines in the first quarter, and so that product requires less processing and is sold at, probably on average $3 to $4 a ton lower than material going into asphalt and concrete.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Just a couple more quick questions on stimulus. Obviously, you are hopeful that the second half of the year you are going to see an improvement in volumes. But is there a rule of thumb that you can point to as far as how quickly you can start shipping after a project has been obligated by the state?", "Don James", "It depends on the nature of the project. For resurfacing projects, it goes very quickly. Many of these, as you are aware, are resurfacing projects, so we would expect to see some volume. We don't have enough data to try to pinpoint whether it is going to hit in the third quarter or the fourth quarter of '09 or the first or second quarter of 2010. But these projects we believe will move faster than highway construction projects have historically. There aren't very many big earth moving projects in these stimulus package projects that take a long time to get done.", "There are lane additions and those will go relatively quickly. Bridges will be more slow to get started and in some states, there are a fair amount of bridges. But I think we are very encouraged by the speed at which the DoTs have already bid projects and have set projects up for bid in the next few months. It will certainly benefit us. The benefit clearly will arrive in 2010 and 2011. How much of it we see in the second half we're continuing to monitor, but we believe we'll see some.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research", "Lastly on the bids that you are seeing. We have been hearing about some of the bids coming in below engineer's estimates. Can you talk about what you are seeing on the aggregates pricing side on stimulus projects coming down the pike?", "Don James", "I think aggregate pricing on stimulus projects will be consistent with aggregate pricing on every other type of project. It won't be a increase or decrease in the price of our materials because it is a stimulus project as opposed to any other type of project. There is just not any basis for that. I think some bids coming in at below engineering estimates for construction are probably much more related to the drop in liquid asphalt prices, the drop in diesel fuel prices, the drop in steel prices, which very substantially affect the engineering estimates and a lot of the engineering estimates were put together in a time period in which the price of those products were much higher than they are today. So I would expect that to be the basis of bids coming in below engineering estimates and not related to aggregate pricing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of KeyBanc.", "Jason Brown - KeyBanc", "This is Jason Brown actually on for Chris. Just a follow-up on the underlying price decline in your western markets. Net of the mix shift, I think you said prices were lower. Just wondering if this was just a function of a fragmented market where pricing got more competitive, or if there was something else more at work there. And secondly, realizing that your pricing is not directly related in different regions. Is there anything that gives you confidence that this won't occur in other regions?", "Don James", "Well, I think the pricing, particularly in California, is interesting. We started, as you probably know, with among the highest prices we enjoy in the country in California, and we've had among the highest rate of increase of pricing in California over the year since we have been there. Really since 2000 we have had very strong price growth in California to the point that as I have said, almost our highest-priced markets in the country were in California.", "California started down on the private construction side early in the process. So there has been more stress on volumes in California than perhaps in other states, at least early on. I think when the California infrastructure program started back in 2008 awarding bids, you saw a lot of people hungry for work, and you saw very aggressive bidding. I believe we will see as the stimulus projects get bid and as other public infrastructure work and the big California infrastructure program that is separate from the stimulus begin to roll forward, we will see a slightly better pricing environment.", "I think across the rest of the country, certainly private construction remains weak in almost all of the markets. So do have that pressure. I think the stimulus package and the upcoming highway bill will provide stability across virtually all markets in the U.S.", "Jason Brown - KeyBanc", "On the mix shift for the back half of the year, obviously your projects will be leaning toward public works projects, and I think you've said before that those are actually, on average, higher priced products. I was just wondering if I had that right.", "Don James", "Yes, that's correct. When you produce material for federal highway projects, it tends to have much tighter specifications. It is more costly to produce and it has higher pricing. So I think generally our pricing guidance of 4% to 6% for the full year anticipates a mix shift to some extent to more highway projects versus private construction.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "As far as your guidance outlined today, how much of that includes stimulus. I just want to make sure your previous guidance in your previous quarter did not include stimulus.", "Don James", "Yes, our previous guidance, Kathryn, did not include stimulus. Our current guidance attempts to include stimulus. It's the timing whether those projects ship in 2009 or 2010 is still very difficult to predict, but we have attempted to add a modest amount to our 2009 guidance to reflect some of the stimulus projects. Hopefully it will move faster, but at this point, we have included it, but at a very modest level.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "Would it be a reasonable assumption of saying excluding stimulus, all things equal, that volumes will be down, say, 15% to 20%? Is that another way to looking on an apples-apples basis?", "Don James", "The amount that we have included in stimulus, we really only increased our highway projection or the aggregates going into highways by about 1% for the stimulus. We have increased on some other like water and sewer projects, which are really relatively small volumes, a few percentage points. So I don't think there is that big of -- you have said from 10% to 15% to 15% to 20%. We don't think it's that big a impact from stimulus in our guidance.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "Given the aggressive bidding on stimulus work, particularly in certain states, how much leverage do you have in pricing, and how do you manage that amount?", "Don James", "I mean a stimulus project is no different than any of our other projects. We look at where the project is located, who the potential customers we have who are viable bidders for that project, and we work with them to try to come up with a price that allows them to get the work and gives us a fair return on our materials. That's a case-by-case, project-by-project process, and it really depends on a number of factors that are project specific. As we've said before, we don't set a price in the corporate office because if we do, we can't possibly have the local market knowledge that is necessary to be successful in pricing. So the stimulus projects are not dealt any differently than our regular highway work.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "That makes perfect sense. Right now I mean from the bidding does (inaudible ) it sounds like what you are saying.", "Don James", "I am sorry, I missed your last question, Kathryn.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "You really haven't seen any impact from bidding activity yet at any meaningful level?", "Don James", "There is no shipment impact from stimulus projects in the first quarter. They will not likely be any shipment impact from stimulus projects in the second quarter. As we have said earlier, we expect to see some in the second half. The amount of that is really difficult to predict at this point until we see when our customers can get mobilized and get underway. That is not to say, however, that there is that there have been a lot of stimulus projects already bid by the state DoTs and by local DoTs.", "In fact, as I mentioned, the State of California has already bid $1 billion in stimulus projects. So that is moving very quickly. In terms of the DoTs getting the projects out for bids, getting the money obligated. So we are happy with that. There is zero impact in the first quarter in terms of shipments, and I will be surprised if there is any impact in the second quarter from stimulus. It is in the pipeline, and it will be there, and it is going to sustain demand, certainly through 2010, 2011, probably into 2012.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "Well, maybe we will take a break from the stimulus questions. Just general, could you give additional color on regional pricing trends, and then also, are there any meaningful changes in your non-res and residential housing outlook for 2009?", "Don James", "I'll address the first part of that first. We track contract awards. Companies publish contract awards for various categories of private non-res work in our markets, and we also track housing starts in our markets. As we look at those two factors plus our own information that we get from our teams in the field, this is not going to be a great year for any private construction activity. The one exception to that being, as we said in our press release, I think on the Gulf Coast, there is a fair amount of heavy industrial construction that we are supplying, and that has remained good. In fact, the Gulf Coast is the one market where we are up in volume year-over-year. So we are pleased with that. The first part of your question, Kathryn, could you repeat that for me?", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "Any additional color on regional pricing differences.", "Don James", "Yes, okay. As we've said, excluding the far west, which is essentially California and Arizona, we got about 4% price increase and again, that was in a very tough market in the worst quarter of the year. We believe, that pricing will certainly be positive and we will get real price growth throughout the whole country for the full year. The issues in the west, I tried to respond to earlier really have to do with the length of time. That the private construction economy in California have been extremely weak, and as you know, there's been a lot in the paper about the California state budgets.", "There are still a lot of things in the paper, so there has been a great deal more uncertainty in the state of California than in the rest of the country, and I think we have seen that in pricing for products there. Hopefully when the California construction economy begins to stabilize, we will see pricing opportunities that look more like the rest of the country right now. But outside of the far west, virtually all of our major markets had price increases in the first quarter.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "For your Florida market and given the Lake Belt situation, is it safe to assume that pricing in that market may be slightly above the overall corporate average?", "Don James", "Well, I think it certainly has the opportunity for that to happen. We got price increases in Florida in the first quarter as we did in all of our other markets other than the far west. I think today, those companies producing material in the Lake Belt, as I have said in our remarks, cannot mine. Most companies, including Vulcan, have stockpiled material that we are processing, but that can be measured in months, and I don't think anybody believes that this whole issue, either with the Corps of Engineers or the Federal Courts is going to be resolved anytime soon. So I think you are absolutely correct that the environment for material availability in Florida and therefore pricing has some upside potential.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group", "Final question. Do you have any indications to buy or sell any assets within Vulcan?", "Don James", "If there is a strategically located bolt-on quarry that we think is important for the long-term reserves and market presence, we certainly will be interested in continuing to make those kind of acquisitions. We constantly prune our portfolio of businesses, and if we are in markets where it is very difficult to get above cost of capital returns on our investment, our business model says we will exit those markets and we continually look for those opportunities. So I don't think, Kathryn, either of those strategies have changed or will change in this climate. We aren't putting up large blocks of assets for sale for any reason.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephans, Incorporated.", "Trey Grooms - Stephans, Inc.", "A couple of questions. Give us an update on kind of where the specific mix for your end market stands right now. So, kind of how much is currently coming from residential, commercial, et cetera. If there has been any change from what you have said in the past, Also on that, you mentioned that you expect infrastructure down kind of low-to-mid single digits, if I heard you correctly. Could you give us a little more specific kind of expectations for what is baked into your guidance for the other end markets?", "Don James", "Sure. Our end market mix has no mystery to this. Certainly housing is down into the low teens, maybe even lower than that today. The part that will be growing as an end market will be public infrastructure generally, including specifically highways, but also other publicly funded infrastructure private non-res, the stores piece, retail, is weak and falling. Office buildings are weak and falling.", "Industrial plants are holding up, institutional buildings are holding up. So private non-res as a percent of our total historically has run 27% or 28%. I expect it will drop down into the mid-20s. We will see public infrastructure spending again go back over 50% of our total end market mix. I mentioned earlier railroad ballast is really one of our stronger end markets now. Railroads continue to need ballast, and we are well positioned in a number places to provide that.", "So that segment as a percent of total may grow slightly, but the big growth will be in public infrastructure, particularly highways, and I see us moving back towards the plus 50% range there with housing probably getting at some point to half of the norm. That is 10% of our total volume versus 20% and then private non-res moving down a couple of percentage points.", "Trey Grooms - Stephans, Inc.", "Could you just give us an idea of your expectations for -- I know you say they're coming down, but you said for infrastructure coming down low-to-single digits. What is your expectation specifically for some of these other end markets other than just -- I know you are expecting them to come down, but I mean for like commercial, do you think it will be down 20%, 30% this year? Or could you quantify?", "Don James", "Sure. We think highways and infrastructure will be down about 4% year-over-year in terms of aggregate volume going into it, and that can move around a lot depending on whether these stimulus projects go fast or slow. That's our current estimate. Residential we see down about 34% year-over-year. Office buildings and stores, 28%, 29% year-over-year decline. Manufacturing down much less than that, probably about 5%. Institutional buildings down about 10% or 11% and government buildings flat to down slightly. So the big drops are obviously residential and office buildings and stores. The strength being in highways, infrastructure and government buildings.", "Trey Grooms - Stephans, Inc.", "You have mentioned in the press release and then also on the call that energy projects, rather, as well as some big industrial projects helped the Gulf market. How long are those projects expected to last?", "Don James", "Some of them will continue throughout 2009. Maybe beyond that. Whether there will be in this market new projects coming down the pipeline of the same magnitude is doubtful. But we are certainly enjoying them now. I think what we see going forward, the automobile plant in Chattanooga, the Volkswagen plant is moving forward. The ThyssenKrupp steel plant in Mobile is moving forward. The big intermodal rail yard south of Chicago I think is moving forward.", "So there are significant projects around. I think one of the things that is most encouraging to me, and I have had conversations with people in the ocean shipping industry, is that while we won't see it in '09 or '10 probably, for the longer term, there are going to be some very large port projects in the U.S. Gulf and South Atlantic coast. As the Panama canal project gets underway and the additional capacity necessary to accommodate the larger ships and increased number of ships that will be diverted from the West Coast to the Gulf Coast and Atlantic.", "So that demand sector, I think has got a lot of upside to it. You are not going to see that, the impact for at least a couple of years. Hopefully, that will kick in as some of these other large projects begin to wind down.", "Trey Grooms - Stephans, Inc.", "My last question is, I am sure it is tough to quantify this, but the carryover from kind of mid 2008 price increases into what we saw in the first quarter, is there any way to kind of think about how much those price increases benefited the quarter, the price increase announced in the quarter?", "Don James", "I can tell you that some of the price increase in the quarter came from '08 price increases. Probably relatively little because of the relatively low volumes in the first quarter. You just don't see the impact of it. The mix in the first quarter isn't our sweet spot, because not many people are putting down asphalt in the first quarter in many markets. The price increases that are in the pipeline will, I believe, be more visible as we move forward in the second and the third quarter than they were in the first. That didn't answer your question, but you knew when you asked it, I couldn't answer it the way you asked it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Betts of JPMorgan.", "Mike Betts - JPMorgan", "I've got I think three, maybe four questions, but three major ones. The first one is kind of a bit of a technical one, that the average freight adjusted aggregates price seems to be restated for Q1 '08 down from $10.19 to $10.04. Could Dan or somebody maybe explain why that restatements were posted?", "Don James", "So you have a technical question, I have to refer it to Dan Sansone.", "Dan Sansone", "Which gives me the distinct honor of admitting that there was an error, in the calculation in the first quarter of last year in adjusting out those freight numbers, so, we just corrected it. What you have in this report is, in fact, the proper number for both quarters.", "Mike Betts - JPMorgan", "Okay. Apologies for asking that question.", "Don James", "Only would you find that one, Mike.", "Mike Betts - JPMorgan", "Well, I am sure you find plenty of errors in my reports. So, please, I am not encouraging you to look. Second question, you have lowered the pricing guidance, Don, for the year by a couple of percentage points. Was that just the factors that went on out west in Q1 with more ballast and also the weaker pricing there? Or actually, have you struggled in some of the areas that you, maybe when gave the initial guidance were more optimistic on pricing?", "Don James", "I think our pricing guidance was heavily influenced by what we saw in the far west. Certainly, our volume guidance into the private sector, both residential and private non-res is weaker or our outlook is weaker today than it was at the end of the year, based on contract awards that are from published data. While we wish we were immune to competitive pressures, we clearly are not. We have competition in every market for every job and with weaker demand that does affect the pricing. So our guidance is adjusted on the basis of pricing in California, number one and weaker private sector demand in the rest of the country. The reported average price could be impacted by the amount of stimulus projects that actually get shipped because as we say while we wouldn't increase price because of the stimulus projects, they will improve our mix into higher priced products because they would go into federal highway construction and airports.", "Mike Betts - JPMorgan", "My third question. You gave in your presentation some cost savings in terms of lower numbers of employees, et cetera. Is that just a carry over from what you did last year? Or given the volume declines that you've just mentioned, have you implemented any significant further rationalization or cost saving measures this quarter?", "Don James", "Yes. We have continued to rationalize our operating hours and our production. We actually shipped more in the first quarter than we produced which helped us reduce our inventory levels. As you know from the way accounting works, we make more money when we are producing material, but we made the conscious decision to cut back production so that we could manage our inventories. Hopefully, as we move into the second and third quarters, we can bring people back to work or run our plants longer hours. We did reduce our employee headcount some in the first quarter over just the sequential quarter of last quarter 2008. That is not something we like to do or feel good about. We think in this economy, it has been necessary to do, and we certainly want to bring people back to work as soon as we can.", "Operator", "You have a question from the line of Timna Tanners of UBS.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "Just a couple of question I think left. Wondering if you could maybe Dan can give us an update when we might see another impairment test at Florida Rock. Is there anything coming up on that?", "Dan Sansone", "Well the accounting rules, require a test annually. We have historically performed that test in the fourth quarter. We do not believe that there has been a triggering event of sufficient magnitude to indicate an interim formal testing. So as of right now, absent any further developments, we would go through the rigorous test in the fourth quarter.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "What would be a triggering event, just for my edification?", "Don James", "Somewhat loosely defined, but it is some event that would be significant enough on the performance of the business to cause you to suspect that there might be an issue. I am making these things up here, for example, if the stimulus program was not in place and there was further indications of a collapse in volume maybe that could be a triggering event. We don't see anything that would have an adverse affect on the business beyond what has already been incorporated into our fourth quarter 2008 goodwill impairment testing assumptions.", "So kind of a moving target, we built in kind of a current view of the world in our fourth quarter assumptions. If you think about goodwill impairment testing, in this industry in particular, you are doing discounted cash flow projections over an extended period of time. Whatever modest modifications we've made in our volume and pricing guidance for 2009 is immaterial to the valuation of this business over a 20-plus year time frame.", "Timna Tanners - UBS", "The other thing I wanted to do was follow-up on some comments that Don made in the introduction about [Stacy Lou] and the reauthorization of the successor to that. PCI recently anticipated that there would be a year lag before it gets reauthorized. Can you comment on that? Do you think that is true? What are you doing, and what is the mood right now in Washington regarding impetus to passing that in a more timely manner?", "Don James", "I don't have a prediction as to when it is likely to pass. I think history says it is unlikely to be passed at its due date, which would be October 1 of 2009. I think the places to look, I guess the budget resolution has highway funding continuing in FY '10 at the same level it was in FY '09, which is about $43 billion. If you look at that over a six-year basis that is a 13% increase over the last six-year highway bill. That is sort of the low point, we think in the process, and that budget resolution I think is at $325 billion, which would be the six-year look.", "The heads of the authorizing committees, that is, transportation and infrastructure in the House and the parallel committee in the Senate have both been talking about a $500 billion program, which would be extraordinarily robust. The issue, of course, is how to fund it. The two commissions that Congress authorized to go study, both the infrastructure needs of the U.S., the surface transportation infrastructure needs and the funding sources have both come back with recommendations to Congress, and they both include increase in the fuel tax.", "I think it is it particularly encouraging that the general business community as represented by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, by the National Association of Manufacturers and particularly by the American Trucking Association are all saying fund highways at the level being recommended by these commissions, because it will increase economic efficiency. It will increase fuel efficiency, and ultimately, it will reduce emissions if we have trucks and cars moving through metropolitan areas at some steady rate of speed as opposed to the stop and go congestion we have today.", "In addition to recommending fuel taxes, which perhaps the American Trucking Association represents the largest single group of consumers of motor fuel, they are saying raise the tax, commit it to congestion relief. The commissions also recommend increased use of tolling, congestion pricing for tolling, which is now feasible from an IT standpoint, and the continuing work to facilitate public/private partnerships or private money going into the highways. We are seeing all of that working.", "Chairman Oberstar has specifically said he wants to cut through a lot of the bureaucracy in Washington and streamline the flow of funds and cut the total number of accounts from some huge number down to about four in order to not only speed the process for highway construction. So that we can move the dollars through more quickly and efficiently, but also increase the amount of funding in the near-term. So there is a lot working there. I can't tell you when and how it is going to work out.", "Certainly the Obama administration needs to be heavily involved in the process. I think there is a case to be made from the environmental standpoint that higher fuel taxes will facilitate the shift to more fuel efficient cars. So there is a lot of public policy benefit to what is going on in the highway funding area in addition to just building more infrastructure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Kasprzak of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Adam Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "This is Adam Thalhimer calling in for Jack. Most of my questions have been answered. I have just one left. I wonder if you comment just broadly on the commercial downturn. I know in the past, non-res cycles have tended to last for two to three years. I am wondering, is there a chance that this time around the commercial market comes back a little faster if the credit markets soften up?", "Don James", "Well, I think certainly all private non-res construction is being impacted greatly by the credit issue. That's the single biggest factor in my view. There is weakness in retail and there is weakness in business travel because of the overall economy, but there are a lot of projects that are ready to go if the credit markets return anywhere near normal. So I think that is the single issue with respect to private non-res construction, is the credit markets. I can't tell you how many developers that I have heard from, that say, I can't get my project financed in this market and as soon as I can, it will go. That seems to be pervasive all across the country right now.", "Housing, on the other hand, credit, while it requires larger down payments, mortgage rates are at very attractive levels. So the housing side is a function of not so much the credit markets as it is the uncertainty about what is happening to housing prices. Housing starts are down at 500,000 to 550,000 starts when most economists are saying the level to sustain the housing stock in the U.S. and meet the demand from household formations is more like 1.5 million. So we are running at plus or minus a third of what is necessary to sustain the housing stock. That maybe the place we see recovery surprising people at some point in the future.", "I am not predicting when that is going to be. We are saying, I think, that the public infrastructure is going to be the key demand sector for us. Another factor in the store side that I think is important is that a lot of the big box retailers and those that are relatively prosperous in this economy like Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is going to build its own building. It doesn't matter that there may be five big box stores available for lease in a marketplace. If Wal-Mart wants to put a building in, they are going to build their new building.", "There are other big box retailers that have the same business model. That is their store and the layout of the store is part of their brand, and so those buildings are going to continue to get built notwithstanding some vacancy rates in particular markets. I think that's a relatively interesting phenomenon from that standpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of DA Davidson.", "Brent Thielman - DA Davidson", "Don, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expected asphalt and concrete sales to be down in 2009, but I guess I am wondering, would you expect at least in terms of tonnage in the asphalt mix business in the second half, to begin to grow just given some of the, I guess more of the resurfacing work coming in?", "Don James", "The second half asphalt tonnage will be significantly influenced by the timing of the stimulus projects on the one hand, and a large part of our asphalt business is in California. The resumption by the state of California of a lot of the California infrastructure program projects, which are separate from the stimulus projects, should benefit asphalt shipments in California as those projects resume. They were largely stopped throughout the first quarter.", "While we improved our material margins in California, our shipments were down significantly year-over-year. Texas and California are our larger asphalt markets, particularly California, so I would think we have an opportunity to see perhaps more improvement in asphalt shipments than we have baked into our outlook. That's going to depend on when these projects actually start shipping, both the stimulus projects as well as the California infrastructure projects.", "Brent Thielman - DA Davidson", "On the price, the asphalt mixed price in the first quarter, I think it did come down sequentially. I am just wondering, is that seasonal? Do you typically see a ramp-up in its pricing?", "Don James", "Asphalt mix prices went up in the first quarter.", "Dan Sansone", "He said sequentially.", "Brent Thielman - DA Davidson", "From the fourth quarter, I'm sorry.", "Don James", "As you know, liquid asphalt spiked in mid-year '08, and our margins eroded as we were shipping material with higher liquid asphalt costing, and faster than we could get our pricing up. Certainly, we have moved pricing to offset the higher cost of the liquid asphalt, and our margins have returned to more normalized levels. We expect that to hold going into the second quarter of 2009. At some point, if liquid asphalt prices remain low, which we hope they will, that that will be reflected in the absolute price of asphalt mix. Hopefully, we can hold our margins.", "Brent Thielman - DA Davidson", "Just lastly, have you had any disruptions in your quarry in the Yucatan just subsequent to the end of the quarter?", "Don James", "No, we haven't. We have got 350 employees in that operation, including 50 teachers at our school there, and we have not had a single case of flu. We did have a two-day production interruption in response to President Calderon's order that all production facilities shut down for the five-day period over the past weekend. So we did lose two days of production, but we have already got that scheduled to make up on weekends as we go forward, but so far, [knock on wood], our employees have not been affected at all by the Swine Flu.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aynsley Lammin of Citigroup.", "Aynsley Lammin - Citigroup", "First, just two quick questions. Firstly on the dividends. Just wondering if you could give a bit more on your thinking behind that and should we take kind of dividend being held for the first quarter is a good indication that will be the same for the full year. Obviously, it is not in the statement, but just wondered if you will give any more kind of any guidance on the EPS for the full year based on your current assumptions on volumes and prices?", "Don James", "With respect to the dividend, that is something that our Board will look at the upcoming Board meeting. It is certainly an issue that we take seriously, and there are competing considerations. I will not prejudge how our Board views. They do feel very strongly that we need to return cash to shareholders, and they have been very supportive of the dividend historically, but that's an issue that we will take up quarter-by-quarter.", "With respect to EPS guidance, we have not given EPS guidance for the year or for the second quarter. I think in this economy and with the uncertainty in the private sector construction and the uncertainty of the timing of when stimulus projects are going to go, we have elected to let you guys decide how much we will make this year instead of trying to give you guidance on it.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Don James.", "Don James", "Well, thank you very much. This was a very tough quarter for us. I think our management teams are doing all the right things. This is about volume. If we get a recovery in volume, we believe we are very well-positioned to benefit strongly from that. Our view is that volume recovery will come from public sector infrastructure funding first, and that the private sector will come along later. We are managing our business to survive this downturn, to position ourselves for the long-term, which has been Vulcan's strategy for about the last 50 years, and it is not changing. Thank you very much for your interest, and we look forward to talking with you in three months.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

My name is Eric, and I'll be your audio coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn your presentation over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed.", "Donald James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference to discuss Vulcan's first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ron McAbee and Danny Shepherd, our two Senior Vice Presidents in our Construction Materials Group.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "To start our conference call, I will make some brief comments related to the general economy and the effects of the economy on our business prospects, as well as our first quarter results and outlook. And then, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Economic measures that broadly track U.S. economy indicate that economy is stabilizing and beginning to grow. GDP and industrial production had been improving since the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, every Vulcan-served state but one reported growth in gross state product in the third quarter of 2009, a marked improvement from the first quarter of 2009 when each of these states reported declines from the previous quarter. In the most recent data for the fourth quarter of 2009, every Vulcan-served state reported growth in gross state product. Virginia and California, both important states for Vulcan, reported some of the largest percentage improvements in gross state product. ", "In past economic cycles, demand for aggregates has improved as GDP has grown during the initial years of economic recovery. As a result of these historical trends and current measures showing economic improvement, our confidence is growing that many of our markets have stabilized, and that aggregate shipments will improve for the remainder of 2010. Having said this, our first quarter results masked this economic improvement because of the extremely wet weather and record snowfall in January and February across many of our markets. ", "Overall, first quarter aggregate shipments declined 14% from the prior year. However, the monthly trends within the quarter were quite different. In January and February, construction activity and demand for our products were slowed by extremely cold and wet weather and record snowfall. In those two months, shipments of aggregates declined 25% as compared to the first two months of 2009. 11 of the 23 major metropolitan areas served by Vulcan experienced at least twice the number of wet weather days compared to a year ago. The most notable effects were in Charlotte, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Orlando, Houston and San Antonio. However, measuring less weather days alone does not fully capture the effects of the record cold and snowfall experienced in several key markets. Accumulation of snow can have a lingering effect on construction activity, if temperatures remain cold delaying the return of dry conditions.", "In March, we experienced more normal weather patterns and demand for our products recovered. Aggregate shipments in March increased 4% compared to March of last year, the first year-over-year monthly increase we have seen in four years. This pattern continued in April, as total aggregate shipments were 9% higher than the prior year's level, reflecting increased shipments in most markets. ", "The average unit sales price for aggregates increased 1% in the first quarter, reflecting wide variations across Vulcan-served markets. Segment earnings in asphalt were lower than the prior year due mostly to lower selling prices, and a 27% increase in the unit cost for liquid asphalt. Last year's first quarter average unit cost of liquid asphalt was a cyclical low point following the sharp spike up in the fall of 2008 driven by higher energy prices. Our selling prices for asphalt mix were 10% lower than the prior year. Selling prices for asphalt mix generally lag, increasing liquid asphalt costs and further were held in check due to competitive pressures. Segment earnings in concrete declined due to lower selling prices and lower volumes. Cement earnings were higher than the prior year's first quarter due to lower production costs and a 4% increase in sales volumes. ", "Our employees have effectively managed the business during this downturn to maximize cash flows. These efforts have not only included minimizing costs, but have also included aggressive management of working capital. ", "Total inventory of aggregates at the end of the first quarter was reduced $32 million, or 9% below the prior year's levels. While this action negatively affected GAAP earnings and margins because of the reduced production levels, it increased cash generation and better positions us to benefit from increased production and earnings as demand increases.", "My opening remarks included some comments about the macroeconomic indicators that point toward general improvement in the economy, and more importantly, in the states where we operate. Now turning to our outlook, I want to build on that general trend of economic improvement by reviewing contract award data, a leading indicator of demand for our products. ", "Contract awards for highway construction have been strongest among the four major end markets. In the three months ending March 31, 2010, contract awards for highways in Vulcan-served states were up 37% from the prior year. The momentum of stimulus-related funding for highways help support this sharp growth in contract awards for highways in our states. We expect that momentum to continue through the remainder of 2010 and all of 2011.", "As of the end of March 2010, the Federal Highway Administration reported that approximately 74% of the total stimulus funds obligated for highways remains unspent. Regular federal funding for highways and contract authorities was restored through the HIRE Act signed into law in March. This law extends authorized funding for Federal Highway programs through the end of 2010 to an annualized level consistent with fiscal year 2009. The combination of stimulus funding and authorized highway funding puts funds available for key highway projects around the country at record levels, and helps set the stage for a healthy baseline of ongoing highway funding when the highway bill is ultimately reauthorized.", "The large backlog of highway constructions that is building whether measured broadly by total contract awards for highways or more narrowly by the percent of stimulus-related work yet to be completed, bodes well for aggregates demand from highways in 2010 and 2011. Contract awards for residential construction have also increased sharply in recent months, albeit from a low base. ", "In the three months ending March 31, 2010, contract awards for single-family housing increased 41% from the prior year. In Florida and California, where residential construction experienced some of the steepest declines, single-family starts were up 65% and 35%, respectively in the three months ending March 31. ", "For non-residential buildings, we expect construction activity to remain weak in 2010. U.S. contract awards for stores and office buildings declined 62% and 63%, respectively in 2009. While public buildings declined more modestly only 16%, reflecting some impact from stimulus funding.", "In the three months ending March 31, 2010, the rate of decline in contract awards slowed. This end market remains weak, however, and will continue to be a drag on the full year aggregate shipments. Due mostly to the level of contract awards for highway construction in our states, we expect aggregate shipments in the remaining three quarters of 2010 to be 4% to 10% higher than the prior year. Overall, Vulcan's total aggregate shipments are expected to be flat to up 5% from 2009 levels. ", "Our 2010 outlook for aggregate shipments reflects a 10% to 15% increase in aggregate shipments going into highway and other infrastructure-related construction activity, due primarily to stimulus-related funding. We expect aggregate shipments in the residential construction to increase 10% to 15% from 2009 levels.", "For the full year of 2010, we now expect aggregate pricing to be flat to up 2%, reflecting pressure on pricing in certain markets. Higher aggregate volumes in pricing in 2010 should offset the earnings impact of a projected increase in cost for diesel fuel. In 2009, our average cost for diesel fuel were $1.94 per gallon. For the full year, we now expect the unit cost for diesel fuel to increase approximately 36%. In 2010, we expect to consume approximately 40 million gallons of diesel fuel. At this level of consumption, a $0.10 per gallon change in the average cost of diesel fuel impacts operating earnings by about $4 million per year. ", "In our Asphalt business, we expect sales volumes in the remaining nine months of 2010 to increase from the prior year, offsetting the 9% decline reported in the first quarter. As a result, full year asphalt volumes in 2010 are expected to be flat with the prior year. Pricing for asphalt mix is expected to be flat compared with 2009 levels, while unit costs for liquid asphalt are projected to continue to increase from current levels. As a result, we expect lower material margins for the full year in asphalt when compared with the prior year. ", "In concrete, we expect sales volume to remain flat with the prior year and pricing to decline modestly, reflecting continued weakness in private non-residential construction. In our Cement business, we expect earnings to improve modestly from the prior year on slightly higher shipments. We expect full year SAG expenses in 2010 to be slightly lower than 2009, due to continuing cost reduction efforts, as well as lower cost related to the replacement of our legacy IT systems.", "Cash interest expense for the full year is expected to be approximately $175 million based on current level of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest on capital projects. We will continue to tightly manage capital spending and as a result, expect to spend approximately $125 million in 2010, up slightly from the 2010 we spent in 2009 and down sharply from the $353 million in 2008.", "Finally, I'd like to provide an update regarding permitting activity in the Lake Belt in Florida. In late January, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued its record of decision in support of mining in the Lake Belt region. Simultaneously, the Corps of Engineers began moving ahead with issuing new permits. Vulcan received its new permit in March of this year. Our permit is for a period of 20 years. It covers 940 acres, and allows us to mine in excess of 80 million tons of limestone.", "In closing, I would like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our aggregates-focused business, which has a compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future. ", "Our available production capacity and ongoing efforts to improve cash margins position Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in the $50 billion to $60 billion in stimulus-related construction, including significant remaining portions of the $27.5 billion for highways and bridges. ", "We are the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well-positioned for significant participation in the economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. We thank you for your interest in Vulcan. ", "Now the operator will give us the required instruction, and we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Can you please talk about the variance in volume?", "Donald James", "I'm sorry, Jerry. Could you repeat that?", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Can you please talk about the variance in the volume recovery that you saw in April, which regions are you seeing shipment increases stronger than average, which regions are weaker?", "Donald James", "Jerry, it's across the board. We're seeing it in virtually every market. California is probably behind the rest of the country in terms of improving volumes, but pricing in California improved in the quarter. But it's pretty widespread, and I think it's just an indicator of -- principally, highway contract awards and principally the stimulus work.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And can you please talk about the Virginia quarries that you sold in the quarter? Do you see other opportunities to call your footprint, or was this just a particularly attractive price that you received and are you looking for any opportunities to redeploy that capital?", "Donald James", "Jerry, we constantly look at our portfolio of businesses to identify those where we think we have less opportunity for growth. These three quarries were identified about two years ago, and we've gone through a long process and finally closed the transaction in the first quarter. We did receive an attractive price. We took the immediate proceeds and reduced debt, but that strengthens our balance sheet. And certainly, we continue to look for other acquisition opportunities both reserves, greenfields and existing quarries in markets where we have, believe we have a bigger upside. We do have a few other quarries around the country that are not in areas that would exhibit better-than-average growth, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to withdraw capital from those assets and redeploy it in areas where we think we have greater opportunities for growth.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And lastly, you were kind enough to provide a pricing update for your Asphalt businesses. I'm wondering if you can talk about your customers' pricing outlook in areas where you're not vertically integrated, are they able to pick up pricing as these new contract awards come in?", "Donald James", "As you know, partner with our construction customers to work together to achieve DOT contracts. And certainly, there's pressure on both construction contracts, which backs up into asphalt mixed prices. I think the wildcard is the timing of liquid asphalt costs compared it to the ability to pass those through. In the first quarter of 2009, we had a period of declining liquid asphalt costs, but contract pricing that reflected much higher cost. So we were in a sweet spot on the asphalt margin. We're not in such a sweet spot now because we've got business contracted at basically fixed rates, and we're receiving rising liquid asphalt costs. That will flip, it's just a matter of time. But we're in a probably a trough in terms of asphalt margins compared to being at a relatively high peak in the quarter a year ago.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms. [Stephens Inc.]", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Don, well, I guess first off, on the price guidance, the source of the reduction there, did mix play a role in that at all? Or is this -- I mean, true pricing pressure that you're seeing? I know you mentioned that in certain markets, but I'm just trying to get a feel if product or geographic mix played any role in that at all?", "Donald James", "I don't think that at this point, we can point to any product or geographic mix with respect to our pricing outlook for 2010. After the fact, we can tell you that, but at this point, we're going to get price increases wherever we can, in some places we have to respond to competitive pressures to keep our customers competitive and that's a moving target, and it continues to ebb and flow from day to day. But we're reasonably optimistic that we can continue to gain price, but at a very modest level through 2010, but it is very market specific.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. And you talked about your expectations for increases in highway and residential and kind of quantify those. Could you give us kind of what your thought is on the non-res piece? I mean, in the press release you said you expected continued weakness there, but at least, unless I missed it, it didn't get as much color on the specifics there.", "Donald James", "Trey, we think our shipments into non-res construction in 2010 will be down 15% to 20% compared to a year ago.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay, all right. And then my last question is on margins. In the quarter, obviously, the lower volume in the quarter and diesel, et cetera, played a role, but you guys have talked about incremental margins in aggregates many times in the past and now that it looks like volume is starting to improve, kind of given where costs are currently and diesel, et cetera. Could you give us an update kind of where you see those incremental margins currently since we are starting to see these volume start to move in the right direction finally?", "Donald James", "Trey, we think that the 60% margin is a good number in quarters in which we are both producing and shipping at comparable levels. I think one of the really important things for analysts to understand about Q1 is that we cut way back on production in Q1, partly because weather made production terribly difficult and expensive. But secondly, we made a conscious decision to reduce production and ship out of inventories and if you file accounting, that hurts GAAP earnings. But it certainly positions us as we move forward to get the benefit of the GAAP earnings benefit of increased production, along with increased shipments. So if you look at our inventory numbers, particularly in aggregates, you see we have reduced our inventory of aggregates. We will get to replace that by production in the second quarter, in the third quarter, which will greatly improve our earnings. So shipping out of inventory hurts GAAP earnings, but as you produce and ship at comparable rates, it really does improve earnings. So hopefully, you all understand that, but that's a real factor in the quarter as we pulled inventories down.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners. [UBS Investment Bank]", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "You were kind enough to give us the trends so far in volume in April which is really helpful, but can you talk to us about kind of the trends you're seeing, maybe in prices?", "Donald James", "I don't have any good data on prices in the second quarter. I don't see any reason it is any change from what we were seeing in the first quarter. But certainly, volumes have picked up. And as you know, we normally don't talk about shipments in the quarter, but we thought the change between January and February on one hand, and March and April on the other were significant enough and that we felt like it was important to indicate that and fairly others are doing the same thing.", "Daniel Sansone", "And, Timna, this is Dan. I do have the pricing for the month of March, and the increase in the month of March was essentially comparable to the increase for the first quarter. I do not have anything for April in front of me right now.", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then within that pricing you talked in the past a little bit about whether it was mom and pops that are providing that competitive pressure you referred to or whether or not it's more of the established players. Can you give us a little color on characterizing where that competitive pressure might be coming from?", "Donald James", "It depends on what market, but there's competition everywhere and it's coming from both mom and pops and larger, publicly traded companies. So there's not a particular point or price competition that's different from the general competitive landscape.", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then just wanted to take a step back and ask you about with your high-level conversations regarding the gas tax and what your government contracts are saying there, and as we look forward to kind of the end of the year, and next year's federal government spending outlook?", "Donald James", "We clearly prefer a multi-year highway bill funded by gasoline tax. As you know, there have been, I guess, now three supplemental appropriations in the Highway Trust Fund to offset the effects of declining fuel consumption. Economic recovery will help with the volume, but still we think there's got to be an additional revenue stream to get the Highway Trust Fund at a level that is most observers think is necessary just to maintain the conditions of the U.S. highway infrastructure. I don't envision there being any movement in Congress until perhaps the lame duck session after the November elections to address a funding source for the next multi-year highway bill. There has been some discussion, I think it's -- maybe off the table now about a carbon tax, which would be collected as a motor fuel tax, but I think that's all dead at this point. So anyway, the discussion continues. We don't see a near-term resolution. And again, we will continue to work hard with our industry associations to try to make the case after the elections that -- by that time, hopefully, the economy will continue to be improving, unemployment rates will be falling and maybe there'll be a case at that point to fund the highway program.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Garik Schmois with Longbow Research.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "First question is on pricing. I was wondering if you could dig in a little bit more on what regions you're seeing some of this price competition? In the past, it seemed like it was confined to Florida and California. Are you seeing, I guess, an expansion in where your pricing is under pressure?", "Donald James", "Well, the California prices are actually up for the second quarter in a row, so that has stabilized. Florida remains, has a fair amount of price pressure. And between those two, most markets, there's a significant variation, but I think the Florida market is probably the one that has the greatest amount of price pressure at the current time.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And I was wondering if you could talk about aggregates of volumes as you look out for the rest of the year? You've provided the up 4% to 10% guidance for the next three quarters, but certainly pointed out some pretty attractive macro data points with highway contract awards being up significantly, and we also track railcar shipments on a weekly basis. Do you think -- I understand that visibility might not be quite there yet but, is there a potential upside, perhaps, to your volume guidance at this point?", "Donald James", "Well, we hope so, but I can't change my internal guidance at this point. But we think, for example, if you're tracking railcar shipments, much of the material that moves by rail goes into our distribution yards, and then it's sold off those yards to our customers. So there is a lead time or lag time, depending on which way you look at it, between the time a railcar is loaded and the shipment is reported by the railroads and when it shows up into aggregate sales for us. So that is a great leading indicator, but you know it's not an overnight conversion from railcar shipment into aggregate sales. But within a quarter, it ought to show up. So you have to look at the timing of those rail shipments compared to when the quarter ends and when the sales are actually reported. And another factor, of course, will be the regular federal highway program got reinstated in March, and there was no benefit of that in the first quarter in terms of new contract awards because there was no time. Hopefully, in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2010, we'll see the benefit of the re-establishment, if you will, of the regular federal highway program at a $42 billion annual funding level and that will be on top of the stimulus. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, for the next couple of years at least, we're going to see record highway funding in the United States. The downside, of course, is in non-res construction where we're seeing significant continued difficulty, and housing winds up sharply as coming off very low base. So the real story here is highway funding on the upside versus non-res on the downside.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Sure. And I guess my last question is on asphalt, with your volume guidance of flat for the year. Just trying to reconcile that with your aggregate shipment forecast being up. I guess what's the disconnect between the asphalt volume guidance and aggregates?", "Donald James", "Well, in asphalt, really in any significant way and only three states for a total of four, California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. As we said, volume in California is lagging the rest of the country aggregate volume. So there's not a, I think you can, there's not a correlation between our asphalt shipments and our aggregate shipments because of the diversity of geography, plus we supply a lot of asphalt producers as customers and in different parts of the country. So those aren't tightly correlated.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Just a follow-up question in California. Spending has lagged to the rest of the country. Are you seeing, as we move through March and April, and weather seems to have improved, are you seeing any realization of volumes from pent-up demand?", "Donald James", "Well, certainly, we felt that March had some impact of pent-up demand from January and February. One reason we gave you our shipments for April was because we thought that while it probably had some pent-up demand from January and February as well, it nevertheless was more indicative of some recovery in volumes for two months in a row. Again, some of that is going to come from volume that was not able to be shipped earlier in the year. But we do see improving shipment opportunities, primarily in publicly funded highways and other infrastructure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "When we look at the, I guess 75% odd of the stimulus highway left or about $20 billion, and then the $30 billion on non-highway, what's your best guess on 2010 versus 2011 in terms of how much we get done in 2010, of each of those numbers and then how much spills over into '11 or beyond?", "Donald James", "Our estimate overall is that probably 45% to 65% of the total will be spent by the end of 2010. That includes the 20% or so that was spent in '09, and then probably a third of the total will be spent in '11, and then a little bit of the tail of it will go over into '12. What is significant though, and these numbers are available and you should get them, is it's a very different story when you look at individual states. For example, California has spent less than 15% of its money. Florida has spent less than 15% of its money. Georgia spent less than 12% of its money. Virginia, less than 8%. So there are several large states for us, Louisiana, less than 9%. So there are several large states for us where, has a lot more spending of stimulus money for highways still available than in the overall country. On the flip side, if you look at states like Illinois, it's well ahead of the game and about 46% has been spent. Tennessee, which is another key state for us about 43% has been spent. North Carolina, about 27% has been spent. So it's a very different scenario across individual states. And so as we look at our states, we're really in better shape going forward because there's been a much lower percent on average in our key states than in the overall U.S.", "John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes, Arizona and Virginia, I think we're in last place, DOT needs to go but anyway...", "Donald James", "Well, it's spent. We're frustrated as you are about Virginia, but the money is there and it'll get spent.", "John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Is there a way to relate that $50-odd billion to sort of less the spend to an aggregate shipment number in tons, Don?", "Donald James", "We have done estimates. It's easier to estimate on the highway piece and on the other infrastructure piece, which are water and sewer projects, and there's less data available and there's less aggregate intensity on many of those projects than on highway projects. The good news about the highway projects and the stimulus is because of the time frame in which contracts had to be awarded and projects completed. It's very aggregate intensive and we've given some metrics on that in the past. I don't have them in front of me, but it is relatively more aggregate intensive than general highway dollars because less of this money is going to write away acquisition and earth moving and much more to resurfacing and lane additions. We have given that data, and I just don't have it in front of me.", "John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then just quickly, I know it's way out, but do you have any insights into '11 for non-res volumes?", "Donald James", "We don't. We watch contract awards and that will drive our analysis of '11. And obviously, for '11 to be a recovery year, we'll have to see non-res contract awards pickup in 2010. We're not seeing that yet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "I just want to circle back on some of your commentary on the margin weakness. It appears that the higher diesel and also the inventory had an overall -- the greatest impact on margins. Of those two, how much did the higher diesel impact impact the quarter and what are you doing to offset those in Q2 and beyond? And what was the relative impact of your inventory reduction that you discussed earlier on margins?", "Donald James", "Diesel cost us about $6 million pretax, incremental cost in the quarter. The inventory drawdown probably cost us $14 million in the quarter, which will recapture when we produce that material in the second quarter.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "On the same lines with inventory management, all the way down here, a little steeper decline for inventory as 10% to 9% that you commented on the prepared comments based on the release you had today. But you basically you've had, at least according to our calculations, two consecutive quarters where you've had double digit year-over-year declines in inventory. What are your targets for inventories for fiscal '10, and how should we think about this as the year progresses?", "Donald James", "In our view from our operating standpoint, the fourth quarter and the first quarter are the toughest quarters to produce material because of weather. So that's the most efficient time to cut back production and ship out of inventories. So that's what we've done. Q2, Q3, we typically have better weather, better conditions. We're more efficient. So we have shipped out of inventory for two reasons. One is because of production efficiency, and the other is to conserve cash and not have cash tied up in piles of inventory. Now that we expect shipments to improve for the remainder of the year, we can then run our plants at efficient levels in decent weather. So this is what we have been planning for over the last six months. And fortunately, we're well positioned now to get the benefit of improving GAAP earnings and margins from both increased shipments, but also higher production levels.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "So do you have an internal target for a dollar level of inventories you'd like to be at the end of the fiscal year?", "Donald James", "It really is a function of sales, projections, size and by market and I don't think we have a -- we don't put a dollar figure on that. That's really a plant-by-plant sales and marketing, operating decision.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Generally, what I'm trying to get an understanding of is just given your stated volume guidance for the year, how much more are you looking to draw down inventories further, assuming that your current volume guidance is...", "Donald James", "We don't expect to draw inventories down. We expect to resume production. And if anything, inventory levels will go up, both from a seasonal standpoint and from a cyclical standpoint. So we'll see the benefit in our GAAP earnings and margins of higher production levels.", "Daniel Sansone", "Kathryn, throughout the downturn, we've tried sequentially through the quarter as the best as we could to match our production levels with our demand levels. And obviously, you're not going to match them perfectly in a given quarter. But if you look at that data over a four to eight quarter period of time, the guys have done a great job of doing just that. They try to match what they produce to what they're selling. And if you look at the days sales of inventory we have on the ground today, it's a little bit higher than where it was a year ago based on the current run rate of sales activity. So it's another metric that just support Don's comments, that the inventory levels themselves are really not a problem for us, they're in pretty darn good shape. And as the demand profile recovers, we have a lot of flexibility to again match our production levels to our future demand levels.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "I just wanted to clarify that inventory draw down costs that we experienced in Q1 won't necessarily be carried through in the remainder of the year. Moving on over to your pricing, we're in the field getting some good feedback over with pricing guidance, particularly over the past 30 to 45 days. But still we want to get a little bit of hand holding on why the difference in pricing for the full year and what's really driving that, particularly if you believe that they're potentially getting upside of volumes and assuming once again that pricing generally follows volume trends.", "Donald James", "Well, we got about 1% price improvement in the first quarter. That was lower than our full year guidance, so we've got to make up some sales price through the year where we have the opportunity. I don't think you should, within the range of our ability to predict selling prices for the full year at the end of the first quarter, don't put too much significance on what we're projecting as average selling price. That can change a lot depending upon product and geographies and volumes and changes in demand. So we're not trying to signal anything about pricing changes in the year in our guidance, other than our best guess is how it's going to come out. And that's a roll off of a lot of different projections around the country.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "And finally, I know that you talked about this a little bit earlier. Given -- obviously, the you've lease starts adaptations for Q1 volumes, but you left your full year unchanged. Any other additional clarity? And particularly, if there would be any upside to volumes, what areas would it be? I know you said that the downside would be in your non-res commercial. But between residential and your public, which should be the greater pool in your opinion for potential upside with regards [ph] for the year?", "Donald James", "I think there are probably two places where there may be upside. One, is we're seeing robust increase in housing starts albeit from low levels. A lot of those houses are being built on already developed lots. If the homebuilders start developing new lots in advance of construction, projections at the latter part of 2010 and '11, we've been very conservative in projecting volume going into housing because of this developed lot phenomenon. But there is an upside, if housing continues to strengthen, particularly in our markets and there's new infrastructure development around lots, I believe that's an upside. The second upside is how quickly the state DOTs get the $42 billion that was reinstated in mid-March in the regular Federal Highway Program out to bid in construction. And if that moves faster than we have projected, then it could show up in 2010 volumes. Certainly, it will show up in 2011 volume, probably carrying over well into '12 given the normal spinned-out level of the regular Federal Highway Program. But I think one telling anecdotal piece that was on the front page of Birmingham News about a week ago, which is consistent with everything we tell our friends in Congress, the Alabama DOT announced that it was moving forward with the contract award for the interchange of new Interstate I22, otherwise called Corridor X, that connects Birmingham and Memphis with I65, which connects Birmingham and Nashville. And the Director of the state DOT said with this month-to-month funding extension from Congress, we couldn't award the contract for that interchange. Now that the $42 billion has been reinstated, we're going to award the contract to build the interchange. And it's tens of millions of dollars of construction. And that's one small example of what we hope we will see with the reauthorization, at least through the end of 2010 on the Federal Highway bill. And as projects like that get bid and let and constructions starts, then there's an upside we think to volume in 2010.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Just wrapping up with your Lake Belt, is there anything we should think about with the Lake Belt that would impact the pricing situation in Florida? Or any other thing we should take in consideration surrounding Lake Belt?", "Donald James", "I think virtually everybody in the Lake Belt is now back into production. But so much of that material moves relatively long distance by rail up the east coast of Florida and up the rail to Central Florida. I don't expect that to really have a tremendous impact on pricing in Florida. The issue in Florida right now is demand.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital Markets.", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "I want to make sure I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks, where I thought I heard you say, that the increase in diesel fuel you guys expect for the year will basically be offset by the price increase that you think you'll get for the year, i.e the tool that will offset, it's a push. Is that what you were saying?", "Donald James", "Yes.", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "So any profit improvement that you might get in 2010 versus 2009 would be due to volume?", "Donald James", "Yes. And general production efficiency outside of diesel fuel. The more we produce, the more efficient we get.", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Right. Moving up the curve to that 50% incremental.", "Donald James", "Right.", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Your comment to ready mix concrete, where I think you said that for the year, you expect modest decline, it was down 12% in the first quarter. I think you just said demand in Florida was weak, seems particularly weak there across your various markets. Why a little more optimistic view of ready mix given that it's down double digits and that's mostly in Florida and that's among your weakest, if not weakest market?", "Donald James", "Actually, our Concrete volume in Florida was stronger than it was in the rest of the country. We had a relatively less of a decline in Florida Concrete as we had in our other markets. So Concrete in Florida is not particularly weak. It's weak compared to historical, but relative to other markets in the country, it's not. I think the -- Florida was also, had terrible weather in January and February and that certainly didn't help Concrete sales. So I wouldn't look at the Concrete volume in the first quarter as indicative of the market for the full year, I would certainly factor in the terrible weather. And as we indicated, we have a large Concrete business up in Washington DC and Baltimore and Virginia. And it's really our largest market and that market was hammered with snow. So trying to pour concrete even after days and days and days after those big snows was impossible. So I think Concrete is not as bad as first quarter volumes would indicate.", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Also too on pricing for the year, where you think you were just referencing that your trying your best guess but we'll get later in the year and have a little more certainty, which makes some sense. But given that most of the volumes seems to be coming from infrastructure work right now, highway work, which is generally contracted ahead of time. Wouldn't you have more certainty as to your pricing for this year given the mix versus an average year?", "Donald James", "Yes, I think that is a correct statement. A lot of the projects have been bid. We have contracts for a lot of the projects, but there's still a fair amount in front of us. And so we're trying not to be too aggressive on our pricing outlook, but again, this is -- I hate to keep saying this,, but it's job by job, market by market, day by day. What we report to you at the end of a quarter is a roll off of thousands of pricing decisions. And we're just giving you our best guess at this point about what full year price is going to look like. So again, I wouldn't put great significance at the end of the first quarter on what we're saying or not saying or changes we've made in full year pricing metrics.", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "How much of the competition that's evident in the pricing environment is due to the inventory and balances that seem to exist for a lot of producers?", "Donald James", "I don't have a feel for that. We have worked very hard not to have inventory imbalances, as you know. So from our standpoint, we got rid of our surplus material several quarters back in most markets. So we're really not out of balance. We actually had almost no change in off-the-books inventory in the quarter. So most of the -- as you say, most of the demand is for material going into highway projects, and that's not surplus in most markets.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D. A. Davidson.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Just with respect to your Concrete, do you think you can recover for the full year just from that pretty significant first quarter loss?", "Donald James", "In terms of volume, we certainly hope to improve the volume over the first quarter number. If you're talking about earnings, we're not projecting Concrete earnings to be up for the year.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "And then, I guess, just with respect to Concrete pricing, and you mentioned obviously some modest declines there. Are you starting to see some improvement in pricing in the backlog for that business?", "Donald James", "It's a challenge at this point. So I think the answer is no, we are not seeing pricing improve in the backlog. Although there are price increase announcements by some companies out in various markets. A little visibility of improving demand will help. But at this point, I wouldn't anticipate price improvement in Concrete for the full year.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Just with respect to Asphalt and without having much historical context, what sort of a normalized level of profitability for that business on sort of an annualized basis?", "Donald James", "It's a function of liquid asphalt prices, volume and the timing of our ability to get higher liquid asphalt cost into our contracted selling price for the mix. I don't have -- we can certainly go back and look at what that business has generated historically over a business cycle. I don't have a number I can give you today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Avondale.", "Ted Grace - Avondale Partners LLC", "First question I was hoping to run by you, you've given a lot of great color in kind of how to think about pricing geographically. But from a product standpoint, just wondering if you could speak to mix shift in the quarter on the aggregate side, a crushed rock, gravel and sand perspective. What that mix would be in the first quarter of '10 versus '09? And then, how to think about pricing year-over-year change by product category?", "Donald James", "I don't have any data. The first quarter shipments are so low and so affected by weather that I don't believe you should draw conclusion of mix shift in the first quarter. As we look forward, the stronger demand is going to come from, over asphalt overlays in stimulus projects, which is a higher spec, tougher to make, generally more expensive product. And will use less base material, which tends to be a lower-priced product.", "Daniel Sansone", "Ted, this is Dan. If you look at the first quarter data, I do have some breakdowns on broad product categories and our year-over-year change in the price for base material was essentially the same as the year-over-year change in the price that we got for our clean stone sizes, for asphalt and concrete. The absolute dollar levels are quite different as Don just pointed out. But in trying to dissect the 1% increase for the quarter, there was no difference in the behavior of those two broad categories. It was really some of the more specialty sizes like rip rap and some of our signs [ph] and screenings that were a little bit weaker than the main stream counter contour products.", "Ted Grace - Avondale Partners LLC", "So just to clarify that Don made, if the mix shift is going to increasingly consist of cleaner stone used in asphalt work, then presumably that's offsetting drag on other mixed shift, presumably geographic, right? Because we're getting more clean stone that comes with a higher price point. So when you blend that in, there's got to be an offset that will only get you to up one.", "Donald James", "And the offset is the rock that goes into relatively high specification concrete in private non-res, because we're not -- that's a really weak market. We're not pouring high-rise condos or building baseball stadiums right now because that sector is just so weak. So that's a high-spec, half-priced material that we're not able to have a great deal of volume in.", "Ted Grace - Avondale Partners LLC", "On the margin side, certainly appreciate the incremental color on the under absorption that we saw in 1Q. Just wondering if you can give us a sense as to how the quarter progressed. You spoke to how January and February, obviously, we're challenged both from a demand standpoint and a production standpoint by weather. But did you see the gross margins within Aggregates improve, January to February to March and then April? So that as you've  seen volumes pick up as you talked about, the margin pull-through is hitting the bottom line. I think in scale, certainly, and looking at the numbers myself, 80% decrementals were well below what I'd thought you'd put up. And talking with people, I think, people may have been mis-calibrated on that under absorption. So to understand how you're progressing would be helpful.", "Donald James", "My colleagues are feverishly looking through their reports. I have an answer, but I'm going to let them make sure I'm right before I give it to you. While they're looking, do you have any other questions? And Ted, in the interest of everybody's time, I'll come back and pick this up and give it to you.", "Daniel Sansone", "There was a substantial increase in the unit margin of Aggregates in the month of March as compared to the number for the full quarter average. The month of March, these are measured in dollars per ton but in the month of March, the margin per ton was about 2.5x to 3x greater than what the average was for the entire quarter. So yes, it did rebound in March. I don't have April data in front of me yet.", "Donald James", "My answer which is based on just reality, is that given the fact that volumes recovered in March, our margins just follow volume. So that's not any mystery.", "Ted Grace - Avondale Partners LLC", "So the implication there is that April should progress sequentially?", "Donald James", "Yes, absolutely.", "Ted Grace - Avondale Partners LLC", "Could you just walk us through the math on estimating stimulus spending for 2010 and 2011. How you arrived at 25% to 45% in total spending in '10 and then 33% for '11?", "Donald James", "I think the -- it's 20% in '10, a total of 45% to 65% through the end of -- I mean, 20% in '09, about 40% plus or minus in '10. And we did that based on a role off of the kinds of projects, in which state and when contracts were let. There is not a simple way to do that. It's just a roll off of all the stimulus projects and the nature of the projects and when it was let. I don't know whether there's a macro, whether there was any trade associations have done similar studies or not would be available. But we think it's proving to be relatively accurate, and so we haven't changed our estimate of the timing of the spending of the stimulus on the highway part.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo.", "Adam Rudiger - Wachovia Capital Markets", "On gross margin, if the expansion you talked about from shipping from production in the next couple of quarters rather from inventory. Is that enough in the Aggregate business to offset weakness in some of the downstream operations, so that the year-over-year margin in kind of like consolidated basis could be higher?", "Donald James", "Certainly, we hope so.", "Daniel Sansone", "I think that's correct. I don't expect a dramatic change in the margin through the year of the other products. So if we get margin recovery in Aggregates, that should pull it through to the total company. That's correct. That's right.", "Adam Rudiger - Wachovia Capital Markets", "So there's that much power you think in the Aggregates volume increase. Let's say, you hit the 10% top end of the range, you think that's enough to really drive margins higher year-over-year despite all the weakness in the other segments?", "Donald James", "Absolutely. There's so much leverage in that Aggregate volume, it can move the needle substantially.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of form Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Market.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "What percent of your shipments go via rail, go via both barge or via truck? Do you have a rough break out on an annual basis of that?", "Donald James", "Historically, and I don't think this year will be any different. About 85% of our shipments go by truck; about 7.5% go by rail; and another 7%, 7.5%, 8% go by either ship or barge. So it's about 85%, truck; 7% to 8%, rail; 7% to 8%, ship or barge.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "I think a lot of what you're bringing via barge comes out of CALICA, out of Mexico?", "Donald James", "No, that comes by ship.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Any potential -- I know there's a little oil spill, we understand down there in the Gulf. I'm wondering if there's any potential for impact or how you think about that? What you might have embedded into your volume numbers if there's any disruption you'd anticipate?", "Donald James", "The only place right now that there's any concern about taking our ships into would be Gulfport, Mississippi, New Orleans and Mobile. We have diverted our ships to other markets to avoid going through the oil slick because we can't then go into the harbors without having our ship washed down, and with an 800-foot ship, that's a pretty sizable project. We can serve each of those markets adequately by barge or by rail or by boat. So we don't envision any real impact on our ability to ship into those markets. So that's one of the advantages of having multiple means of supplying material into those coastal markets. It does give us a lot of flexibility.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "And then with respect to the Virginia quarries that you guys had sold, if I pulled the number right from the cash flow statement, it's about $51 million of proceeds. Were those mostly leased or were those owned facilities? Or can you give us a little more color there?", "Donald James", "Your number is too high because also in that is a fair market value of donated real estate. It's the 5CP, it's the earn-out from the sale of our Chemicals business. What was your second question, Chris?", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Could you tell us what the -- I guess where I'm going with this is, approximately what were the reserves that were there that you sold? I was going to assume a $1 a ton if you owned it and $0.35 to $0.45, if it were leased. So maybe some little color, so we understand...", "Donald James", "I don't have the reserve data in front of me. The issue in those markets was a change in the long-term economic outlook. Those markets were textile and furniture manufacturing and those have gone away forever. And if you don't have a whole lot of population and job growth in Aggregates business, you don't have much opportunity to grow volume. So that's the reason they were identified as being non-strategic.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "I just wanted to get a sense of what kind of going transaction price, has there been a change?", "Donald James", "On an EBITDA multiple basis, depending on what time period you look, it was within the high single digit, low double-digit kind of range. Our view is on an EBITDA basis, a quarry and the growth market, ought to trade at a higher EBITDA multiple in quarry and a low growth or declining growth market. So if you're trying to calibrate what an aggregate plant in a declining market ought to be, high single digit, low double digit, if you're looking at faster growing markets, it will all be higher than that, which is what you see in the trading multiple of most of the public companies.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "That will be based off of -- probably not off last year's levels but off the normalized kind of levels, I would assume.", "Donald James", "Yes.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Just to follow up, I think it was on Ted's question earlier question about how stimulus comes on, and I guess where I want to go with it is kind of as it rolls off. 20% in 2009, 40-ish percent 2010. So roughly flat then in 2011 as the balance rolls out. As you move out to 2012, and I think about, at least this public side, potentially falling off. How do you replace those tons? Or how do you feel about highway spending being able to offset -- or increased highway spending to be able to maintain that level, I guess, as you go forward from there and that there isn't a drop off?", "Donald James", "Well, you have to go back and look at the -- highway spending is a roll off of the regular Federal program, the regular state and local programs plus the stimulus spending. So from September through March, we virtually had almost no regular Federal program. We had a tremendously reduced program in terms of dollars, but the real impact was the DOT sitting on their hands because they didn't have any visibility of funding out of a regular program. So 2010 and '11, when you add up the stimulus spending and the formal extension of the regular Federal Highway Program will be record years in terms of the Federal contribution to spending. We're seeing that in contract awards. What we expect, what will have to happen at the end of 2010 will be some reauthorization of the regular Federal Highway Program, one way or the other. Either through additional appropriations out of the general fund or some other funding mechanism. And as you say, there will be about a third of the stimulus dollars in 2011, with a little bit in 2012. As we look forward, if the numbers that are being talked about from the need side for the Federal Highway Program kicked in, it will be large enough to offset the expiration of the stimulus spending. We're also cautiously optimistic that at some point, banks will actually start lending to real estate developers and we'll see private non-res construction coming out of the trough maybe by 2011, certainly by 2012. So that's how we're sort of seeing the longer-term demand trends. We're not concerned that the world is going to come to an end when the stimulus dollars are finally spent because it's going to be 2012 before we see that drop off. And by that time, hopefully we'll have a regular Federal Highway Program, as well as a recovery in the private sector.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "As I look back at kind of the last peak in the cycle, say, 2005, 2006, when you did a neighborhood of 240 million, 245 million tons and even layering on Florida rocks, volumes on top of that, I don't think will be inclusive of that. What's the path, I guess, over the next two, three, four years, five years to get -- where you think your volumes can get to again, on a normalized basis. Is that something back to that 40-ish range?", "Donald James", "Our pro forma volumes were about 293 million tons in 2005. That was coming from a normal Federal Highway Program, it was coming from an overheated housing market that was generating over 2 million starts. We won't get back, we shouldn't get back to 2 million starts. And it was from a reasonably normalized private non-res level. So as we go forward, we think longer term, housing will not get back to the '05 levels. But Federal highway spending ought to be better than '05 levels, if we get a multiyear program as the kind of numbers all the people say we need. And we can certainly get back, we believe longer term to the level of private non-res spending that we saw in the '04, '05, '06 timeframe. So the down would be from the peak would be housing, the up from the peak would be public infrastructure and highways, and that would include recovery in private non-res. So that's how we sort of see the future. The other side of it is the supply of aggregates in most markets is very hard to expand beyond the levels that people were producing in 2005 simply because everybody was pretty much running at capacity, and there have been not any real capacity expansion. In fact, I expect we'll see more reserve depletion as we move forward. So that's in a very general sense how we see the future, Chris.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Davenport & Company.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "On your comments about the impact of diesel and the inventory draw down, that $40 million inventory draw down, I guess, that was year-over-year the impact...", "Donald James", "That was the absorption effect on the P&L, that was not the dollar value of the draw down.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "Was that primarily or entirely in the Aggregate segment?", "Donald James", "Yes.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "And then on the diesel impact, what fraction of that was in the Aggregates business versus other business?

My name is Eric. I'll be your audio coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn your presentation over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed.", "Donald James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining the conference call to discuss our second quarter results and our outlook for the second half of 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "Our second quarter volume growth is encouraging as we look ahead to the second half of 2010 and continuing recovery in demand. The upward trend in aggregate shipments that started in March and continued through the second quarter led to the first year-over-year quarterly increase in shipments in four years. Improvement in the overall economy as well as higher level for contract awards for highway construction and for single-family housing starts provided the catalyst for growth and demand for our products in the second quarter.", "The earnings effect of higher volumes in each major product line was more than offset by the settlement of the lawsuit in Illinois, the flooding in Nashville as well as higher energy-related costs and lower pricing. In May, we reached the final settlement in a lawsuit filed in 2001 against Vulcan by the Illinois Department of Transportation. As a result, a $41 million charge was recorded in the second quarter. The suit alleged damage to a 0.9-mile section of the road that bisects our large quarry in McCook, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. ", "Excluding this charge and related legal expenses in the second quarter, EBITDA in the second quarter was approximately $138 million versus $168 million in the prior year's quarter. Second quarter segment earnings in aggregates were $122 million compared to $127 million in the prior year. The earnings effects from higher aggregates shipments was more than offset by the effects of a 2% decline in aggregate pricing, a 38% increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel and charges associated with record rainfall and flooding in the Nashville area. Over a three-day period in early May, more than 12 inches of rainfall was recorded, most of that total occurring in the first 12-hour period. Aggregate pricing continues to reflect wide variations across Vulcan-served markets.", "Some major markets realized price improvement from the prior year's second quarter. Other markets, such as Florida and, to some extent, the Far West, have remained challenging due to reduced demand as well as continued competitive pressures. In a number of long-haul markets served by rail, barge and ship, increased transportation costs due to higher energy costs resulted in lower freight-adjusted selling prices, as these costs were not recovered in second quarter selling prices to customers. ", "Aggregate shipments increased 6% from the prior year's second quarter, due primarily to stronger demand from public highway projects and improvement in single-family housing starts. Many Vulcan-served markets realized solid increase in shipments versus the prior year's second quarter. In markets where increased competitive pressures have persisted due to weak demand, such as Florida and, to some extent, the Far West, and in long-haul markets, where competitive pressures have inhibited our ability to recover recent increases in transportation costs due to higher fuel prices, aggregate net sales approximated the prior year's second quarter, while gross profit declined. As a result, the earnings leverage to higher volumes was not realized in these markets. However, in all other Vulcan-served markets representing about 73% of our aggregates volume in the quarter, the higher sales volume resulted in incremental margins of 65% on the incremental sales dollars.", "Across most markets, key operating measurements of labor productivity improved from the prior year. In the Nashville, Tennessee area, severe flooding in May closed several of our quarrying operations, reducing Aggregate segment earnings by $3 million. We expect to recover a portion of this from our insurance carriers. ", "The average unit cost for diesel fuel increased 38% in the quarter, reducing pretax earnings $8 million. Excluding the impact of higher fuel costs, unit variable production costs for Aggregates declined slightly from the prior year, demonstrating the continued focus of our employees in running our plants efficiently. ", "Segment earnings in asphalt were $14 million lower than the prior year, due mostly to lower selling prices and a 26% increase in the unit cost for liquid asphalt. The year-over-year increase in liquid asphalt cost reduced asphalt earnings $9 million. Asphalt volumes increased 2% from the prior-year second quarter. ", "Our selling prices for asphalt mix were 5% lower than the prior year. Selling prices for asphalt mix generally lagged increasing asphalt costs and further were held in check due to competitive pressures. ", "Segment earnings in concrete declined $3 million from the prior year due to an 11% decline in selling prices. Cement earnings in the second quarter declined $1 million from the prior year as lower average unit selling prices offset higher sales volumes.", "Our forecast for aggregates demand in the second half of 2010 continues to reflect an increase in public construction, driven by stimulus-related funding, as well as the formal extension of the Federal Highway bill, which occurred in March of 2010, along with an increase in residential construction, albeit from low levels. Single-family housing starts in the second quarter increased 6% from the prior year in Vulcan-served states. This year-over-year increase follows a 41% increase in Vulcan-served states in the second quarter. As a result, most key states for Vulcan now reflect positive growth in trailing 12-month single-family housing starts.", "In private, non-residential construction, the rate of decline in contract awards has slowed in recent months. The start of a recovery in this end market will be influenced by employment growth, business investment and lending activity. The flow of contract awards for highway construction, a leading indicator of future construction activity, has been improving since March of 2009, when stimulus-related funds became available to each state. ", "In March of this year, the stimulus-driven improvement in contract awards for highways was accentuated with the passage of the HIRE Act. This legislation formally extended the regular federal highway funding through the end of 2010 and transferred $19.5 billion into the Highway Trust Fund, a balance sufficient, along with projected tax receipts into the trust fund, to maintain current levels of federal funding of $41 billion for highways through 2012, according to Congressional Budget Office projections. As a result, monthly contract awards for highways in the U.S. have remained at high levels, greater than $5 billion per month since January. ", "Through the first six months of 2010, contract awards have increased 6% from the prior year. This increase follows last year's first half increase of 7%. In Vulcan-served states, that increase has been more dramatic. During the first six months of 2010, total contract awards for highway construction in Vulcan-served states, including awards for our federal, state and local projects, increased 11% from the prior year. Through 2010, the Federal Highway Administration reported that only 38% of the $27 billion of total stimulus funds obligated for highways has been spent, which bode well for increased construction activity from federal stimulus spending for the remainder of 2010 and throughout 2011. ", "Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Fiscal Year 2011 Transportation Housing Appropriations Bill. The House bill provides $45 billion in federal funding for highways, a 10% increase from the FY 2010 level. The Senate will consider its version of the FY '11 appropriations bill after the August recess. This continuation of stimulus-related highway construction activity as well as the prospect for regular federal highway funding through 2012 from a solvent Highway Trust Fund provides the cornerstone of our demand outlook. ", "In the second half of 2010, we expect aggregate volumes to be flat to up 5% from the prior year's second half levels on a same-store basis. Overall, pricing for aggregates remains solid, despite the year-over-year decline reported in the second quarter. A number of Vulcan-served markets are still realizing year-over-year price growth, while other markets where pricing has been under competitive pressures or affected by recent increases in transportation costs remain challenging. As a result, we expect aggregate pricing in the second half of 2010 to approximate the prior year. ", "Our 2010 outlook for aggregate shipments reflects a 10% to 15% increase in aggregate shipments going into highway and other infrastructure-related construction activity, due primarily to stimulus-related funding. We expect aggregate shipments into residential construction to increase 10% to 15% from 2009 levels and private, non-residential shipments to decrease 15% to 20%.", "In the second half of 2010, we expect the average unit cost for diesel fuel to increase slightly from actual year-to-date unit costs. In 2010, we expect to consume approximately 40 million gallons of diesel fuel. At this level of diesel fuel consumption, a $0.10 per gallon change in the average cost of diesel fuel impacts operating earnings by $4 million per year.", "In our Asphalt business, we expect sales volumes and segment earnings in the second half of 2010 to approximate the prior year. In Concrete, we expect sales volumes in the second half of 2010 to increase from the prior year and pricing to decline, reflecting continued weakness in private, non-residential construction and competitive pressures. In our Cement business, we expect second half earnings to be a slight loss versus the break-even results recorded in the prior year. ", "We expect SAG expense in the second half of 2010 to be flat with the prior year due to continuing cost-reduction efforts as well as lower costs related to the replacement of legacy IT systems. Interest expense for full year 2010 is expected to be approximately $175 million, based on the current level of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest capital projects.", "After the close of the quarter in early July, we raised $450 million through a syndicated bank term loan at attractive interest rates of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. Proceeds of this transaction were used to further improve the company's liquidity position. We will continue to tightly manage capital spending, and as a result, expect to spend approximately $125 million in 2010, up slightly from the $110 million spent in 2009 but down sharply from $353 million in 2008.", "In closing, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our Aggregates-focused business, which has the compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years in the future. Our available production capacity and ongoing efforts to improve cash margins position Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in the $50 billion to $60 billion of stimulus-related construction, including significant remaining portions of the $27 billion for highways and bridges. We are the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well-positioned for significant participation in economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. ", "We thank you for your continued interest in Vulcan. Now if our Operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Don, I'm wondering if you could talk about pricing trends that you've seen in Asphalt over the couple of months? Your guidance on flat year-over-year profits in the back half appears to imply a 10% or so price increase 3Q over 2Q. Do we have that right?", "Donald James", "Yes. We expect 3% to 4% price growth in the second half. The issue there are liquid asphalt costs, which were up about $100 a ton in the first half and will probably be up about $90 a ton in the second half based on our current outlook. So we are closing the gap on asphalt pricing versus liquid asphalt costs. But it takes a while to get that done.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And have you seen that starting to take in, in July yet? Or do you have some more work to do over the coming months to get to that price hike?", "Donald James", "Well, a lot of the asphalt we shipped in the second quarter was priced last year. A lot of it is stimulus work, and it was priced in the period in the second half of 2009, largely, when stimulus work was about all that was out there, because the regular Federal Highway Program was in limbo. As you know, it expired September 30, and for several months prior to that and all the way up through mid-March of 2010, there was very little in our regular Federal Highway Program. So competition for asphalt as well as aggregates was about as intense as it's been in a long time in the public sector. So I believe the situation is improving from the standpoint of visibility of future demand. But liquid asphalt pricing remains a challenge.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And lastly, can you talk about aggregate pricing trends over the past couple of months? And I think your guidance implies a modest sequential increase. Have you seen early signs of sequential improvement across your markets?", "Donald James", "Again, I think a lot of the aggregate shipped in the second quarter were priced back in the end of 2009, or the second half of 2009, when, as you can recall, housing was still very weak. Private non-res was falling sharply, and there was not lot of highway work other than the stimulus project. So we think the environment is better going forward for aggregate pricing than it certainly was in the second quarter.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And so the declines in outlook, was that driven by some incremental spot work that was shipped? Or was that driven by mix or timing of shipments? I guess, considering the good visibility you've had, I'm wondering why the pricing outlook has been reduced here.", "Donald James", "Well, highway work, generally, is strong and improving. The offsetting factor is the continued decline in non-res construction, primarily private non-res construction. Housing is continuing to pick up in our markets, but it's a relative small portion of total demand. So the balance, here, is the relationship between the improving demand in the highway sector and the continuing decline in the private non-res sector. We are seeing signs that contract awards in the private non-res side are bottoming in the sense that the rate of decline is lessening, and we're getting closer to a bottom there, but that it's still falling. And that's offsetting the upside from the highway sector.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "First of all, on the pricing. As you alluded to earlier, pricing was impacted by the hangover pricing in late '09. And also, you alluded to the long-haul market. Which of the two had a greater impact in the quarter? And also, do you have what percentage of aggregates shipped in Q2 was priced in late '09?", "Donald James", "I don't have that statistic, Kathryn, with any precision in front of me today. But the long-haul, our reported freight-adjusted selling price in long-haul markets was down about $1 a ton. Our actual price to our customers was only down about $0.30 a ton. The other $0.70 is the incremental freight cost that we absorbed as we freight-adjust our reported pricing. So the long-haul markets were significant. And the reality is that there is a lot more capital tied up per ton of aggregate in long-haul markets. You've got to have loading facilities at the quarry. You've got to have a distribution yard and unloading facilities and either investment in transportation assets or hiring those transportation assets. And then you've got more money tied up in working capital in both inventory and receivables. So in a rational world, margins ought to be higher in the long-haul business than in the truck-served markets. Unfortunately, in this market, there's a lot of competitive pressures along the Gulf Coast. And that's resulted in a reduction in our reported pricing. That accounts for about 27% of our volume, that is, the long-haul markets plus Florida and the Far West, being California and Arizona. The other portion of our business, our largely truck-served markets, which was about 73% of our volume in the quarter, did very well. We got, as I said, 65% of contribution margin from the volume growth there. So the challenge for us is to get our pricing caught up in the long-haul markets. And ultimately, California is in reasonably good shape to try to improve our margins in Florida.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "And just to clarify. In the long-haul markets, is this a function of higher fuel? Or were there other additional competitive pricing pressures in the quarter?", "Donald James", "Well, as I said, about $0.70 of the $1 is transportation, which is largely fuel. And $0.30 is competitive pressure.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Okay, okay.  That's helpful. And how has prices overall in your aggregates group trended since the quarter end? And how much did mix or geographic differences play to the pricing trends in the quarter?", "Donald James", "The first half of the question, about pricing trends in Q3, I won't go there at this point, because I don't want to give that information until the quarter ends. With respect to geographic mix, the higher-priced markets had relatively lower volumes. Then that would be Florida and California. And on an absolute basis, the long-haul markets, the way we reported, on a freight-adjusted basis, that would not be the case. But there was some geographic impact to the reported pricing. Some of our markets had price growth. In fact, our pricing ranged from up about 6% in some divisions to down significantly in Florida.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "We're hearing from our checks that you've been attempting to push some pricing throughout much of 2010. Are you still trying to push in pricing now? And how is the market accepting any attempts to pass through pricing?", "Donald James", "Depending upon the location and the job and the dynamics in the market, we're trying to push pricing every day. Where we're seeing competitive pressure is when an established customer is being called on by a competitor and offered lower pricing. And we have to deal with that in order to maintain the competitiveness of our customer. So we're responding to issues in the marketplace, which really are driven by weak demand in a number of markets. It's a very good correlation. Where demand is improving, pricing is improving. Where demand is weak, pricing is weak. Supply and demand in pricing are very alive and well in this industry.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Okay. Overall, just stepping back, you talked a little bit earlier in prepared comments about incremental margins.  Has your position on incremental margins really changed at all?", "Donald James", "Well, I think we've said publicly we would expect 60% incremental charges with improved volume. In markets that had 73% of our volume, we got more than 60%. We had erosion in gross profit in some of the markets where we had to absorb the additional transportation cost and where there is tremendous competitive pressure right now. We think volume growth, which is certainly available through highway construction, will allow most markets to exhibit the kind of incremental gross profit growth as a percent of revenue that we have experienced historically.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Okay. And my final question before I get in the queue is more related to volumes. We noted that in mid-May, there was an overall sentiment change in many key markets in the U.S. Maybe the fundamentals hadn't changed, but there definitely was a marked step to a more conservative outlook from a variety of different construction industries. How much did this play into, effectively, lowered guidance for the back half of the year?", "Donald James", "Well, I would expect without knowing that if you're hearing from contractors who build non-highway, privately-funded construction, there's got to be a great deal of pessimism there. Because the contract awards for private non-res construction are weak and not yet improving. On the highway side, the contract awards are relatively robust. So I think you would get very different reports from highway contractors compared to general contractors who do civil work in the private non-res sector. If that's inaccurate from what your sources are saying, I'm surprised.", "Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "No, not necessarily. I mean, really, what we're seeing, I mean, a great example is you have an aggregate producer that's still having the same fundamentals but is scaling back on CapEx, because they're not sure about the outlook because of stimulus rolling off or the uncertainty about the new highway build. So it's not an overall market shift, and the fundamentals have changed meaningfully, but just being a little bit more conservative.", "Donald James", "Well, I think you can see that in our CapEx over the last 24 months.  We have certainly been cautious until A) we had the need for it, which, when we are producing roughly people we were at the peak, we don't consume capital at the same rate we do at the peak. So it's natural that our CapEx would be down. I think there are, as you well know, several hurdles yet on the highway side. We've talked about the 2011 Appropriations Bill, which we were pleased with the passage last week in the House of Representatives, it's got to pass the Senate.  As you know, the authorization now runs through the end of this year.  And I think, most importantly is that the Congressional Budget Office is projecting that the balance in the Highway Trust Fund, given the current balance plus the projected receipts are sufficient to maintain a $41 billion regular highway program through 2012. And I think that's a very positive number that gives us optimism that highways will be strong. When you overlay that with the stimulus spending in the remainder of '10 and throughout 2011, highway spending is going to be robust. The real question, then, becomes, when does private non-res bottom so that it's no longer falling? And how quickly will residential begin to recover? But I think, our confidence is high in the highway sector over the next three years or so.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Garik Schmois with Longbow Research.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Just want to expand on a previous question with respect to fiscal '11 or the appropriations that passed the House. Seemed like the Senate, in recent weeks, or even going back a little bit  further, has been a little bit less keen on increasing spending. Any color that you can provide on that? And any initial reads on whether or not the Senate will pass the $45 billion spending plan? That would be helpful.", "Donald James", "I don't have a prediction. I do expect that they will take it up. We have been told by the Chair of the Environmental and Public Works Committee that they're working hard and will have hearings and try to get something done right after they come back after the August recess. I think the good news is that the Congress can appropriate the $45 billion, which is what the House appropriated, out of the balances in the Highway Trust Fund without having to increase revenue in the near term. That would likely result in the balance in the Highway Trust Fund not being sufficient to take it all the way through the end of 2012. Basically, it would accelerate some spending out of the Highway Trust Fund from 2012 into 2011. But at some point, Congress will have to take up a multi-year highway bill. The reality is that's probably going to be after the November elections. We have had several senior people in both houses indicate that they expect to get it done in 2011, that it would be a multi-year highway bill. But at this point, the thing that is, I think, tangible is that the balance in the Highway Trust Fund is sufficient to maintain a significant federal program through 2012 without any incremental tax receipts. And I think whether Congress decides to accelerate the spending or maintain level spending x the stimulus is the real question.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And just switching gears to volumes in the quarter. Can you provide a little bit more color on the year-over-year progression of volumes as you moved through April, May, June?", "Donald James", "I think they've been relatively stable each month, in the range of our -- I guess we gave an April volume number at the end of the first quarter. And so, volumes have continued to grow in the 6% range, steadily through the quarter, if that's your question.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "It is. I guess what I was trying to get at, I believe the April number was a little bit higher than the 6% that you reported.", "Donald James", "Yes, but April's a smaller-volume month than June. So we haven't seen a material shift in monthly volumes through the second quarter. Any variation is just within the normal range of -- some months have one less shipping day, some months might have one more shipping day, and that moves the monthly numbers around.  But if you're looking for a trend that shipments are way down in June compared to April, I don't think you'll find that.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And that's, I guess, what I was getting at, because the back of the year, guidance, flat to plus 5, suggests somewhat of a slowing year-over-year trend. And you did mention that there was some segments that you expected to, I guess, lag versus recover. For the full year, or at least for the second half of the year, the guidance that you provided for your various end markets were pretty similar, I believe, to what you had offered for the full year previously.", "Donald James", "That's correct.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Any one area that you feel, I guess, better or worse about?", "Donald James", "Well, I certainly feel better about highways. And I am less certain about private non-res, just simply because we don't see the catalyst in the near term for a change there. But on the highway side, the combination of the reauthorization of the regular Federal Highway Bill in March, the additional money going into the Highway Trust Fund, plus the overlay of the stimulus projects in 2010 and 2011, I think, are the place there's upside. Housing, if you look at housing incrementally month-to-month, you get one picture. If you we look at it this year versus last year, you get a different picture. So we're looking at it this year versus last year, and housing is up. Whether the loss of the tax credit for housing is going to cause a double dip in housing once could speculate, but we don't have that view. We think housing will be stronger in 2010 than it was in 2009, and that will continue well into the future. Housing starts are just so low relative to the amount necessary to replace obsolete housing and to deal with new household formations that we think that's got to move. Plus interest rates are at historic lows, and affordability is at historic high. So we have some optimism with housing, but it's a small part of our business relative to highways.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And just looking at the ready mix and asphalt volumes relative to aggregates. Was the underperformance there just purely geographic?", "Donald James", "Primarily, yes. Our concrete is in Florida, the larger Washington DC Metro area and all the way from Richmond up to Norfolk up to Baltimore. In San Antonio, Albuquerque, Phoenix and California, in some of those markets, housing has been hit harder than the rest of the country. Our asphalt is in Texas, California, Arizona and New Mexico. And our volume in asphalt is relatively stronger, or as strong as our volume growth in aggregates in those markets.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with UBS.", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "In the past, you talked a little bit about stimulus that's not related to highways. Do you have any updates on how that's tracking?", "Donald James", "That is hard to track. We keep trying to track it, but it is much less precise than the highway side. But certainly, it is moving. I think the BRAC work, there's a little bit of that stimulus money that goes to the Base Realignment and Closure. And BRAC work is very strong right now in several of our markets. Some of the other projects, water and sewer projects, go through a far less efficient contracting and bidding and awarding process than highways. And some of that's got relatively long lead times. Our sense is the $30 billion or $32 billion of non-highway stimulus-funded heavy construction is lagging the highway side. But I can't give you a precise metric. We're pretty confident that the 38% of spending through the end of the second quarter on the highway stimulus is a very good number. That comes from the government. But on the other side, we think it's probably materially lower than that, but we don't know exactly what it is.", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. In the second half of this year, the 5% volume increase, that amounts to kind of a lower volume recovery than what you had signaled for the full year. And given your confidence in highways, I'm kind of trying to understand what accounts for that downgrade. I know you talked about it a little bit, but if you could help me out with that...", "Donald James", "Private non-res.", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, so that's worse than you thought.", "Donald James", "When it's going to bottom, now you can follow the contract awards, which is what it's all about. But the contract awards are still declining. The rate of decline has decreased, but it's still declining. And the lack of credit to developers is really a big part of the issue. And so, until credit becomes more accessible, it's hard to see private non-res construction turning up significantly.", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, great, thanks. And then final question for me is, we have modeled in a payment due by the end of the year as about $340 million. So does this bank loan then address that? Is that how that should go?", "Donald James", "Yes, that's what it's about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "I guess just maybe to summarize some previous questions and maybe it's a bit early to ask, but I guess based on some of the trends you are seeing today, I mean do you anticipate you could see some pricing growth in 2011 for aggregates?", "Donald James", "We would certainly hope so. If highways are continuing to improve, as contract awards would certainly indicate they will; housing continues to solidify; and if the rate of decline in private non-res continues to be reduced; or if private non-res actually bottoms so that there's the down sector, there's a flat sector and two up sectors, then volume and price are pretty closely related over the long term. And we would expect opportunities for price growth.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Sure. Okay. And then I guess just given the pressures you've seen in your Concrete business, I mean has your view changed in terms of your relative exposure there, I mean particularly given some of the uncertainty around non-res? Or would you view the current downturn as an opportunity to expand some shares as some of the other suppliers out there are struggling?", "Donald James", "We continue to look at the opportunity. I think being able to supply cement and aggregate to Ready Mix is a key factor for us. The Ready Mix business, by itself, is not something that is strategic to us. But if it is integrated with our Aggregate business and particularly, if it's integrated with our Cement business, we think it is an attractive business in a normalized market. This is a really tough market for concrete, as you can imagine. There is a fair amount of concrete in some public infrastructure projects, particularly water and sewer projects. But concrete, by itself, is not strategic to us; concrete integrated with our other products, more so.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just one last one, any additional anticipated cost associated with the flooding in Nashville? Or is that taken care of at this point?", "Donald James", "No, that's done. We just had huge amounts of water pouring into several of our quarries and destroyed or impacted some of our equipment which we had to spend money to replace or restore. And that's essentially the gist of that. And that's behind us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Don, you've done a great job kind of outlining your expectations on the federal highway side, and you've obviously been quite clear on your views on non-res. I guess as we think about total call it road and highway demand, about 40% of total aggregates go to that channel. And as we think about it, about half of that funding comes from the federal government, and about half comes from states. And if you look at the spending trends to date, and it's really every month this year and it even goes back into last year, the numbers have been kind of flat to up on a total reported basis if you look at road and highway construction as the Census Bureau reports it. If you back out the spending from stimulus, it would suggest that the underlying spending is down substantially. Year-to-date, call it the underlying spend, is probably down 15%. Now we know that the federal dollars have been constant because of the extension. And so one read on this is that states are under a lot more pressure than the market may be aware, and it's something that the industry hasn't really addressed. So my first question is, could you speak to your view on the state situation as opposed to the federal highway situation because it's absolutely a huge component of overall road and highway demand for aggregates and how you're thinking about where we are now, how that trends in the second half of this year and given the budgetary pressures they're under, how that looks for 2011?", "Donald James", "Well, for us that's about 22 different questions, because every state is different. And within the states, the local situation is different. I think overall, the fact that for the last six months, total highway contract awards including federal, state and local in our markets are up 11%. So without regard to construction-put-in-place numbers, which are backward-looking, the contract awards are forward-looking. And they are positive. Now perhaps a greater portion of that 11% contract awards is coming from federal money contrasted to state and local than we have seen historically, but the net result for us is that total highway contract awards funded from all three sources, state, local and federal are up significantly year-over-year. And that gives us the basis for our optimism of future demand for that sector. Some states have struggled with getting state highway budgets funded and contract awards out the door. Others have done a very significant job. Some states are viewing highway construction as a state-level stimulus. I think Texas has among the largest state highway program in history. Illinois has a large program that, hopefully, will begin to roll out soon. And California's still got a very large state highway program. Notwithstanding all of the budget issues California's got, the state highway program still appears to be very robust going forward.", "Daniel Sansone", "Let me give you just a couple of total numbers we'll be able to pull up. If you look at the total state and local awards year-to-date, and this is through June 30, so it's the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year, total state and local awards are up 11%. That excludes all the federal activity. The state-only awards, state Department of Transportation awards, are actually up in the high teens. And these are in Vulcan-served states that I'm citing. And the local awards are down 5% or 6%. And when you put the state and local together, you're up 11% first half this year versus first half last year.", "Donald James", "Who was it, Mark Twain who said , \"The story of my death has been greatly exaggerated.\"? That may be true about state and local highway funding.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "I certainly hope so. As a follow-on to Jerry's question on pricing, can you give us any color on kind of current spot pricing versus reported either for the second quarter or at the end of second quarter?  That really is [indiscernible] (1:09:38) across the whole portfolio.", "Donald James", "As we say, we're pricing virtually every highway project separately. And there are so many factors that go into that, I don't think I can give you an answer that would be accurate that would make any sense. We haven't seen any momentum change in the quarter I guess is the best I can answer that, up or down. There's individual projects going to be bid at individual prices. And they're going to take into account all sorts of things including transportation cost. But in terms of trying to see a monthly momentum shift or even a quarterly momentum shift, that's a very subtle distinction.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Understood. And then the last question and kind of to follow on to that response. Given higher transportation expenses in the long-haul markets, higher diesel costs in local markets, across your platform. Are you undertaking or anticipating taking any more cost-cutting efforts to help on the margin side?", "Donald James", "As I indicated in my remarks, absent the cost of diesel fuel which we have relatively little influence over, our variable production costs at our plants are actually down slightly. So our guys are doing a tremendous job at the plant. Our labor efficiency, as I indicated, is up. So cost for us is a function of volume. And if we can continue to get volume growth, that will help on our overall cost structure. And we continue to look hard in our overhead costs in trying to rationalize them as we work through this period of relatively low volume.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I had two questions. One related to California and one related to Florida. Heidelberg on their call on Friday, were indicating that they'd seen some volume improvement in California, a change in trend at the end of the quarter which continued into July. I'm wondering whether you'd seen any of that. And my second question related to Florida. CEMEX were indicating on their call that some of the pricing issues had occurred because of somebody dumping stone into the Florida market. I mean is that something you've seen? And is there any sign, if you have seen of that, of that situation coming to a conclusion, coming to an end?", "Donald James", "California, our volumes there are down slightly in the quarter, but are stabilizing. We certainly have not seen volume growth in California in the second quarter. In Florida, there appeared to be a domestic producer with new capacity that's being aggressive in Florida, but there's many factors there. But Florida has got to get some overall volume recovery, I think, to get pricing back up. I have seen some price increase announcement by some parties in Florida. And certainly given the earnings difficulty everybody in the industry in Florida is under, I would hope that will occur. But I can't give you a projection about what we will be able to report in the second half in Florida pricing.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And how long has that new capacity in Florida being on stream?  Has it been on [ph] (1:14:40) now for 12 months?", "Donald James", "It's not in Florida. It's railing in from another state.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And just finally, just back to my first question, Don, I mean I hear what you say about California across the whole quarter. But was there any sign of improvement at the end of the quarter?", "Donald James", "Yes, we did see an improvement in shipments in June, significant, offsetting -- the whole quarter was essentially flat, which meant April, May were down some and June was up. So yes, the trend is good. I would caution that we shouldn't take one month's shipments compared to a prior month's shipments and conclude that there's a trend there. Like I said, just having one or two more shipping days versus one or two fewer shipping days can move the numbers around plus or minus 10%. But I think our June shipments did improve relative to the first two months of the quarter in California.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Davenport & Company.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "Just getting a little bit of competitive dynamic a little bit, I'd just like to drill down and a few people have done it already, of course. But are you seeing more competition on Bay stone or clean stone? Or does it matter at this point?", "Donald James", "I don't know that we see a discernible trend either way.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "Okay. And is there a theme with regard to -- well, first of all, I guess I should say has there been a change in sort of the tenor or the identity of the competitor or any of that? I mean have there been any changes in that way? Has it become more aggressive as the volumes have kind of started to pick up this year?", "Donald James", "I mean every market's different. And some competitors have appeared to have one strategy and one market and a different strategy in another market. So it's so market-specific that I don't think there are any generalizations to be made. I think, as we've indicated, the markets along the Gulf coast, and Florida in particular, which have been historically high-growth markets and will again be high-growth markets, the adjustment period has been steeper and longer than in most of the rest of the country. And so the issue about volume and price, like I said earlier, in markets where volume is flat to up, pricing tends to be up. In markets where volume is down, pricing tends to be down. And the Gulf coast right now, much of the Gulf coast has lower volumes, and therefore, lower pricing.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "Got it. And sorry to belabor the point...", "Donald James", "And a lot of it is the freight-adjusted piece of the pricing. As I said, 70% of the pricing off of our yards is the freight adjustment whereas once we can get that built into our ultimate selling price, then that will correct itself hopefully.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "So just a follow-up through that, is it fair to say that whereas you guys who are long-hauling into that market, are experiencing very significant I guess I should say net-of-freight price declines, maybe some guys who are closer aren't being as competitive on purpose, they just happen to be closer and their net [indiscernible] (1:19:39)?", "Donald James", "Well, in the Gulf coast, nobody's closer. There's no rock down there. So it's all moving. Everybody's moving rock a relatively long distance.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "Do you feel like your competitors, whoever it is who's sort of driving the competition, is trying to grab share? Or are they trying to generate cash? Do you know?", "Donald James", "I can't look into the minds of our competitors. I'm sure the need to generate cash is significant. I don't know that there's a conscious effort on the part of any particular competitor to go in and try to grab market share. I would say most competitors are probably not doing very well in long-haul movements right now and trying to grow market share in an area. The difference, there's a fundamental difference in the truck-served markets and the long-haul markets. And that is there's a big chunk of cost, ultimate cost over which you have almost no control, and that is the railroad. And so long-haul markets are tougher and riskier in that respect.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "Got it. On the question of stimulus and looking into the future a little bit, what do you think is the breakdown of the percentage of stimulus work for you guys that gets spent in 2010 versus 2011?", "Donald James", "Our initial projection, which we think has proven to be reasonably accurate, is by the end of 2010, about 60% or 65% of the highway stimulus dollars would get spent. Through Q2, that's about 38% or 40%. Then in 2011, there's probably another 30% of the total highway stimulus we would expect to be spent, with a little bit of carryover to 2012.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "So a bit more next year than in the back half of this year?", "Donald James", "Yes. But 2010 overall will probably be slightly larger than 2011 from the stimulus piece.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "Okay, thanks for that. Dan, quick question, you talked about $41 million on the legal issue up in Illinois. And I think there's $40 million on the income statement. Is there another $1 million of expense buried in somewhere else?", "Daniel Sansone", "Yes, that's in the SAG line. It's about $1.5 million of legal fees. The $40 million was the settlement itself. And the $1.5 million were the legal fees incurred during the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Johnson with Morgan Keegan.", "J. Keith Johnson - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Just a couple of quick questions. Regarding the pricing trends in your truck market. As you kind of came in the quarter, were there similar to your long-haul markets or other markets you talked about where there are contracts that were being supplied based on prices end of last year? Is there a discernible trend in the truck market specifically as you move through the quarter?", "Donald James", "Pricing in our truck markets on a freight-adjusted basis is relatively stronger than in our long-haul markets.", "J. Keith Johnson - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And as you moved through the quarter, did it continue to show strength?", "Donald James", "Yes.", "J. Keith Johnson - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Sequentially?", "Donald James", "Yes.", "J. Keith Johnson - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Okay, so continual. And then when we look at results I guess for the second quarter, maybe help me understand how big of an effect that weather pattern that we experienced in the first quarter, did it kind of shift the demand patterns into 2Q?", "Donald James", "I'm certain there was some effect. It's very difficult to quantify. As we reported at the end of the Q1, we saw improvement in March. January and February were a complete washout. We saw improvement in March. We saw improvement in April. I would imagine the largest impact from the terrible weather in January and February was seen in March and April, maybe a little bit of carryover later in the quarter. But I would think whatever we reported, April numbers were up maybe 9%. I would think that's where you saw the carryover. That was in the first quarter.", "J. Keith Johnson - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Okay, so that's helpful. So when you think of seasonal movements from Q2 to Q3, we're not...", "Donald James", "Well Q3 is historically our largest shipping quarter because we have more of the construction season. Throughout our footprint in virtually all of our markets, it's a full three months of good construction weather.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chase Jacobson with Sterne Agee.", "Chase Jacobson - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "I was just wondering if you could give us some insight into what your strategy in the markets that are more competitive, in terms of how you're maybe going to combat the pressure that you're seeing from your competitors. Also, if you have had to take pricing down, how long do you think it takes to be able to regain that pricing?", "Donald James", "Chase, I think one of the facts of life in this industry is that there is a -- changing the price doesn't create or destroy demand in the marketplace. Put another way, there's very little price elasticity to demand in our markets for our products because our products are a relatively small portion of the total cost of a construction project. That being said, in markets where volumes are down and there is stress on pricing, we have to focus on cost. We have to focus on serving our customers and keeping them competitive. And basically, volume recovery from improvements in the overall demand is really the thing that will allow us to improve price and margin. So our strategy is to keep our customers competitive, be very diligent on cost and be well positioned to take advantage of volume recovery when it occurs. The only place we can affect demand for our product is through public infrastructure funding. And that's an industry effort. But we work very hard in that regard. And we have virtually no impact on demand for our products in the housing and private non-res. But the public infrastructure side is hugely important for us. And we spend a lot of time and energy as a company and as a participant in the larger industry, in trying to build the public policy case for improved infrastructure spending. You may have seen, I believe, there's an article in this week's Time magazine, in fact, talking about how much sense does it make to continue to allow the U.S. infrastructure to decline. And the question is which is more dangerous for the future of the U.S., higher deficits or declining quality of infrastructure? So there's a significant public-policy case to be made. There's got to be an election in November before there's a real opportunity to get anybody to listen to that case.", "Chase Jacobson - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "So do you think that there's a chance that just given the cost-cutting across the industry, that maybe some of your less-disciplined competitors keep pricing lower even if demand does return given the incremental margins you can get on the higher volume?", "Donald James", "We study history. We study markets. Every market's are different. Generally, in this industry, as volumes recover, pricing improves. Will there be an exception to that somewhere? Absolutely. But as a general principle over the hundred markets we participate in, there's a price/volume relationship: the stronger the volume, the greater the pricing power, the weaker the volume, the less pricing power. And that's not going to change, I don't believe, in this cycle.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Just two questions left that I have. Don, you mentioned that 73% of your markets actually saw the 65% incremental margin that you kind of expected. So that means 27% of aggregates markets are kind of dragging on the margin. And has there been something or anything that has fundamentally changed in your opinion in those markets that are going to make those more difficult to kind of turn the corner, as the volume improves? Or is this just simply these are the hardest hit markets for volume and price and therefore, they're going to take longer to come around?", "Donald James", "There's some of that, Trey. I think the freight rates have spiked up with fuel costs. And that's been a factor. That's a significant factor. As I've said, 70% of the freight-adjusted decline in selling prices is freight. Only 30% is what I'll call market factors or competitive factors. Although the competitive factors have made passing through the higher freight cost take a little more time than we would like. Part of the issue in the second quarter, and I can't quantify this, but if you think about what's been going on in the Gulf of Mexico throughout the significant portion of the second quarter, the whole oil spill has not enhanced private construction in the Gulf coast markets. That's a big tourism area. And while I don't think we can attribute the totality of weakness in the Gulf to the economic impacts of the oil spill, it nevertheless is there. And I can't quantify it. But if you're somebody thinking about building something on the Texas Gulf coast or the Louisiana or Mississippi or Alabama or Florida Gulf coast, you aren't terribly enthusiastic with this oil spill going on and with the huge drop in tourism and economic activity from fishing and everything else. So there's some piece of that in there. Hopefully, we are getting very close to being past that. I can't tell you that that's 2% or 20% of the issue in the Gulf. But it's an issue.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Sure. How much of your shipments were long haul in the quarter? Do you have that?", "Donald James", "Generally, they're about 15%. I don't know that I have -- I guess we said the 27% includes Florida, some of which is long haul, some of which is local. It includes California and Arizona. Most of which are truck-served markets. So I'm guessing it's in the 10% to 15% range for the quarter, but that's an estimate.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay, that's real helpful. And then you had mentioned earlier kind of just looking into 2011 when you were asked the question if pricing should improve. And you said you were hopeful that it would, given kind of what you're looking for from a demand standpoint. Do you think that, that would include these hardest hit states? Or are they going to be more of a lag than the rest of the business, do you think?", "Donald James", "I think the reality is that markets where volume and price fall more sharply tend to have sharper recoveries once recovery begins. That's certainly been the historical pattern. Time will tell whether that repeats itself here. But the markets that have been hardest hit on pricing are the markets that generally had the most robust growth in pricing up through 2007. California and Florida, they're the ones where pricing has been hit the hardest in the downturn. History says they'll be the ones that will recover both in price and volume most robustly once the economy begins to recover.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Right. I mean I guess what I'm just really trying to get at here is at what point are we going to start to see the outstanding incremental margin that this business has really start to take shape for the overall business and when we kind of start baking that into our thoughts?", "Donald James", "Well I think in a large part of our footprint, that's happened. It's happening. We've very pleased with that. In order for the weaker markets to exhibit that kind of recovery, there's got to be some improvement in demand from whatever source. We think public infrastructure is alive and well in Florida and California, as it is in our other markets. The problem is the private side. And once we see some bottoming of particularly private non-res in those markets and some recovery beginning, then I think we'll certainly see the escalation in margins from the higher volume. But it's on the private side and that's what it's going to take to move those markets. In Florida and California. The Gulf coast is a little different, a little different dynamic and it may correct itself soon.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. And my last question, and this is the one that I think has a lot of people kind of scratching their heads now. I mean this is your first quarter to ever announce a down price, or a down year-over-year price, that I could ever find. And there is very little price elasticity with aggregates et cetera. And what I'd love to get your view on is why now that volumes are just now starting to really improve for the first time in 16 quarters, are we finally starting to see people in this industry getting more aggressive with price? And this is an industry that thus far has had incredible pricing power.", "Donald James", "I think the answer to that question, Trey, is twofold. Number one, in none of the periods you have looked at historically has the construction economy in the U.S. been as stressed as it has been recently. But I think perhaps more importantly is that the reported pricing in Q2, for us and perhaps everyone else in our industry, is based on price quotes made in the second half of 2009. And if you remember what was happening to volume in the second half of 2009 and, more importantly, what the future prospects for volume were in the second half of 2009, it was a pretty grim situation. Private non-res was falling. Housing was beginning to bottom, but hadn't quite yet bottomed. And there was no Federal Highway bill. All we had was some stimulus work. Hopefully, what you're seeing in Q2 pricing is a result of the economic stresses in the marketplace in the second half of '09. Those aren't behind us fully yet, because private non-res contract awards are still falling, albeit at a lower rate. But the thing that's going to pull us out of this, both volume and price, is the highway programs, to a much lesser extent, housing. And then the real kicker's going to be when private non-res finally bottoms and has some upside. So I don't think this quarter's pricing, and we've tried to indicate this in our press release and in our comments, is it is not a step change or a functional change. It is the result of really tough markets back in the second half of 2009.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A. I would like to turn the call over to Don James for closing remarks.", "Donald James", "Well thank you for being with us today. We do appreciate your questions and more importantly, your interest in Vulcan. Hopefully, we have seen the worst of this downturn in our industry.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Don James, Chairman and CEO. Please proceed.", "Donald James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss Vulcan's fourth quarter and full year 2010 results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President, Construction Materials.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "We start 2011 with optimism that the decline in demand for our products bottomed in 2010, and that growth in shipments is ahead of us. We have worked diligently throughout this long downturn to position the company for earnings growth when demand recovers. Improved stability and economic factors that drive demand for our products will bring the strength of Vulcan's fundamentals back into focus. ", "As a result of these efforts, our cash earnings for each ton of aggregate sold in 2010 was $4.15 per ton, 26% higher than it was at the peak of demand back in 2005. The attractive industry characteristics of our primary product, Aggregates, and the determined efforts of our employees have allowed us to maintain this level of profitability in 2010 despite a significant and prolonged decline in shipments during the past four years due to the economic recession. ", "In 2010, the year-over-year decline slowed significantly from the prior three years. During the period from 2007 through 2009, aggregate shipments, adjusted to include major acquisitions and divestitures, declined 11% in 2007, 21% in 2008 and 26% in 2009. In 2010 , aggregate shipments declined 2% from the prior year, reflecting varied market demand conditions across our footprint. ", "Fourth quarter aggregate shipments in several of our key markets exemplified these varied market demand conditions. In Florida, demand remained relatively weak during the fourth quarter, while California exhibited some modest growth in shipments versus the prior year. In Texas, aggregate shipments in the fourth quarter increased more than 30% from the prior year, while in our markets in North Carolina, shipments declined more than 30%. Finally, Tennessee and Illinois, two states that quickly obligated and awarded their stimulus-funded highway projects, both realized growth in aggregate shipments versus the prior year's fourth quarter. ", "While overall, aggregate shipments in the fourth quarter were flat compared to the prior year, we experienced unfavorable mix variances versus the prior year, accounting for the majority of the 4% decline in reported freight adjusted selling prices. The remaining decline in the average freight adjusted selling price in the fourth quarter was mostly attributable to competitive price pressures in Florida and California. The earnings effect of lower freight adjusted selling prices in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $15 million. This earnings effect was offset somewhat by higher earnings in our Transportation businesses that support our Aggregates businesses by moving aggregates from producing quarries to sales yards in regions where local aggregates are unavailable. ", "The average unit price paid for diesel fuel in the fourth quarter increased 19% from the prior year, reducing earnings approximately $4 million. Excluding energy-related costs, aggregates unit cost of sales in the fourth quarter were favorable compared to the prior year, reflecting the effective cost control efforts by our employees. ", "Overall, segment earnings for aggregates in the fourth quarter were $58 million versus $70 million in the prior year. Segment earnings in 2010 included $7 million of certain adjustments in charges in the quarter. In our Asphalt segment, earnings were $8 million versus $10 million last year. Selling prices for asphalt mix increased 2% offsetting a portion of the earnings effect of a 14% increase in liquid asphalt costs. Sequentially, unit material margins in the fourth quarter increased slightly from the third quarter. This is our second consecutive quarter of improving asphalt mix margins. In our Concrete segment, earnings effect of lower average selling prices more than offset 5% higher shipments and lower unit cash cost of sales versus the prior year's fourth quarter. Cement shipments in the fourth quarter increased 43% from the prior year due to higher internal consumption by our concrete operations. ", "Overall, for the quarter, our EBITDA was $65 million, our cash earnings were $46 million and our net earnings were a loss of $47 million. For the full year, EBITDA was $371 million, our cash earnings were $228 million and net earnings were a loss of $96 million. ", "Full year earnings results include a pretax charge of $22 million. This net amount includes a $43 million charge for the settlement of the IDOT lawsuit, as well as $21 million of certain adjustments and charges recorded in the fourth quarter. These charges were somewhat offset by a $39 million gain reported in the first quarter. ", "For the full year, the earnings effect of higher cost of diesel fuel and liquid asphalt reduced EBITDA  $51 million. Additionally, the full year earnings effect of lower aggregate shipments reduced EBITDA approximately $21 million. However, shipping trends for our products continued to stabilize in the fourth quarter. Trailing 12 month aggregates shipments have increased modestly since February, and asphalt and concrete trailing 12 month shipments were relatively stable throughout the second half of 2010. ", "While economic improvement in growth and construction activity across our footprint have not materialized equally, we expect the improvement in shipping trends for our products to continue in 2011 and contribute to earnings growth. ", "There are several factors that make us more optimistic about the prospects for earnings growth in 2011. First, from the perspective of the overall economy, most GDP forecast for the U.S. indicate additional growth in 2011. Additionally, state and local tax revenues have been increasing for the last four quarters, ending December 2010, according to an independent research organization. This pattern appears to be consistent with past cycles in which state and local tax revenues have rebounded after GDP recovers. Since the spring of 2009, all Vulcan-served states have shown positive growth in growth state product, an indication economic recovery is underway. ", "Looking more specifically in our construction end markets, public construction activity, particularly highways, should continue to provide solid support for aggregates demand provided that Congress acts in a timely manner to extend authorized highway funding levels at current levels through the remainder of the year. ", "Overall, the rate of growth and demand for our products in 2011 largely depends on the pace of recovery in single-family residential construction, the stabilization of private non-res construction and at the continuity of Federal funding for highways at current levels without interruption. With that said, we expect aggregate earnings in 2011 to increase from the prior year due to higher shipments in selling prices compared to the prior year, as well as the benefit of our cost-reduction efforts. ", "The midpoint of our estimated growth range in aggregate shipments is 2% above prior year level, driven by low to mid-single digit volume growth in most markets outside of California and Florida, where shipments are expected to be in line with the prior year. Most of our aggregate markets are expected to realize year-over-year price growth in 2011. We believe a more stable outlook for demand will benefit pricing overall.  Assuming comparable geographic and product mix, we expect aggregate pricing in 2011 to increase 1% to 3% from the prior year's levels. ", "In our Asphalt business, material margins on each ton of asphalt mix sold have trended higher in the second half of 2010 due to a relatively more stable cost environment for liquid asphalt, allowing average selling prices for asphalt mix to better reflect the cost of this key input. In 2011, we expect this trend to continue, resulting in continued recovery in materials margins. Overall, we expect asphalt earnings to increase from the prior year. This growth in segment earnings assumes a modest increase in sales volumes, as well as improved material margins, as higher selling prices should more than offset higher costs for liquid asphalt. ", "In Concrete, we expect higher sales volumes and slightly higher selling prices. As a result, we expect the loss reported in 2010 to narrow, somewhat. ", "In Cement, we expect segment earnings in 2011 to improve slightly from the loss we reported last year. ", "Selling, administrative and general expenses in 2011 are expected to be lower than the prior year. Total SAG expenses of $327 million in 2010 included approximately $24 million of adjustments in charges referable to the fair market value of donated real estate, severance costs and expenses related to legal settlements. In 2011, we do not anticipate similar adjustments in charges. As a result, we expect SAG expenses in 2011 of $305 million to approximate a comparable level in 2010. Included as part of SAG costs is our ERP project, which began in 2008 soon after our acquisition of Florida Rock. Implementation of this project is on schedule and most major milestones should be achieved by the end of 2012. Annual project cost peaked in 2009 at approximately $13 million but were slightly lower in 2010, reflecting realization of a portion of the cost reduction benefits. We expect a further reduction in net costs in 2011 of approximately $6 million related to the ERP project. ", "Our earnings in 2011 will be affected by the absence of certain adjustments, charges and gains recorded in 2010. In our press release as well as my earlier remarks in this conference call, we outlined $21 million adjustments and charges recorded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we incurred $42 million in charges in the second quarter for the settlement of the IDOT lawsuit, and recorded a $39 million gain in the first quarter as part of the sale of non-strategic assets. The net earnings effect of these items lowered EBITDA for the full year by about $22 million. In 2011, we do not anticipate similar adjustments, charges or gains. ", "Further, we are involved in three arbitration proceedings seeking recovery from our insurers of legal settlement cost and fees expensed in 2010 and prior periods that could impact earnings in 2011. The first arbitration relates to a case filed in Modesto, California in 2008 referable to our former Chemicals business. In the third quarter of 2010, we agreed to a settlement range with our insurer subject to final arbitration, and booked a minimum amount of $6 million as pretax income from discontinued operations. In January of this year, last month, we received a favorable arbitration award for the full amount we claimed. As a result, we expect to book an additional $7.5 million of pretax income from discontinued operations and to collect $13 million in cash in the first quarter of 2011. ", "We are also pursuing two arbitrations related to the IDOT settlement in which we are seeking to recover from our insurers the amount paid in settlement above a self-insured retention of $2 million, as well as a portion of our defense cost. As previously reported, we recorded a $40 million charge to operations in the second quarter of 2010 for the full settlement amount. Defense costs were expense as incurred. Any amounts we recover through these two arbitrations will be recorded as income from continuing operations when realized. ", "Interest expense for full year 2011 is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million based on expected interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest on capital projects. We expect our liquidity profile in 2011 to be strengthened by an increase in earnings, as well as the absence of any long-term debt maturities until the fourth quarter of 2012. We have carefully reviewed our capital spending needs based on projected demand levels, and as a result, we now expect to spend approximately $125 million in 2011, up from the $86 million spent in 2010, but still sharply lower than the $353 million spent in 2008. ", "Due in part to lower capital spending the last couple of years, we expect depreciation, depletion accretion and amortization to be approximately $365 million in 2011, down from $382 million in 2010. ", "During 2010, we completed three acquisitions that will increase our aggregates reserve position and enhance our operational footprint going forward. Two of these acquisitions included quarry operations in Tennessee and in Southern California. The third was the acquisition of a concrete business in Atlanta. ", "In summary, we believe our business continues to get stronger as a result of cost control efforts and disciplined approach to pricing throughout this downturn. We will remain diligent in our efforts to look for every opportunity to reduce costs. The underlying trends in both shipments and in the general economy continue to build our optimism, that the worst of this severe downturn is behind us. ", "We are the leader in the U.S. aggregates industry, and are well-positioned for significant participation in the economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. I would like to reiterate our confidence in the future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our  aggregates-focused businesses, which has the compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future. ", "We thank you for your interest in Vulcan and your participation in this conference call. Now if our operator will give the required instructions, we'll be pleased to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "First, can you talk a little bit, Don, about the expectation you have for pricing in 2011? Are you expecting any mix, either geographic or product mix, to impact that pricing this year? Or do you think that 1% to 3% is going to be all real pricing impacts?", "Donald James", "We don't have any mix shift built into those projections. Certainly by the time the year occurs, they will very likely be a different geographic mix than we have projected. But at this point, the 1% to 3% price growth is not based on any sort of mix shift. Clearly, if volumes continue to recover in California, as they appear to have or begin to stabilize and begin recovery, that will help on a mix. As we pointed out in the fourth quarter, our shipments in our markets in portions of North Carolina where we have operations were down substantially, North Carolina is a good state for us. We had much higher shipments in Texas, and the average selling price in Texas is significantly lower than it is in North Carolina, for example. So the recovery in North Carolina would help if that occurs in 2011. So there will always be some geographic mix differences but the simple answer to your question is, we have not projected any significant shifts in our pricing outlook for '11.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "As we sit here today, would you expect those price increases to show up immediately? Or is that something that will kind of start to increase as the year progresses, you think?", "Donald James", "Well, I think they will begin -- a lot of what we'll ship in the early part of the year will be based on prices that we quoted in 2010. So I think you will start seeing the benefit of it, some in the second quarter, but then third quarter is when I think you will see increases. Our average for the full year is the 1% to 3% number. We haven't broken that out quarter-by-quarter.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "I guess looking at North Carolina, just falling off the map, can you talk a little bit about what's going on there? Is that mostly weather or is there some big one -- I mean, what happened there?", "Donald James", "Well, in our portion of North Carolina, which is certainly not the full state, we are much stronger in the western half than the central and the eastern half of the state. Charlotte is one of our key markets, and Charlotte is struggling on housing and private non-res. Coastal Carolina that we serve is like many other coastal markets where the vacation business is not great. And the state budget in North Carolina is under some pressure. And while there's been a fair highway program, it has not been in the parts of the state that we serve in large part. So the combination of those factors has reduced our shipments substantially in North Carolina in the fourth quarter.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.", "And then on Texas, I know that weather has been favorable there relative to last year or I guess year-over-year in the quarter, in the fourth quarter. That's an awfully big jump. Is that mostly weather or are you guys seeing just a pretty big jump in demand coming back there as well?", "Donald James", "Well, certainly, there is -- last year's fourth quarter in Texas, the weather was absolutely awful. So we have a relatively easy comp in Texas for the fourth quarter. That being said, the economy in Texas is better than it is in most other parts of the country, and Texas continues to grow. I'm sure you've seen the census forecast that, Texas is going to add four Congressional seats as a result of the 2010 census, and there's just a lot of momentum there that yet to be picked up in some other parts of the country.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Don, can you say more about your asphalt material margin forecast for 2011? What are you assuming for liquid asphalt costs, and can you give us an update on asphalt market pricing in January from year end?", "Donald James", "We think liquid asphalt costs will be up again in 2011 above '10, probably on average, maybe $50 a ton. We expect to be able to continue to increase our pricing for asphalt mix to recoup the big run-up in liquid asphalt prices that has occurred over the last couple of years. As we have said in many meetings and presentations, the ability to get asphalt mix prices tends to lag, liquid asphalt tends to be bought and sold on a spot basis and asphalt mix tend to be sold on a contract basis over some longer period of time. So there is some lag. When we have the highest materials margins in the Asphalt business is when liquid asphalt prices start down and we have booked prices at higher numbers. So we think we'll see gradual recovery in the margins in 2011 in asphalt mix, even assuming the higher cost of liquid asphalt. You asked about trends in January. We're not prepared to go into January results at this point.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And Dan, you have a couple of maturities on the debt side coming up over the next year. Should we think of a drawdown on the bank lines, and can you talk about how you're thinking about the capital structure broadly with the bank loan maturities in 2012?", "Daniel Sansone", "Our next meaningful maturity is in December of 2012 of $300 million. In 2011 and 2012, prior to that large one, the maturities are de minimis, $5 million here or $5 million there. So at this point in time, we're not facing any significant maturities at all in the current year. And as we get closer to the 2012 maturity in December of that year, we'll assess both our free cash flow and credit market conditions at that point in time and make a decision on how to fund it. But right now, we don't believe there's any reason to have to go out and pre-fund that 2012 maturity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Kasprzak from BB&T.", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "How much were aggregates prices down in California and Florida in the quarter, if you can tell us?", "Donald James", "In Florida, they were down about 14%. And in California, they were down -- we have different markets in California, but they were probably down 6%, 7%.", "Daniel Sansone", "Two of our California markets were down and one of our markets in California was actually up 2%.", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "And do you guys know the infrastructure part of your business in 2010? What the volume change was for the year?", "Donald James", "If you mean -- do you mean infrastructure including highways, or infrastructure excluding highways?", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Including highways.", "Donald James", "Including highways, in 2010, highways were up for us about 13%, shipments into highways and shipments into infrastructure were up about 7%. So that's where, obviously, that was where our strength was. Non-construction, that is railroad, ballast, environmental, ag line , et cetera, was also up significantly, 18%. The big drop was of course, in private non-res.", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "And I was also curious about concrete, the expectation that prices might be up slightly in 2011, just given that you have the  Florida exposure there, obviously, and that residential is still pretty weak in Florida, not getting better anyway. I mean why would pricing even be up a little?", "Donald James", "Our Concrete businesses is not all in Florida, it's also in Washington, D.C.; Northern Virginia area; Baltimore; Richmond; Norfolk, Virginia; Atlanta; San Antonio; Albuquerque; Phoenix; San Diego; Central Valley of California. So we have a mix, and Florida has been a very tough environment. But while we had a tough year in 2010, we believe the situation is set for some ability to get price increases in concrete. We're not in the business of selling concrete at a cash loss, and we're not going to do that.", "John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets", "Do you guys anticipate any asset divestitures in 2011?", "Donald James", "We have some non-core assets that we would sell if the right deal came along, if they were worth more to someone else than to us, we don't have anything built into our projections for that. But certainly, we do have some things that are not strategic to us. That's nothing new. We continue to prune our portfolio, and we'll continue to do that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from UBS.", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "Two questions. One, I was interested in the part of your release where you talk about the second half of the year potentially seeing leverage to your business model with the private sector coming back, I just want get a little bit more color on how you weigh two factors of public stimulus continuing through the year but at some point tapering off and then the private sector picking up. How do those factors play against one another?", "Donald James", "Well, I think what we were trying to communicate was that we expected the second half of private non-res to be better than the first half. But we don't think private non-res is going to improve in '11 over '10. Overall, we think private non-shipments and the private non-res in '11 will be down 4%, 5% compared to this year. While it is stabilizing, we're not seeing the huge drops that we saw in 2008, 2009, slightly lower drop in 2010 than the prior two years. But it looks like to us in contract awards that the private non-res is bottoming, and when we had a reference to the second half, it was the second half would be really better than the first half. But overall for the full year, we don't expect any increase in shipments in the private non-res. Hopefully, we can be surprised. But at this point, we're not projecting up trend in private non-res for the full year.", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "So stimulus continuing to be solid are going to help the volume story overall?", "Donald James", "Well, there's still a lot of unspent stimulus money. The Congressional Budget Office report, which has to be accurate, says there's still $9.4 billion in stimulus money for highways to be spent in FY '11. Now FY '11 includes the fourth quarter of '10, so that full amount probably doesn't exist today, but still the stimulus impact is not over. We expect the stimulus to have an impact in 2011, and even a small impact in the '12, and with the tail running all the way out to '13.", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "Maybe more for Dan. I wanted to know -- I had written in my notes that there will be $120 million debt pay down in the fourth quarter and maybe I missed how exactly that was -- if I was wrong there, if that was expressed. And then also on tax guidance, if you could help us give some color if we're going to continue to see what we saw in 2010 into 2011?", "Daniel Sansone", "There was not a $120 million maturity in the fourth quarter of this year. I think what you may be remembering is we did have a term loan that we entered into in the summer of 2008, which was a three-year note that would have matured in the summer of 2011. When we put in place the $450 million term loan in the summer of last year, we used some of that cash to prepay that maturity, so that is gone now. And the remainder of that $450 million term loan that we took down in July of 2010 was used to satisfy the $325 million maturity in the fourth quarter of 2010. So the only maturity we have in 2011 is a $5 million maturity, and the only maturity we have in 2012 is a $300 million maturity in December of 2012.", "Timna Tanners - UBS Investment Bank", "And then, so on tax rate guidance, if you could help us with that. It's been something...", "Daniel Sansone", "Yes, that's hard. Let me try to tackle the tax rate this way. Let's look at the 2010 numbers as a springboard. We posted a tax provision of $85.9 million, it was a tax credit of $85.9 million. There's a lot of pieces that make that up. But the two drivers that I think you need to focus on in developing your tax numbers for your projections are: first, the tax at the statutory rate. And if you will just take the pretax income tax effective at 35%, that's the Federal tax rate and that will be the starting point for the tax provision. So in 2010, that was about $67.5 million. The second significant piece of the tax equation is statutory depletion on our mining operations. And that amount in 2010 was just a shade over $20 million. So the Federal tax credit and the depletion benefit combined represented virtually all of our tax provision. There's obviously, some state tax that has to be factored into that, and then of course, you have the myriad of other tax items and true-ups and adjustments with the taxing authorities, et cetera. But they have, in the last couple years, generally netted to a fairly small number. I have no reason to think that's going to be materially different in 2011. So I guess my guidance would be, begin with your own assumption on what pretax earnings is going to be for the company. Start with tax at the statutory rate or the 35%, that will be your debit or credit based on whether you have us at earnings or a loss. And then the depletion benefit will generally track the activity in the Aggregate business. So if you are projecting aggregates, revenues and earnings to rise, there will be kind of a scale effect for depletion rising with that. And if you were to have aggregates earnings declining that depletion benefit will be declining. It's not necessarily a straight one for one relationship. But just look at history and I think you can get pretty close. That's my best advice on planning for tax provisions for 2011.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Adam Rudiger - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Two questions. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you guys break out what the $21 million in Q4 charges were?", "Donald James", "Yes, I'll go over that again. We had about -- $3.8 million, $4 million of it was SAG. Most of that was in severance and some of its remaining part was in legal fees and in a case that we have settled and disposed of, which will not be recurring. There's about $7 million of it that ran through gross profit in our Aggregates business. Some portion of that was a write-down of some inventory values at a Legacy Vulcan quarry in Florida that we have mothballed. And when we looked at the reprocessing cost of that material and current selling prices, we booked the charge there. We're also consolidating some of our Deepwater terminals in Florida, Legacy Vulcan terminals. There's some non-cash charge associated with that, that ran through gross profit total that's about $7 million. And then there were a number of non-cash charges that ran through other income. Some of that was asset retirement obligations. Some were some impairment for non-strategic assets, and things like ARO type things. One was a lawsuit settlement of some reclamation obligations that go back to a predecessor of CalMat many, many, many years ago. So all of that rolled -- that was roughly $10 million or $10.5 million, so you roll all that up and it's about $21 million. We don't expect any repeat of any of those things in 2011 or in those categories of things in 2011.", "Adam Rudiger - Wachovia Capital Markets", "And second question is just on free cash flow for 2011. This is a preliminary kind of estimates but just as I take a quick stab at it, I don't see a real robust cash flows the next year after dividends and your CapEx. I was curious what your thoughts were there and if you've revisited cutting the dividend again at all?", "Donald James", "Well, our board will take up the dividend at our next board meeting. We look at cash earnings or cash flow or free cash flow as you do. We certainly believe that over the long term, our cash flows will increase substantially. And at this point, we have not elected to reduce our dividends since the equity offering back in June of 2009. I indicated we took some charges and some in 2010 related to some litigation. Hopefully, we can recover a substantial amount of that from our insurers. We certainly believe we are entitled to it and that will have some benefit to cash as well. So there are some moving parts on cash that give us comfort. As Dan Sansone has reported, our maturities of any of our debt, we don't have any significant maturity until late in 2012. So we are -- we have the lion's share of our $1.5 billion line of credit still untapped. So we're not concerned at all about liquidity or cash in the near term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Goldman Sachs", "First, on the highway bill, we all heard what the President said and the Republicans' rebuttal and I think there's been a lot of consistency there among other things that we need to live within our means, the highway trust fund is clearly underfunding on the structural basis and other people we've spoken to in D.C. have suggested that we may well need to live within our means with the highway bill. That, obviously, would imply pretty substantial cuts. I was hoping maybe you could start by talking about what you're hearing on the highway bill and then we can go from there.", "Donald James", "Well, I think there are a couple of points of misinformation have occurred. Somebody reported that the Highway Trust Fund was in deficit, that's not correct. The Highway Trust Fund has ample funding to maintain the $41 billion or $42 billion spending levels through fiscal year '12, which would be September 30, 2012. That doesn't necessarily mean that Congress will spend that amount. But that amount is in the Highway Trust Fund. So there is no current deficit in the Highway Trust Fund. You are correct that the current receipts into the Highway Trust Fund are less than current expenditures. That's being offset by the supplemental appropriations that have gone into the Highway Trust Fund, the most recent of which was $19.5 billion earlier in 2010 as a result of the HIRE Act. And it was a restitution of interest on unspent balances in the Highway Trust Fund that have been drawn down for the accounting side, I would say, a deficit reduction in past, and that money was restored to the Highway Trust Fund. Long-term for the country to grow highway spending in a way that will at least maintain the condition of the current investment in highways and to create jobs, as you know, in the construction sector, unemployment is running twice what it is in the general economy,  it will require some incremental revenue stream to the $18.4 per gallon that was last adjusted back in 1993. At this point, we don't have a prediction or projection for when we will see a new multi-highway bill or what source of funding is. Our focus today is to get the authorized level of spending approved through the rest of the year, then we'll begin to look at sources of revenue. I think a real important fact is that a lot of the highway users, that is not the construction highway, construction and materials industry, but the people who use the highways in their business are saying, \"Come on guys get on with this highway program.\" The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has embraced a higher fuel taxes to go on the Highway Trust Fund. The American Trucking Association has embraced higher fuel taxes to go in the Highway Trust Fund. We are in this political game of chicken where nobody wants to say raise taxes either side of the aisle. So that's where we are.", "Ted Grace - Goldman Sachs", "I guess on a related note, it would be great to get your state of what's going on in the individual states? Certainly we think the states are probably the better part of half of total road and highway, it's not something that gets a lot of attention. And certainly, while to your point, tax receipts are improving, states are -- there's a ton of survey work done that says states are still facing, I think it's fair to use the word massive deficits, and so as they look at spending relative to priorities, education, healthcare, public safety take precedence over just above everything else. We've seen some anecdotes, Kansas most recently where the governor actually in his budget included taking funds out of the State Highway Trust Funds. In our conversations with [indiscernible] they highlighted similar risks at most states and actually referenced similar issues or risks in Maryland, Virginia and Florida. So just curious if you have any perspective of that side of it as well?", "Donald James", "Well, if you look at the source of highway spending, in 2009, you had, from the regular Federal Highway Program, you had $42 billion, you had about $6 million in stimulus and you had $34 billion in state and local. State and local dropped in 2010 down to about $30 billion as the stimulus spending ramped up from $6 billion  to $11 billion but the regular federal program with some bits and starts and ebbs and flows continued. We don't see a big drop in any state and local. We think the state and local contribution to highway spending in '11 will actually be up slightly to offset a slight decline in stimulus spending. Every state's got a different story. I think it is important to drill down to how states fund their state and local highway programs. Generally, they don't use income taxes or sales taxes, general sales taxes, which have been the most volatile source of revenues for states. Many states use fuel taxes or excise taxes on transportation-related items, including taxes on automobiles or vehicles. So there's a huge -- it's really difficult to generalize from state to state in the condition of the transportation budget. That being said, there are many states with improving programs, projected improvements in programs, many states with declines in the program. Overall, we think it is reasonably balanced as we go forward.", "Ted Grace - Goldman Sachs", "As a follow up to Jerry's question, did I hear you correctly, right now your best guess is liquid asphalt price is up $50 year-over-year?", "Donald James", "Yes, that's an estimate but it's like predicting the price of crude oil. Who knows? So that's just where we are when we put our numbers together.", "Ted Grace - Goldman Sachs", "And what's the base number for liquid asphalt? And what was your average price in 2010?", "Donald James", "$464 a ton.", "Ted Grace - Goldman Sachs", "So if we take $464 and we assume at 5% of the cost, correct?  That's kind of the rule of math we use, that 5% of...", "Donald James", "The 5% is by weight.  The aggregate goes in at $10 or $12 a ton and the liquid asphalt goes in at $464 a ton. So you need to do your math differently I think.  It's not 5% of the cost, it's 5% of the weight.", "Ted Grace - Goldman Sachs", "Exactly, so if you convert it, it's about 70% of the cost of a ton of asphalt?", "Donald James", "That's roughly correct.", "Ted Grace - Goldman Sachs", "And if we look at diesel futures as a proxy for liquid asphalt because it's historically shown the highest correlation there, that will probably point to 20-plus percent inflation. I guess what I'm curious to understand is when you look at your guidance of volumes up say 2% for aggregates, how does that adjust for the fact that state budgets are at best semi-fixed on a dollar perspective and you've got pretty substantial inflationary component in liquid asphalts which actually essentially deflates your real purchasing power?", "Donald James", "Well, we factored all that into our projections. I mean we live and breathe all that everyday. That is one of the problems with a fixed cents per gallon revenue stream set back in 1993, when the price of imports go up and the one that, by far, is the more volatile as liquid asphalt, it does reduce purchasing power and more of the dollar goes to asphalt mix and ultimately liquid asphalt than to the other components.", "Ted Grace - Goldman Sachs", "So said differently, you actually think on a dollar basis road and highway spending is up more than your tonnage assumption we assume on aggregates?", "Donald James", "Well, ours is based on our markets, not the whole company, not the whole country. And so we do it on a very granular basis, and I can't get beyond -- I don't have the data to try to get beyond what will happen in our markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "For your guidance you gave for the year, does that assume flat federal highway funding for 2011? So in other words, $41 billion spend?", "Donald James", "Yes, I mean within the range of $42 billion to $41 billion, it's flat.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "And also in terms of your driver for your increased CapEx, what is the primary driver for your increase CapEx?", "Donald James", "Let me go back. We are projecting stimulus spending to be down some in '11. So the total Federal piece of highways, we do expect to be down some compared to '10.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "As far as your increased capital expenditures, you talked about a little bit earlier in your prepared comments. But what are your first areas for spend and where do you see that overall just stepping back and looking the next several years, where do you see a more normalized maintenance CapEx?", "Donald James", "Well, maintenance CapEx is really a function of tons of throughput of aggregates going to the plants. And the plants don't depreciate or deteriorate with age or time in any meaningful way. It's really how hard you run them, how many tons you're running through it. As you can imagine, running crushing rock consumes plant and equipment with a fair amount of vigor. So the best way to think about CapEx for replacement CapEx is on a cents per ton basis. It's not smooth, I mean, when you have to rebuild a plant, that gets to be lumpy. But most of our CapEx, or projected CapEx for 2011, is replacement CapEx although we've got some other things in there...", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "So is that like a placement of mobile equipment  initially and...", "Donald James", "Not a lot of that because we're not wearing out our mobile equipment today as the same as we're wearing it out twice as fast five years ago as we are today on -- because of the difference in volume. The same thing with our fixed plant equipment. So we didn't place $88 million in 2010. That was less than we had projected at the beginning of the year because volumes were actually slightly weaker than we projected at the beginning of the year. And it's really a function of how much volume we use, is how fast we consume our plant. And with the number of plants and the mobile equipment fleet we have, we have a fair amount of flexibility in utilizing our resources across a big footprint.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "You said that much of the 2011 CapEx is replacement. What exactly would you be replacing if that's not mobile equipment, if it's not fixed plant equipment?", "Donald James", "I didn't say we wouldn't. That's what you replace...", "Daniel Sansone", "There's no single category of equipment or assets that dominates the $125 million. In certain locations we're replacing processing segments within a plant that have either become inefficient or have to be moved to get better access to the reserves. There's a number of projects for further development of some greenfield sites to make sure that we do what is necessary to protect the permits for those sites. In some other cases there are some pieces of mobile equipment being upgraded. It is really a large number of very small projects, generally speaking, spread across a pretty broad footprint, as Don said.  And there's some carryover spending embedded in that $125 million. If my memory serves me right, it's around 25% to 35% of that total is spending that will occur in 2011 on similar type projects that were begun in 2010 or earlier. We are just completing them. So again, it's really no single category jumps out and says, \"My gosh, we're having to spend a lot of money on this or that,\" it's really site-specific and responding to very, very specialized needs. You may have one location where there is a problem with a screening circuit, you'll deal with that. Another location where you have a mobile equipment issue, you deal with that. But it's not a single across-the-board category that's making up the spending.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "Also, you projected lower SAG on a dollar's basis for 2011, and I understand you do have some IT costs that you're not carrying over in 2011 that you had in 2010. What are the other drivers for the lower SAG cost in 2011 on a dollar's basis?", "Donald James", "Well, we had a fair amount of severance, we had a fair amount of legal fees. I think I covered this earlier but we had...", "Daniel Sansone", "Related to the ERP project, as we have rolled that project out, we have been able to reduce the headcount associated with transactional accounting and those implementations in the various businesses have occur sequentially, so we're seeing a full year effect in 2011 of some of the reductions in administrative costs that occurred as a result of the ERP project. We have only partial year benefits in 2010.", "Donald James", "Kathryn, the major items are donation. We had a $9.2 million donation in 2010. We had roughly $7 million in severance costs. We had about $8 million in professional fees that we don't believe we'll have again in 2011.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "This is more just an industry question for you. Do you know what the aggregate intensity of a single-family versus multi-family development is for aggregates?", "Donald James", "Our estimate is single-family, if you use single-family is a 1, multifamily is going to be like a 1.8. It's going to be more like retail construction because you have parking lots and typically more concrete and asphalt then you would in single-family per dollar of spending.", "Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners", "And also just in terms of -- I know there's been of focus on overall cost for raw materials and other input costs into 2011. Would you differentiate what your thoughts or your forecast for your truck versus rail rate trends for 2011?", "Donald James", "I think they're both driven by fuel costs. And if the question is what will be the escalator, if any, in delivery costs of truck versus rail, I think it's all fuel costs and the fuel costs are similar in terms of change from year to year, same thing with parts and chips.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois  from Longbow.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Can you just parse out, on the pricing side, the 4% decline in the quarter, you mentioned in your remarks that most of it was due to geographic mix. But how much was the declines in California and Florida part of the 4%? Is it fair to think about it as maybe 1% and that...", "Donald James", "Yes, that's what we were saying, it's about 1%.", "Garik Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "And then just lastly on the cement prices, there's an increase in market in Florida. If you could just comment on that? If you're participating or if you expect that to hold?", "Donald James", "Well, we certainly intend to improve our cement pricing. Our volumes were way up in the year as we indicated. There've been largely by internal consumption. But we think the stage is set for some improvement in cement pricing in our markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil from Davenport.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "On the guidance for volumes where you gave a midpoint, would you care to sort of put a range around that midpoint?", "Donald James", "Well, you can probably say 1% to 3% or maybe 0% to 4%. That's sort of the parameters about as we look at ups and downs. We don't see the situation given our assumptions for a huge variation in demand. But we hope there's some more upside. But as we sit here today, 2% is our best risk adjusted estimate.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "And you didn't mention it, so I assumed it wasn't significant. But was there any product mix shift in the year-over-year price change in the fourth quarter?", "Donald James", "There's always some, but it was not as significant a factor as the geographic mix.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "So we haven't really started to see the long anticipated shift back toward a more normal proportion of base material?", "Donald James", "I don't know what that means but...", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "I guess we had heard, I think we had talked, if we haven't, I could be mistaken that there's been a lot of demand for clean stone and that base material had been piling up towards fairly heavy inventories of that out there.", "Donald James", "Well, you probably were talking to somebody else. Certainly, with the stimulus money using clean stone for resurfacing, there have been big increases in base material in the industry. We work very hard to manage that. Our inventories are actually down year-over-year. So I don't think that's a factor for us next year.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "You said on the last call about Florida that you hope that you're going to see some pricing stability there and, obviously, prices were down year-over-year in the quarter. Can you talk about what you saw there sequentially?", "Donald James", "From third quarter to fourth quarter?", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "Yes, sir.", "Donald James", "I don't think the price improvement we're looking for in Florida will begin in the fourth quarter. It will be a 2011 phenomenon.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "Switching to just a follow up on some of the CapEx comments, if you think about the different businesses or the different business segments or however you want to think about it, where is the majority of the CapEx or what does split look like on capital expenditures among concrete, asphalt and aggregates?", "Donald James", "It's heavily, heavily aggregates.", "Daniel Sansone", "Predominantly aggregates, very little capital is being spent on Concrete or the Asphalt businesses right now, same with cement. We completed the expansion in the cement plant that was underway when we bought Florida Rock. So there's a lot of fresh capital there. We're not putting very much money in and literally the spending in concrete and asphalt is de minimis.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "I absolutely accept the concept that the maintenance requirement goes way down as volumes go down but given your spend is so far below D&A, have you seen any sort of shift in repair and maintenance expenditure? Or are you sort of keeping that...", "Donald James", "I think the best indication of that is that we said that excluding energy costs, diesel fuel and electricity, our unit cost of sales in aggregates in 2010 were slightly lower than 2009, and that includes the R&M component as well as labor and other things so...", "Daniel Sansone", "I would also add, if you think about the level of CapEx spending today relative to DD&A, don't forget that our DD&A charge is significantly inflated by the purchase accounting associated with the Florida Rock transaction. I don't have the number at my fingertips of how much is embedded in there for the markup but it's a significant portion. So if you factor that out and look at it on a traditional historic comp DD&A number, it's not nearly the GAAP that you're seeing.", "Donald James", "And look at the difference in our cash earnings versus our GAAP earnings and you'll see the impact of these big non-cash depreciation charges.", "Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company, LLC", "I asked you last quarter about the $35 million that showed up on the cash flow statement that you said was buying that concrete operation in Georgia. It looks like almost the same amount is on the cash flow at this quarter. Can you talk about that a little bit?", "Donald James", "Yes. We bought two quarries, as I indicated in my remarks. We bought a quarry in San Diego, we bought a quarry in the Knoxville, Tennessee market. These are operating quarries, and they're both owns for us and they were strategic to us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Just first on the Cement business, I mean we've all heard about the challenges in the Florida market and you've experienced some pretty robust improvement in volumes there for a few quarters now. Can you just help me understand the discrepancy there.", "Donald James", "I don't know that there's a discrepancy. As Dan Sansone said, we completed and brought the second line of our cement plant in Florida on stream. We are supplying a greater proportion of our internal needs, both directly and indirectly, through swaps. So that's the story.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "And then on concrete prices, it sounds like you're expecting it to hit a floor year maybe in 2011. Are you starting to see some evidence of that year in Q1?", "Daniel Sansone", "Yes, we've got price increases in place in a number of markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Aynsley Lammin from Citigroup.", "Aynsley Lammin - Citigroup Inc", "Firstly, if you could comment on your expectation for any kind of the underlying cost increases on [inidscernible] say ignoring kind of energy and depreciations, is there any cost of sales category? And could I just clarify I think you said your front-end cost this year you'd expect to be between $170 million and $180 million. Is that correct?", "Donald James", "Correct. The only place we see cost escalation in Aggregates businesses is in diesel fuel, little bit in the explosives but we hope to be able to offset that by productivity and efficiency.", "Aynsley Lammin - Citigroup Inc", "Could you just remind us again how many gallons of diesel you use across the group?", "Donald James", "43 million gallons. And of course, that's way down because we're producing a lot less rock than we did four years ago.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Don James for closing remarks.", "Donald James", "Thank you very much for being with us today. We look forward to talking to you again after the conclusion of the first quarter. And have a good day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

My name is Larry, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Don James, Chairman and CEO of Vulcan Materials Company. Please proceed.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining our call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2011. We have posted to our website a few slides on our Profit Enhancement Plan and our planned asset sales that we announced today. These slides are also available to those of you on the webcast, and we'll be talking about those slides in a few minutes.", "Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President for Construction Materials; John Mcpherson, our Senior Vice President for Strategy and Business Development.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risk and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "First, I want to take you through some key financial highlights from the fourth quarter and full year 2011. As you saw in our press release, we had significantly improved results in the fourth quarter. Earnings from continuing operations were a loss of $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $0.36 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. This year's results include $0.05 per share related to the organizational restructuring costs and $0.01 per share related to the unsolicited exchange offer by Martin Marietta. Excluding those charges, fourth quarter 2011 results were a loss of $0.14 per share compared to a loss of $0.36 per share in the prior quarter.", "Net sales for the quarter were $578 million, which is 5% increase from the fourth quarter of last year. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $74 million, an increase of $24 million or 47% from last year's fourth quarter.", "Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased 360 basis points, largely due to strong results in our aggregate segment. Our aggregate segment results demonstrate the impact of our effective cost controls and operating leverage. ", "Net sales increased $16 million or 4% from the prior year. Aggregates gross profit increased by $22 million or 37%, reflecting the strength of our operating leverage. Gross profit margins increased 500 basis points as a result of higher pricing and lower unit cost. Unit gross profit was up 34% to $2.29 per ton. ", "Aggregates shipments increased 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago period, due mostly to increases in shipments in California and the mid-Atlantic markets. Shipments in California and the mid-Atlantic were up 40% and 19%, respectively, versus last year. These increases are due primarily to large infrastructure project work, as well as favorable weather conditions.", "Average freight-adjusted selling price increased by 1% in the fourth quarter due to improvements across a number of markets particularly in Florida, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Labor productivity and energy efficiency, which are both key operating measures for us, also improved versus the prior year's fourth quarter, helping to offset a 25% increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel.", "Fourth quarter earnings in Asphalt were $5 million versus $8 million last year. This year-over-year decline in earnings was due primarily to higher liquid asphalt cost. The average sales price for asphalt mix increased approximately 9%, offsetting most of the earnings effect of the 16% increase in liquid asphalt cost. Asphalt mix volume decreased 1% from the prior year's fourth quarter.", "The Concrete segment reported a $2 million improvement to a loss of $11 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $13 million in the prior period. Volumes were flat with the prior year's fourth quarter. The average sales price increased 5%, contributing to improved unit materials margins, despite higher unit costs for us in Aggregates.", "Finally, Cement segment earnings in the fourth quarter were $1 million, an improvement of $2 million from the prior year due to increased volume and lower operating cost. Our EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $97 million, excluding restructuring charges and the expenses related to the Martin Marietta exchange offer compared to $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.", "Fourth quarter SAG expenses were $8 million lower compared to the prior year, a decrease of 10%. This is a result of our cost initiatives and decreased spending on our new ERP and Shared Services platform, which I will discuss in a moment. Importantly, this $8 million decrease does not include the additional benefits from the restructuring we announced in December of 2011 and have now implemented.", "EBITDA for the year was $425 million, including $87 million related to gains from the sale of nonstrategic assets and the legal settlement and also, including $15 million in expenses related to restructuring and the Martin Marietta exchange offer. Our SAG expenses for the year decreased by $38 million or 11% compared to the prior year period, primarily a result of our ongoing focus on reducing cost.", "In 2011, our Aggregate segment maintained a high level of profitability, generating cash earnings of $4.08 per ton compared to $4.15 in 2010. All key labor and energy efficiency metrics for aggregates improved for the full year from the prior year and helped offset some of the 35% increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel.", "Throughout the year, we continued our disciplined approach to working capital management. As a result, our cash conversion cycle remained in line with 2010 levels despite a challenging business environment for Vulcan and its customers. ", "As many of you know, on December 9, our board approved a plan that we had developed during the course of 2011, which consolidates our organization from 8 divisions into 4 regions and streamlines our management structure. In addition to reducing overhead costs and increasing efficiency, the new organizational structure confirms our longstanding commitment to decentralize management of sales and productions. This allows us to maintain close relationships with our customers in our local markets.  ", "I am pleased that we have substantially completed the restructuring, and along with other cost reductions carried out earlier in 2011, have now captured $55 million in run rate overhead reductions. I should note that a key factor in our ability to implement the restructuring and to do it so quickly is our new ERP and Shared Services platforms. ", "As you know, we initiated the ERP project in November 2007 to create a common platform for all systems that support our businesses and have now completed all the major milestones for the project. The collection of systems and new processes has allowed us to make substantial reductions in SAG and will support the pursuit of increased efficiency going forward with our Profit Enhancement Plan.", "Turning now to Slide 4. Today, we announced a new initiative in our ongoing efforts to accelerate earnings growth and enhance our credit profile. The initiative has 2 parts: a Profit Enhancement Plan and planned asset sales. The Profit Enhancement Plan includes cost reduction and other profit enhancements to improve our run rate profitability, as measured by EBITDA, at current volumes by more than $100 million annually. We expect to achieve the full run rate by 2014.", "The second part of the initiative we announced today is planned asset sales. We are targeting $500 million in net proceeds from these sales. These are good assets, which should have significant value to a number of potential purchasers. These planned asset sales will be made from a larger portfolio of assets that are not central to the company's strategy as the leading aggregates producer in the fastest growing regions and urban markets in the United States. These actions will enable us to generate higher levels of earnings and cash flow, strengthen our credit profile and give our board flexibility to restore competitive dividend.", "Turning now to Slide 5. This shows the actions included in the Profit Enhancement Plan. These profit enhancements will be in addition to the $55 million in run rate overhead reductions already achieved, which are shown on the left of the slide and/or a logical continuation of the efforts done a year ago in early 2011. ", "Specifically, we will drive improved profitability through leveraging Vulcan's already robust procurement practices to capture significant incremental savings in production, technology, transportation, logistics and other capital spending. Of the $100 million in Profit Enhancements, $25 million will be achieved in 2012, $75 million will be achieved in 2013 and the full $100 million will be achieved in 2014.", "The timing of the Profit Enhancement Plan is driven by several important catalysts. First, since initiating the project in 2007, we have invested $62 million in implementing our new Oracle-based ERP and Shared Services platforms. This investment will be substantially complete in 2012, and we are now beginning to reap the benefits of these new platforms. These platforms will help us streamline processes enterprise-wide and standardize administrative and support function while providing enhanced flexibility to monitor and control cost.", "Second was the completion of our restructuring, which included the consolidation of the company's management structure, which enables us to implement best practices efficiently across the organization. This initiative has been led by Danny Shepherd who was promoted to Executive Vice President of Construction Materials in January 2011; and John Mcpherson, our Senior Vice President for Strategy and Business Development, who joined us in October of 2011. John has over 15 years of experience with realigning and restructuring corporate organizations and cost structures. Danny Shepherd and John Mcpherson will lead the execution of the Profit Enhancement Plan. ", "Importantly, we've been engaged in dialogue with our shareholders and understand their concerns over the last few years related to our balance sheet and to our overhead cost structure. Now that our new ERP and Shared Services platforms are in place and the spending on those projects is now largely behind us and now that our restructuring announced in 2011 has been accomplished, we are focused on the profit enhancement actions announced today to help us address those concerns.", "Slide 6 provides additional information on how we get to the $100 million of profit enhancements: $75 million is from savings we will capture by leveraging our already robust procurement process to additional areas in production, technology, transportation and logistics; $25 million is by improving the efficiency of support functions, standardizing and simplifying workflows by fully leveraging Vulcan Shared Services structure and by retiring our legacy IT systems.", "Together, these actions will improve our profitability at current volumes and further enhance the company's already strong operating leverage. We estimate that the $55 million of run rate overhead reduction already in place, plus the Profit Enhancement Plan, as well as our ongoing cost actions in price leadership, will enable the company to generate EBITDA equal to our historical peak levels at volumes 25% lower than the historical peak.", "As we mentioned earlier, our SAG expenses for the year decreased by $38 million or 11% compared to the prior year. Going forward, we expect SAG costs to be approximately $270 million for the full year 2012.", "Turning now to Slide 7. The second part of the initiative we announced today is planned asset sales. This slide summarizes how this planned action reinforces our strategic focus. We will be selling assets that are not core to our strategy as the leading aggregates producer in the fastest growing regions and urban markets in the U.S. ", "The assets we expect to be divesting will be selected from among our ready-mix concrete and cement operations, which will increase our focus on our core Aggregates business and reduce our exposure to lower margin downstream market -- downstream products in some markets. It will also come from our surplus real estate parcels, allowing us to unlock the value of excess land in our portfolio. And also from certain aggregate assets that generate lower returns, allowing us to maintain our focus on higher growth markets.", "Again, these are valuable assets that are not central to our strategy. We expect the divestitures will provide net proceeds of approximately $500 million. We will use the proceeds to reduce debt, improving our overall credit profile.", "We will focus on optimizing the value of these assets as a disciplined seller in a disciplined process by divesting these assets over the next 12 to 18 months. Importantly, these actions will also enhance our longer-term earnings growth profile, margins and return on capital employed. ", "We have a long history of continuously attempting to improve our product and geographic portfolio of assets and pursuing our strategy of being a leading aggregates producer in the higher growth markets in the U.S. In pursuit of this strategy, in 2011, we sold 4 quarries in northern Indiana. We divested ready-mix assets in Arizona and New Mexico and completed a swap transaction that enabled us to redeploy capital to more attractive businesses and markets. We also continued the sale of surplus real estate in California and other regions.", "Moving on to our outlook for 2012. Slide 8 presents our objectives. In Aggregates, we expect price growth of 2% to 4% and same-store volume growth of 2% to 3%. We expect SAG costs, as I said, to be approximately $270 million for the full year in 2012. Finally, we expect 2012 EBITDA of approximately $500 million, including $25 million from the Profit Enhancement Plan and including impacts from the planned asset sales and the unsolicited exchange offer.", "We expect our full year segment earnings for each product line to improve in 2012. In Aggregates, the modest increase in volume and in freight-adjusted selling pricing should help improve earnings during the year. In terms of Asphalt earnings, we expect an increase as a result of higher pricing and modest growth in volumes. Ready-mix concrete pricing should also continue to improve, and we expect shipments to be roughly flat with last year. We also expect Cement earnings to approach breakeven levels in 2012.", "We also expect energy costs, specifically diesel fuel and liquid asphalt, to approximate the full year levels of 2011. As you know, we have a long record of paying competitive dividends. The actions announced today will provide our Board of Directors with flexibility to restore competitive dividends. Finally, capital spending in 2012 should be approximately $100 million. ", "Now just briefly, I want to share our perspectives on the market. Overall, we think it's prudent to take a conservative view of the market given the gradual pace of recovery so far. That being said, we are encouraged with recent developments on a number of fronts. We have seen a rising level of support in Washington for meaningful legislation to address the nation's crumbling infrastructure as President Obama described the situation in his State of the Union address. ", "The President singled out the vital importance of rebuilding our infrastructure as a way to grow the economy and restore jobs. The President's budget proposal, released Monday, calls for a 6-year transportation infrastructure investment of $476 billion, with $305 billion of that amount for the federal highway program and an additional $50 billion investment in FY '12 to inject funds in the transportation programs now. ", "The President is also continuing to call on Congress to pass a new multiyear transportation bill. Such bills have tended to pass when presidents are strong advocates and when congressional leadership rolls up its sleeves and gets to work. That is what is happening now in Congress where we have seen a number of positive developments over the last year. ", "The 6-month highway funding extension signed in September 2011 include annualized contract authority essentially in line with the 2011 funding level. Notably, leaders in Congress from both parties have ended up working together over the last year to maintain highway funding at or very near current levels at a time of dramatic proposed cuts in many other areas of the federal budget.", "The first appropriation bills for FY '12, which Congress passed in November of '11, included FY '12 appropriations for highways at $41 billion, essentially even with the last 2 fiscal year funding levels, underscoring the agreement reached by both House and Senate, Republican and Democratic leadership that the highway funding for the new fiscal year would not be reduced. This is quite a change from early and mid-2011 when some House Republicans were aggressively advocating cuts of up to 35% to the federal highway program.", "I am proud of the leading role our company has played in helping bring about this change, holding personal meetings with Republican leadership and key conservatives in Congress throughout the spring and summer, demonstrating the devastating impacts on the economy of their states as such cuts were implemented and testifying for the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee and in meeting altogether with more than 200 members of Congress and staff over the year. In addition, our employees have made more than 6,000 grassroots contacts with members of the Congress during the year, emphasizing the importance of maintaining current highway funding levels while Congress work toward ultimate passage of a new multiyear bill.", "Both Senate and House leaders made it clear in the fall of 2011 that they intended to move a highway bill in 2012. This week, both Chambers of Congress began debating their surface transportation bills on the floor of the House and the Senate and are set for continuing work on their respective bills following the President's Day recess next week. ", "As I'm sure you noted, the Senate bill was reported out of the Environmental and Public Works Committee in a bipartisan 18 to 0 vote. Last Thursday, the Senate voted 85 to 11 to proceed with consideration of the Senate surface transportation bill. And as I said, it is on the floor of the Senate even as we speak. ", "This is real progress. Even if the 2 chambers do not vote pass and then successfully conference a highway bill before the expiration of the current extension, we have seen more progress in the last 6 months than at any time since the expiration of the SAFETEA-LU in 2009 and the stage is set for ultimate passage of a bill. In the meantime, Congress has created a clear path to level consistent funding with its 2012 appropriation for federal highways.", "Moving now to private construction. While overall private construction has remained at historically low levels, there are some indications of improvement in certain categories. In residential construction, single-family housing starts remain at historically low levels. Multifamily starts, on the other hand, have increased sharply throughout 2011. ", "Private nonresidential construction has also remained at low levels. However, trailing 12-month contract awards are up across the U.S. for the fourth quarter in a row. The growth in contract awards in the manufacturing sector has remained strong since late last year and awards for new projects in the categories of retail and office buildings have increased modestly for the third consecutive quarter. While the recent growth in contract awards is encouraging, we believe employment growth, as well as an increase in business investment and lending activity, is necessary to sustain a recovery in nonresidential construction activity.", "Finally, I wanted to take a moment to briefly discuss Martin Marietta's unsolicited exchange offer. As you know, on December 12, Martin Marietta commenced an unsolicited exchange offer to acquire all outstanding common shares of our company at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.5 shares of Martin Marietta common stock for each share of Vulcan common stock. After a very thorough and careful review, and in consultation with our independent financial and legal advisors, our Board of Directors unanimously determined that the Martin Marietta exchange offer is inadequate and not in the best interest of our company and our shareholders. ", "Among the reasons our board rejected this offer are that it substantially undervalues Vulcan. It fails to compensate Vulcan shareholders for our stronger operating leverage and our asset portfolio, and it would not enhance shareholder value. In fact, we believe that Vulcan shareholders have more upside on a standalone basis.", "Since making its offer, Martin Marietta has not provided any new information to change our view. Accordingly, we continue to recommend that shareholders not tender any shares to Martin Marietta. We remain focused on accelerating our profit growth by further improving our operating leverage, reducing overhead cost, strengthening our credit profile, all of which will allow our board to restore a meaningful dividend. ", "Our leadership team is stronger and more focused than ever and committed to creating value for our shareholders. I know there will be some questions on the Martin Marietta offer, but we hope that you focus on our improved overall results, our outlook for 2012 and the exciting new initiatives we announced today, which is our primary focus.", "With that, I will now turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  And our first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall, RBC.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to talk about the cost saving announcements. How should we think about the $55 million in savings that's been achieved and the $100 million that comes after that? And just for model purposes, are these going to be discrete measures that you've taken or is this more of a continuous process? And what can you tell us about the timing and the source of the savings?", "Donald M. James", "Bob, the $55 million is fully in place. It includes $25 million that we took out during the course of 2011 and an additional $30 million on the restructuring that was announced in December, which will be essentially fully in place by the end of this month, so that is a separate number. That includes -- it's virtually all overhead, including both SAG categories and general production overhead categories. The $100 million in profit improvement comes from a significantly different focus. It is leveraging the opportunities we have with our new ERP and Shared Services program and extending and leveraging our existing procurement program to additional goods and services over a broad range of activities. We expect to get $25 million of earnings or EBITDA in 2012 from this project, an additional $75 million in 2013 and the full $100 million by 2014. All of that is incremental to the $55 million of overhead reductions already in place.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's very, very helpful. Just one other question. You are talking about, and I just want to make sure my math is right, getting to EBITDA of $1.3 billion based on 225 million tons annually. Can you comment on your degree of conviction that you can actually get that much EBITDA if you get to 225 million tons? And in tandem with that, can you give us a better idea of cash margin per ton versus where you are compared to the last cycle on the upside?", "Donald M. James", "With respect to the getting back to peak EBITDA levels, given our enhanced profitability in our Aggregates business since the peak of the last cycle, I think we are about $0.85 per ton in cash margin above where we were at the peak of the last cycle. With the Profit Enhancement Plan we've announced today and with continuing improvement in our Aggregates business and some improvement in our other segments, we are confident that we can get our peak EBITDA levels at 25% below the peak volume levels that we experienced in the 2005, 2006 timeframe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace of Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "The first thing I was just hoping to ask is on the underlying profitability of the Aggregates business. Don, I think in your numbers you outlined revenues up 16, profits were up something like 22. It looked like pricing was probably $4 million. But could you give us a bridge to kind of how you got to those incrementals and how we should think about that for 2012?", "Donald M. James", "We had, as I indicated, substantial improvement in all of our productivity measures, labor, every productivity. We track, 8 or 10 key operating metrics at all of our plants, and we improved every one of them. I will also say, and though it doesn't directly go to margin improvement, our safety, health and environmental performance at our plants reached record levels. We had the best year in history in the safety performance at our plants and the environmental performance at our plants, all of which works together. The earnings improvement was the pickup of 3% volume in the quarter really helped move the needle. We have so much leverage to volume that even modest increases in volume really help drive earnings, along with the improved efficiencies that we had throughout our system.", "Daniel Sansone", "Ted, this is Dan. There was also a reference in the press release to about $7 million of certain charges that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 that didn't reappear in the fourth quarter of 2011. So about $7 million of that earnings bridge is the absence of some of those somewhat unusual items that burdened the last year's -- or 2010's fourth quarter numbers as well, and those were mainly inventory adjustments and things like that.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then, on this topic, we would normally talk about kind of 60% flow-through rates in Aggregate; clearly a much better performance this quarter. Are you revising kind of what we should think about coming from normalized incremental as we get the volume?", "Donald M. James", "I don't think so, Ted. I think we've said that's -- putting aside the Profit Enhancement Plan, but looking at -- we've always said the 60% flow-through, you have to look at over the course of a full year, individual quarters are going to move up and down. But I think the Profit Enhancement Plan can expand that. But on a regular basis, I don't -- I wouldn't expand other than as you build the Profit Enhancement Plan into those models.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second one that I just wanted to touch on quickly is, and there are sure to be a lot of other questions on this, on the divestitures. Don, you said kind of ready-mix concrete, then cements, then downstream -- I'm sorry, surplus real estate and then aggregates after it. Is that the order in which we should think about the prioritization of monetizing these assets?", "Donald M. James", "Ted, we have a basket of assets we would consider selling. We don't need to sell the whole basket. We can sell a subset of the basket. We are looking for the best values for our company to achieve the best prices and the best impact on our bottom line. So we will look at various assets across that spectrum, and determine where we ought to move forward.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And you mentioned that could enhance, I think, earnings and cash flow and the turns. Could you give us a sense for what the EBITDA contribution might be for -- just to think about what the hit would be on the P&L side if you were to sell $500 million of assets? And then I'll jump back in queue.", "Donald M. James", "Well, as you can tell, our Concrete segment as a whole has negative earnings. Our Cement segment is close to breakeven. Our excess land doesn't generate earnings. It has some marginal carrying costs in terms of taxes and other things. We don't -- it really -- the answer to your question depends on the basket -- which of the basket of assets we ultimately end up selling. It could be positive; it could be negative; it could be neutral. We are really looking for the best deals we can find. So I don't think we have an assessment of that at this point.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So to arrive at the $500 million of value, I'm just curious kind of what metrics will you be based off of. I mean, land has an intrinsic value. You\u2019ve got to look at the full cycle profitability of a concrete plant. But I'm just wondering how do we get to $500 million in value of those assets, given the cash profile -- the earnings profile.", "Donald M. James", "Well there are, as I said, a much larger value of assets than $500 million that we will consider. Our valuations are always based on discounted cash flows over a period of years. And that's the basis that we will go forward. We believe there are some assets in our portfolio that are probably significantly more valuable to other people than they are to us, because they would have synergies. For example, someone with excess cement capacity might be very interested in additional concrete assets. That's just one example.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "First question is on your $500 million EBITDA guidance for 2012. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand what the volume guidance we should be using in that forecast? Is it the, like-for-like volume guidance? Or is it the total of volume guidance x assumed asset sales?", "Donald M. James", "Well, the total volume change in our projection from '11 to '12 for Aggregates is 1% to 2%. On a same-store basis, as I said, that's 2% to 3%. So if you want to take 2011 volumes, add 1% to 2%, that's where we are. The aggregates we divested in 2011 versus the aggregates that we acquired in 2011, the aggregates we acquired are somewhat higher margin than the aggregates we divested. So there's some margin improvement impact to the shift from -- shift in markets in those transactions.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for clearing that up. And just 2 questions on the Profit Enhancement Plan. Just first off, are there any new incremental costs associated with implementing the plan? Or is it mainly just reaping the benefits from some of the initiatives you've undertaken over the last couple of years rolling off?", "Donald M. James", "I think the vast majority of what we expect will be -- and the numbers we've given you are net numbers. The $25 million improvement in 2012 is a net number. That is benefits minus cost. There will be some cost associated with it. John Mcpherson is here. John, do you have additional comments?", "John R. McPherson", "The thing to highlight is the $25 million of impact in '12 is net of cost in our forecast, and we do not expect major capital investments associated with the profit improvement.", "Donald M. James", "Okay. Those are largely behind us, both the cost and expense of getting there are largely behind us with ERP platform and the Shared Services platforms and the existing procurement platform. Not many of you followed us back in 1996 and 1997, but we reengineered our entire procurement process then; brought it up to a state-of-the-art process at that point. We will continue to update that and expand it, and that will help us significantly in Profit Enhancement Plan.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then the $75 million in improvement in cost of goods sold, I was wondering if you could break it down by segment, if you could give us some color how much is coming out of aggregates versus asphalt and ready-mixed cement.", "Donald M. James", "I'm not sure. What $75 million?", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "On Slide 6.", "Daniel Sansone", "$75 million, Gary, is the 2013 impact.", "Donald M. James", "Yes. The $75 million, that is largely procurement.", "John R. McPherson", "He\u2019s asking volume. I think that's my product lines. I would say roughly proportional to sales and size for the segments.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes, that's what I was looking for. And then just one more question on the dividend. You mentioned that the board is looking to reinstate a competitive dividend. So I was just wondering, Don, if you could just give us some color. What are some metrics that the board's going to look for to determine that indeed a higher dividend makes sense and maybe the timeframe in which we could look forward to perhaps a higher dividend coming back?", "Donald M. James", "Our board has always looked at cash earnings as a source for dividend payments. That is a very, very important issue for our board. We would very much like to get -- restore a dividend and continue to grow a dividend. We will take a look at that at the end of the first quarter. Again, we looked at it very carefully. As you know, in the fourth quarter of last year, we looked at it again in our most recent board meeting, and we'll continue to look at it very carefully as we move forward. But I think our board's view is we need to restore it sooner rather than later.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "And just as a follow-up to that. It wouldn't necessarily come after the debt repayment program as a result of the asset sales? It doesn't have to mutually exclusive from that?", "Donald M. James", "That is correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line Jack Kasprzak of BB&T.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Just back to the asset sales quickly, covered a lot of that. But I guess I wanted to ask, there are other announcements out about asset sales, notably CEMEX saying they might want to sell $2 billion by the end of this year. I mean, have you guys gotten \u2013 are you to the point where you've gotten a feel from the market? I mean, given the level of competition out there, how confident can you be that you'll get the value it \u2013 types of valuations that underpin that $500 million estimate?", "Donald M. James", "Jack, I think every asset we have in our basket, we have had people asking us to buy those over the last 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 years. So there's plenty of interest in them. I don't know where and what CEMEX is proposing to sell. But we believe that there will be significant buyers with, hopefully, significant synergies who will be interested in our assets that we have in our planned asset sales.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. The California volume increase is noteworthy to be sure, and you mentioned infrastructure projects. But is there anything else going on out in California that you -- that might be underpinning that sort of volume change? We've obviously had good weather here lately, but do you see any other signs of life out there in that market given it's so important to you, guys?", "Donald M. James", "California has a very robust highway program, and we are benefiting from that significantly. Other volumes in California have stabilized. The private sector volumes have stabilized albeit at low levels. But the big driver in California is highways. A lot of people don't really understand that or don't want to believe it because what they read about California's budget, there\u2019s a very robust highway program going on out there. We're benefiting from it substantially.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Is this true that their awards were up last year while the market was down, so that...", "Donald M. James", "And we get the benefits, Jack, of both aggregates and asphalt and to some limited extent in concrete in the infrastructure of the highway program in California. So we get the leverage from both asphalt, as well as aggregates.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And on residential construction, obviously bumping along low levels there, too. But in the last 2 or 3 months starts have picked up, mostly that's multifamily. But if you look at some of the homebuilder orders lately, they've been pretty good. Are you guys seeing builders move dirt and start to use aggregates again?", "Donald M. James", "A little bit. The big bump is in multifamily. While our outlook for U.S. starts, housing starts for 2012 is about 714, about 488 of that is single-family starts, which is a very low number. As you know, multifamily has been the driver, and the multifamily is consuming heavy construction materials because it's not being built on existing developed lots. There's a little bit of lot development, but there's still a big inventory of developed lots. They may not be in the right place for homebuilders but \u2013 and so there is some incremental lot development, but it's still modest.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Betts of Jefferies.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Two questions, if I could, Don. Firstly, just on Q4, plus 3% on aggregate volumes. You highlight the big increases in California and the mid-Atlantic. Presumably, there were some regions where the volumes were down significantly. I mean, where were they is my question and is it primarily caused by weather? And then secondly, the thing that intrigued me on Slide 6, you have Plant Operations, Additional Opportunity. Is this just additional opportunity because you still could work it through? Or I mean, is that potentially a significant area of further profit enhancement?", "Donald M. James", "Mike, in terms of volumes, you are correct. Volumes from state to state and market to market varied significantly across our footprint from in the quarter, down 13% to, we said, up 40%. So it's very market-specific volume. And again, it's the fourth quarter and you can't -- the fourth quarter is so heavily influenced by weather. I think we had good weather in a lot of the eastern and southeastern U.S., which probably had some influence on volume. But there was a lot of work in infrastructure, particularly in highways, that we enjoyed in the quarter. Your second question was -- could you repeat that please?", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes. On Slide 6 where it talks about the Profit Enhancement Plan. It has Plants Operationals, Additional Opportunity. I'm trying to work out whether you\u2019re just kind of still working on that, whether it's just a small opportunity or whether potentially there are maybe tens of millions more to come from that.", "Donald M. James", "Well, that is certainly something we are working hard on and we'll pursue. We are not in a position to quantify a number there yet. As you know, if you have looked at our recent debt, our margin per ton and cost per ton, our margin per ton is substantially higher than our chief competitor and our cost per ton is substantially lower. We do think we've got opportunity for continued improvement. We'll get there, but I think we are more confident and have done more work to date on the other categories, but that doesn't mean we're not going to be pursuing improvement there. We have improvement in our Aggregates business built into our 2012 EBITDA projection. Some of that is price, a little bit is volume and a little bit is cost improvement. What we get in this project would be in addition to what we have built into our 2012 outlook, but we will update you on that as we go quarter-by-quarter through 2012.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just one final question, Don, if I could. You talked about ready-mix operations, maybe that would interesting to others who had cement. I mean, how much of your ready-mix is not vertically integrated?", "Donald M. James", "How much of our concrete or cement?", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Donald M. James", "Well, our concrete, we don't have cement in California. As I said, we have divested our concrete in Arizona and New Mexico. We do not have cement in Texas. We don't have cement in Maryland, Virginia and Washington D.C. The concrete we have in Florida and Georgia can be served by our cement plan in north Florida. We do have some cement swaps in place, but a significant portion of our concrete is not supplied directly at least by Vulcan cement.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So of the 4 million cubic yards, at least 3 of that wouldn't be supplied internally?", "Donald M. James", "I don't have that number in front of me, but that's in the ballpark. We have some very good concrete businesses that we don't supply with cement. We do supply the vast majority of our Concrete businesses with our own aggregates, and that will be a key issue for us in determining selling these assets is that we preserve the ability to supply the aggregates to the concrete businesses.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Two questions, and this is more operational-focused. When you look at your Aggregate margins in the fourth quarter, how much of the improvement were the result of your cost cutting initiatives, both that were ongoing and that were announced, versus better volumes and/or pricing? I'm not necessarily looking for specific dollar amount, but even on a percentage basis, broad buckets, whether it be half is cost cutting and half is other. But giving some clarity with that in Q4, theoretically should give some visibility on how we should think about it when modeling going forward.", "Donald M. James", "Kathryn, the majority of the improvement is as a result of operating leverage from the 3% higher volume, a little bit of price improvement and very good productivity efficiencies, both labor, fuel, explosives, other energy, electricity, not much from the overhead cost reduction that was in the fourth quarter aggregates improvement. Certainly, as we go forward, the $56 million of run rate -- $55 million of run rate, some of that will flow through and help aggregates. But I think fourth quarter was really operating leverage more than anything else.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Okay, great. When you look, obviously, there's been some mild weather that\u2019s helped a variety of different building materials and building product companies. How have your volumes trended in January and February? How much is this winter\u2019s mild weather helping to drive demand? And your experience in the past, when you've had milder weather in the winter, does that really pull forward much demand? So if you could really kind of reach back to prior years in operating, first answering how volumes trended in January, February. How much weather\u2019s been an impact and then in the past how much has mild weather really pulled forward demand from the spring?", "Donald M. James", "Certainly, in the end of the fourth quarter, we had favorable weather in a number of our markets. Our shipments were very strong in the latter part of the fourth quarter. Without being specific, that shipment trend has continued. How much of it is weather and how much of it is improvement in demand is always problematic to determine. But we are pleased with the 3% volume growth we had in the fourth quarter. And as we've indicated, we expect 2% to 3% volume growth for full year '12 on a same-store basis. How much pull forward there is or is not is very difficult for us to determine at this point.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "What about in just looking at prior years, because -- putting this into perspective, there have been some contacts that said, \"Listen, when you have very cold weather, a lot of the volume is just lost.\" And by the same token, with mild weather, it doesn't necessarily represent as much lost volume as you would think. It's really -- I'm just looking, in your stand...", "Donald M. James", "We don't think good weather in the first quarter is going to change the total demand outlook for full year 2012. It may move some volume around from one month to the next or from one quarter to the next, but it really is not going to be a factor. First quarter weather is not going to be a factor in full year demand. Sometimes fourth quarter\u2026", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.", "B.G. Dickey - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "This is actually B.G. Dickey sitting in for Trey. I'm just wondering if you guys could quickly go through some of your end markets and give us some idea of kind of what level of growth you're expecting in each in 2012. Just trying to get a sense of what's driving the volume growth expectation in aggregates in '12.", "Donald M. James", "As we look at our end markets, and these are Vulcan-served counties, at a macro level, we have highways -- shipments in the highways, and this is not Vulcan specific. This is demand in our end markets. Highway's down about 3%; housing, up 15%, but the vast majority of that being multifamily; non-res being up about 3%; infrastructure being down about 2%. And if you roll all that up, that's about a 1% to 2% increase in volume -- aggregate volume in our served markets. That doesn't say anything about market share or ability to serve particular projects or whether -- who will get the work and who has advantages and disadvantages based on the where it may be. But from a macro standpoint, that's our current outlook.", "B.G. Dickey - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just switching to pricing, aggregate pricing expectations. Your guidance, again, calls, I believe, for 2% to 4%.", "Donald M. James", "That's correct.", "B.G. Dickey - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Can you give us an idea kind of which markets that you serve you're expecting the highest growth? Or is this just more just kind of broad spread that you think it will be equal across all?", "Donald M. James", "I can assure you, it won't be equal across all markets. It never is and probably never will be. Some of it -- we pointed out in our comments, some of our strongest pricing in the fourth quarter came from Florida. We also had good pricing in the other markets I called out: Virginia, Texas, and Tennessee. So those are markets that were strong in the fourth quarter. As we look forward to 2012, those same markets seem to be relatively stronger, some shift, but both Florida and Texas should be good along with Tennessee. And perhaps some other markets, but we'll report on that as we go through the year.", "B.G. Dickey - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, you guys gave a lot of color and detail around -- in your prepared comments around the multiyear highway bill. And just very simply, I mean, can you guys handicap probability as far as actually thinking that a multiyear deal actually gets done for November? Or is it anybody's guess still?", "Donald M. James", "Well, I think the most important point is the commitment, we think, of both Houses and the administration that highway funding will be maintained under whatever legislative structure at the 41-ish kind of annual number. That's the most, I think, encouraging and the thing that we have the most confidence in, that we're going to see a continuation of highway funding whether by continuing the resolution or by a Senate bill or House bill. We think the funding levels through 2012 will remain at essentially current levels. Senate bill adds a little for inflation. So if the Senate bill were to pass, and be passed by the House as well, then there could be a slight uptick. We do not see the risk of cuts that we saw a year ago. I think the Senate bill has the best chance of passage. But to handicap it, it's very hard to say that we have high confidence that a multiyear bill will be passed by March 31. There certainly is a possibly, but I think the more important point is we do not see a scenario in which federal highway funding will be reduced.", "B.G. Dickey - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And do you have a preference on the 2-year bill versus the 5- or 6-year bill as far as -- like you're saying a Senate bill may be more dollars but it was generally our understanding that you would prefer more extensive bill in terms of years. What are your thoughts on that?", "Donald M. James", "Well the best proposal out there is the President's budget, which has like $51 billion per year for 6 years, plus $50 billion on top of that. Whether that has any political viability or not depends on who you talk to. But certainly, the Senate bill, I think having some certainty for 2 years or 1.5 years, as it will be by the time it would pass, is beneficial to state DOTs. But as long as there continues to be stable funding and an outlook for stable funding, I think that would be helpful. Obviously, we'd much rather have a 5- or 6-year bill. But at this point, I think that's problematic in being able to identify the funding source. As you know, the house is talking about oil and gas revenues from federal lands being dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund. We'd love to see that happen. That's got a lot of political angst associated with it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.", "L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Don, we're just talking about getting back to the peak levels of EBITDA on 25% fewer volumes. I'm just a little -- I just want to make sure I'm thinking around the Florida Rock deal well enough. What volume and EBITDA levels are those that you're thinking of?", "Donald M. James", "The EBITDA is about 1.35, 1.3, 1.35. The aggregate volume levels were about $294 million.", "L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it, perfect. And a lot of the rest of stuff that I had has come and gone. But on diesel, can you share with us what the cost and the gallons were in the fourth quarter and for the year?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. For the full year, Todd -- and our cost for diesel fuel is a blend of off-road and on-road, which is different than some other folks. We burn on-road diesel in our ready-mix operations as well as our trucking operations in Texas and Illinois. Our average cost, as we said for 2011, was up about 35.4% over 2010. And the average price throughout the year was $3.31 per gallon. So you can get to 2010 numbers by doing the math. We think it's going to be essentially flat for 2012, which is a big deal if that comes about. That 35% higher diesel fuel cost us $35 million in earnings. So if we can -- and that's been escalating, as you know, for the last 2 or 3 years. So if we can get stable diesel fuel prices, that will be a big benefit to us, as opposed to having them go up 35% as they did in 2011.", "L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Excellent. And I'm sorry, what were the volumes for the fourth quarter and for the year, the gallons?", "Daniel Sansone", "It's over 40 million gallons for the full year and just about 10 million for -- just under 10 million for the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes of SunTrust.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just on asset divestitures you spoke of earlier, can you at least tell us, in terms of the basket you're looking at, what kind of the EBITDA addition or the detraction that was in 2011?", "Donald M. James", "Well, if you look at our segment earnings in 2011 you can get up -- we don't report EBITDA -- we haven't reported EBITDA by segment, but I think if you look at the..", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I know where you're going. Let me ask...", "Donald M. James", "If you look at the earnings by segment, you see a loss in concrete; you see a small loss in cement. So selling those assets will improve our near-term profitability.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So that's my -- at least, my next question is on the table, getting completely out of those 2 segments, as part of this \u2013 if it goes to fruition.", "Donald M. James", "No, not necessarily. We don't need to sell all of our ready-mix and all of our cement by any stretch to get to $500 million.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So specifically, within concrete and those losses, you have businesses that are making money and others putting up really big losses. Is it that kind of makeup?", "Donald M. James", "We have very differing results by region in concrete.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And I guess, final question on this topic. We've been in this downturn for several years now, and you look back and see large losses specifically within concrete. Have you looked at this before and not do it for some reason? Or what's been the strategic thought over the last couple of years specifically within concrete?", "Donald M. James", "We have, as I've said in our remarks, we sold or divested in a transaction our ready-mix concrete business in Arizona and in New Mexico. Over the years, we have divested a lot of concrete assets that have come in acquisitions, along with aggregates. Concrete can be a good business, and it is a really good business for us in some markets. But concrete does not enjoy the same structural advantages of aggregates, primarily barriers to entry. And as a result of that, I think, concrete, over long periods of time, is a lower return, less profitable business than aggregates. Our obviously long-term strategic focus is on aggregates. That being said, there are some markets where the structural characteristics of concrete look more like aggregates, and we tend to do very well in those markets. And we -- so we're not, at this point, proposing to sell all the concrete assets. They are in the basket, but we will be very selective about what will make the most sense for us to sell.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rodny Nacier of KeyBanc Capital.", "Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I see energy inflation is flat in your forecast for 2012 EBITDA. Can you help me understand how much of a percent increase in energy do you think you can offset without impacting your target EBITDA number?", "Donald M. James", "That -- we're looking at energy in our -- as part of our strategic sourcing plan. We also are looking at energy efficiency in our planning. As I indicated in the fourth quarter and full year 2011, we were much more energy efficient, including diesel fuel efficiency, over 2010. We will continue those efforts. So it is a combination of trying to buy better, be more efficient in the utilization. I can't give you a specific answer to your question, but those are embedded in both our -- in our strategic sourcing focus and our transportation and logistics focus. All of those have energy and diesel fuel, and that will be -- that is a very large component of our total input cost and a place that we are going to be very focused in trying to improve our results.", "Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And with the profit plan, the $25 million that you expect to achieve in '12, I'm sorry if I missed this during the call, but can you help me understand how that's flowing through to the Aggregates business versus the downstream operations?", "Donald M. James", "It will flow through to all, but principally aggregates.", "Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And you had commented before on the $1.35 billion of EBITDA that you'd expect to achieve when you achieve your volume target. So I was wondering how much of that number is now tied to explicit cost actions that you've announced in 2011 and '12?", "Donald M. James", "Certainly, the cost actions we've announced in '11 and '12 will help us in that -- in reaching that goal. But the profitability improvement we have experienced over the last 3 or 4 years is the principal source of that opportunity. It will only be enhanced by the Profit Enhancement Plan we've announced today.", "Daniel Sansone", "Rodny, put a little differently, of the $55 million of overhead costs that we've announced, about $35 million or $37 million of that hits full year impact in 2012. The rest -- most of the remainder was already realized in 2011.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh of Stifel Nicolaus.", "John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And just quickly here. California in '11 represented roughly what percentage of your aggregate mix, number one? And number two, if you were to  separate out, in California, the private nonpublic piece in '12, how do you see the public infrastructure highway spend in California year-over-year '12 versus '11?", "Donald M. James", "My guys are doing some calculations to try to answer your question. I think our outlook is for continued infrastructure spending, primarily highway spending, in California in 2012. We had a good year, obviously, in 2011, but there's still a number of projects moving forward. California is about 13% of our aggregates shipments. It's a larger portion of our revenue because we have a significant Asphalt business in California, as well as ready-mix concrete. So in aggregates, it's 13% of our shipment.", "John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So based on the spending plans that you know of, are you comfortable saying public spend will be up in '12 versus '11 in California?", "Donald M. James", "I think I was indicating we think it will continue to be strong. A lot depends on bid lettings as we go through the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of JPMorgan.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just looking for a little bit better understanding of what a highway bill with continuity in funding might mean for the highway and infrastructure business, and this is going to be somewhat theoretical. But if you do get a bill this year and you do get continuity in funding for at least a couple of years, do you think that could result in growth in the infrastructure side of your business or at least the Highway side? And what magnitude of growth? I mean, how important is that level of visibility to the states? And can we see growth in a scenario where funding remains constant and to what extent?", "Donald M. James", "Clearly, a multiyear program gives visibility and confidence to states. Whether, I think, the impact -- if you have essentially level funding, a multiyear bill, even if it's only 2 years compared to continuing resolutions, probably just affects the timing of jobs and to some extent, the nature of the job. Shorter-term funding typically is used to support resurfacing and to some extent lane additions, whereas multiyear funding often results in large -- larger sort of new construction projects. But at the end of the day, it's really more of a timing between quarters and years rather than an absolute increase in demand, if I understood your question.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes. I guess maybe as a follow-on, I mean with that timing impact, could you see a pull forward into '13 in a scenario where you get pretty significant growth in 2013 if something gets passed this year?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. And that's a timing thing. If something passed this year, which would allow the state DOTs to go ahead and take from their existing backlog of projects and put them out for bids, then yes, it would change the timing and it would pull volume forward.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And then one follow-up really quickly on the residential. I think you suggested that the market residential construction, up 15%. On the single-family side, does that imply growth there? Is that positive in your view? Or is all that growth from multifamily?", "Donald M. James", "The vast majority is from multifamily.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Johnson of Morgan Keegan.", "J. Keith Johnson - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just real quick on the -- you had given us a little color earlier on kind of how your volumes, by end markets, stacked up for your 2012 outlook. Could you give us how 2011 finished when you look at it by infrastructure, residential that sort of thing in aggregates?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. Let me get my hands on the -- if we look at -- well, I have in front of me 2012 and the change. I don't have the '11 data in front of me, but you can get to by -- in essence, highways in '11 were 103% of where we think it\u2019s going to be in '12. Infrastructure is 102% of where we think it's going to be in '12. Housing was 85% in '11 of where we think it will be in '12. Non-res was 97% of where we think it'll be in '12. And overall, '11 was about 99% of where we think it'll be in '12. So I know we've got that data. I just don't have it in front of me. I just have the year-over-year change in end markets from '11 to '12. But you can get back into what '11 was.", "J. Keith Johnson - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right. Just real quick on concrete. I noticed a little bit of a sequential decline in selling price going from third quarter to fourth quarter. I'm just trying to get an idea. Was that just a mix issue or regional issue relative to -- or how we should trend that as we go forward?", "Donald M. James", "It's a mix issue. Concrete pricing is up. We expect it to continue to improve. But there's no significance to that.", "J. Keith Johnson - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then just final question, I want to make sure I'm thinking about this -- the comments around peak EBITDA on 25% less volume. If I look back into, I guess, kind of '06, '07, the, I guess, Concrete And Asphalt businesses, at that time, were decent contributors to performance relative of course to where they are in the depressed market today. Getting back to that peak EBITDA of around $1.3 billion on 25% less volume in Aggregates, what does that count in there for the downstream products? Or does it?", "Daniel Sansone", "It assumes that the downstream products recover -- the volumes of the downstream products recover similar to the growth in aggregates, but it does not assume that the downstream product ever achieve EBITDA margin levels equivalent to those that were achieved at the peak of the last cycle. Most of the leverage to get to the peak earnings faster is because of the enhanced profitability of the Aggregates business as it stands today, along with the better leverage on the overhead side.", "J. Keith Johnson - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And in that comment -- or outlook, could you assume any adjustments around that basket of assets for sale?", "Daniel Sansone", "No.", "Operator", "With no further questions, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Don James.", "Donald M. James", "Well, thank you, all, for being with us today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan. The primary theme I hope you heard from us today is that we are intensely focused on increasing our profitability and growth, delivering value to our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress at the end of the first quarter. Thank you so much, and have a good day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Vulcan Materials Company Earnings Conference Call. My name is Erica and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2012. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President for Construction Materials; and John McPherson, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business Development.", "We have posted to our website a short slide presentation that we will be referring to during the call. The slides are also available to those of you on the webcast.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Description of these risk and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS for continuing operations. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's first quarter 2012 earnings release and in the Investor Relations section of Vulcan's website at vulcanmaterials.com.", "I would now like to walk you through our first quarter results. As you saw in the press release we issued this morning, we began 2012 with another strongly improved quarter. Our results were substantially better compared to the first quarter of last year. ", "Net sales were approximately $500 million. This is a 10% increase from the first quarter of 2011. Although some of this year-over-year growth is attributable to milder weather, we also benefited from the continued recovery of our markets, particularly in the demand for Aggregates, combined with the strength of our market positions.", "Gross profit for the first quarter increased $29 million from the first quarter of 2011, reflecting sales growth in every segment and the favorable earnings effect of improved productivity and cost reduction. Gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 600 basis points from the same period last year.", "When making year-over-year comparisons of earnings and EBITDA, it's important to note a few items that impact these comparisons. One, the first quarter of 2012 included $10 million of cost related to Martin Marietta's unsolicited offer. Two, the first quarter of 2012 also included a $6 million gain on the sale of real estate in California. And three, in the first quarter of last year, the company received approximately $25.5 million in an insurance arbitration award for the recovery of settlement and legal cost related to a lawsuit settled in 2010. Excluding these items, EBITDA increased to $46 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $5 million of EBITDA in the prior year.", "Earnings from continuing operations, excluding the items I highlighted, were a loss of $0.42 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012 compared to a loss of $0.62 per diluted share in the same period last year. ", "Further enhancing operating earnings, SAG expenses decreased by $13 million or 17% compared to the prior year period. This decrease was due mainly to cost reduction initiatives undertaken in 2011. In addition, the Profit Enhancement Plan we announced in February is well underway, and will generate significant additional savings and profit enhancements.", "John McPherson will update you on that shortly. ", "Turning to our segment results on Slide 4, our Aggregate segment performed very well, reflecting continued market recovery and favorable weather. Segment revenues, which include sales to our Asphalt and Concrete businesses, increased approximately $24 million or roughly 7% from the prior year period. And gross profit increased $23 million.", "Aggregate revenues reflect stronger demand, including increased demand from our Asphalt and Concrete operations, as well as generally stable pricing. First quarter Aggregate shipments increased 10% from the prior year, and coupled with lower unit cost of sales, led to a sharp increase in Aggregates' gross profit margin. Shipments increased in almost all of our geographic markets. Our operations in California and Virginia continued their trend of achieving much stronger than average volume gains from the prior year.", "Our Aggregates businesses in 8 other states also achieved double-digit volume gains over the prior year's first quarter, most notably key states like Florida, Texas and Alabama. These increases were due mainly to large infrastructure project work, primarily highways, some improvement in private construction activity, as well as favorable weather conditions.", "Average freight adjusted selling price decreased by 1% in the first quarter due mostly to a less favorable product mix. ", "In the first quarter, above-average levels of lower priced products, including base stone and fill material, were shipped to large projects in Virginia. Excluding the fill material shipments, which are sporadic and infrequent relative to other sizes, first quarter pricing was flat with the prior year.", "Overall, we continued to see pricing stability across our markets. In the first quarter, more than half of our markets realized price improvement from the prior year, a trend that has continued for the last 4 quarters. ", "Importantly, Aggregates gross profit increased to approximately $34 million, reflecting the earnings effect of higher volumes and improved productivity, which contributed to lower unit cost of sales. This increase is more than triple the $11 million in Aggregates gross profit we recorded in the first quarter of 2011 and shows the favorable earnings impact of the operating leverage inherent in our business. This is also a continuation of what we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result, net sales have increased $73 million and gross profit has increased $53 million in the trailing 6 months ended March 31, 2012, compared to the prior period last year.", "Aggregates gross profit as a percent of segment revenues for the quarter increased by 640 basis points. Cash earnings per ton increased by 11% to $3.36.", "Helping to drive our first quarter results in Aggregates, we continued to pursue opportunities in plant operations, including executing a turnaround of specific underperforming facilities, increasing the exchange of operating practices and talent across geographies, and improving central service facility sharing across regions.", "Segment unit cost of sales decreased approximately 10% from the prior year due to increased productivity, cost-reduction initiatives and the operating leverage realized from higher volumes. All key labor productivity and energy efficiency metrics for Aggregates improved compared to last year's first quarter, more than offsetting an 11% increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel.", "For our Asphalt Mix segment, gross profit in the first quarter was a loss of less than $1 million, approximating last year's breakeven earnings. The average sales price for asphalt mix increased approximately 6%, offsetting most of the earnings effect of a 16% increase in liquid asphalt cost. The Asphalt Mix volume increased 3% from last year's first quarter.", "In Concrete, gross profit was a loss of $12 million compared to a loss of $14 million in the prior year. Ready-mixed concrete volumes increased 12% from the prior year. The average sales price increased 1% from the prior year, contributing to improved unit materials margin.", "Finally, Cement segment gross profit was $1 million, an improvement of $4 million from the prior year due to increased volumes and lower operating costs. ", "In total, gross profit for our non-Aggregate segments improved by $6 million, reflecting cost reduction initiatives.", "Turning now to Slide 5. We wanted to take a step back and review the significant progress Vulcan has made and continues to make in reducing cost. As you can see in this slide, our full year SAG expense reductions should further accelerate as a result of our cost savings initiatives and by leveraging our ERP and Shared Services platforms. By the end of 2012, Vulcan is on target to have reduced run rate SAG expenses by at least 32% since 2007.", "Spending for our new ERP systems peaked in 2010. We are now reaping the benefits, both in improved efficiency and in our ability to undertake the restructuring actions we announced last year, as well as pursuing the Profit Enhancement Plan.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to John McPherson who will provide a brief update on our Profit Enhancement Plan. John?", "John R. McPherson", "Thanks, Don. ", "Hey, now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to highlight the steady progress we've been making in the Profit Enhancement Plan that we announced in February. As you may recall, the Profit Enhancement Plan includes cost reductions and other profit enhancements to improve our run rate profitability as measured by EBITDA at current volumes by more than $100 million annually. Of that $100 million in profit enhancements, $25 million is expected to be achieved in 2012, $75 million is expected to be achieved in 2013, with the full run rate in place by mid-2013. And as a result, the full $100 million is expected to be achieved and hit the P&L in 2014.", "These enhancements are, and I'd like to underscore this, in addition to the $55 million in run rate overhead reductions achieved through our restructuring actions announced in 2011. ", "Of the $100 million in profit enhancements we expect to achieve through this initiative, $55 million should be derived from savings in sourcing, $25 million from G&A and support functions and another $20 million from transportation and logistics.", "I'd now like to give a brief update on progress in each of these 3 areas. ", "In sourcing, we have renegotiated vendor agreements and pricing for categories ranging from office supplies to mobile equipment. In addition, we have expanded the role of our professional procurement staff. We have strengthened certain procurement policies and programs, and we've taken steps to accelerate company-wide adoption of these programs.", "Initial actions have been taken to reduce spending related to outside services, a category that includes costs such as drilling and blasting, electrical, repair and maintenance, and landscaping. This category includes over $150 million in annual spending at the plant level. We will address other categories of procured goods and services over at least the next 2 quarters, and we remain fully committed to reducing the annual run rate spending on third-party goods and services by $55 million or more before mid-2013.", "In G&A, additional efficiencies have been identified in accounting, HR, IT, legal and other support functions. These efficiencies leverage our prior restructuring in ERP investments and include actions such as further standardization and simplification of administrative policies and practices, further consolidation of support activities to leverage the company's systems of scale, and further streamlining in automation of management processes and reporting.", "We implemented certain of these improvements during the first quarter and we'll implement others throughout the balance of the year. Again, we remain fully committed to reducing overhead costs by $25 million or more without negatively impacting our safety, environmental, customer service or sales performance.", "In the area of transportation and logistics, our transition to the 4-region structure has positioned the company to further optimize intermodal transportation decisions to better manage the deployment of rail cars and other assets, and to consistently assess and adopt best trucking practices across operating units.", "For each of our trucking, rail and marine operations, we have identified opportunities to reduce cost and increase revenues associated with our owned and contracted transportation assets. We remain on target to increase profits in this area by more than $20 million through our initiatives in -- over the next year.", "I'd like to note that across all of these areas, our employees at all levels of the business have demonstrated great ingenuity and commitment in managing costs smartly, while remaining focused on serving our customers and operating safely.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Thank you, John. Well, as John noted, we are very pleased with our progress over the last 2 months, and the organization is fully committed and engaged in the Profit Enhancement Program. We remain very optimistic that we will achieve our goals.", "Now if you turn to Slide 7, during the quarter, we also continued to execute on our Planned Asset Sales initiative, which was also announced in February. As previously disclosed, we'll be selling operations that are not core to our strategy. These are quality assets, many of which will have significant value to a number of potential purchasers. Thus far, we've been pleased with the level of interest and activity surrounding the process. The divested assets will include ready-mixed Concrete and Cement operations, nonstrategic Aggregates assets and real estate.", "This initiative is in line with our strategy to focus our capital on higher return, higher growth Aggregates positions, optimize our exposure to downstream businesses and unlock value of real estate from our portfolio.", "We have completed similar transactions in the past in states like Virginia, Indiana, New Mexico, Arizona and others. We are focused on optimizing value as a disciplined seller, and we continue to expect this initiative will generate net proceeds of approximately $500 million by mid-2013.", "Importantly, these actions will enhance our longer-term earnings growth profile, margins and return on capital employed as demand for our products improves with the economic recovery.", "Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Don.", "Donald M. James", "Thanks, Danny. ", "If you will turn with me now to Slide 8. Sentiment is spreading that the worst of this economic downturn is behind us. This view appears to be supported by the U.S. contract awards for new construction projects, particularly in private construction, which bodes well for continued demand recovery in our high-growth markets.", "Multi-family housing starts have remained strong, growing now for 17 consecutive months. Trailing 12 months single-family housing starts turned positive in the first quarter of 2012 on the back of higher starts reported in recent months.", "As of March of 2012, the year-over-year change in trailing 12-month contract awards for private nonresidential construction has remained positive for the last year. This positive trend is driven by growth in contract awards for commercial and retail building. Additionally, trailing 3-month awards for Vulcan-served states are up 10% versus other states, which are down 12%. This is another positive indicator for continued demand recovery in our high growth markets.", "Finally, private non-highway infrastructure projects, mainly power-related projects, have been positive, although very lumpy due to the large scale and scope of these projects, which can consume large quantities of Aggregates.", "Trailing 12-month contract awards in Vulcan-served states are up 34% compared with other states, which are down 27%.", "On the public side, contract award activity has been mixed. Trailing 12-month awards for non-highway infrastructure projects are down 2% versus the prior year. In highways, trailing 12-month awards for the period ending March 2012 were $51.4 billion, down 11% from the prior year, reflecting the absence of $7.5 billion in stimulus-related project awards from last year.", "Prospects for the next federal highway bill are improving. At this time, we are operating under a 90-day extension at current funding levels. Last week, the House of Representatives passed by a wide and bipartisan margin, additional legislation designed to expedite a House-Senate conference on a new highway bill. This follows the bipartisan passage of the Senate highway bill earlier in the spring. It is the stated intention of both the House and Senate leadership to resolve their differences on the highway bill and produce a conference agreement before the end of the current extension that avoids additional disruption in the Federal Highway Program.", "Just this week, Senate and House leaders have announced the members of the conference committee that will focus on reconciling the Senate bill with the House proposals. It is a streamlined conference committee, notably smaller than was the case with SAFETEA-LU, and it is composed of a number of strong highway program proponents from both parties and from both the House and the Senate. We, along with a broad coalition of stakeholders including unions, highway users, industry and state and local government officials are urging Congress to reach agreement on this new bill as quickly as possible to facilitate a recovery in construction activity.", "Turning now to Slide 9. For 2012, we continued to expect earnings in each of our segments to improve from the prior year due to continued growth in volumes, higher pricing and reduced cost. We now expect that total aggregate shipments will increase by approximately 2% to 4% based on our strong performance in the first quarter and solid demand levels. We have adjusted our full year freight-adjusted pricing for Aggregates to reflect the impact of the product mix shift in the first quarter. As a result, we now expect aggregate pricing to increase by 1% to 3% for the full year.", "In addition, Aggregates segment unit cost should be lower than in 2011 due to improved productivity, restructuring of overhead support functions and the implementation of the Profit Enhancement Plan. As a result, Aggregate segment earnings are expected to improve substantially from 2011. ", "Asphalt earnings are expected to increase due to higher pricing and modest growth in volumes. Ready-mixed Concrete pricing should continue to improve and shipments should increase modestly from the prior year, contributing to an improvement in earnings.", "Cement earnings should approach the breakeven levels in 2012.

We also continue to expect 2012 EBITDA of about $500 million, including $25 million related to the Profit Enhancement Plan and approximately $29 million in gains for 2 real estate transactions that were initiated in 2011 prior to the announcement of the Planned Asset Sales that are not part of that program.", "Our full year EBITDA guidance excludes impacts from Planned Asset Sales and costs associated with the unsolicited offer.", "We continue to expect capital spending in 2012 to be approximately $100 million.", "In summary, we had a much better first quarter and our outlook for the year remains favorable.", "Moving to Slide 10, I should note that in addition to delivering strong improvements in our financial results for the last 2 quarters, we also recorded the best safety and health performance in the history of our company in 2011. ", "And our environmental performance resulted in the lowest number of environmental citation since 1999, when we were a very much smaller company. We take pride in our safety record, which is among the best in the industry, but we are always looking to improve. Our performance last year is a testament to the focus and professionalism of our employees and their commitment to maintaining a safe work environment.", "Finally, before taking your questions, I wanted to take a moment to briefly comment on Martin Marietta's offer. Vulcan has been and continues to be open to transactions that create value for our shareholders. The long history of discussions between Vulcan and Martin Marietta demonstrates our willingness to explore potential value-adding strategies. However, we will not agree to a transaction that dilutes Vulcan's shareholder value. And put simply, we do not believe that Martin Marietta's offer reflects the intrinsic value of Vulcan's assets or would create value for our shareholders. It doesn't compensate our shareholders for Vulcan's strong operating leverage, which we believe should continue to drive strong performance as our markets recover. The benefits of this leverage are clear in the results we announced today. Nor does Martin's offer compensate Vulcan shareholders for the benefits of our Profit Enhancement Plan, which is delivering real, tangible results for Vulcan shareholders. In addition, the offer would enable Martin Marietta shareholders to capture a significant portion of the value that our ongoing initiatives are creating. We believe this is value that belongs to Vulcan shareholders.", "Finally, the significant divestitures that may be required by the Department of Justice to complete a transaction will erode value that belongs to Vulcan shareholders and add great uncertainty to the Martin Marietta offer. ", "Accordingly, we continue to recommend that shareholders not tender any shares to Martin Marietta. We remain focused on shareholder value. We are executing our initiatives to generate higher levels of earnings and cash flow, improve our operating leverage, reduce overhead costs, strengthen our credit profile and restore a meaningful dividend as rapidly as possible. ", "And if Vulcan decides to pursue a value-enhancing transaction, whether with Martin Marietta, one of its competitors or none of the above, it is Vulcan's board, which has undivided loyalty to Vulcan and its shareholders, and not Martin Marietta's hand-picked nominees that should be negotiating on Vulcan's behalf.", "I know many of you have an interest in Martin Marietta's offer. But we hope that you will focus today on our results, on our outlook for 2012, and on the initiatives we have in place to further enhance our performance and shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn it back to the operator to begin Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "And our first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Don, I apologize if I missed it, but I wanted to come back and revisit the highway contract awards. We tracked the data and I guess we've noticed a pretty sharp decline, certainly January, February, improvement on a relative basis in March. But I guess the way we tracked it across your 10 states, I have it down 12% on a trailing 12-month average basis. It's your forward contracts on highways, just federal highways. But I'm wondering if -- are we missing something? Or is there anything that's gone on that might explain the really sharp decline of January, February this year?", "Donald M. James", "Ted, I think if you look at the year-over-year change in highway contract awards from the stimulus funding, that accounts for virtually all or maybe more than all of the difference year-over-year. Those stimulus projects are still largely under construction, but the contract awards coming from stimulus money have virtually come to a halt. Because that -- the contract award part had deadlines, but as you know, there are still many, many stimulus projects under construction.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Sure. Do you think there was any impact from the uncertainty on the highway bill and now that we've got the CR signed?", "Donald M. James", "Absolutely. I think the DOTs are not willing to award new contracts till they see some more certainty in the Federal Highway Program. We work very closely with the Association of State Highway Transportation Officials and they are, as I indicated, lobbying as hard as we are to convince their congressmen and senators from all of their states that we need to quit quibbling and get something in place that will allow the state DOTs to move forward with the backlog of projects.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And so as you guys kind of look at April and the trends you've noticed that you might be willing to talk about through this month, is it your sense that contract awards are starting to improve on that basis? And then I was wondering if you could also just talk about pricing that you've seen, March versus April.", "Donald M. James", "I haven't seen any April contract award data yet, so I really can't comment on that. Pricing, our guidance for pricing for the full year is up 1% to 3%. That's down a notch from our guidance beginning earlier in the year. And that's really because of 2 or 3 big large projects where we sold some, essentially, by-product or fill product at relatively low prices to some large construction projects, particularly in Virginia. So it's really on that basis that we ratcheted down our pricing assumption for the full year. But as I said, there is stability in pricing in the sense that we don't have wide swings from -- and price changes from market to market. And we're optimistic that we'll be able to report price improvement as the year moves forward.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, that's really helpful. The last thing I was hoping to ask you or Danny is on the asset sales. And I know Danny reaffirmed confidence and the slide deck said that you can get $500 million announced by the middle of 2013. Just given the progress you've had to date on that process, should we look for this to come in chunkier transactions? Will there be more kind of one-off transactions? And any more color you might provide on the process would be super.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "I think the way I would answer your question, Ted, is some of it would be one-off transactions, but we do have a combination of ready-mixed assets or assets that could be sold in a single transaction. I will add that we are encouraged or we're early in the process, but the interest that we're receiving from interested parties has been very, very encouraging, and hopefully, we'll have something positive to report in the near future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.", "L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I had a handful of questions, but let's stick on that question about mix there for a second and the big projects in Virginia and other places. I mean, is this the kind of thing that you expect to persist for a little while? This sort of newly -- I think, you described that the volumes of those products is above average.", "Donald M. James", "I think this is -- the contract awards indicate that private sector construction is well on its way to recovery, office buildings and other large private construction. These sales in Virginia were to large, private construction projects, manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities. But the kind of material we sold in the first quarter is really sort of a one-off. That's not a routine part of our business. We'll, in the course of production, put finds aside and then a big project will come along and take several hundred thousand tons for one project. And that's what happened in the first quarter. I don't see that being a continuing trend, if I'm understanding your question.", "L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "No, that was the question. And this -- and thanks to that. I did have one -- I was going to follow up and ask if that was a private job or a highway job, so it's interesting that it was on the private side. To the extent you can tell, and I'm sure it's probably hard given the lumpiness of the transactions, but can you tell what the price trend on that sort of lower-priced material is? I mean, is it pretty aggressively bid right now or is the price for that product sort of firm enough?", "Donald M. James", "Well, it's just a very low-priced product. I mean, it's a fraction of our average selling price. That's why I pulled the reported freight-adjusted selling price down to minus 1%. Absent that, we were flat. We certainly believe we'll have opportunities through the year in our normal product mix, normal geographic mix, that we'll see pricing improvement as the year moves on.", "L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. On that point, last year, around midyear, I guess, there were price increases in Aggregates put through in a lot of places, driven by the increase in diesel cost. Obviously, diesel\u2019s back up again this year. I mean is there any outlook to kind of go for a second round, if we can think about it that way, this summer?", "Donald M. James", "Well, certainly, higher diesel costs support higher Aggregate pricing for at least 2 reasons. One is it increases production costs in the plants, and secondly, it increases delivery cost, which shrinks the shipping radius, and therefore, gives an individual quarry typically more pricing power. The -- our full year -- the big increase in diesel cost occurred second half of last year. And as I -- as we indicated, we think diesel cost increases for full year 2012 will be in the 5% to 10% range, which will be substantially lower increase than we saw last year. But nevertheless, they're still up. Most of our cost elements are down. Our labor productivity is better. Our energy, our electricity consumption and energy conversion is better. So we're doing -- our guys in the plants are doing a super job on cost management and cost control. The one place we have higher cost is in diesel fuel. I believe it was up 11% in the quarter over last year's first quarter. But we're offsetting that with other productivities. So if we get some moderation in diesel fuel cost, it will certainly help us as the year moves forward.", "L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. On the activity in D.C. with the conference committee around the highway bill, can you kind of walk us through what you're hearing? I mean obviously, there's -- in terms of the annual funding level, I guess the House and the Senate have been pretty close to one another barring recent...", "Donald M. James", "Which is stable, stable to up slightly.", "L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Right. But there's been a spread there on -- in terms of the duration and in terms of how to pay for it. Do you have any -- is there any conversation as to how they might bridge the gaps there?", "Donald M. James", "Well, as you know, the Senate, the Senate EPW Committee reported its bill out 18 to 0, all Democrats, all Republicans fully aligned. It had offsets from other spending cuts of $12 billion plus or minus, which funded, in addition to the regular Highway Trust Fund and the receipts in the Highway Trust Fund, it fully funded the Senate bill through the end of FY '13. The House bill, really wasn't a bill. It was something that was passed by leadership in order to get to a conference committee. There is no funding mechanism per se in the House side. The -- I think as we read the tea leaves, you have a lot of Democrats, in both the House and the Senate, willing to support the Senate bill. You've got Senate Republicans, by and large, supporting the Senate bill, and you have a substantial portion of House Republicans, including all the leadership who, I think, will coalesce around the Senate bill. The problem, of course, are the same group that's opposed to a lot of other things in the House. But our view is that the leadership in both House and the Senate is committed to getting this thing passed so it is not an issue in the election. And in order to do that, they need to do it by June 30. And they seem to be fully committed to doing that. You've got the Keystone Pipeline in the House bill that's not in the Senate bill. We don't know where that goes, but that's really not relevant, of course, to highway funding, at least directly. So we're probably more optimistic today than we've been in several years that something is about to happen with respect to a formal highway bill, albeit, probably only through the end of FY '13 at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "First question is for John. I was wondering if you could identify how much of the $25 million in the Profit Enhancement program for 2012 has been realized so far. Maybe it's a little bit too early to see the full benefit, obviously, but can you identify how much was in the first quarter numbers?", "John R. McPherson", "It is a bit early to figure out exactly how much of the first quarter and to hit the first quarter numbers, but let me answer you this way. We are well on track to the $25 million target for the current year. A number of those actions have not only been identified but are already put into place. The only thing that's slightly difficult in the first quarter is tracking how much each one has hit the P&L so far. That will become much easier in the second quarter. And that's simply a function of things like renegotiating vendor contracts or certain other internal practice changes that take some time to flow through our operations and hit the P&L. It's a timing question, that's all. But we are very much on track for the big goals that we've set.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So we should see maybe a more concrete number after the second quarter?", "John R. McPherson", "I think so. And I think with each quarter succeeding that also.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Great. And then just my last question, just for clarification. The $6 million in asset gains, is that part of the $29 million that you had identified as part of your EBITDA?", "Donald M. James", "It is.", "John R. McPherson", "Yes, it is.", "Donald M. James", "That is a -- that's the sale of a parcel of the California real estate. We have another parcel of California real estate for about $23 million in gain, which accounts for the $29 million that's in the $500 million of EBITDA for the year. But those are outside the Planned Assets Sales group because those things were well underway last year.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes, that makes sense. And then, I guess just looking at the cash flow statement, there was about $17.9 million in net gain of sale property. Can you just provide a bit more color what that was?", "Daniel Sansone", "Garik, the biggest piece of that is the cash payment we received on the earn-out from the sale of our chemicals business. That was about $12 million or $13 million that came in the first quarter. Under the accounting rules, the payment of that earn-out gets categorized on the cash flow statement as cash proceeds from the sale of the business even though we actually sold the business in 2005. We have one more year under that earn-out, so there should hopefully be a payment in the first quarter of 2013, then that will go way.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Great.", "Donald M. James", "And that flows through discontinued operations.", "Daniel Sansone", "The income effect of it flows through discontinued ops.", "Donald M. James", "It's not in our continuing ops.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rodny Nacier with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Thanks for the update on the federal funding picture. Looking more at the local level, muni bond issues across the state, they increased about 60% in the first quarter. And that was up 100% for transportation. From your perspective, are those capital raises offsetting declines in other revenue sources? Or are they adding to state and local budgets? And when could we see that start to trickle through to your business?", "Donald M. James", "Well, I think the way many state and local governments, but particularly states, are now funding really critical highway needs are through bond issues. California, obviously, has been doing that for several years now. And as I indicated, our volumes for going into highway construction in California have been strong for several consecutive quarters. As you go state-by-state, I think we are seeing states, in many cases, not all, but in many cases, stepping up to address the lack of certainty in federal funding, and they are doing that through municipal bond issues. As you know, 100% of the proceeds of bond issues have to go to capital projects. They can't be used for operating. So it's virtually all construction. Every dollar from bond issues goes into some form of capital project, the vast majority of that being construction, whether it's highways or water and sewer or transit or public buildings. But that's a very positive sign. Whether -- and I -- you probably see the Rockefeller numbers, but state and local tax receipts, I think, are now back to where they were at the peak of the last cycle, which is helping. That\u2019s certainly -- not every state and local government is that way, but on balance, on average, that's improving. And I think we'll probably see a slightly larger proportion of highway work being funded by state and local sources than we have seen over the last 3 or 4 years.", "Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I mean with some of the strength then that we're seeing just from the state and local funding sources, did it diminish, in your perspective, the lack of agreement coming out of D.C. around the federal funding picture?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. I think on balance, a driver for many states is that they have needs. And there's not enough money coming out of the federal program to meet those needs, and the states are coming up with their own funding mechanisms, and it's all over the board to try to address the infrastructure needs in those locations, particularly highway congestion and poor highway conditions.", "Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And you mentioned California. And we've seen for several quarters now, you've had some strength in that state. Focusing on your Asphalt business, which I believe is mostly in California as well, you're expecting modest volume growth this year and volumes only grew modestly last year. When can we start to see perhaps some acceleration in demand for your Asphalt business out of California, given some of the strength we've seen on the Aggregates side?", "Donald M. James", "Well, our Asphalt business in California has continued to grow. It hasn't grown as fast as our Aggregates business, but certainly, it has been growing over time. But the big, as you point out, the big jump in demand has been in Aggregates and -- but a corresponding growth in Asphalt. We have a very good Asphalt business in California. I don't -- we're not projecting a large growth in volume in California this year, but we certainly believe that we will improve our material margins there as our pricing for asphalt mix begins to catch up with the higher costs of liquid asphalt that we have incurred over the past 9 months or so.", "Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I have one last question, then I'll jump back in queue. The $500 million EBITDA number, would that compare to the $46 million adjusted this quarter or the $42 million GAAP?", "Donald M. James", "I think the $40 million -- yes, if you take the $46 million and add back the $6 million real estate gain, that's in the $500 million.", "Daniel Sansone", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. On Asphalt, your guidance is looking for improved profitability there. Are the price increases in place now to kind of start to kind of catch up with what we've seen in liquid asphalt? Or how quickly should we expect to see kind of pricing catch up there with those costs?", "Donald M. James", "Well, we, certainly, as we are bidding work and as we have bid work over the last quarter or 2, are certainly taking into account the much higher cost of liquid asphalt. So I think the basic answer to your question is yes, those price increases are in place. Obviously, a lot of asphalt is actually shipped months after it is bid and quoted just because of the sequencing and the duration of large highway projects. But we are, as you know, and Trey, you've followed us for a long time, our material margins in Asphalt tend to shrink as liquid asphalt prices move up. And then as they turn down, our margin, material margins, tend to grow because there's a lag in -- we're paying essentially spot prices for liquid asphalt and we are contracting, in advance, prices for asphalt mix.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Sure, yes. I was just kind of trying to -- for modeling purposes, trying to figure out the best way to kind of approach the -- how that will roll out.", "Donald M. James", "Well, I think if you look at our full year guidance for our Asphalt business, it's probably -- it just probably takes all that into account, the ebbs and flows of liquid asphalt versus our settling price.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then volumes, Aggregate shipments up 10% in the first quarter. You moved the full year guidance up some, a couple of percentage points I believe, but is it safe to kind of look at 1Q as being, okay, this is a big quarter, there definitely was some weather impact, but as we kind of look into 2Q, you expect improvements but not the type that we saw in the first quarter. And is that going to kind of roll off as the year kind of progresses? Or is that kind of a quick kind of pullback in 2Q as far as the rate of growth?", "Donald M. James", "Well, let me answer it this way. The first quarter is so much more weather sensitive than Q2 and Q3, and to some extent, more weather sensitive than Q4. We can't quantify what the -- how many tons were sold in the first quarter because of good weather. I mean that's -- we just -- that's really impossible for us to do. We know there was a weather effect. The second fact is that the number of tons in the first quarter is substantially less than the number of tons sold in Q2 and Q3. So a lot fewer tons can account for a 10% bump, whereas when you go in Q2 and Q3, you can have the same earnings impact on a much lower percentage increase in shipments, if you're following where I'm trying to go.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Absolutely.", "Donald M. James", "And so our full year guidance is 2% to 4% increase in Aggregates shipments, including the 10% we got in the first quarter. But the earnings effect is -- since the tonnage is so much higher in Q2 and Q3, and the leverage we get from even a 2% to 4% volume gain is very significant for us. As you saw, literally, almost 100% of our revenue increase flowed through in gross profit. That's a combination of a lot of things, but we have a lot of leverage to volume and we're looking forward to enjoying that as the year moves forward.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Sure, okay. And my last question is, Don, if I heard you right, I think you said more than half of the -- half of your markets, I guess, realized the price improvements in the quarter. Can you talk, number one, just specifically where you're seeing the most strength? If I missed it, I apologize. And then secondly, is -- you saw more than half with improvements, but your pricing was down a little bit. And you pointed to the Virginia, the more fill material with that large project or projects. But is that -- the strength in those more than half, is that just offsetting the Virginia fill material more or are you -- or is there some markets that are actually seeing some softness in price?", "Donald M. James", "Well, I think our pricing in Virginia was down. It was in the top 1 or 2 markets in the average selling price being lower, and that was all driven by those sales of what I'll call non-spec product. I think there are 2 points, Trey. One is that the range of increase and decrease is narrowing, meaning there's more stability in pricing, both up and down, across most of our markets, which, on balance, at this point in the cycle, we think is a good thing. Clearly, if we -- if you factor out Virginia and get to neutral, we had as much downside in pricing across some markets as we had in upside. But we think coming out of the first quarter, for us to get to the full year 1 to 3 price improvement, we're going to see price improvement across many of our markets, the majority of our markets. But still, it's an ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter, really month-to-month, on what is shipped. And there are thousands of individual pricing decisions that are made every quarter. We're confident that pricing, overall, will move up instead of down. But there's still -- we need some additional volume growth before we start seeing a significant real price growth. And hopefully, that's coming with improved private sector construction as we look at these contract awards.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I've got a number of questions, if I could. I'll try and limit it, but the first one, just a follow-on from that last answer. I'm looking at the CEMEX numbers today. They reported a 6% increase in Aggregate prices, Q1-on-Q1 last year. I mean, I gather or presume you don't want to give us the detailed pricing by state, but from when you look at that, can you see any reason why they should be so different given they're very California and Florida biased as well?", "Donald M. James", "Mike, I haven't studied their release yet, but I don't have an answer to your question.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, no worries. My second question, just on the operating leverage, which obviously was very good in Q1 on the Aggregates business, as you said, almost 100%, was any of that benefiting from the fact that some of the stone that was more than 12 months in inventory, some of this base fill, you were able to put through the books at almost nothing? Was that a factor at all in that very high operating leverage in Q1?", "Daniel Sansone", "Mike, this is Dan. No, that -- the level of that was consistent with prior periods. That has not been -- that was not an issue for us as volumes were declining because we managed our inventories and production rates down accordingly, and we do not expect that to be a distortive impact on the uptick either.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Thank you for that. And then just maybe a final one on Cement, that nobody's talked about yet. I realize it's small, but it was a very good result in Q1. The volumes were particularly high. Were there any exceptionals or one-offs in that?", "Donald M. James", "I'll let Danny Shepherd take that.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Yes. Actually, our sales volumes were up, Mike. But at the same time, we had a good quarter from a cost point of view. And we anticipate our Cement business this year showing improvement, a slight improvement.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Was the plant down for maintenance last year and not down for maintenance this year, for example?", "Danny R. Shepherd", "It was down partially in the first quarter of last year. This year, we didn't have an outage. But we believe our kilns are well maintained and we\u2019re pleased that we didn't have to take an outage in the first quarter.", "Donald M. James", "We have built in an outage in our full year projection.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "We have.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Just really one question for today related to your Aggregate margins. Once again, just trying to get a better understanding of how much did volume versus pricing versus cost cutting impact the quarter. I know you addressed some on the cost-cutting side earlier in the call, but maybe a better understanding of what, for the second quarter in a row, is helping to drive margin improvement.", "Donald M. James", "It is in the operating leverage of our business. That is being able to run our plants at higher volumes really has a significant impact on our productivity, labor productivity, energy productivity. Obviously, selling prices didn't have a positive effect on Aggregates earnings, but costs and so much of cost is tied to volume. I think the volume increase was the real driver for our improved -- and the flow-through of revenue to gross profit.", "Daniel Sansone", "Kathryn, let me try to just provide a little more color on that. If you look at our variable costs of production in the quarter, they declined as compared -- on a unit basis as compared to our variable costs of production in the first quarter of last year. And as Don mentioned, that was predominantly labor efficiency offsetting diesel fuel. Our cash period costs, and period costs in our way of -- in our terminology is your fixed costs. Those -- the spending at the cash period costs level was flat year-over-year, so we've got 10% additional volume. So that same level of cash spending is being spread over more tons. And if you look at the supplemental schedules, you'll see that our depreciation expense in the various business segments is declining as well. So the dollars of non-cash fixed expense are being -- are not only declining, but being spread over a larger amount of tons. I should also point out that in the quarter, we also reduced our units of Aggregates inventory as well by several million tons. So we got this level of operating leverage on a level of production that was less, that increased less than the increase in the level of sales. So again, I think it's a further illustration of both the disciplined working capital management by our operating guys and the inherent profitability of this business as it comes into recovery.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Of that inventory that was reduced, could you describe, is it more base-type rock or other...", "Daniel Sansone", "It would be across the board. It would represent the full array of product mix in kind of normal production splits. No single category jumped out.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Okay. And also in terms of weather certainly has helped the last couple of quarters, how much do you think mild weather has pulled forward demand and what are trends then as we've gone into April? And would that give any indication of a pull forward of demand?", "Donald M. James", "Kathryn, I don't think we have good metrics on that. It is -- we do believe there was a weather effect in the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter this year. I don't think -- it's too early to say whether it's going to have a chilling effect on second quarter volume at this point. We don't think so because we think the underlying demand is improving, particularly in the private sector. And that's really the reason that volumes are moving up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.", "Judy Merrick", "Actually, this is Judy Merrick for Keith. And just to clarify on your EBITDA guidance, you talked about that all excluding the gains from the asset sales. Will you give us any information on the impact of the EBITDA contribution from these asset sales? Or what sort of matter -- the mix of what's real estate and what's not going forward?", "Donald M. James", "The EBITDA contribution from asset sales would vary greatly depending upon what we sell. And so for -- and as Danny Shepherd and others have talked about previously, we have a large portfolio of assets that we would be willing to sell. We are really looking for the right buyer at the right price. You saw that our ready-mixed business in the quarter, I think, operated at a $12 million loss. So if we sell ready-mixed assets, we could get a double pickup on EBITDA. That is by avoiding loss, as well as if we have a gain on sale. So it's too early for us to give you predictions as to that, but we will certainly give you, as transactions close, we will give you the specifics of the EBITDA and EPS impact of those transactions, as we do with our routine real estate transactions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just quickly on California as a follow-up to a previous question. But how much of that improvement you're seeing as there is being driven by highway sort of infrastructure work versus private sector activities?", "Donald M. James", "I think most of it is highways. But our volumes in California are up substantially and have been for the last year or so, and it's largely highways.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. So still waiting for that next leg on the private sector?", "Donald M. James", "Yes.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then I apologize if you've answered this before. But on the portfolio of sort of Planned Asset Sales that you have, when that's completed, should that change how we sort of currently think about your more key states and exposure?", "Donald M. James", "To the extent we sell ready-mixed assets, it could reduce the revenue from large states. If, for example, we sold some Concrete assets in California, since Concrete sells for a much higher unit price than Aggregates, yes, it could change the revenue. But that's really not important as to our market presence and our market penetration. We would continue to sell Aggregates to Concrete if we sold the Concrete. And our profitability per dollar revenue would be enhanced, if that gets to your question.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "That's what I needed.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call back over to Don James for any closing remarks.", "Donald M. James", "Well, thank you very much for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan. As I indicated, we look forward to updating you with our progress in our earnings improvement as we go forward, and particularly, to updating you with respect to our Profit Enhancement Plan, as well as our Planned Asset Sales as we move forward through the course of the year.

My name is Ian and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded for replay purposes. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed, sir.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results for the second quarter of 2012. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today on the call are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President for Construction Materials.", "We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference during this call. These slides are also available to those of you on the webcast.", "Looking at Slide 2 and before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties", "Descriptions of these risk and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS for continuing operations. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's second quarter 2012 earnings release and in the Investor Relations section of Vulcan's website.", "Turning now to Slide 3. Before we walk through the quarterly result, I wanted to briefly discuss a few highlights from the quarter. We remain keenly focused on reducing overhead cost and maximizing operation efficiency across the organization. These efforts have enabled us to continue to increase profitability, while sales remained essentially flat. Adjusted EBITDA was $127 million in the second quarter of this year, an increase of $10 million or 8% over last year's second quarter.", "We achieved higher EBITDA despite a slight decline in net sales. This decline is due in part to demand weakness in certain of our markets to the pull-forward effect of seasonably favorable weather conditions during the first quarter and unusually severe weather from tropical storm Debby in Florida in June. These negative influences were offset by encouraging growth in a number of our other key markets.", "Despite weaker volumes in several of our most profitable markets, Aggregates segment gross profit margin increased 220 basis points, and cash earnings per ton of aggregates improved to $4.57. Both of these improvements demonstrate our cost-reduction efforts, and earnings potential of our Aggregates business, particularly as volumes across our geographic markets recover.", "SAG expenses were reduced during the quarter by approximately 16%, reflecting our organizational restructuring and our cost reduction initiatives.", "As we look ahead, activity in both private and public sector construction markets continues to improve.", "We are encouraged by the passage of a new multi-year highway bill, signed into law in early July, which should provide State Department of Transportation with a funding certainty that they need to move forward on infrastructure programs.", "I will discuss some of the details regarding the highway bill a bit later in the call.", "We've also made important progress on our initiatives to enable Vulcan to continue to generate higher levels of earnings in cash flow, further improve our operating leverage, reduce overhead cost and strengthen our credit profile.", "Turning now to Slide 4. As I noted, net sales for the quarter were approximately $649 million, which is a 1% decrease from the second quarter of 2011. For the first 6 months of 2012, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion, 3% higher than the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $127 million in the second quarter of 2012, which is an increase of $10 million or 8% over the second quarter in the prior year.", "When making year-over-year comparisons of earnings and EBITDA, I want to highlight 3 items that are better excluded from the adjusted EBITDA. The second quarter results include $32 million of cost related to the unsolicited exchange offer by Martin Marietta. They also include $4.5 million of charges associated with the implementation of our Profit Enhancement Plan. And finally, we recorded a $12 million gain on the sale of mitigation credits in California during the quarter.", "For the first half of 2012, EBITDA increased $52 million or 42% from the first half of 2011. I also want to point out, again, our continued success in reducing overhead cost. SAG expenses were 16% lower in both the second quarter and the first half. These decreases are the direct result of restructuring initiatives we undertook during 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, as well as the early benefits of the Profit Enhancement Plan we announced in February. We will provide an update on the Profit Enhancement Plan shortly.", "I'll now turn the call over to Danny Shepherd, who will walk you through our segment results for the quarter and an update on our Profit Enhancement Plan and Planned Asset Sales.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Thank you, Don.", "Turning to segment results on Slide 5. Aggregates segment results revenues were pressured by sluggish demand in certain markets and relatively weaker volumes in several of our most profitable markets. Aggregates volumes declined by double-digit percentages in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. All of these states are relatively high margin states for Vulcan, so the volume decreases in those states had a larger impact on bottom-line result.", "On the positive side, we achieved double-digit growth in shipments in a number of key states, including Alabama, Florida, Illinois, and Texas, while shipments in Virginia and California continued to show improvement compared to the prior year.", "These year-over-year increases in Aggregates shipments were due mainly to large infrastructure project work, primarily highways, and increased private construction activity in these states. I should also note that while volume growth was strong in Florida, as Don mentioned, the severe wet weather in June from tropical storm Debby impeded the level of shipments in Florida in June, reducing the quarterly gains.", "The average freight adjusted selling price increased slightly in the quarter due primarily to some price improvement in private construction work and offset mostly by the negative impact of geographic and product mix.", "Overall, we believe our pricing in our markets remained solid with additional improvement expected in the second half of the year.", "While the top line was sluggish, we continued to drive stronger profitability. On a $7 million decline in revenues, our Aggregates gross profit increased by approximately $9 million, reflecting lower unit cost of sales.", "As a percentage of segment revenues, Aggregates gross profit increased by 220 basis points for the quarter. Cash earnings per ton of Aggregates increased to $4.57 per ton. All key labor productivity and energy efficiency metrics improved from last year. The unit cost for diesel fuel decreased 4%, accounting for $1 million of the increase in gross profit.", "Moving to Asphalt. For our Asphalt Mix segment, gross profit in the second quarter was $5 million compared with $8 million in the year-ago period. The unit cost for liquid Asphalt increased 7%, which contributed to the decline in segment earnings.", "The average sales price for Asphalt Mix increased slightly from the prior year, offsetting some of the earnings effect of an 8% decline in volumes.", "Concrete gross profit was a loss of $9 million, which is in line with the prior-year period. Ready-mixed concrete volumes increased 6% from the prior year. The earnings effect of higher volumes was offset by the unfavorable geographic mix.", "Finally, Cement. Cement segment gross profit with a loss of $2 million compared to a loss of $1 million in the prior year. A planned maintenance outage at the company's cement plant in Florida, as well as cost related to production disruption from heavy rain and power outages from tropical storm Debby negatively affected segment earnings in the second quarter.", "In total, gross profit for our non-aggregates segment decreased by $4 million.", "Turning to Slide 6. Now, I'd like to highlight the steady progress we are making as a part of the Profit Enhancement Plan announced in February. As you may recall from the call, the Profit Enhancement Plan includes cost reductions and other profit enhancement initiatives intended to improve our run rate profitability as measured by EBITDA, and we would expect to improve $100 million annually at current volumes.", "The Profit Enhancement Plan is focused on 3 major areas: We have a $55 million target in sourcing. We have $25 million target in G&A and another $20 million target for transportation and logistics.", "As previously announced, we expect to achieve at least $25 million of the Profit Enhancement Plan in 2012 and the remainder in 2013.", "Employees throughout the organization are implementing actions to improve our profitability across all business segments. And thanks to their continuing efforts, we remain very confident that we will achieve our Profit Enhancement goal.", "Through the first half of 2012, we've reduced total company controllable cost by $55 million from the prior year. This includes the benefit of previously announced restructuring, as well as the initial results of our Profit Enhancement Plan. The latest portion of restructuring and implementation cost for the Profit Enhancement Plan, approximately $4.5 million, was incurred in the second quarter. The company expects to incur an additional $3 million in restructuring and implementation cost as work is completed in the second half of 2012.", "There are over 200 specific Profit Enhancement initiatives underway across Vulcan's regions and functions. Our entire team, in particular, the managers and staff closest to our operations and customers, has risen to the challenges presented by today's difficult market conditions. The actions being taken will positively impact our already impressive cash margins per ton, further improving our leverage as demand recovers.", "To give some examples, in the area of G&A, we worked on further consolidating back office transactional activities into shared services and rightsizing shared services staffing. Types of actions we've taken in sourcing include renegotiating several large supply contracts at reduced rates, implementing enhanced bidding requirements for certain third-party services and implementing a new TNE [ph] cost policy.", "A specific example of an action we've taken in transportation is optimizing fuel efficiency of Vulcan's ships. We remain very committed to our Profit Enhancement Plan, and execution of these initiatives will remain a top priority for corporate and region management.", "Now for a brief update on Planned Asset Sales. It won't take a minute to give this update. As you may recall, we are planning to sell non-core assets in a disciplined and strategic manner. These are good assets, many of which we -- which will have a significant value to a number of potential purchasers. Our objective is to generate net after-tax proceeds of approximately $500 million by mid-2013, helping to strengthen our balance sheet, unlock capital for more productive uses and create value for our shareholders.", "We've been pleased with the level of interest in activity surrounding this process thus far. During the last several months, we have maintained active discussions and engaged in negotiations with multiple potential purchasers. These discussions include potential sales and other transactions involving a portfolio of assets that are not central to the company's strategy. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months, and I'll now turn the call back over to Don.", "Donald M. James", "Thanks, Danny. We're becoming more confident as we move to Slide 7, that the worst of this economic downturn in construction is behind us. This view is supported by increased contract awards for new construction projects, particularly in private construction, which bodes well for continued demand recovery in our markets.", "Multi-family housing starts have been growing now for 20 consecutive months. The trailing 12-month single-family housing starts turned positive in the first quarter of 2012 on the back of higher starts reported in recent months.", "The trailing 12-month contract awards for private nonresidential construction have been growing for the last 16 months. This trend is driven by growth in the boards for commercial and retail buildings. Additionally, trailing 12-month awards for Vulcan-served states and this private non-res category are up 7% versus 2% for other states. This is another positive indicator for continued demand recovery in our high-growth markets.", "Turning now to Slide 8. We continue to be optimistic about the trends in the private and public sector construction. We are encouraged about the passage of the new multi-year highway bill by Congress in late June. There was overwhelming bipartisan support for this legislation in both the House and the Senate, and it was signed into law by the President on July 6. This bill, called MAP-21, is designed to provide State Departments of Transportation with funding certainty in order to allow them to move forward on infrastructure programs. It will help rebuild America's aging infrastructure by modernizing and reforming our current transportation system, while also protecting millions of jobs.", "The bill maintains essentially level funding for the next 2 fiscal years with over $105 billion for total funding through fiscal year 2014. It extends the Highway Trust Fund and tax collections through fiscal year 2016, which is 2 years beyond the reauthorization period and adds additional stability that we have not had for the last several years.", "The bill's substantial highway provisions are more reform-focused than previous bills, with a strong emphasis on improving project delivery and eliminating red tape that has slowed the construction of highway projects. Funding directly for highways provides a floor of $82 billion for fiscal years '13 and '14. On top of this, there's a very significant increase in the TIFIA program, which stands for Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. Funding for this program will increase to $1.75 billion over the next 2-year period from only $122 million per year under SAFETEA-LU. According to the Federal Highway Administration, TIFIA funding is typically leveraged by a factor of 10, so that there is a potential for a $17.5 billion in additional major project funding for fiscal years '13 and '14 over and above the $82 billion in the regular highway program. TIFIA is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investments for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the United States, including large portions of our footprint. The program provides credit assistance in the form of secured loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure projects.", "Eligible sponsors for TIFIA projects include states and local governments, private firms, special authorities and transportation improvement districts. Eligible projects include highways and bridges, large multimodal projects, as well as freight transfer and transit facilities. Some of the existing TIFIA projects that those of you around the country may be familiar with would include the Capital Beltway HOT lanes in Virginia, the I-595 corridor improvements in Florida, and the Presidio Parkway in California, as well as the Central Texas Turnpike in Texas.", "Overall, MAP-21 creates a positive framework for future authorization through its significant reforms, consolidating and simplifying Federal Highway Programs, accelerating the project delivery process, expanding project financing and promoting public-private partnership opportunities. And needless to say, the fact that Congress was able to pass the bill in the current political climate, maintaining funding levels while also adding an additional year of program funding beyond what all the pundits expected, has its own significance, and makes us even more optimistic about the bill to have Congress to continue to work towards long-term solutions to rebuild America's infrastructure.", "Vulcan played a very active role in support of this legislation, communicating with Congress about the critical need for infrastructure investment. We have worked on this critical issue and will continue to do so, both as Vulcan and as part of broad coalition of key stakeholders including business, labor, industry association and state and local governments.", "Turning now to our outlook on Slide 9. Through the first half of 2012, Vulcan's adjusted EBITDA was $175 million, up from $123 million in the prior year. During the second half of 2012, Vulcan expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately $325 million, a $102 million increase from the second half of 2011.", "Included in this second half improvement is approximately $23 million from gains from the routine sale of real estate that is not part of the Planned Asset Sales and savings from the restructuring initiative announced last year and completed during the first quarter of 2012.", "For the balance of the year, we expect the year-over-year EBITDA improvement to be realized from cost reduction initiatives underway across the organization, including additional savings from the Profit Enhancement Plan, as well as the year-over-year improvement in second-half segment earnings in Aggregates, Concrete and Asphalt. We anticipate the controllable cost in the second half of 2012 will decrease by approximately $50 million from the prior year, which gives us $105 million in savings for the full year.", "Full year SAG costs are now expected to be approximately $260 million.", "For 2012, we expect earnings in each segment to improve from the prior year. We now expect the total aggregate freight adjusted selling prices to increase 1% to 3%. Aggregates demand should benefit from recovery in private construction activity and from the new Federal Highway Bill I mentioned earlier.", "As a result, total company's same-store shipments are now expected to be up 1% to 3%, with the total shipments, that is adjusting for divestitures of Indiana operations last year, should be flat to 2% higher. The uneven pace of growth in shipments through the first half of 2012 across our key markets makes forecasting overall volume growth more challenging. The full year outlook assumes a more normal geographic mix of shipments in the second half of 2012.", "Our non-aggregates segment earnings are expected to increase approximately $25 million compared to last year due mostly to improved earnings in Asphalt and Concrete. Asphalt earnings are expected to increase due to second half growth in shipments as a result of the timing of certain large projects in California.", "For the Concrete segment, volume should continue to benefit from growth in private construction activity in the second half of the year. Cement earnings are expected to approach breakeven for the full year. Unit cost for diesel fuel are expected to increase modestly from the second half 2011 levels, resulting in a full year increase of 1% to 5% from last year.", "Based on all of these assumptions, we expect 2012 EBITDA will be approximately $500 million, which excludes the results from the Planned Asset Sales and the cost associated with the unsolicited offer.", "We expect capital spending in 2012 to be approximately $100 million.", "In summary, we are encouraged by our second quarter results. Our cost-reduction initiatives are gaining traction and positioning us well for solid earnings growth in 2012. More importantly, these initiatives will improve the underlying cost structure of our organization and allow us to fully leverage the earning potential of a sustained recovery and demand.", "Now I'll turn the call over to our operator to begin Q&A. Dan Sansone, Danny Shepherd and I will be happy to respond to your questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "My first question is, I'm just wondering if we could dive in a little bit more on the weakness that you saw in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia in the quarter. I think it was a bit surprising the level of volume declines there. I'm just wondering, was it all weather driven, the pull forward into the first quarter, the rain in the second quarter, is there some market share loss going on there? I'm just wondering, a little bit more color will be helpful.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Gary, this is Danny Shepherd. I'll answer your call. The first question you asked about demand in North Carolina and Georgia, North Carolina has remained weak for some time. As you know, we have a significant presence in the great -- presence in the greater Charlotte area, and that area of North Carolina has been weak now for some time. We do not have a major presence in eastern North Carolina, and large highway projects for the most part have been occurring in that part of the state. Switching to Georgia, Georgia has also been weak for some time now. Georgia had a hugely overbuilt residential sector. That sector is slowly improving. What remains hopefully a bright spot for us as we move through the year is in the highway sector. We have a reasonably good backlog in highway work as we travel through the summer. So hopefully, we will be somewhat stronger in Georgia in the second half.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. I guess, just looking at your volume guidance that's been reduced this morning, you had about 3% volume growth in the first half of the year. And I guess, the new full year volume guidance implies something like a plus 1% to down 3% volume performance in the second half? I was just wondering if you can reconcile, given that in the prepared remarks, you're starting to see some improved trends in private and public demand. I'm just wondering where the disconnect is and why you're anticipating modest volume declines, broadly speaking, in the back half of the year?", "Donald M. James", "I believe our volume guidance for the second half of the year would be essentially flat, not down, and certain maybe up slightly on a same-store basis. The issue, of course, Garik, is timing of projects. We think there's a substantial amount of work in the pipeline coming from improvement in the private sector. We were surprised by both the large declines in the 3 states Danny mentioned but also by very large gains in many of our other markets. So there's a disparity in growth rates across markets, which we think will level out some in the second half, at least, our outlook is based on that. But we are -- we think contract awards for highways are down for the year about 5% to 7% largely because of the lack of any of the stimulus contract awards are no longer going out. But with the passage of the new highway bill, we think the significant new contract awards in the second half, whether they shift in the second half of 2011 or the first half of '13 is difficult for us to predict at this point. But we're not -- I don't think we see a disconnect in our macro outlook in our Aggregate volumes forecast.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then just my last question is, on the $50 million reduction that you're looking for in controllable costs, just wondering how that relates to Profit Enhancement Program. And it seems like in the presentation, that it would be separate, and you would need this $50 million in the lower cost to help hit your guidance for EBITDA for the full year. But if you can provide some more color how -- whether or not there are some more costs that are being pulled forward from the Profit Enhancement Program into the back half of the year or just where this $50 million are coming from, that will be helpful.", "Donald M. James", "Well, in the first half, we got $55 million of controllable cost reduction. About $25 million of that was SAG and about $30 million was in cost of goods sold. Of the $50 million in the second half, again, about $25 million will come from SAG and about $25 million from cost of goods sold. A portion of that savings is coming from the form of Profit Enhancement Plan, but it's also coming from a very broad-based plant level and regional level initiatives that are helping us with our overall cost reduction effort. So it's a combination of the Profit Enhancement Plan plus the last year's restructuring and last year's SAG reduction efforts, as well as the ongoing Profit Enhancement Plan benefits.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Realistically, in Q2, how much does volume shortfall with a pull forward in demand versus the Florida storm?", "Donald M. James", "Certainly, there was a pull forward in demand from the very favorable weather in the first quarter. It's really hard for us to quantify that, but we know it exists. The issue in Florida from tropical storm Debby, I think, there were like 22 inches of rain that soaked the state, certainly, portions of the state. We don't have a number associated with that. Our volumes, as a Danny Shepherd said, in Florida, we're up double digit in the quarter. Clearly, they would have been up some more if it hadn't been for the impact of tropical storm Debby, but we really can't quantify that in any way that we think would be accurate.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "I think it will be safe to say that the pull-forward demand probably had a greater impact though?", "Donald M. James", "Yes, yes. Relatively I'm certain. I misunderstood that part of your question.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "And you said in your prepared comments, you expect additional pricing improvement in the second half. But our industry contacts are telling us that's increasingly more challenging to get pricing in a market. What are you seeing that maybe is a little bit different or is there maybe just degrees in terms of what type of pricing you feel you'd be able to get in the market?", "Donald M. James", "Well, as you know, in this industry, every market is different. It's a matter of what's going on in individual markets. Clearly, it is challenging in this market to get price improvement. We had very, very modest price improvement in the first half but some -- there is a geographic mix to pricing and we had a negative geographic mix for pricing in the second quarter. We think that will modify in the second half and we will get some benefit from a more normal geographic mix as it would flow through into pricing. Put another way, we have very good pricing in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, and some of the states where we have the highest volume gains don't have a stronger pricing as some of those other markets. So that geographic impact to pricing is significant.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Okay. Now I know that kind of topic du jour is fiscal cliff and elections coming up. What are you doing -- a twofold question related to, these are facing the U.S. and us overall. Do you feel better or worse about demand given the hurdles that we face in the back half of the year? And are you doing anything differently to manage your business around those events?", "Donald M. James", "I'll go to the first question -- the second part of the question first. Clearly, we are very focused on controlling our cost. And without regard to what's happening with volume, we are committed to achieve the $50 million in additional controllable cost in the second half, totaling $105 million for the year. And then as we move forward into '13, the continuation of the benefit from our Profit Enhancement Plan. So we're doing that independent of political issues or demand issues. Actually, I think we -- with the passage of the federal highway bill, the certainty that gives to DOT's and the substantial increase in the TIFIA program, I think politically, we think we're more optimistic than we've been in several years in terms of the impact on our demand. We obviously are all affected by what is happening and may happen in Europe. But in terms of public infrastructure spending and what we're seeing in the housing markets, both multi-family and single-family housing, and increases in contract awards for private non-res, I think we are probably more optimistic today about the future than we've been in a long time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rodny Nacier of Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Don, you commented on your expectation implied in your guidance that volumes are going to be flat in the second half. So I'm just trying to understand, it's going to be on a relatively tougher comp than the 2Q and with residential activity pretty evident in the first half and not too much volume growth and comps getting tougher in the back half. I mean, is it really a combination of residential private construction continuing to be strong and maybe some regional mixed dynamics going away?", "Donald M. James", "Well, full year, we think residential -- the demand from residential end markets will be up plus or minus 10%. Non-res up plus or minus 6%. Those are the areas that are positive. Highways, at least in terms of contract awards, will probably be down some, maybe plus or minus 6%. And so you balance all that out, infrastructure may be flat to down 1% or 2%. So when you run all that through our model, the improvement is coming from the private sector with some near-term weakness. Last year's third quarter was weak. We saw strength coming back in the fourth quarter, so that's -- as we're looking at comps from last year, we had a relatively weak third quarter and a relatively strong fourth quarter.", "Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And with the bill -- I missed if you had said that changed your guidance for this year at all would be a transport bill being signed on the public side?", "Donald M. James", "No, that did not change our guidance. I think it gives us a lot of encouragement about the future, but we didn't change our volume guidance based on the passage of the highway bill.", "Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And my second question is on the asset sale program that you have. Did you extend the timeline for the completion of the program for the $500 million. The tone in the release seems to be more cautious around the deadline. And secondly, do you have any assets that are classified as held for sale on your balance sheet as of now?", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Rodny, Danny Shepherd here. we have not extended the deadline that we had previously communicated, and we're working very aggressively to actually accomplish some things in the Planned Asset Sale category certainly this year. But no, the answer is no, we have not extended out our deadline.", "Donald M. James", "For the second part, we don't have assets held for sale on our balance sheet. There are rules for when you do that, and basically, the impact is you stop depreciating them so we don't have any on the balance sheet held for sale at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "I was curious -- in terms of getting that sort of rough $25 million improvement in the non-aggregates piece, does that also assume the sale of any businesses or is that purely a function of better market and better operating performance with what you have?", "Donald M. James", "That does not include sale of any assets. That's operating for -- it's primarily -- it's not in the Cement segment, it's in the Asphalt and Ready Mix segment. The Asphalt Segment is -- will benefit from some projects that will begin in the second half. And the Concrete segment, we believe will benefit from the improvement in private sector demand, both residential and private non-res.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Got you. Okay. And then, and just on the residential side, maybe more broadly speaking, just curious what you're seeing in terms of sort of community development, flat development and things like that?", "Donald M. James", "Well, it was a very market specific. I think there is probably less infrastructure development per housing start today than there was at the last time we saw housing starts pick up, but that will catch up. But there's obviously some of that, but that's not a huge factor right now, but it will obviously come back as some of the already developed lots get consumed.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] of RBC Capital Markets.", "Unknown Analyst", "I'm mostly focused on maybe you can give us an idea of what you think incremental margins are in the aggregate segment given that you're taking out so much cost during the remainder of the year?", "Donald M. James", "Incremental margin in the Aggregates business, you're looking for a full year number?", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes. How would you [indiscernible]?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. The guidance we have given has been about 60% in the Aggregates business. We're doing better than that year-to-date. And there's a lot of reasons for that, but I would go back to what Danny Shepherd said about the broad-based work our people across our regions are doing at the plant level. So 60% over some period of time is still a good number even though we're beating that year-to-date.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Betts of Jefferies.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to return, please, to the non-aggregates businesses. I mean I think, Don, you were talking about $25 million improvement. It was only up, I think, 2 in the first half. So there's a lot of progress needed here. My specific questions are really, I guess 2 or 3. Firstly, were there any other problem in projects or work contracts that you had in over the Asphalt business or the ready mixed that particularly have held it back in the first half and you won't have in the second half? And are you expecting significant price increases as well in ready mix or Asphalt that helps with that? And then the third question, really just look at the quantification, if you could, of the one-off cost that impacted the Cement business in the first half or in the second quarter.", "Donald M. James", "Mike, in the Asphalt business, the issue was the higher cost of liquid asphalt and the lag in getting that higher cost of liquid asphalt pushed through into our pricing. But in terms of an -- the problem with an individual project, we didn't have any of those. It's really the liquid asphalt impact. The liquid asphalt prices were up about 10% in the first half, which had a significant impact on the profitability. And we're looking for stronger volumes in both Asphalt and Concrete in the second half. I mentioned earlier in Asphalt, it's because of the timing of some larger highway projects particularly in California. And in Concrete, it's driven by the improvement in residential and private non-res construction, which is the larger user of concrete. We expect improved material margins in both Asphalt and Concrete. And the combination of volume growth and improved margins is the basis for our improved guidance in the second half. With respect to the cement plant, 2 things happened in the second quarter. One, we had a planned outage, which always impacts results in a quarter in which you have an outage because you don't have production for a period of time and you have increased R&M costs. And secondly, at the cement plant, we had a -- because of the storm, we had -- we lost power to the cement plant and that clearly disrupts production not just for the time that the power is out but then the time to get the plant back up following that. Danny, do you have any other...", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Well, I would add, Mike, early in the quarter, you know what it takes when -- you know what the time line looks like when you take a cement kiln down. So one way to look at it is we lost 10 days, roughly early in the quarter and we lost roughly 10 days late in the quarter because of the weather events. So hopefully, these are non-recurring. There are no planned outages, kiln outages at the cement plant in the near future.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Do you have a quantification of the cost of those 2 events, was it like $1 million or $2 million?", "Daniel Sansone", "Yes, roughly $1 million, we believe.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Don, if I could just return to the Asphalt question, 2 parts to it and my final question here, 2 parts to it. One, is the lag under the indexation roughly about 3 months or is it significantly different? And how do you locked in the liquid bitumin-- liquid asphalt cost for the rest of the year or you're still at vaguaries of what that price does?", "Donald M. James", "We have some portion of our liquid asphalt needs committed pricewise. And in some portion, we'll have to continue to buy on the  spot market. The lag in pricing, many of these projects are priced much further out than 3 months from the shipping date.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "But the indexation, does that work on a 3-month basis or is it the indexation of the point?", "Daniel Sansone", "I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question, Mike.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes. I mean, is the price recovery a question of waiting for the indexation to deliver the cost of increased asphalt, or is it you win and you work higher prices?", "Danny R. Shepherd", "No, the answer is no. We're expecting a significant improvement in California as Don talked about in his remarks. The work that -- a large percentage of the work that we expect to ship in the second half is indexed work in California, and that is -- that is something that's manageable.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Don James for closing remarks.", "Donald M. James", "Thank you very much for joining us for our second quarter conference call. We look forward to having you again after the third quarter.

Benway - S&P Equity Research", "Operator", "Welcome to the 2012 Vulcan Materials Company Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Hilda, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and CEO. Mr. James, you may begin.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2012. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference during the call. These slides are also available to those of you on the webcast.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risk and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's third quarter 2012 earnings release and in the Investor Relations section of Vulcan's website.", "Turning now to Slide 3. I want to begin by briefly discussing a few highlights from the quarter. We continued to deliver earnings improvement during the quarter, with an adjusted EBITDA of $146 million, an increase of 9% over the third quarter of last year. We achieved these results despite a demand environment that remains highly challenging, as reflected in the weak volume we saw in the quarter.", "Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.14 per diluted share, a 27% (sic) [$0.27] per share improvement from a loss of $0.13 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. The earnings impact of lower Aggregate volumes was about $18 million of EBITDA or $0.10 per diluted share.", "We also generated higher Aggregates profitability. Aggregates unit profitability as measured by cash gross profit per ton was a third quarter record and the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Aggregates segment gross profit margin increased 340 basis points due to a 4% increase in Aggregates pricing and the benefits of our continued cost-reductions efforts. Cost reduction is an ongoing focus of our management team and all of our employees. In addition to lower unit cost of sales in our Aggregates business, we also realized our fourth consecutive quarterly decline in year-over-year SAG expenses.", "As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the leading indicators for private sector construction. In addition, we're looking forward to more predictable funding provided by the new federal highway bill and the benefits from a greatly expanded TIFIA program within that bill.", "Moving now to Slide 4. We are very pleased with the margin expansion we realized in the third quarter and year-to-date, particularly given the lack of top line growth. Our margin expansion will further enhance earnings leverage as volumes recover.", "Employees throughout the company remain keenly focused on managing controllable costs. Thanks to their continued efforts, earnings leverage in our Aggregates business continues to grow as evidenced by the consistent increases in gross profit margins and adjusted EBITDA. We also benefited from stronger pricing in both the third quarter and the year-to-date periods.", "Through the 9 months ended September 30 of this year, adjusted EBITDA, which excludes $18 million in real estate gains, was $321 million, up $64 million or 25%. Again, this was despite a 1% decline in Aggregate volumes.", "SAG expenses for the third quarter were $65 million, down from $67 million for the third quarter last year. Excluding the effects of certain accounting charges tied primarily to employee benefit plans and resulting from the increase in the company's stock price, SAG expenses were reduced $10 million from the prior year's third quarter.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd who will walk you through our segment results for the quarter, Danny?", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Thanks, Don. Turning to our segment results on Slide 5. As Don said earlier, Aggregate segment revenue remained sluggish as a result of weaker volumes. On a same-store basis, Aggregates declined 6%. But we are pleased in spite of the sluggishness in public construction, Aggregates' gross profit increased $12 million from the prior year's third quarter.", "Aggregates' cash gross profit per ton was $4.75, a 10% improvement over the prior year. As Don mentioned, and I would like to further emphasize, the $4.75 per ton Aggregates cash gross profit is a record level of unit profitability for the third quarter. Also, gross profit margins expanded, as he said, by 340 basis points over prior year third quarter.", "Pricing, which was good news, and specifically a 4% improvement in pricing contributed significantly to higher segment earnings and profitability. In addition, our operations teams lowered unit cost of sales for the quarter by 1%.", "Turning to Slide 6. Here, you'll see our bridge for the Aggregates segment, and it shows the benefit of higher pricing and effective cost control, which more than offset the earnings effect of lower volumes. Now it's important to note that despite overall sluggish volumes in the quarter, we were encouraged by strong Aggregates shipments in several key states, including Arizona, Florida and Texas.", "Total volumes from these 3 states increased 12%, due primarily to growing demand from private construction. Now if you look at the green bars on the slide, they illustrate the earnings contribution of higher pricing and lower cost. Year-over-year price improvement was achieved in most of the company's markets, including key markets in Florida, Texas and in the states -- and in Southeast states, the mid-Atlantic and the Midwest.", "The improvement in operating cost is a result of our intense focus on cost control and productivity. In the quarter, our unit cost of sales decreased 1% on lower production volumes. And when we look at our operating metrics, like we do, it shows that we continue to improve.", "Turning to Slide 7. You'll see from this chart that we remain encouraged by the momentum that we've seen over the last year. Aggregates unit profitability continues to improve. And for the 12 -- for the trailing 12 months ending September 30, 2012, our cash gross profit per ton was $4.28, and that is 8% higher than the prior year and 30% higher than the peak year in volumes, which was 2005.", "If you turn to Slide 8 now. Third quarter earnings from the company's non-Aggregate segments were in line with prior year. Earnings improvement in Cement and Concrete offset a slight decrease in Asphalt mix gross profit.", "On Slide 8, you can see evidence that continued recovery in private construction activity led to solid increases in ready-mix Concrete and Cement volume, as well as year-over-year growth in pricing for both segments.", "Concrete gross profit for the third quarter improved slightly from the prior year period. Year-to-date, Concrete gross profit was a loss of $30 million, a $2 million improvement over the prior year.", "Private construction led by housing is recovering sharply in Florida. There, ready-mix Concrete volumes are up more than 20% and Concrete block, albeit a smaller part of the Concrete segment, are up almost 30% through the first 9 months of 2012.", "Cement segment gross profit approximated a breakeven position in the third quarter, a modest improvement from the prior year. Through the first 9 months of 2012, Cement gross profit has improved $4 million from the prior year.", "Finally, in our Asphalt segment, gross profit in the third quarter was $11 million, which is a decrease of $1 million from the year ago period. The unit cost for liquid asphalt increased 3%, thus reducing Asphalt segment earnings by $1 million.", "Consistent with the public-sector demand, Asphalt sales volumes in California, the company's largest asphalt market, were down versus the prior year, which more than offset volume increases in Texas and Arizona. Year-to-date Asphalt mix segment gross profit was $15 million compared with $20 million in 2011.", "In total, gross profit for our non-Aggregates segment has improved 9% over 2011 year-to-date.", "Overall, we believe the non-Aggregates earnings performance has stabilized and should benefit from increased private construction activity. We remain focused on maximizing the Aggregates shipments that are pulled through our downstream businesses, and we're focused on improving our profit and cash flow performance of these very valuable assets.", "Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the program back over to Don.", "Donald M. James", "Thank you, Danny. If you'll turn now to Slide 9, I want to focus for a moment on publicly funded construction, more specifically highway construction.", "This slide depicts the historical relationship of the timing of contract awards to the passage of new federal highway bills. You will notice that historically, increases in contract awards for highway projects have followed the passage of new federal highway bills. This trend should continue with the July 2012 passage of the new federal highway bill MAP-21, which will provide stability and predictability to highway funding for the next several years.", "Evidence of this relationship between growth in new construction activity and the passage of a new federal highway bill can be seen in dollars obligated for qualified federal projects. In the last 2 months of fiscal year 2012, that is, in August and September of this year, 42% of the full year $38 billion budget was obligated. This share of full year funding was disportionately larger than normal, which means the prior 10 months were disproportionately smaller, and is indicative of the state DOT's positive response to the final passage of a new highway bill in July.", "In the third quarter, the passage of the new highway bill had no material impact on shipments, which reflected softness in highway construction from the weak contract awards during the past 20 months as reflected on Slide 9, and the winding down of stimulus-related construction.", "Moving now to Slide 10. This map highlights one of the important features contained in the new federal highway bill. The large increase in Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act or TIFIA funding contained in the new highway bill should also positively impact demand in the future, particularly for several key Vulcan-served states. The current backlog of potential projects requesting TIFIA funding is substantial. Currently, letters of interest for 54 transportation projects have been submitted for more than $65 billion in total project cost. More than $42 billion of the projects are in Vulcan-served counties, with almost 80% in Vulcan-served counties in 3 states: California, Texas and Virginia. The uncertain timing of shipments to larger projects, including these TIFIA- funded projects, continues to make forecasting quarterly volume growth difficult.", "Turning now to Slide 11. Looking at the other portion of public construction activity, you can see that other public infrastructure contract awards are improving. On this slide, we have overlaid year-over-year change in contract awards for new construction, with construction activity completed as measured by the Census Bureau's construction put in place monthly survey.", "As you can see, there is a lag effect between the leading indicator, that is contract award, and the actual construction. We are optimistic that the growth in recent awards will continue and actual construction growth will follow.", "We'll move now to Slide 12. As we mentioned before, private construction activity, specifically, residential housing starts and contract awards for nonresidential buildings, continued to improve during the quarter, offsetting some residual softness in highway construction resulting from the prolonged delay in the renewal of the federal highway bill.", "On Slide 12, we see a very nice fit between housing starts and the actual construction activity, with a predictable lag between the start and completion of construction. We believe this growth trend will continue.", "The same can be said for private nonresidential construction shown on Slide 13. Here, you see a slightly longer lag than in residential, but again, evidence of growth in new contract awards followed by growth in actual construction activity. Consequently, Aggregates demand in the private construction is beginning to grow. We are seeing evidence of this [indiscernible] in several of our key states, including Florida, Texas and Arizona.", "We are in the midst of our planning for 2013. But preliminarily, we believe the indicators shown on the last 5 slides point toward solid growth in Aggregates demand in 2013. We expect private construction demand to grow again in 2013 as housing starts and contract awards for private nonresidential buildings continue to improve. Additionally, we expect the stability and predictability that will come from the new federal highway bill, coupled with the potential for large TIFIA-related transportation projects to begin in several of our key states some times next year, could lead to modest growth in demand for highway construction. We will provide you with additional details in February when we report our fourth quarter results and our outlook for 2013.", "Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2012 on Slide 14. We now expect same-store shipments in 2012 to approximate the 2011 level, and total Aggregate shipments to decline approximately 1%. As a result of our successful efforts to offset the earnings effect of lower volume, we will continue to reduce controllable cost and achieve improved pricing. The geographic breadth of pricing gains achieved in the third quarter reinforces our expectations for full year freight adjusted price growth of 1% to 3% in 2012. This price growth reflects the continued recovery in private construction activity and the newly enacted federal highway legislation. We remain laser focused on improving our profitability at today's volume, while enhancing our already strong operating leverage.", "Full year earnings improvements in the company's Cement and Concrete segments are expected to offset lower Asphalt mix segment earnings. As a result, collectively, full year non-Aggregates earnings are expected to approximate last year. Cost-reduction initiatives continue to improve Vulcan's run rate profitability. These initiatives are reducing our overhead cost and support our expectations for full year SAG cost to be approximately $260 million compared to $290 million in 2011.", "We continue to focus on executing our initiatives, enabling us to generate higher levels of earnings and cash flow, further improve our operating leverage, reduce overhead cost and strengthen our credit profile.", "We now expect 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $435 million to $455 million, an improvement of 23% to 29% from the prior year and a significant accomplishment in the current economic environment. This adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects principally the earnings effect of lower volumes in Aggregates and Asphalt, and the timing of realization of our cost-reduction initiatives. Approximately $20 million of the decrease from our prior guidance is a result of the earnings effect of lower Aggregates volume, and approximately $20 million is from lower earnings in Asphalt and Concrete. The remaining $15 million relates to delay in the realization of some cost savings component of our Profit Enhancement Plan. We expect to exceed our $25 million target for our Profit Enhancement Plan in 2012, and we remain on track to achieve the target run rate savings in 2013.", "Our efforts to accelerate more of the 2013 savings into 2012 have proven more challenging than we thought earlier in the year, in part because of weaker volumes. This EBITDA guidance excludes results related to the Planned Asset Sales and cost associated with the unsolicited offer terminated earlier this year. This guidance does include $29 million in gains, of which $18 million has been realized through the first 9 months of 2012. These gains are incremental to the $4 million of routine gains completed during the normal course of business.", "The company continues to work on additional asset sales in the fourth quarter that are expected to result in $100 million to $150 million of cash proceeds, and incremental gains of $25 million to $45 million. However, the ultimate timing of these transactions is difficult to predict, and thus, we have excluded them from our current guidance.", "In terms of cash as of September 30, cash and cash equivalents total $243 million. Debt maturities in the fourth quarter of 2012 total $135 million, which we expect to pay off out of available cash. Capital spending is expected to be approximately $100 million for 2012.", "In summary, turning now to Slide 15, we are pleased to see continued earnings improvement. This quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter of higher year-over-year profitability. Overall, year-to-date controllable costs have decreased approximately $70 million. Through the first 9 months of 2012, adjusted EBITDA is up sharply from the prior year and earnings per diluted share has improved.", "Finally, we remain cautiously optimistic that construction-related fundamentals will continue to improve. Trailing 12-month contract awards for private construction continue to grow. And if history repeats itself, contract awards for highways should again begin to recover with the new federal highway bill in place.", "Demand for our products is driven by economic cycles and public infrastructure funding, which are largely beyond our control. We do have control over our cost and pricing initiatives that will enable us to generate higher levels of earnings and cash flow, further improving our operating leverage, reducing our overhead cost and strengthening our credit profile.", "With that, I'll now turn the phone over to the operator to begin your questions. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan, and we look forward to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have Bob Wetenhall from RBC on line with a question.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I was just hoping to get a little bit of clarification on the guidance. It sounds like your new range of $435 million to $455 million, that is down from $500 million which was the prior guidance, but it's up year-over-year from the $354 million number last year. Is that correct?", "Donald M. James", "That is correct.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Could you fill us in, in terms of asset sales between normally occurring and nonrecurring? What's included in that number and what's excluded?", "Donald M. James", "Bob, there was $29 million of gains that were in our $500 million guidance, which remain in our current guidance. Any other asset sales under our planned asset program are not included in our current guidance and were not included in our prior guidance, and that's the -- those are the items we talked about that could generate $100 million to $150 million of cash. Year-to-date, of the $29 million in our guidance in gains, we have already realized $18 million, and we expect to realize the remaining $11 million in the fourth quarter.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Understood. That's helpful. Could you touch on -- your sales in the Aggregates business were unfavorably impacted by volume, sales were off $24 million, but I saw that gross profit rose by $12 million. Can you just talk about the sustainability of incremental margins at that level? And kind of what's driving that? Because I assume it's pretty difficult to get better gross margins off much weaker volume, and I'm just trying to understand how that's working.", "Donald M. James", "Well, it is a combination of a lot of factors. As Danny Shepherd pointed out, our unit cost for Aggregates was down 1% in the quarter through a lot of work at the plants. Our pricing was up 4% and those are powerful numbers. We are, I think, extraordinarily well-positioned to benefit from a little bit of volume recovery. And we are, as a management team, and I think our entire employee group, is really encouraged by the fact that we are generating record levels of unit profitability at lower volume, both lower sales volumes and lower production volumes. And when volume comes back, we get a compounding effect from higher production volumes and the opportunities that come with slightly higher volumes in our market. So we're really encouraged where we are, both from the standpoint of the things that we can control, which is price and cost. And equally important, as we look at the future given the contract awards in the private sector, both housing and non-res, as well as the real opportunities from the new highway bill, in particular, the big TIFIA projects that are about to kick off in 2013, we're very encouraged by our opportunities for next year.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And if I could just sneak a last question in. Could you touch on how you think...", "[Audio Gap]", "in the Concrete business?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. As I think as Danny Shepherd pointed out, year-to-date, housing starts in Florida, for example, are up 38%. Our ready-mix shipments in Florida year-to-date are up 21%, in the last quarter, they were up 33%. So housing starts are a huge driver for Concrete demand, and obviously, every -- virtually every yard of concrete we pour has got Vulcan Aggregates in it and then Florida has Vulcan Cement in it, so that really has a significant effect not only on the Concrete business, but also the Aggregates and Cement business.", "Operator", "Trey Grooms from Stephens Incorporated is on line with a question.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Given your kind of high-level outlook, I guess, for 2013, it sounds like you're expecting improvement, I guess, pretty much across the board but especially in highways. Given that, should we be expecting any type of geographic or product mix impact on pricing as we kind of look on to the next year or so?", "Donald M. James", "Trey, it's too early for us to try to give you guidance on that. I think we expect private sector construction to grow on a percentage basis, probably significantly more in 2013 than public-sector construction. Although, we do think there is an opportunity for growth in the public sector, and the big wildcard is how quickly some of these big TIFIA projects kick off. The Interstate 95 HOT Lane project, which is a $927 million project up in Northern Virginia, is scheduled to begin in '13. The Grand Parkway in Houston, which is a $1.1 billion project, is scheduled to begin in '13. And I think the Route 460 in the Hampton Roads to Richmond TIFIA project, which is over $1.7 billion. And there is a big project in Dallas-Fort Worth, about $1.6 billion, the Southwest Parkway/Chisholm Trail. Those are 4 big TIFIA projects that are -- have the potential to start in 2013. And if they do, that could certainly impact or would significantly impact demand. But it's just really too early for us to know whether and how much of those big projects will likely to occur in '13, but the basic highway program is in place. And as I pointed out, 42% of the money for 2012 in the regular highway program was not obligated until -- by the states, until after the MAP-21 passed in July. So the effect of that is that, that made the current year weak and is pushing a disproportional amount of the 2012 highway budget into 2013. We'll have better data on all of that when we talk to you again in February. But directionally, I think we are encouraged that all end markets are likely to be up or all of our major end markets are likely to be up in 2013 over 2012.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "That's very helpful. I guess, I may have missed this in your prepared comments, but what were California volumes in the quarter?", "Donald M. James", "California volumes in the quarter were down slightly. Let me check that.", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Down about 6% or 7%.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "6% to 7%?", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Yes.", "Donald M. James", "Yes.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And then lastly, is there any update you can give us on the progress of any potential asset sales or anything like that from some of the stuff you outlined a few quarters ago?", "Donald M. James", "No. We're still working hard. We have pretty strict criteria about what we would sell and under what circumstances. But as I pointed out, it is about $100 million to $150 million of transactions that are in the process of being, I'll say, papered I guess. So we're working on those. Whether some or all of those hit in the fourth quarter or close in the fourth quarter is not certain at this point, but they are all in the process.", "Operator", "Garik Shmois from Longbow Research is on line with a question.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Don, you have outlined a number of large TIFIA projects in your markets. I was wondering if you could help us maybe understand a little bit the lag between when these projects would start and when you would actually start to see Aggregates shipments into these projects, just so as we start following these projects a little bit more closely, we might be able to time your volumes associated with them?", "Donald M. James", "Well, I wish we could project them better ourselves. We have gotten a lot of information from the TIFIA office that -- the metrics I gave you earlier all come from the TIFIA office. The particular projects that I mentioned are already approved by the Federal DOT and are likely to begin or certainly have a probability or possibility of beginning sometime in 2013. And that is the I-95 HOT Lanes in Northern Virginia, Grand Parkway in Houston, the Southwest Parkway/Chisholm Trail in Dallas-Fort Worth and the Route 460 from Hampton Roads to Richmond. Those are, I guess, in total probably $6 billion in TIFIA work. But the bigger chunk are in the letters that have been submitted to the TIFIA office and the Federal DOT for approval. And as I pointed out, the big majority of those are in Virginia, California and Texas. And as those projects get approved and as the contracting authority then starts awarding projects, we will have a lot better sense of what that would mean for the magnitude and the timing of increased shipments. But I think the real point about TIFIA is, while the regular federal highway bill is at $40 billion plus or minus a year, according to the DOT, in the next 2-year period, there could be another $40 billion over that 2-year period of incremental awards under the TIFIA program. So when we say we have optimism about growth in awards, it's based on, number one, the stability in the regular Federal Highway Program now that we have one, plus the big increase in TIFIA. The wildcard at this point is the timing of those shipments and the quantity of those shipments, and we'll continue to update you on that as we have better information.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "And I guess just switching to margins. Certainly, another good quarter of cost control. Just wondering how much of your $100 million profit enhancement program has been realized year-to-date, and perhaps if you could provide some granularity as how much was incremental in the third quarter?", "Donald M. James", "Well, as I've said in my prepared remarks, our target for 2012 was $25 million. We will get more than that. I don't have an amount that we would call out in the third quarter. But some of the metrics that would -- that you can look at is our SAG, we expect to be down $30 million in the year. Some of that is under our Profit Enhancement Plan. Some of it is from the work we had done earlier in our restructuring. Our controllable costs are down $70 million year-to-date, a significant portion of that is coming from Profit Enhancement Plan. The reason things are murky, Garik, is that we have a lot of cost initiatives going on throughout the organization. Some of it is an outline of the Profit Enhancement Plan, which we gave you earlier, which is all still in place, but there's a lot of additional stuff going on. And whether we count it as a Profit Enhancement Plan or other cost reduction is largely irrelevant to us. We just like the cost reduction. And so I think the combination of the 2 so far is about a $70 million year-to-date reduction in our controllable cost.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just my last question is on Asphalt demand. If I remember correctly coming out of the second quarter, you had anticipated year-over-year growth in Asphalt earnings, you anticipated some large project starts in the second half of the year supporting that, and now it doesn't sound like those projects are going to be starting in the back half of the year. Just wondering if you could speak to that, if I remember that correctly, maybe provide an update on to when you would anticipate some of these big projects would get under way.", "Donald M. James", "Let me refer that to Danny Shepherd.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Yes, Garik. First of all, as I pointed out, we had a good quarter in Texas and Arizona. We are challenged in California, and more specifically, Southern California, and we're moving to address that market properly. In Southern California, there was some work that was not let that was anticipated. And as you know, we are an asphalt producer/supplier, and we have customer alignments in Southern California, and some of our customers missed work in the quarter. So we are really focused on Southern California because we found that, that's our weakest asphalt market, and hopefully, we will see improvement as we travel through 2013.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. I guess just real quickly to follow up, would you anticipate some of these projects that weren't let would be let in 2013 or are these projects...", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Yes, we do. Sorry, I didn't answer that part of your question.", "Operator", "Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research is on line with a question.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "For the quarter, could you give some clarity of how much did pricing benefit from mix versus natural price increases, and maybe talk -- you touched on a little bit earlier, but maybe digging a little bit more into that dynamic with mix, particularly if we get into larger infrastructure projects that would be more base rock heavy.", "Donald M. James", "Yes. Kathryn, of our 4% price growth, about 3 percentage points of the 4% are real price growth spread over the vast majority of our markets. That's very encouraging. About 1% could be accounted for as mix shift, more of that in geographic mix, a little bit in product mix, with some asphalt, high price, high specification asphalt material. But our shipments in the Midwest were relatively lower than in the Sun Belt, and we have relatively better pricing in the Sun Belt than we do in the Midwest. And so about 3% is just across the board price improvement, about 1% is a positive mix shift. And you asked about will -- the TIFIA projects, in some cases, like in Northern Virginia with the HOT Lanes or lane additions, those are beautiful for us in the sense that the aggregate intensity per dollar of spending is about as good as it gets because, as you point out, there's base then there's the lift of either concrete or asphalt to get to the surface, the surface mixes. So they're -- but the TIFIA projects and the Grand Parkway in Houston is, I think, virtually all new construction, and that would consume base, the highway 460 in Virginia is virtually all new construction, and that would consume a full range of Aggregate products. So I think, whether that will change our pricing mix is way too early for us to tell. But you're correct that this new construction will consume base, as well as clean stone, which certainly will help with our production and production cost.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Yes. So even if pricing was slightly lower, the volume would trump that anyway?", "Donald M. James", "Oh, absolutely.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Could you talk a little bit more detail about the new resi construction activity that you see. You've talked a little bit about Florida, but also in Texas and Arizona. What scale projects are you seeing implemented? Obviously, there's been a lot of talk about new construction in all of those markets, but if you could give a sense of what types of projects and how they compared relative to the peak of the market and what you think, what is a normal market?", "Donald M. James", "Well, we are -- I'll go to the first, and I'll give some examples. Housing starts year-to-date are up 66% in Arizona. They're up 23% in California. They're up 38% in Florida. They're up 36% in North Carolina, 29% in Tennessee, 28% in Texas. In Vulcan-served counties overall, they're up 26%. That being said, they're coming from a relatively low base. So the good news is, they're up. We look at housing numbers like everyone else. I guess right now, we're in the 850,000 range, annual seasonally adjusted range. Most people are saying that will be 900,000 to maybe over 1 million. And we believe, based on what we see and hear from economists and housing experts is that the normalized run rate should be something like 1.5 million, 1.4 million to 1.5 million. And given the pent-up demand and the number of household formations, I believe there's an article in Wall Street Journal yesterday about that. We've been 5 years with collapsed housing starts, and at some point, the demographics in the U.S. are going to drive that sharply upward. And I think we're beginning to see the front end of that change. That helps our Aggregates business, but it really helps our Concrete business in Florida, California, and Texas and Northern Virginia. And I didn't mention Virginia, but Virginia, Northern Virginia, in particular, housing came back much earlier than in the rest of these states. So it's been improving now for 18 months or so.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Okay, great. Any plans on paying off the $140 million note due in 2013, what are your plans?", "Donald M. James", "We're going to pay it off out of available cash. We're not refinancing either the bonds that come due end of this year or the ones in June of next year.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Any ballpark...", "Donald M. James", "We'll have sufficient cash flow to do that. Dan, do you have a comment?", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Yes. We have over $200 million on the balance sheet at the end of September. At the end of this year, we estimate that our cash will be in the neighborhood of $100 million, and that's after paying off the December maturities. So we expect to pay the June maturity next year off out of available cash and free cash flow and not term that out, just have a net reduction in debt.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "And just to clarify, what will be the interest expense savings from this?", "Daniel F. Sansone", "That will be approximately $14 million in total interest expense should be the reduction in interest from 2012 to 2013. Of that $14 million reduction in interest expense, $12 million will be cash, $2 million is noncash.", "Operator", "We have Jack Kasprzak from BB&T Capital Markets on line with a question.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "With regard to the cost reduction, profit improvement program, what can you say about, or update us rather on what we can expect in 2013? I don't think you've changed the overall goal of the program. What's left or what will be realized in 2013? And I would expect SG&A could be down again in absolute dollars, is that -- would that be a reasonable assumption?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. And our target, as you know, is $100 million, and have in place by mid-year '13, $75 million, and by the end of '13, I think the full $100 million on a run rate, on a run-rate basis. There's a substantial procurement piece of that, and the procurement dollars savings are tied to production volume. And so if we are getting cost savings on various items in procurement, that is affected significantly by volume. So as volumes recover, we can expect that the procurement piece of the Profit Enhancement Plan to materialize in relation to volume recovery, at least in part. Not all of the procurement savings are tied to plant production, but a significant portion are. The overhead piece is largely in place, and we'll continue to get the benefit of that, and the transportation and logistics piece is being rolled out. So we're, I think, optimistic that we will achieve our targets as we have laid them out earlier this year.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay, great. Maybe this is a question for Dan. What would, could you just update us on what you think maybe a normalized tax rate is, for modeling purposes? Obviously, in recent quarters, it's been a bit all over the map.", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Yes. And unfortunately, the quarterly numbers will continue to fluctuate. Here is the way I would try to model it going forward, Jack. Build your model, get down to a pretax earnings number, earnings or loss, begin with about a 38% to 39% tax or credit, and then about $20 million of tax benefit referable to statutory depletion. So the net of those 2 numbers, marginal tax at 39% less roughly a $20 million statutory depletion benefit is going to get you pretty darn close.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Depletion's rated on volume?", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Pardon me?", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "The amount of depletion by quarter is a function of volume?", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Well, the amount of depletion annually is a function of volume. It's actually a function of revenues, but it's driven by volume. The quarterly recognition of that is a function of a set of fairly complex tax accounting rules, sometimes it's pro rata, sometimes it's not, depending on whether you're in an income or loss position. So I would -- it's tougher to give you guidance on how to build the quarterly number. I would just start with the annual number and keep tracking towards that.", "Operator", "Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo is on line with a question.", "Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask about your CapEx guidance for 2012, I think you said $100 million, and you only spent about $50 million year-to-date, so what's driving the big uptick in the fourth quarter?", "Donald M. James", "Adam, we, as we've said before, our CapEx requirements are really a function of volume, of materials. So we are still looking at that, but we do have -- we've got about an $18 million acquisition of reserves at an existing quarry that will close in the fourth quarter, and that will push our CapEx number up. But that will add a lot of reserves to a very good quarry, and that will bring us back closer to the $100 million that we're projecting.", "Daniel F. Sansone", "And the remaining difference, to get up towards the $100 million is really just a series of relatively small projects, a piece of mobile equipment there or here, or a small piece there, it's just -- there's no single project that jumps out, Adam.", "Operator", "Keith Hughes from SunTrust is on line with a question.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "You had referred in the prepared comments I believe to $15 million of cost savings that was going to be deferred into 2013, what would that bring the total cost savings look right now in 2013?

Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "You had referred to $15 million of cost saves that have been pushed into 2013.

And number 2, what kind of projects and what kind of things are you going to be doing next year to realize those numbers?", "Donald M. James", "Okay. I think we have to start back to what our targets have been. Coming into this year, we were projecting $55 million in savings from a combination of restructuring and other overhead reductions that we had put in place in 2011 and the first part of 2012. Incremental to that was our Profit Enhancement Plan which was $100 million. So a total of $155 million. And we want to have -- our target is to have all of that in place on a run-rate basis by the end of 2013. Now you're trying to put a number in your model, I guess, for 2013.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "That's correct.", "Donald M. James", "Through the third quarter, our controllable cost, which is a combination of all of these things, are down about $70 million. So the remainder of that $155 million, we will have in place on a run-rate basis by the end of '13. How much of that will be actually realized and taken to the bottom line in 2013, we'll give you better guidance on that in February after we've gone through our -- completed our planning and budgeting process.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "But the $70 million you referred to is not bottom line, that a run rate number?", "Donald M. James", "That's bottom line.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "That's bottom line?", "Donald M. James", "That's bottom line.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So but the project, whatever it falls to in the near term in terms of cash or the bottom line, the project will be done at the end of 2013, is that still the plan?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. And I would say this as a caveat. The officially announced Profit Enhancement Plan will be completed on a run-rate basis by '13. It is remarkable to me the opportunities our guys in the plants and in the regions are finding, and I think we will continue to find opportunities for cost savings above and beyond those targets, particularly when we start seeing some volume recovery, which can pull, for example, more of the enhanced procurement savings through the bottom line with additional volume. So we're focused on the $155 million, but I think there are additional opportunities if what we see as volume growth in 2013 materializes.", "Operator", "Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee is on line with a question.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Don, you have talked about the growth that you're seeing in nonresidential private construction, can you sort of unpeel that a little bit and talk about where and which of the subtypes of non-res you're seeing activity in versus which ones maybe not so much?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. And I guess I'll refer you back to Slide 11 and Slide 13. Slide 11 is other public infrastructure. That's water, sewer, airports. And you see a bump up in contract awards from the stimulus, then once the stimulus contract awards were done, huge drop, and now you see beginning in sort of April of this year, contract awards turning positive again, on a trailing 12-month basis. So we're seeing that trend. And then if you flip back over to Slide 13, and I don't know whether you're able to do that or not online. But in terms of private non-res buildings, you see a very distinct pattern, where beginning about in first or second quarter of 2011, we started seeing contract awards improving, turning positive on a trailing 12-month basis, and that has continued through the most recent months. Now there is -- and you can also see from that slide, there's probably a 12-month lag between contract awards and actual construction, but there's a very clear pattern. So Todd, I think it's in the private non-res buildings category, and then the publicly funded infrastructure categories where we're seeing contract awards that are positive now for 10 or 12 or 15 months in a row on a trailing 12-month basis, and they will begin to pull material through as those projects get under construction.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it, perfect. And with regard to price, I think you said in the release that prices were up in most every market, is there any place that, that is -- that, that's more difficult or where you're not seeing price go through?", "Donald M. James", "Within a relatively narrow range, pricing has been stable to improving. The markets where our pricing was not up in the quarter, it's only down like 1% or so. So it's -- pricing is stable, and we're getting good opportunity, as I said, they're up in almost every market, a couple of markets where they're down, they're only down 1%.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And on those markets where they're down 1%, just to be clear, is that a same product, same store shift or is there a mix impact on that? I guess I'm just wondering if real price is dropping anywhere still.", "Donald M. James", "I would not suggest that real price is dropping anywhere. There are anecdotal spots, but a lot of that's mix shift. I think more than any quarter so far this year, we've got real price improvement showing up across the board.", "Operator", "Mike Betts from Jefferies is on line with a question.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions related to the downstream business, and I guess, maybe I'll ask the first one because the second one depends on the answer to the first one. You talked already, Don, that the ready-mix and I guess the Asphalt has a lot of your own Aggregates in. In the way you report gross profit, does the profit on those Aggregates appear in the Aggregates division or does it appear in the Asphalt and ready-mix divisions depending on where they are, that's my first question.", "Donald M. James", "It appears in the Aggregates segment. We attempt to price the Aggregates that are consumed in our Asphalt and Concrete business at market prices for the market in which the Concrete and Asphalt businesses operate, and the profit on the Aggregate is in the Aggregate segment. And with respect to Cement, we try to do the same thing. We try to price the cement to our ready-mix plants at market for Cement and the margin on the Cement is reported in the Cement segment. We also are very sensitive to the lack of profitability in our ready-mix business and are working hard to improve that. But reality is, we also have to look at that on what that business, every yard of concrete that goes out, how much margin is embedded in that, in our Aggregates segment and our Cement segment.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And that's what I thought was the case. And I guess the follow-up question then is, I'm surprised that the disparity between Asphalt and ready-mix, not so much in where the ready-mix is, but where the Asphalt is, because presumably really most basically, the majority of that is heating the raw materials and adding the bitumen, yet you're still making pretty good margin on that. Or am I missing something there?  Because, I mean, it's a huge disparity between those 2.", "Donald M. James", "The Asphalt business is a good business if -- the variability in earnings is largely a function of the cost of liquid asphalt versus the time we can get that higher cost built into our pricing. And we get higher Asphalt margins typically in periods in which liquid asphalt is ebbing down, and then the reverse is true when liquid asphalt prices are moving up. I think in this quarter, liquid asphalt prices were up about 2.5% or 2.6%, something in that range, which squeezed our margins a little bit. The real issue in Asphalt though is volume. And with, hopefully, improving demand in highway construction, both regular highway construction and TIFIA construction, in the states where we have asphalt, which are California and Texas primarily, but also in Arizona, that we'll benefit from higher highway construction.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That leads nicely to my final question, Don. Just in relation to those 2 businesses, to help with modeling, because I always seem to be wrong on them. Roughly what proportion of the costs in the Asphalt business and what proportion of the costs in the ready-mix business are fixed costs when we're trying to model the impact of additional volume will be? How much is fixed and how much is variable on the cost side?", "Donald M. James", "I'm going to refer that question to Mr. Sansone who is working vigorously to calculate.", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Mike, on the Asphalt business -- I'm sorry, on the ready-mix business first, I would say that the traditional fixed costs would represent something in the neighborhood of 10% of average selling price for the product. It's not a fixed cost intensive business. It might be a few percentage points higher than that, but not a lot. It's basically depreciation and some supervisory cost. In the case of the Asphalt business, a fairly similar although even less fixed cost in that business, probably in the neighborhood of between 5% and 10% of average selling price. So again, they are not -- they're going to really -- what's going to drive earnings in both of those business is what we refer to as material margin, which is the difference between the average selling price and the cost of the raw materials, meaning aggregates and liquid asphalt and/or cement. [indiscernible] fixed costs in those businesses.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And the point about higher volumes means you've got a better chance of increasing that materials margin, I guess, that's the key point.", "Daniel F. Sansone", "That's right. Absolutely.", "Operator", "Stuart Benway from S&P Capital IQ is on line with a question.", "Stuart J. Benway - S&P Equity Research", "Could you just give us a breakdown of how much of your business volume, I guess, really is in residential versus nonresidential versus industrial versus municipal?", "Donald M. James", "Our projection for this year is that highways would account for 30% or 31% of our aggregate volume. Infrastructure would be about 18% or 19%. Residential, about 17% or 18%. Non-res, about 29%. And nonconstruction, which would be environmental and agricultural, would be about 4%. And the residential historically has been 20% to 25%. And those are not materially different numbers than 2011. So in this current demand environment, that's about the breakout. That will shift as housing and private non-res begin to recover, particularly housing.", "Stuart J. Benway - S&P Equity Research", "And how about energy, is that in the nonconstruction or non-res?", "Donald M. James", "Energy is in probably infrastructure.", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Yes. So if you were building a power plant, it would be in the infrastructure, other infrastructure category that we highlighted in the slides.", "Stuart J. Benway - S&P Equity Research", "Okay. Then just -- I mean, the volume was down in the third quarter, and you say it was because of weakness in public construction activity, so is that pretty much from the winding down of the stimulus program, do you think?", "Donald M. James", "Well, it's from 2 reasons. One is, the winding down of stimulus projects, and there are still some stimulus projects, we're still shipping to some stimulus projects. But by and large, the volume going to those projects is tailing off. The other impact is that until July of this year, we did not have a federal highway bill. And even though there was roughly $40 billion in the pipeline for fiscal year 2012, which ended September 30, the states were very cautious about spending money on highway projects and awarding new contracts. So I said in my remarks that 42% of the 2012 federal highway money was not even obligated until the last 2 months of the year, which were August and September, which means that only 58% of the 2012 highway budget was even obligated. Obligation is a step before contract award. And if you look on the slide we had on contract award, you see a very prolonged period of declining trailing 12-month highway contract award certainly beginning to -- the rate of decline beginning to reduce, but it's not yet turned positive. The last positive trailing 12-month period was probably February of 2011. So we've now been, whatever that is, 18 months or so with declining contract awards. And I think the point is, given the passage of the highway bill in July, given the obligation of 42% of the 2012 highway budget in the last 2 months of -- that is in August and September, and given the fact that we have a new highway bill and a big TIFIA potential, we think we'll see recovery in highways. But it's been -- the highway sector, and to some extent, the public infrastructure sector that has been weaker in the current period than we think either the past or the future will indicate. Now there's one other little piece in nonconstruction, and that is the environmental stone to coal burning power plants. That's a small but important piece of our business, but that's way down because utilities are burning more gas and less coal generally, and so consumption of chemical stone for power plants is down sharply, but that's a really small part of our business.", "Stuart J. Benway - S&P Equity Research", "Just one last quick one. Have you made any -- can you give us any guidance for CapEx for 2013 or is that a volume projection as well?", "Donald M. James", "We'll give you that in February. At this point, we're still developing our 2013 CapEx budgets.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr.  James for closing remarks.", "Donald M. James", "Well, thank you very much for joining us today and your interest in Vulcan. And we look forward to talking to you again in February. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. James, you may begin.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for 2012. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will refer to during the call. These slides are also available to you on the webcast.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call today as indicated on our Slide 2 of our presentation contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risk and uncertainties that are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "In addition, during the call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's fourth quarter 2012 earnings release and in the Investor Relations section of Vulcan's website.", "I want to begin today by briefly discussing a few highlights for the year.", "Turning to Slide 3. In 2012, our company reported significantly improved earnings during continued challenging market conditions. For the full year, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $411 million, a 17% increase from 2011 on flat revenues. We achieved this result by improving gross profit margins by 210 basis points and by reducing overhead expense 11%. We continued to generate higher Aggregate profitability in 2012. Aggregates cash gross profit per ton increased 5% to $4.21, and Aggregates segment gross profit margin increased 270 basis points in 2012. This was driven by our cost reduction efforts and a 2% increase in Aggregates selling prices for the year.", "In addition, we took meaningful steps to strengthen our balance sheet during the year. We retired $135 million of debt as scheduled, and ended the year with $275 million in cash.", "We also made progress on our Planned Asset Sales, generating $174 million in total gross proceeds. These transactions include the recently announced sale of reclaimed and excess land in California, 1 small quarry in rural Virginia, and a percentage of future production at 4 Aggregate quarries in South Carolina.", "Moving on to Slide 4, you'll see a snapshot of our full year financial results.", "As you can see from this table, despite flat revenues, we increased gross profit by $50 million and increased adjusted EBITDA by $59 million compared to last year. A significant portion of the EBITDA improvement relates to our restructuring plan initiated at the end of 2011. As a result of those efforts, we decreased SAG expense by $31 million, despite an increase in non-cash pension expense due solely to lower discount rates.", "These improved operating results flowed through to significant improvements in reported and adjusted EPS from continuing operations.", "Moving now to Slide 5. Improving our profitability was a key highlight of our 2012 results, and strengthens our ability to take advantage of an improving demand environment.", "As you can see on this slide, our cost reduction initiatives, coupled with stronger pricing, enabled us to generate higher levels of profitability in 2012. Gross profit margin was 13.9% for the year, up from 11.8% in 2011. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.1%, up from 14.6% in 2011.", "We also improved profitability in our Aggregates business. Aggregates gross profit margin was 20.4% for the year. And as I indicated earlier, cash gross profit per ton increased 5% to $4.21 per ton, a 27% increase from the same measure of profitability in 2005 when volumes peaked.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd, who will walk you through our segment results. Danny?", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Thanks, Don.", "Turning to Slide 6, for a review our Aggregates performance in 2012.", "Our Aggregates business generated $593 million in cash gross profit in 2012 as compared to $573 million in 2011. This bridge chart shows how improved pricing and effective cost controls have more than offset lower volumes during the year. The effects of lower volume reduced cash gross profit by $12 million. Key states, including Florida and Texas, reported full year growth in volumes versus the prior year. Other markets in key states, such as Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia, were down modestly in 2012. Full year shipments in California were relatively flat versus prior year. In some markets, the decline in shipments can be attributed to very favorable weather in December 2011 as compared to more normalized weather in 2012.", "Less large-scale project work also contributed to lower shipments in certain markets compared to the comparable period last year. Diesel fuel increased 3% in 2012, reducing Aggregates cash gross profit approximately $4 million. We benefited from a 2% increase in pricing during the year, which added $27 million to cash gross profit.", "Pricing in the fourth quarter remained strong, increasing 4% from the prior-year period. Finally, cost improvements increased cash gross profit by $9 million, more than offsetting the earnings effect of higher unit cost for diesel fuel.", "Now if you'll turn to Slide 7, you'll see from this chart that we remain encouraged by the momentum we've seen over the last year as our Aggregates unit profitability continues to improve. In 2012, cash gross profit per ton increased 5% to $4.21, and we remain focused on driving that number even higher.", "Our cash gross profit per ton continues to improve from a cyclical low in the third quarter of 2011, reflecting the cumulative effect of our cost control efforts and a disciplined approach to pricing during the downturn. These efforts are establishing unit profitability higher than in 2005, which was a peak year for volumes, adding to the attractiveness of the earnings potential of our Aggregates business as volumes recover.", "Now if you turn to Slide 8 for an update on the performance of non-aggregates for the year.", "In total, gross profit for our non-aggregates segment improved approximately $4 million from the prior year. In Asphalt, volumes were down 7% due in part to fewer large projects in California in the second half of 2012 and the divestiture of our New Mexico Asphalt business in a swap transaction completed in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "Asphalt volumes in Texas were up 15% from the prior year. Material margins remain steady despite lower volumes, finishing the year 3% higher than the prior year.", "In our Concrete and Cement segments, volumes continued to recover from cyclical lows. For the year, Concrete and Cement volumes were up 9% and 18%, respectively. These 2 segments benefited from increased private construction activity during the year, as well as year-over-year growth in pricing for Cement. Pricing in Concrete was relatively flat for the prior year.", "Concrete gross profit improved by roughly $5.1 million compared to the year-ago period. Cement segment gross profit increased $1.7 million from the prior year. As we move forward, we remain focused on maximizing the Aggregates shipments that have pulled through our downstream businesses, while improving the profit and cash flow performance of these valuable assets, much in the same way we've done for Aggregates.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Don.", "Donald M. James", "Thank you, Danny.", "Before discussing current market trends, I want to briefly review our fourth quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 9.", "We improved gross profit margin by 90 basis points on slightly lower sales. Overall, SAG expenses were $67 million in the quarter, down from $72 million in the fourth quarter 2011. Fourth quarter EBITDA, including gains on sale of real estate and businesses, restructuring charges and exchange offer costs was $137 million compared to $85 million in the prior year. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA was $90 million versus $95 million in the prior year. These transactions mark important progress in our Planned Asset Sales initiative.", "These transactions include the sale of reclaimed and excess land in California and 1 small quarry in rural Virginia. Since 1998, we have sold $450 million of reclaimed and excess land, averaging over $32 million per year. We view these transactions as an integral, ongoing part of our Aggregates business and a way to continue to add value for our shareholders.", "The proceeds from these transactions are used to expand our Aggregates asset portfolio and to strengthen our balance sheet, as I will highlight on the next slide.", "On Slide 10, we summarized our debt and leverage positions. Net debt declined 10% in 2012, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved from 7.6 to 5.8, all without a meaningful recovery in demand for Aggregates. We have sufficient cash on the balance sheet to fund our scheduled maturity in the second quarter 2013, after which, we have no maturities until the fourth quarter of 2015. Strengthening our balance sheet remains a top priority for our management team.", "Turning now to Slide 11, I want to spend a few minutes commenting on key end markets for Aggregates.", "Our views about highway construction are more encouraging than they were a year ago, reflecting passage in July of 2012 of a new federal highway bill, MAP-21, that took effect October 1, 2012.", "On this Slide 11, we have shown across the bottom, a historical timeline that captures the last 2 federal highway bills, TEA-21 and SAFETEA-LU, as well as the periods of time when federal highway legislation had lapsed, and funding was by a series of short-term extensions, represented on the graph by no bill. The blue bars represent the year-over-year change in trailing 12-month contract awards for highways, a leading indicator of highway construction activity. As the chart shows, growth in new project activity has historically followed the passage of federal highway bills. This new legislation is providing stability and predictability to future highway funding as we move forward.", "Digging a little deeper on Slide 12, we have plotted the year-over-year change in the obligation of federal funds for the regular highway program. Obligations are a leading indicator of future project bidding activity, which in turn, lead to Aggregates consumption. An obligation is the point in time when the Federal Highway Administration commits to fund its share of eligible projects. At that point, the project can proceed to bidding and construction by the state departments of transportation. During the first 3 months of fiscal year 2013, which of course, is the last quarter of calendar 2012, the obligation of federal funds for new projects is up more than 90% versus the prior year. This represents the first time in 15 months we've seen growth in this area, providing an encouraging indicator for the rest of 2013.", "If history repeats itself, contract awards for new highway projects should begin to grow now that MAP-21 is in place and state DOTs have more funding certainty with which to proceed. The growth in obligations may provide the first glimpse into that planning.", "Turning now to Slide 13.", "The large increase in funding from the Transportation Infrastructure Financing Innovation Act, or TIFIA, contained in the new highway bill, should also have a positive impact on future Aggregates demand. We expect only limited impact on 2013 shipments from TIFIA-funded projects, but we should see a meaningful activity in 2014 and beyond from these large projects.", "Letters of intent -- or letters of interest for TIFIA projects totaling $77 billion in construction costs have been filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Of this total, $49 billion or 64% are located in Vulcan served counties. The 43 projects in our markets are highlighted on the map shown here.", "Slide 14 shows the year-over-year change in contract awards for new construction and construction put in place for other public infrastructure, that is publicly funded infrastructure other than highways. These contract awards have been increasing for 9 consecutive months. And we are optimistic that this contract award growth will continue, leading to growth in actual construction activity.", "Turning to Slide 15, private non-residential construction growth has also continued to slow -- to show steady recovery. U.S. contract awards, as measured by square feet, are up 14% from the prior year, led by growth in commercial and office buildings and hotels. In Vulcan served states, contract awards are up 17%. More significantly, awards in Vulcan's key states of California, Texas and Florida increased 42%, 33% and 27%, respectively.", "Moving now to Slide 16.", "Residential housing starts also continued to improve in our markets and at an increasing rate. Leading indicators of affordability, supply-demand balance and household formations continue to improve and point toward housing starts moving back toward structural demand levels.", "On Slide 17, you can see the positive effect of growth in housing starts in many of our key states, some of which were hit hardest by the economic downturn. As a result of improvement in both residential and non-residential leading indicators, Aggregates demand in private construction is growing as well. We're seeing tangible evidence of this growth in several key states, including Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona. However, given the low point from which the recovery began, the full positive effect of the leading indicators will take time to materialize and significantly impact our shipments.", "Danny Shepherd mentioned earlier the volume growth in our ready-mixed Concrete and Cement businesses due to this increased private construction. Another indicator of how increased residential construction is driving volume growth is in our Florida Concrete block business. In 2012, our Concrete block volumes were up 35%, including a 54% increase in the fourth quarter. Sustained growth in housing starts in these states will benefit both our industry-leading Aggregates businesses, as well as our non-aggregates businesses, particularly Concrete and Cement.", "Turning now to our outlook on Slide 18.", "We continued to expect that improved pricing, aggressive cost control initiatives and some volume growth will enable us to generate another year of earnings growth in 2012. Demand for Aggregates in our markets is expected to grow by mid-single-digits in 2013. Aggregates demand from residential construction is expected to experience double-digit increases, while demand from private non-residential buildings is expected to increase by high single digits versus 2012.", "Our current visibility and expectation for growth in Aggregates demand in the public construction, including highways and other infrastructure, is limited given the variability and lead time required from award of contract to the start of construction, particularly for the large TIFIA projects.", "As we look at the projects that could impact our 2013 Aggregates volume, we see a disproportionately greater number of large discrete highway and industrial projects. The timing of these projects is difficult to predict. As a result, our full year shipments in '13 are expected to increase 1% to 5%, with most of the expected year-over-year growth to occur in the second half of the year, due in part to the favorable weather we experienced in the first quarter of 2012.", "We will continue our focus on those efforts that we can control, including reducing costs and improving pricing. The geographic breadth of the pricing gains achieved in 2012 reinforces our expectation for continued growth in pricing in 2013. We expect the [ph] [indiscernible] Aggregates pricing to increase by approximately 4%. We also expect earnings in each of our non-aggregates segments to improve versus the prior year and contribute to earnings growth in 2013.", "Asphalt materials margin increased throughout 2012, and should contribute to earnings growth in 2013. Concrete volumes and materials margin are improving as housing starts continue to recover in our key states. Cement earnings should also improve in 2013, due mostly to lower production costs.", "Our outlook for 2013 reflects our previously stated Profit Enhancement targets. These pricing and cost initiatives should allow us to more than offset the effects of higher cost of key materials and supplies, and maintaining competitive wages for our employees.", "Our cost assumptions in our full year include flat to slightly down SAG expenses, interest expense of approximately $197 million and DD&A of approximately $300 million. Our current capital spending plan for 2013 includes about $150 million. However, actual spending will depend on business conditions and opportunities throughout the year.", "In terms of Planned Asset Sales, as I mentioned, we recently announced a number of asset sales that generated total gross proceeds of over $170 million. We will continue to work on additional asset sales moving into 2013, though the ultimate timing of such transactions is difficult to predict. Overall, we remain committed to completing transactions designed to strengthen our balance sheet, unlock capital for more productive uses, improve our operating results and create additional value for shareholders.", "In summary, our earnings improvement achieved in 2012 is something we expect to build upon in 2013. Despite a challenging demand environment of volumes, we delivered solid increases in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. We continue to build on the momentum in our Aggregates business. The fourth quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of higher year-over-year profitability in Aggregates as a result of our cost and pricing initiatives. We strengthened our balance sheet through further debt reduction, and made important progress on our Planned Asset Sales program. In addition, we have made strategic investments to enhance our Aggregate assets portfolio, which already delivers among the highest profit margins in our industry.", "With strategic acquisitions in both Texas and Georgia, 2 of the fastest-growing regions and urban markets in the U.S., we are optimistic for continued recovery in our markets as housing starts and contract awards for non-residential buildings continue to improve. We're also looking forward to more predictable funding for public construction projects related to the passage of the new federal highway bill and an expanded TIFIA program.", "As we look ahead, our management team will continue to focus on factors within our control, such as cost control and pricing initiatives, to generate higher levels of earnings and cash flow, further improving our operating leverage and strengthening our credit profile, while building our Aggregates position in key markets.", "And with that, I'll now turn it over to the operator to begin with the questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Did a nice job with pricing in the quarter, and wanted to get a better sense of what was mix versus price increases. And also, given overall improvement in volumes, we see more consistency, could you maybe discuss where pricing potentially could go over the next couple of years based on your past experience?", "Donald M. James", "Kathryn, we got some favorable mix, but also a lot of just absolute price increases on the same products. So a blend of the 2 to get the 4% we had in the quarter.", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Probably 3/4 of the improvement or more was pure price.", "Donald M. James", "If you look at the history of this industry, clearly, when there is volume recovery and visibility of future volume recovery, there are more opportunities for price improvement, and we certainly see that in our guidance for 2013. And certainly, as we look beyond 2013, we continue to see opportunities for improved pricing and margin, particularly as we continue to get the benefit of our cost initiatives.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Could you review -- what are your highest per unit price states for Aggregate product?", "Donald M. James", "It tends to be Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, California. The lowest priced markets tend to be the Midwest.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Okay. So all areas -- or at least a portion of the areas where you're seeing some good strength?", "Donald M. James", "Yes.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Is it safe to say that these price increases will be more than enough to offset increases in cost and mix? If you could talk a little bit more on the cost side of what you're seeing in terms of increases there.", "Donald M. James", "The answer to the first part of your question is, yes, we certainly believe we will get price increases in excess of cost increases. Cost increases in our business are materials and supplies in '13 and wages. We expect to continue with competitive wage increases for our employees. And that has a -- will have an impact on our cost in 2013. Other costs that have been significant in prior years' cost increases, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt, we expect some modest increase in 2013, but at a lower percentage rate than we've seen over the last 2 or 3 years. So we think those are within reasonable ranges. So we don't see a tremendous amount of cost pressure in 2013 in the Aggregates business.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Okay, great. And finally, helpful detail that you gave on the public end market. Given your past experience with the increase in obligations that you've seen, maybe excluding the stimulus timeline,  but say, going back further, what's a typical lag that you've seen between obligations and real -- and seeing a more meaningful increase in obligations in that realistically flowing through the market? And maybe talk -- because it is a little bit different  this time because it does appear, at least based on our work, that you're getting a greater percentage of longer-term projects in this cycle versus in prior cycles. And I'd love your opinion on that also.", "Donald M. James", "Well, I agree with you. We are seeing -- largely because of the TIFIA work, but there's a -- there is likely to be a larger proportion of particularly highway spending and perhaps some other surface transportation infrastructure spending like rail, high-speed rail, in big projects over the next -- probably construction time over the next 3, 4 years as these TIFIA projects roll out. If you study our charts, you will see that while the obligations of federal highway dollars are up sharply, we're not yet seeing the increase in contract awards. So there is a lag there. A lot of states are holding relatively large bid lettings this spring, and once that we go through that cycle, we will expect to see contract awards moving up significantly as they have in all of the prior highway bill times in which  federal highway bills have passed. Early in that highway bill cycle, the state DOTs want to go out and get their projects obligated and then contract awards, and we don't see any reason why that cycle will not repeat itself [indiscernible].", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "Okay. And in terms of -- you alluded to somewhat in your prepared comments, but in general, you don't expect to see any meaningful volume to flow through at least in the back half of this year, but more likely into 2014.", "Donald M. James", "And that's hard -- I would agree with that statement. There is -- depending upon the timing of when some of these large projects actually start, both TIFIA projects and industrial projects, and I'm sure you're aware that, particularly along the Gulf Coast, there are a large number of big industrial projects that could begin some time in 2013, including the Airbus plant in Mobile, several refinery and LNG projects along the Gulf Coast, some chemical plant expansions or greenfield developments on the Gulf Coast. So there are a lot of big projects out there, both publicly funded and privately funded, that are going to use significant volumes of heavy construction materials. We believe we're well-positioned to participate in many of those projects. But for us to tell you that shipments will begin in the third quarter or the fourth quarter of 2013 or the first or second quarter 2014 is not terribly clear at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Don, I was wondering if you take a step back and you think about, let's just say, the next 3 years for the sake of argument, and it looks like the private non-res cycle's intact and you talked about some of the opportunities in the relatively near-term, and residential certainly looks like it's intact. You've got a 2-year mini bill, and hopefully, we get something bigger on the back end. We've got TIFIA to look forward to, and it certainly looks like a bunch of state initiatives. So as much as you'd say, look, there's concerns about kind of broader public spending, as it pertains to roads and highways, I think people are appropriately optimistic. Do you think there's any reason why the first 3 years of an up cycle would look much different than what we've seen historically when, on average, you'd see mid-single-digit or better growth per year? And again, this is over a 3-year basis, so I'm not asking you to say for 2013 necessarily, but is there any reason to think that this cycle would look different than prior cycles?", "Donald M. James", "Ted, when we've gone back and looked at the last 5 or 6 construction cycles in the U.S., you always see very robust recovery. This cycle is different in a couple of ways. It has been both longer and deeper than anything we have seen, going all the way back to the depression. So an argument can be made if the slope and length of the downturn is proportional to the slope and length of the upturn, which you can see in all the last 5 recessions, we could have a very long and very robust recovery. We are seeing it in housing. We are beginning to see it in private non-res. And as you know, the vast majority and cyclicality in the heavy construction materials business is in the private sector, and there remains relative stability throughout the downturns on publicly-funded projects, although there is some cyclicality there as well due to tax revenue changes. But I think we are cautiously optimistic that we've got a very good run in front of us. It's harder to say when the big turn occurs than that it will occur, but we're -- we believe there's a tremendous upside. If you look at where we are in relation to peak volumes, Concrete's 35% of peak in 2012, Asphalt's a little over 50% of peak, Aggregates are less than half of peak, and our improved profitability gives us tremendous opportunity to, as we've said publicly, to certainly get back to peak earnings long before we get back to peak volume. And that's all encouraging for us.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. The second thing I was hoping to run through, and I don't know if it's you, Don, or Dan or John McPherson's on the line, but just hoping to square up kind of the impact we saw from the Profit Enhancement Plan in 2012, and if we still think you get $75 million in 2013, as I think was the last kind of target and where we should look for those benefits?", "Donald M. James", "I'll let Danny and Dan, if he'd like to, comment on that.", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Well, as Don commented earlier, Ted, our reduced SAG cost of roughly $31 million was a huge step in our overall Profit Enhancement program. And we remain committed not to have expense creep in that category, and our budget shows a further reduction in 2013. But we are on track. As you look at sourcing and some of our transportation initiatives, we're very confident that we can deliver the numbers that we've given you in the past. I mean, our run rates tell us that we will achieve what we've committed.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "And Ted, just to remind you and the other participants in the call how we framed that objective last year, we said that we would enhance profitability at current volume levels, i.e., 2011 volume levels, by $100 million through a series of initiatives that affected both costs and revenue. And as we triangulate our outlook for 2013 against that stated objective, we come back and can point to the achievement of that 2013 run -- that 2013 amount of $75 million that was supposed to hit the P&L in that year. And as Danny said, be at the full $100 million run rate in the second half of 2013. So again, the important measuring point is enhance profitability by $100 million at current volumes, we stated that on the heels of 2011. So that's how we benchmark and measure it ourselves.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask a little more on your view on private non-residential construction. You're talking about high single-digit growth for the year. I believe you'd mentioned hotels is an area that -- could you get into any kind of detail where you think the strength and what sectors there would probably be lagging over the next year or so?", "Donald M. James", "Well, if you take a look at our chart on private non-res buildings, you can see substantial growth in contract awards as you measure by trailing 12 months, began really in 2011 and is continuing. We also show a line on construction put in place, which is an indicator of the lag between, in private non-res, the contract award and the construction. We are seeing probably the most robust market right now for private non-res office buildings is in the District of Columbia, where there's a tremendous amount of construction; Miami, of all places, which at one point had a glut of high-rise condos that we thought would take 10 years to consume is now back in the high-rise condo construction business. Texas remains strong in all sorts of ways. And Florida, if you look at just the contract awards there, are encouraging. Atlanta is lagging somewhat, and some of the Midwestern markets are lagging somewhat. But overall, when you look at the contract awards across the country and particularly in our markets, it's pretty well diverse, and we are encouraged by what we see at the macro level, as well as particularly from the bottom up in our markets.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Desi DiPierro with RBC.", "Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "On the -- with the range for volumes that you gave minus [indiscernible] the 1% seemed conservative, and I think you talked about it that if it did come in at that range, that will be primarily due to delays in public spending. And so then if that were to happen, you could imply, right, that 2014 that would be stronger than it would normally be, correct?", "Donald M. James", "Yes, Desi, it's both public -- big public projects and some big private projects. And it's really the timing of those 2 is the reason. It's very difficult for us to peg the range of projected volume increase any tighter. We'll be able to update that as we go through the year, as we get better information about which projects we'll participate in and what the projected timing of shipments will be on those projects, but it's both public and private. And we are -- I think there is very little risk in the publicly funded side of this because of -- even if sequestration goes into effect in Washington on March 1, there is very little of the regular federal highway bill that will be affected, and I think none of the TIFIA program will be affected. The sequestration would not touch the regular federal Highway Trust Fund. It would only touch the supplemental appropriation that's in -- that was put in the Federal Highway Program for 2013. It would be about 5.2% of that, which is a total of about $322 million, then there's another $38 million, and another program that would be subject to sequestration. But out of the total of $40 billion or $41 billion for the Federal Highway Program x TIFIA in 2000 -- or in FY '13, only about a maximum of $360 million would be subject to sequestration even if it goes into effect. So we aren't -- we don't think there's a risk to the federal funding of highways during the remainder of the year and into next year.", "Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then on -- when you think about these large -- disproportionately large projects, is that something that you would expect to be a trend over the next several years or is that something you're just seeing this year?", "Donald M. James", "Well, there are 2 things going on here. One is that with the 3-year absence of a federal highway bill and a series of short-term funding extensions, the state DOTs tended to do more maintenance and small projects because the visibility of future funding was not out there. TIFIA is designed to fill that gap. And almost by definition, these TIFIA projects are great, big multi-year projects that have various funding sources in addition to what we would call the regular federal highway program. So I think the answer to your question is, yes, both because of the hiatus of a regular federal highway bill for 3 years up until July of 2012, plus, and as you look at the stars on our map about where those big projects are, they are almost all in high-growth markets where the need for new construction and new highway capacity is greatest, and also where people have sort of gotten over the issue of tolling. And these projects are almost all toll roads. And in big high-growth states, there's a saying, it's either a toll road or no road. So I think while in some of the low growth states, tolling is not politically popular, but you start looking at California, Virginia, Texas, now Georgia, tolling is an increasingly viable source for highway funding, which enables these large TIFIA projects.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I just had one question and it relates to the guidance for '13, and maybe I'm reading a little bit too finely into what you said, but you suggested that demand should be mid single-digit, but your volumes expect to be at 1 to 5. And so my interpretation of that is that you're underperforming the demand or underperforming your markets. So can you correct me or tell me what the discrepancy is if there [ph] exists?", "Donald M. James", "Sure. Demand is based on macro factors. When you start taking a look at contract awards and all the other moving parts, then our volume forecast is  based significantly on our bottom-up view. The reason there's a disparity really goes back to what we have talked about in response to several questions, and that is the timing of those projects. And we are being, I think, intentionally conservative by saying 1 to 5 in the face of a mid-single digit or 4%, 5% demand increase in our markets. But I think in this large project work we are uniquely [indiscernible] vis-\u00e0-vis many of our competitors to participate in those projects, because they are large projects, a lot of volume, we can supply those projects from multiple sources, so we're feeling very good about our ability to participate in those projects and we wouldn't characterize it at all as underperforming. I think we believe we will get a fair share of those projects. It's really, for us, more a question of the timing of when those projects actually go. And I don't think the macro topside view of those projects is any more accurate than we are with respect to timing. They are out there. They exist. They will be funded in most cases and they will go in most cases, but it's really a question of whether enough of them kick off in the second half of the year for us to get to the top end of our guidance range or not.", "Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And the second question is you were talking about the Highway Trust Fund and we've been --  you've been -- a lot of comments talked about '14 and beyond and the stage of this recovery, and whether or not it will be longer or different. One thing though that I'm wondering about still is just the Highway Trust Fund. I mean the CBO is projecting, I think, it to be back insolvent again by '14 or '15, I can't tell from the chart. Nonetheless, there's still some structural problems there. So I was wondering given your insight into potentially D.C., what you're hearing or seeing or thinking about that?", "Donald M. James", "Well, I think you're correct that by the end of the current federal highway bill in end of FY '14, which would be September 30, 2014, the Highway Trust Fund will have an essentially 0 balance. I spent last week in Washington talking to many congressmen and senators in both parties -- everybody is looking for a solution. To say that there is one currently, it would be way too optimistic. But I don't think anyone believes that the Federal Highway Program and the funding levels that we have experienced in the past and including those today are adequate to meet the needs of the upcoming years. How that's going to be funded remains to be seen. I think you're seeing a fair amount of movement in various states and looking at alternative funding mechanisms. You're probably aware in Virginia, for example, that the governor has proposed a new sales tax to replace gasoline tax and increase the amount of funding for highways. I think it passed the House, a different version just passed the Senate, and ultimately, that will be resolved in some form or fashion. But states are looking at alternative funding mechanisms, and hopefully, those will provide some precedent for how the federal government will look at that. There are a lot of different discussions going on about tax on vehicle miles traveled rather than fuel consumption, there are a lot of issues with that. There's not a resolution, but there's clearly a very strong awareness of the issue. The new Head of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Bill Shuster, is very aware of it, very committed to solve the problem. His Democratic colleague from West Virginia, Nick Rahall, equally is aware of the problem and committed to a solution. On the Senate side, the -- Senator Boxer from California led the bipartisan effort in the Senate EPW Committee to come up with the compromises necessary to get the current bill passed. And as you recall, it came out of that committee with an 18 to 0 vote. And then Senator David Vitter from Louisiana is the ranking Republican now on that committee, and he's also very committed to a new highway program and adequate funding. So we're in communication steadily with those leaders in Congress. And while there is no solution, there certainly is a lot of energy and interest in finding the solution.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Seth Yeager with Jefferies.", "Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies & Company, Inc. Fixed Income Research", "Just based on some of your guidance and the outlook for just overall construction activity in the current year, I would imagine you guys should be generating a fair amount of free cash flow. You do have a stub piece of debt coming due this year. What's the overall thought on allocation of capital? It looks like you're increasing your CapEx a little bit, but longer-term, is the expectation to try and get back to investment grade, return cash to shareholders, I guess, how are you prioritizing at this point?", "Donald M. James", "I'll give you my short answer to that and then ask Dan Sansone to comment further. But clearly, we will -- our plan is to repay the bonds that are due in June. I think that's $140 million. We don't have any other bonds due until the end of 2015. Generally, our bonds are trading at a premium, so for us to go buy them back today is a pretty expensive proposition. Clearly, we intend to get back to investment grade, that's the goal of the entire management team. We can get there by improving EBITDA or paying down debt or some combination of the 2. So that's really -- we have several levers to pull there. We will -- in addition to debt reduction, our priorities for cash flow include reinvesting in our Aggregates business, including bolt-on Aggregate operations in the kinds of markets we like, which are generally fast-growing markets where the barriers to entry are significant. We would like to begin to restore a meaningful dividend, that's also a priority for our management team and our board. So I think among those, debt reduction, reinvesting in our Aggregates business, restoring a dividend, those are the principal priorities for cash flow. Dan?", "Daniel F. Sansone", "And the only thing I would add to that is in the near-term, we would want to preserve sufficient cash to have flexibility to respond to these investment opportunities that may come along without having to be dependent on having to do a capital market transaction in a very short period of time. So as we transition through this recovery into the retirement of the existing debt, there may be points in time where we have more cash sitting on the balance sheet than we otherwise would. But some of that is intended to provide the financing flexibility to be opportunistic on these modest bolt-on opportunities, be they the acquisition of operating assets or further investment in reserves to enhance our position in existing markets.", "Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies & Company, Inc. Fixed Income Research", "And just maybe as a follow-up. In the -- on the M&A front, are you seeing more opportunities for existing sellers that are sort of coming out of the woodwork or are you guys still continuing to look at more greenfield opportunities as well?", "Donald M. James", "Greenfield opportunities are very difficult, as you know. While we have some greenfields identified and -- or would anticipate opening those as demand would dictate, there are far more opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions of existing Aggregate quarries. As you know, there are some large global companies that are actively selling Aggregate operations in the U.S., and we view those as real opportunities.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Don James for closing remarks.", "Donald M. James", "Well, thank you, all, for joining us today. We are pleased with our results in 2010 (sic) [2012],  given the fact that the economy, construction economy has remained difficult. We, as indicated, are certainly looking forward to 2013 and beyond because we believe we're at a point in the construction cycle, given all of the work we have done over the past few years, to be ready for the upturn and to be more profitable going into the upturn than we have been in prior cycles. All of those things together give us a great deal of optimism for the future. We appreciate your questions, your interest and look forward to continuing to talk with you in subsequent quarters.

My name is Brandy, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn this call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. James, you may begin.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2013 results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference during the call. These slides are also available to those of you on the webcast.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risk and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's first quarter 2013 earnings release and in the Investor Relations section of Vulcan's website.", "Turning now to Slide 3. I want to begin by briefly discussing a few highlights from the quarter. Our business segments performed in line with our expectations in the first quarter, and thus we have reaffirmed our outlook and remain on track to achieve earnings improvements in 2013. Gross profit of $18 million was $4 million lower than the prior year's first quarter, which benefited from unseasonable warm and dry weather, and this year's gross profit was $25 million higher than the first quarter of 2011.", "Aggregate segment gross profit, while down versus the prior year, was in line with our expectations and better than 2011. Aggregate shipments were 5% lower than the prior year and 5% higher than the first quarter of 2011, which like 2013 was subject to more typical winter weather. The timing of large projects in a number of markets also affected the year-over-year comparison.", "We achieved broad-based improvement in aggregates pricing, which was up 5% overall, helping to offset the earnings effect of lower volumes. Our reported price improvement is adjusted for freight cost incurred in transport aggregates from the producing quarry to the sales yard. We believe measuring our price improvement in this way provides a clearer view of changes in actual realized prices. Without this freight adjustment, our year-over-year price improvement was even higher than our reported number.", "Over a year -- on a year-over-year basis, our trailing 12-month cash gross profit per ton has continued to increase despite the 5% decline in first quarter shipments. We believe this demonstrates the benefits of improved pricing, as well as our initiative to increase operating efficiency and reduce cost.", "Volumes in ready-mixed concrete and cement increased 6% and 14%, respectively, due to improving levels of private construction. Both Florida and Texas delivered improvements in ready-mixed volumes, exceeding 20%. Collectively, non-aggregates gross profit improved $5 million to a loss of $7 million.", "Cost-reduction continues to be an ongoing focus of our management team and all of our employees. As we look ahead, we remain encouraged by improving trends in private sector construction. These positive trends bode well for not only earnings growth in our aggregates business but also earnings improvement in our non-aggregate segments, which are located in high-growth markets.", "We are also pleased to see contract awards for public highways, a leading indicator of future construction activity, turned positive in the first quarter for the first time in 2 years.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd who will walk you through our segment results for the quarter. Danny?", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Thanks, Don. Turning to Slide 4, you can see how the weather played a significant role in the year-over-year comparisons. The unseasonably mild winter weather in last year's first quarter, coupled with some above-average participation this year in a number of our East Coast and central U.S. markets distorted the year-over-year comparisons. The absence of comparable large industrial and infrastructure projects in the Midwest, Tennessee and Virginia also contributed to the 16% decline in the East Coast and central U.S. markets.", "Turning to Slide 5, you see that despite 5% lower volumes in the first quarter, our trailing 12 months cash gross profit per ton of aggregates increased 2%. Overall, we expected our first quarter aggregate shipments to be lower than last year when shipments increased 10% due to favorable weather, as well as the timing of shipments to serve our large projects. However, despite overall lower volumes, we were pleased to see aggregate shipments in a few key states such as Arizona, California and Florida, showing strength, increasing by at least 10% versus the prior year. Florida alone experienced a 25% increase in aggregate shipments during the first quarter, benefiting from recovery in private construction activity, particularly in the residential market. Other key markets, such as Texas, continue to benefit from broad-based demand growth across all end-use markets. Sales volumes at the company's remotely served sales yards along the central Gulf Coast also benefited from stronger demand, increasing approximately 25% versus the prior year. Unfavorable weather, lower production levels and a geographic mix shift impacted year-over-year cash cost comparisons. As an example of the distortion caused by geographic mix, let's take my comment about sales volume growth along the central Gulf Coast and apply it to cost. The unit cost of sales at remotely served sales yards is higher than at a producing quarry because of the freight and handling cost incurred to transfer aggregates from the producing quarry to the yard. As a result, the 25% sales increase, along the central Gulf Coast I just mentioned, stands in stark contrast to our volumes inside Tennessee and Kentucky, where volumes collectively declined 25%. These mid-south markets are truck-served from producing quarries and therefore carry a lower unit cost structure than a sales yard, creating the unfavorable geographic mix impact for both unit cost and total cost. Additionally, production levels were reduced to match sales levels. Notwithstanding the lower first quarter shipments across many markets, our operating managers did an excellent job of balancing production with sales and holding inventory levels essentially flat. While these management decisions had a negative effect on GAAP earnings and EBITDA in the quarter, it positions us to run our plants at efficient levels in the second and third quarters and more than recover these lost earnings. I'm pleased to say that our employees did a nice job of maintaining productivity, as measured by tons per manhour given the lower production levels. Year-over-year, this metric of production efficiency essentially remained unchanged.", "Unit production cost increased slightly from the prior year, due mostly to repairs and maintenance. Plant period costs were down versus the prior year. In a number of locations, the cost variance was caused by planned cash cost in the quarter for routine expenditures necessary to prepare for the start of seasonal construction activity. We did have new operation that were not counted in the prior year.", "Finally, as Don mentioned, we benefited from broad-based price improvement, with virtually all of the company's markets realizing higher pricing versus the prior year, which helped offset the earnings effect of lower volumes and the unfavorable geographic mix.", "Turning to Slide 6 for an update on performance of non-aggregates for the quarter, we're continuing to see concrete and cement volumes recover from cyclical lows. Concrete and cement volumes were up 6% and 14%, respectively. These 2 segments are benefiting from increased private construction activity, particularly in Florida.", "Concrete segment gross profit improved $2 million, due in part to a 6% increase in shipments and after absorbing higher input cost for aggregates and cement.", "Cement segment gross profit in the first quarter was $1 million, up slightly versus the prior year.", "Asphalt mix segment gross profit improved by approximately $3 million despite a 4% decline in shipments. Unit profitability, as measured by material margins, increased 19% due in part to a 7% decrease in unit cost of liquid asphalt.", "In total, gross profit for our non-aggregate segment improved $5 million to a loss of $7 million.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Don.", "Donald M. James", "Thanks, Danny. If you'll turn now to Slide 7, you'll see that we have continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction. Net debt declined 6% over the last year, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved from 7.5 as of March 2011 to 6.4 this year all throughout a meaningful recovery yet in demand for aggregates.", "After a payment of a scheduled debt maturity of $140 million in June of this year, which we'll make from our existing liquidity, we will have no debt due until the fourth quarter of 2015. Strengthening our balance sheet remains a top priority for our management team.", "Turning now to Slide 8 for our end markets. Housing starts measured on the seasonally adjusted annual rate are now at more than 1 million, indicating the beginnings of a broad-based recovery in residential construction. In fact, most well-conserved markets realized double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12 months. More importantly, we are seeing significant growth in several key states, including Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona. Growth in these key well-conserved states is important because not only will we realize the attractive incremental margins from higher aggregates volume, but our non-aggregates businesses will benefit as well. This growth in residential construction activity and its traditional follow-on impact to private nonresidential construction underpins our expectations for volumes and earnings improvements in 2013. Our April concrete shipments are indicative of this expanding recovery in private construction. For the past month, our concrete shipments were up over 20% compared to April of 2012, led by Florida, which was up over 30%. Year-to-date concrete shipments are slightly ahead of our year-to-date plan.", "Moving on to Slide 9. We are also continuing to be encouraged by leading indicators of future construction activity for private nonresidential buildings. One leading indicator, the Architectural Billing Index, or ABI, has been showing signs of steadily increased activity. The ABI can be an important leading indicator of construction for private nonresidential buildings. As you'll see on this slide, for 8 consecutive months, the ABI has been above 50, a level that indicates an increase in billing activity. This is a promising sign as we move further into 2012.", "Turning now to Slide 10. Private construction contract awards continue to recover in our markets, which includes contract awards for nonresidential buildings shown here. As shown in this chart, U.S. private nonresidential contract awards for the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2013, are up 16% from the prior year period. This growth should support increased aggregate demand and private construction well into the future.", "Moving now to highway construction activity on Slide 11. You can see the year-over-year change in contract awards for new construction and construction put in place. As you'll see from this chart, the passage of the federal highway bill, or MAP-21, in July of 2012, is finally providing stability and predictability to highway funding. New highway projects, as measured by trailing 12 month contract awards, were up 1% versus last year's first quarter, marking the first year-over-year increase in contract awards for highways since January of 2011.", "The large increase in TIFIA funding contained in the new highway bill should also positively impact future demand. Contract awards for TIFIA projects are projected to add $30 billion to $50 billion to highway and infrastructure construction, substantially exceeding the contract awards for highways from the 2009 stimulus bill shown on the graph here from 2009 through 2010.", "Additionally, state and local governments appear to be moving forward with funding initiatives over and above the federal programs. Key states, such as Virginia, Texas and Maryland, are pursuing new funding initiatives that should increase future transportation investments substantially.", "In Virginia, a 5-year funding package approved by the general assembly can generate $3.4 billion for highways over the next 5 years, an increase of about $780 million per year. In Texas, the Department of Transportation has remained committed to bidding approximately $8.8 billion in transportation projects in FY '13 compared to about $4.8 billion last year.", "In Maryland, new revenue measures have been enacted that could raise $4.4 billion over 6 years, an increase of about $100 million to $200 million per year over that period.", "And finally, Richland County, South Carolina, home of the state capital in Columbia and the University of South Carolina where we have a substantial presence, is an example of a local government addressing their infrastructure needs beyond the state and federal program. In that County, a 1% sales tax increase was approved that will yield $35 million to $50 million per year the next 20 years. That tax goes into effect next month, or this month, actually.", "Turning now to Slide 12. Our outlook for another year of operating earnings improvements remains on track and it's supported by improved pricing, cost management and continued growth in private construction activity, which should drive volume growth.", "Aggregates demand from private construction is expected to grow overall, led by the residential sector. Residential construction is expected to increase approximately 20%, while demand from private nonresidential buildings is expected to increase about 8% compared to 2012.", "Our current expectation is for aggregates demand in the public construction, including highways and other infrastructure to approximate 2012 levels. However, our outlook for this end market has improved modestly given the recent upturn in trailing 12-month highway contract awards. The projects that could materially impact our 2013 aggregates volumes include a disproportionately greater number of large discrete highway and industrial projects. The timing of these projects remains challenging to predict.", "Our year-to-date aggregate shipments through April are slightly ahead of our year-to-date plan, and our full year shipments in 2013 are expected to increase 1% to 5%, with most of the expected year-over-year growth to occur in the second half of the year.", "In keeping with our successful efforts to offset the earnings effect of lower volumes in recent quarters, we will continue our focus on reducing controllable cost and achieving improved pricing. The geographic breadth of pricing gains we achieved in 2012 and so far this year enforces our expectation for continued price growth in 2013. We expect full year adjusted -- freight adjusted price growth of approximately 4% for full year 2013. Additionally, we expect earnings in each of our non-aggregates segments to improve compared to last year. Asphalt material margins increased throughout 2012, and we expect these material margins to increase again in 2013 and contribute to earnings growth in this segment.", "Full year concrete volumes and material margins are expected to improve in 2013 as housing starts continue recovering in key states. As we've noted, concrete volumes in the first quarter increased 6% overall versus the prior year, due in part to increased private construction activity in Florida. We expect the increased private construction activity to continue to lead to improved unit profitability in the Concrete segment.", "Demand earnings should also improve in 2013 due mostly to lower production cost. As a result, collectively, full year earnings from these segments are expected to contribute significantly to our earnings growth in 2013.", "Our full year outlook for 2013 reflects our continued progress toward achieving our Profit Enhancement Plan goals. Through the first quarter of 2013, profit enhancement initiatives have generated approximately $55 million of run rate profitability improvements. And we remain on track to meet our target of $100 million in run rate improvements from the 2011 base year.", "Finally, we will continue to work on additional asset sales, transactions that allow us to strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics, as well as to deploy capital into assets and markets with higher future returns, to increase our ability to improve earnings as construction activity rose.", "And with that, I'll now turn the meeting back over to our operator to begin Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "On the pricing, it's a question we've been asking all of our aggregate contacts, but how much of the price increase benefited from mix versus a pure price increase? And also to get set further, what was the pricing improvement in your strongest markets and in your weakest markets?", "Donald M. James", "Kathryn, I think of the 5% price increase we enjoyed in the first quarter, about 1% of that is mix and the rest is through same-store price increases. You ask about the range of price increases, I think increasingly, we are seeing price growth across virtually all of our markets. The range is really 10% into 12% and then a market or 2, it's probably down 5% or less, but there's a broad range. But virtually, every market was up. Typically, the markets where there is a price decline is because of a special project or some initiative that we did intentionally.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay. And just to reconfirm, your -- the states with the highest per unit price are the Carolinas, Georgia, California and Florida?", "Donald M. James", "Well, the East Coast, the entire East Coast is a strong pricing market. The Gulf Coast is a strong pricing market, but of course, as Danny Shepherd said, our unit cost on the Gulf Coast are higher because of the freight. But these are freight adjusted prices, so the shipments into the Gulf Coast, including Florida and Texas, are good markets, and California are good markets from a price standpoint. So our whole coastal business from our southern tier from Florida to California is good pricing, the whole East Coast is good pricing. The weakness is in the Midwest.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Faults in the midyear price increase?", "Donald M. James", "Kathryn, as we try to say, we don't do big lump sum one-time midyear price increases. We have boots on the ground, and we try to move prices wherever and whenever we have the opportunity.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Trey Grooms with Stevens.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Just kind of touching on non-res. Are you guys seeing and I may have missed it in your prepared comments, but are you seeing any tangible evidence of non-res, new non-res, specifically kind of commercial and the more cyclical stuff, see any improvement there, any intangible evidence of that? And I understand the ABI is kind of pointing that, that could start to improve pretty nicely at some point maybe this year, but just if you are seeing it, where to?", "Donald M. James", "It depends on your definition of non-res. If you're including industrial projects, we're seeing a lot of industrial projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast, refineries, airbus and Mobile, chemical plant expansions. There's a lot of industrial work in the queue. In terms of buildings, I think our concrete shipments are some indication that there is a recovery underway in certain markets, at least, in private non-res buildings, while concrete shipments are driven by housing starts, there's also a fair amount of that concrete shipment increase that's going to private non-res buildings. So the private construction is really the driver of concrete, much more so than public, and we're seeing big increases as we've indicated in concrete shipments.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then I asked one of your competitors the same question here yesterday or a few days ago but I'd like to get your take on it, Don, as far as kind of looking out longer-term, with all of the things kind of looking into '14, it looks like it could really drive some good volume for you guys and in my opinion I think -- I'm not looking for any guidance on this front, but it doesn't seem unrealistic to see some very nice volume improvements next year, maybe even double digits. And if that were the case, hypothetically, as we look forward, how does your pricing kind of correspond with volume given kind of where we are in the cycle right now as we look forward?", "Donald M. James", "Well, McGraw  -- and I won't give you any bulk on specific guidance for '14 and '15, but you probably have seen the McGraw-Hill numbers that came out the last few days. McGraw-Hill is seeing total construction activity up 18% in 2014 and 20% above that in 2015. So we concur based on the data we see, that construction is going to come back after this 5-year recession we have had. Included within the McGraw-Hill numbers are residential improvement of 14% and 22% in '14 and '15 -- I mean, residential is 36% and 26%. Non-res is 14% and 22%. So there's a lot of optimism there and it is supported, obviously, by contract award data. It's not a theoretical increase, it's real in terms of the contract awards that are coming out. Clearly, Trey, if you look at the relationship of volume growth to price growth for our company, and really for the industry, but particularly for our company, you see that when volumes start moving up significantly so that the visibility of future demand is out there, as well as maybe some of the smaller local players in the market booking up with volume, we have tremendous pricing power. The last time we were seeing substantial volume growth in 2004, '05, '06 and '07, we were averaging double-digit price growth. I'm not predicting that, but that's certainly within the range of possible outcomes.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Desi filling in for Bob. Just on the SAG line, I was curious what you were thinking relative to 2012 what you're expecting for SAG dollars and for 2013. And then...", "Donald M. James", "Our full year SAG expectation right now is about flat, slightly down from 2012, but essentially flat. We are hoping to improve on that, but our current outlook is essentially flat. There's a lot of ups and downs in that. I would say on what we might call controllable cost, they're down. Some costs like benefits cost, where it's tougher to control them in the near-term, are up. So there's some offsets going on there.", "Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then I also want to get a sense of what you're seeing in the market in terms of the opportunity for potential asset sales this year. And then it looks like you made an acquisition in the quarter, if you could also talk about that, too.", "Donald M. James", "Yes. We bought 2 quarries in Georgia from Lafarge. We're very pleased to close that deal. We are operating, making improvements, integrating them with our existing operations. We continue to look for bolt-on opportunities in markets where we think there's good growth potential and which -- and where the acquisition of a bolt-on, not only can we hopefully improve its operations, but we would achieve overhead synergies and cost synergies and the ability to serve our customers better in those markets. So we continue to work on those transactions. We also continue to look at our portfolio, and when we see places where we have capital tied up that does not have the kind of upside we're seeing in the rest of our markets, we are certainly prepared to exit those markets looking for that capital. And that's an ongoing process. Danny Shepherd and our 3 regional SVPs are very focused on that process. That's nothing new for us, but given now the outlook for the next several years in construction growth, particularly in certain of our key markets we are really -- we're pursuing those. Obviously, having willing sellers has helped us.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ted Grace with Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was hoping to talk about pep and as a starting point, I know you mentioned the $55 million of run rate savings realized through the end of 1Q. Can you just remind us sequentially kind of what the -- how 4Q compared to 1Q?", "Donald M. James", "I'm going to get Danny Shepherd. He and the SVPs are our pep gurus. Could you repeat the question for Danny, please?", "Danny R. Shepherd", "I think I heard the question. Well, as Don said in his remarks, he referred to the $55 million number. We believe that in 2013 we will have achieved $75 million in pep improvements, and we believe that we will deliver, as we've promised, the $100 million in 2014. And we will be at a run rate of $100 million at some point in 2013.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. So what I'm trying to understand initially is the run rate were at $55 million, kind of sequentially what changed and how that rate improved, I'm assuming?", "Donald M. James", "I really can't comment on that and answer that question. I can really only tell you that we're at the $75 million run rate now.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Ted, this is Dan. We've got tracking on that, but I don't think we have the data parsed the way you phrased your question right in front of us, so we'd be probably guessing but we can come back and if it's important and flesh that out. It's all part of our tracking, we just didn't slice it the way you framed your question.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Sure, okay. That's great, we can swirl back on it. Maybe thinking about the opportunities in front of us for the remainder of the calendar year, just dividing those between whether it's sourcing or plant operations or logistics, where do we expect to get the biggest gains incrementally in calendar 2013?", "Donald M. James", "I can answer that. We are making good progress on procurement savings, and our transportation initiatives are really gaining momentum. We are now achieving both revenue and cost savings in several parts of the country as a result of the plans that we put in place. That's both in trucking, rail. We're making good progress.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "And, Ted, to maybe add on to that, we expect the bulk of the incremental savings for the rest of this year to be in the areas Danny just described. In contrast, we have achieved most of the savings that we had targeted in SG&A costs. There's still some incremental amounts that are going to flow through during the course of 2013, but the bulk of the SAG or overhead-related savings have already been put in place, but again there are some additional actions that will occur during the course of the year but the largest dollar magnitude yet to come lies in sourcing and transportation and logistics.", "Donald M. James", "Ted, I'll give you one other example of the fact that the original plan has evolved to reflect what's going on in the marketplace. For example, one of our transportation cost savings was to run our ships at lower speeds, which would allow us to save a few million dollars in fuel costs. With the big ramp-up in demand across the entire Gulf Coast in Florida, we are now having to run our ships wide open 100% in service of moving our rock from our Mexican quarry to our yards along the Gulf Coast and in Florida. And as a result of that, we're not going to be able to save that $3 million or $4 million in freight -- in fuel cost, but the margin on those incremental sales just overwhelms all of that. So to take what we set out 15 months ago and reconcile it where we are today, there are some moving pieces there. And we're making those adjustments as we need to improve our overall profit growth.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then the last thing I was hoping to ask you is on the divestiture side, kind of the update, I know we've been targeting something on the order of $500 million from start to finish by mid-2013. Can you just let us know kind of where the process stands and how we feel about the goalposts?", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Ted, this is Danny Shepherd. We're making progress on the -- on our goal. Hopefully, within the next few months, we'll have something positive to report. Obviously, we can't be specific at this point, but we are focused on our divestiture program and believe that we have a reasonably good shot of achieving what we've told you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "In the context of your full year aggregates volume guidance, I'm wondering if you could talk about how you expect the year to play out sequentially. Obviously we had really tough weather comps in the first quarter, and I'm wondering how do you see the seasonality playing out this year compared to last year and perhaps if you're willing to touch on how April volume trends stacked up.", "Donald M. James", "Jerry, to hit our guidance of 1 to 5 for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we need to be up about 3% to about 7.5% given the first quarter shipments. That's just a math problem. We expect, because of the existence of some large projects that are in the pipeline, we expect there to be pretty hefty second half contribution to that total aggregate volume. That's simply because some of these TIFIA projects will kick off hopefully sometime in the second half of the year plus some of these industrial projects on the Gulf Coast. Some of the TIFIA projects have already started, some of the industrial projects have started, but there's much more in the pipeline. So the timing of whether those shipments are in the second half of '13 or they roll over into the first half of '14 is difficult for us to predict, but our base load business, our base load business is improving, certainly, as you can see. And then our aggregates, we are obviously behind on year-to-date shipments compared to our guidance but we're right on our plan.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "We're behind on year-to-date versus last year, not to our guidance.", "Donald M. James", "Right, right, right. So we're reasonably confident we will hit our guidance. We hope to be able to narrow that guidance for you after the second quarter after we are able to see the timing of some of these larger projects.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And on the acquired quarries from Lafarge in Georgia, can you just talk about the size of the reserve and how the pricing point compares to overall Vulcan pricing?", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Yes. This is Danny Shepherd again. First of all, we are well pleased with the reserve position that we were able to acquire. In addition to the existing reserves, there are reserves that we can add to this property, and I'm giving you a range, 30, 40 years is certainly what we believed -- we believe is -- can be described as proven and probable. And there are -- there's another body of reserves that would add significantly to the proven and probable reserves. So we're pleased with the reserve position. As to the pricing question, the -- it's hard to say exactly what our pricing position will be. We're certainly pleased that we've added it to our Atlanta market, but I really can't comment on the specifics of pricing for you. But we're pleased with the acquisition. It fits us perfectly, and we're well pleased.", "Donald M. James", "Those 2 -- the 2 quarries, Jerry, that we acquired are in the northeast quadrant of Atlanta where we were unable to serve the market. So they helped fill our hand out in terms of the geographic market that we can supply.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And lastly, I'm wondering if you could talk about pricing conditions that you're seeing from your customers of ready-mix and asphalt industries, are they able to put through accelerating price increases on the finished products at this point?", "Donald M. James", "We saw very modest price growth in ready-mix in the first quarter, and in terms of asphalt pricing, essentially flat. The story in asphalt though is with the declining in the price -- decline in the price of liquid asphalt, our margins are improving. But the first quarter is not the indicative of what the full year is likely to be for any number of reasons, particularly in asphalt, because of the weather situation. But on balance, we think we'll see price improvement in concrete and we certainly expect to see margin improvement in asphalt.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And what about for your customers in areas where you're not vertically integrated there? Do you have a sense of their ability to get price increase to stick?", "Donald M. James", "We certainly hope so and we think given the increasing demand in residential and private non-res, this is the time they need to be getting price improvement and certainly, that's a decision they make, we don't make, but I think the stage is set for pricing growth, particularly in concrete.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "My question relates to concrete. Is there any sort of metric you can give us in terms of tons or pricing or anything like that? Would you think this will cross back over into profitability and the gross profit line?", "Donald M. James", "It's largely about volume, Keith. We need to be able to run our plants and our trucks steadily and consistently. We also need some price growth, but volume is the key right now for recovery and profitability in the Concrete business. Our Concrete businesses are -- the profitability differs greatly from market to market. Some markets are profitable, some aren't. But the growth in demand, particularly in Florida, I think, bodes well for opportunity for profit improvement there.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Is it 30% above where we are before this quarter or is there a metric...?", "Daniel F. Sansone", "I don't have that calculation in front of me, but -- and I don't think -- Danny, you don't have that data in front of you either, but I can't give you that metric. We will certainly look back at our numbers and our projections and can fill in that blank for you later.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mike Betts with Jefferies.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I had kind of 3 areas of questions, if I could, very quickly. Firstly, in the EBITDA bridge, the $19 million of increased costs and other, we know $4 million is due to repairs and maintenance. Is there any way of kind of splitting what the rest is? And related to that, is that repair and maintenance a timing issue or should we regard it as just an increased cost that you're going to face as volumes start to pick up? That's my first question. The second one to give you, just to help, you're talking in the press release about your objectives for costs this year or your cash cost objectives for 2013. Can you remind me, did you say what they were and have they changed given a bigger volume is coming potentially from the Gulf Coast area? And then just finally on that Gulf Coast market, presumably, that's likely to be strong for the foreseeable future, but it has implications for profitability. I know prices are higher there but is there a scope to put through more substantial price increases to offset the impact on profitability?", "Donald M. James", "Mike, let me first approach the question about the Gulf Coast. As Danny said in his remarks, our unit cost of sales is higher there because of the embedded freight and handling. We also have very strong pricing there, and we have really good margins in that business. So we're perfectly happy to incur the higher cost structure because those shipments come with very high profitability and we report freight adjusted pricing, so we take the freight out of the reported pricing on the Gulf Coast. So with respect to the Gulf Coast, we are really happy with the way things are going. As I told you, our ships are now going full blast all across the markets from Florida to Texas, and that's good. With respect to the cost in the quarter, and I'll ask my colleagues, but generally, there are -- you picked up the R&M, which prepares us for the improving production volumes in Q2 and Q3 that Danny referenced. There is a weather impact there, and there is a geographic mix there, and I'll ask Dan to fill in the blanks on that.", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Mike, if you take the $19 million in that EBITDA bridge, I think we can drop that into 4 buckets. First bucket we would characterize as cost that have been affected by either weather or mix, meaning geographic mix throughout the network, and that's about $6 million of the increased cost. Second category or bucket into which we would categorize some of this cost is what we would call seasonal timing or -- and that would include -- and that's about $7 million, and that's the parts and supply and repairs and a few other items that are really costs that were going to be spent in the course of 2013 and it's really a timing issue.", "[indiscernible] of what I would call true cost increases where we have structural increases in costs. For example, we have one site where the minimum royalty obligation stepped-up contractually from 1 year to the next and a few other items, and that's about $2 million. And then about $4 million is referable to the higher volumes that are flowing through the distribution yards which carry the incremental freight and handling costs associated with it. So if you add those 4 categories up, you get to the $19 million.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Understood. And that's really helpful. Just the one other one. Have you shared with us what your cash cost objectives are for 2013?", "Daniel F. Sansone", "No.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Would you like to?", "Donald M. James", "Well, we have given volume and price guidance. We haven't given EBITDA guidance or cost guidance. Once we get into a more normalized production environment in the second quarter, I think that becomes easier. You shouldn't, for any number of reasons, and you've been in this industry as long as any of us, you shouldn't draw very many conclusions from first quarter performance, good or bad, for the full year. It's just too much variation, particularly with weather. And this year, the weather had a very significant geographic mix effect as well, which is not typical in this industry.", "Suffice it to say, we have a full fledged focus on cost management throughout the organization from the plant, all the way up through the entire organization. But we have not given guidance on what we expect our cash cost will be in 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Chris Olin with Cleveland Research.", "Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company", "Just wanted to talk a little bit about your Mexican quarry and kind of going back to what you said regarding your ships. It seems like that facility could be one of the big drivers of the growth given where the pockets of the demand seem to be developing, Florida, Gulf Coast. I'm just wondering if you can give us updates, kind of where that plant stands in terms of utilization. And you mention the ships running full, I'm just wondering if that's any kind of constraint and would you need to invest in that asset to capitalize on some of the future growth.", "Donald M. James", "With respect to -- our plant capacity there is about 12 million tons. We are not at capacity. We still got a couple of million tons of capacity available. Our ship capacity is 9 million tons, and we have contracts with another carrier who has self-unloading vessels that will allow us. So shipping is not a constraint. Production capacity currently is not a constraint, but we certainly have the ability to ramp up our capacity at that plant very efficiently when we see future demand exceeding capacity of the plant. We have plans in place, the engineering work is done, cost estimates are done, it's just a matter of when we pull the trigger based on demand. And you're right, the -- that product from that quarry fits the growing demand beautifully. Its premier product is concrete rock and that concrete rock can make cement -- I mean, can make concrete with slightly lower cement levels than much of the other concrete rock that's sold in the United States. Secondly, the big industrial projects along the Gulf Coast require huge amounts of base to start with, and that is the other premier product coming out of that. So base and concrete rock are our principal products coming out of Mexico, they go to the Florida and the Gulf Coast, and that's where concrete and base markets are growing significantly. So that's -- I think you hit the nail on the head, that is one of our really sweet spots as this recovery progresses.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. James for some closing remarks.", "Donald M. James", "Well, thank you so much for joining us today. We look forward to being able to talk with you for the next 3 quarters in 2013 and hopefully all of us can enjoy the benefits of the recovery in private sector construction. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's Vulcan Materials earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Shepherd - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President", "Analysts", "Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Keith Maher - Singular Research", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Shay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vulcan Materials Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]", "Mr. Don James, Chairman and CEO, you may begin your conference.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2013 results. I am Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference during the call. These slides are also available to those of you on the webcast.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's second quarter 2013 earnings release.", "Turning now to Slide 3, I want to begin by briefly discussing a few highlights from the quarter. Each of our business segments reported solid growth in second quarter earnings, contributing to consolidated gross margin expansion and significant earnings per share improvement as compared to the prior year. Earnings from continuing operations were $30 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $17 million or a loss of $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. We achieved these results despite challenging wet weather conditions. Aggregate shipments increased 2% compared to last year, despite significantly wetter weather in all of our markets in the eastern half of the United States.", "Our shipment levels in the first 2 months of the quarter were well above the same period last year. June shipments were sharply lower as wet weather blanketed many of the markets we serve. Assuming more normal weather conditions in the second half of the year, we anticipate the trend of improving shipments to continue, and to be driven primarily by growth in private construction activity.", "We achieved broad-based improvement in aggregate pricing, which was up 4% overall with growth in virtually all of our markets. Over each of the past 4 quarters, our year-over-year quarterly price gains have been at least 4%, and the geographic breadth of pricing improvement has expanded. Our reported price improvement is adjusted for freight cost incurred to transport aggregates from a producing quarry to a sales yard. We believe measuring our price improvement in this way provides a clearer view of changes in actual realized prices. Without this freight adjustment, our year-over-year price improvement was even greater.", "As we look ahead, we remain encouraged by improving trends in private sector construction. Vulcan-served states are among the fastest-growing in the country, accounting for more than 60% of all new construction in both housing starts and contract awards for private nonresidential buildings as measured by square feet. This trend bodes well for earnings growth both in our aggregates businesses and in our non-aggregates segments. We are also pleased to see contract awards for highways were up 10% through the first half of the year, an indication that highway funding stability is returning now that the federal highway bill is in place.", "Moving now to Slide 4. This provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. Consolidated net sales increased $47 million or 7%. Gross profit increased $27 million as each segment reported year-over-year improvement in earnings. Accordingly, gross profit margin increased 280 basis points. Volume in ready-mixed concrete and cement increased 15% and 20%, respectively, due to improving levels of private construction. Texas and Florida delivered very strong improvements in ready mix volume, up 46% and 25%, respectively.", "EBITDA was $164 million, an increase of $61 million from the prior year second quarter. During the second quarter, the company sold certain operating assets in lower-margin, lower-growth markets in the Midwest. These transactions generated a pretax gain of $21 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Additionally, in the quarter, we increased our aggregate reserves and operations in attractive markets in Texas.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd who will walk you through our segment results for the quarter.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Thanks, Don. As Don mentioned in his opening remarks, wet weather was a major factor in the second quarter, affecting shipments and production efficiency. Slide 5 provides some context to the amount of precipitation in the second quarter. The amount ranks the amount of precipitation in every state relative to the last 119 years of data as captured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.", "The darker-green color and higher number -- higher the number, the greater the precipitation. As you can see, all of our markets in the eastern half of the U.S. were significantly impacted by rain, and in some cases, historical levels of rain. To help illustrate how to interpret this data, I'll focus on Georgia. In 2012, the map on the left, the number 38 indicates that there were only 37 years over the past 118 years when the second quarter was drier than it was in 2012. In contrast, the map indicates that there were only 5 years when the second quarter was wetter than it was in 2013. Notwithstanding the extreme weather comparison, our second quarter shipments in Georgia increased 9% in 2013. And even though we were repeatedly challenged by weather events, you'll see on Slide 6 that each of our segments increased earnings due to strong demand in some markets, and effective cost management.", "Our aggregate segment, which I'll cover in more detail in a minute, reported increased shipments, prices and earnings. Non-aggregates earnings increased $12 million due to improving private construction demand, which benefited concrete and cement volumes and increased material margins in asphalt due to lower liquid asphalt cost. The concrete earnings improvement reflects higher shipments and lower costs. The improvement in cement earnings is due to higher shipments, higher prices, and lower cost.", "Now turning to Slide 7. You see that aggregates gross margins increased 130 basis points due to higher volumes and pricing. Aggregate shipments in a number of markets increased sharply versus the prior year, and furthermore, instead of a series of major storms leading to the wet weather, the consistent, steady rainfall meant that many locations never completely dried out.", "Wet weather not only results in lower aggregate shipments, but it also leads to production inefficiencies which impacts cost. For the first 2 months of the quarter, aggregate shipments were trending nicely, up 5% setting us up for a strong June finish to the quarter. Typically, June shipments are greater than May shipments, as the construction season ramps up. However, June shipments were less than the prior year and were lower than May shipments, an outcome that has only happened once before in the last 10 years. Markets in the Midwest and Virginia reported year-over-year declines in shipments due to wet weather and the presence of some large project work in the prior year's second quarter.", "Markets in Arizona, Texas and California reported 56%, 23% and 13% increases in shipments due primarily to growth in private construction. Additionally, we were pleased to see many markets achieve quarterly volume growth despite wet weather conditions. Aggregate shipments in Florida and along the Central Gulf Coast are examples of markets where we experienced strong volume growth despite wet weather conditions. Shipments in Florida increased more than 50% versus the prior year. This underscores the broader trend in demand growth we see in much of our geographic footprint as private construction activity continues to recover. I'll say that July shipments have rebounded nicely due to solid demand growth even with the continuation of wetter-than-normal weather.", "Slide 8, aggregates prices continued to gain traction. The year-over-year improvement is broad-based across our markets, almost without exception. For the fourth quarter in a row, prices went up at least 4%, underscoring that markets are recovering, and that the attractive characteristics of the aggregates business remain intact. Because of our disciplined approach to pricing and cost management, the earnings leverage in our aggregates business continues to increase, as you see on Slide 9. On a trailing 12-month basis, our cash gross profit was $4.19 per ton, 25% higher than it was at the peak -- prior peak in shipments in the first quarter of 2006, and superior to our peers. This high unit profitability positions us well for greater earnings leverage from incremental tons that will come with future growth and demand.", "With that, thank you, and I'll turn the call back over to Don.", "Donald M. James", "Thanks, Danny. If you'll turn with me now to Slide 10, you'll see that strengthening our balance sheet remained probable [ph], and we are just doing just that through debt reduction and improving EBITDA. During the past 12 months, we have reduced our total debt by $190 million, while also investing $111 million in strategic assets and reserves in Georgia and Texas. Debt-to-EBITDA has improved from 6.3x 1 year ago to 5.4x as of June 30 of this year, and we expect further improvement in the coming year.", "Turning now to our end markets on Slide 11. As you all know, housing starts are up sharply versus last year, indicating a continuation of broad-based recovery in residential construction. In fact, most Vulcan-served states realized double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12 months. More importantly, we are seeing significant growth in key Vulcan-served states including Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona. 7 of the top 10 states with the largest absolute growth in trailing 12-month housing starts at June 30 are Vulcan-served states, with Florida and Texas leading the way.", "We also continue to be encouraged by leading indicators of future activity for private nonresidential construction. Contract awards, as measured by fee for private nonresidential construction, are up 11% in the U.S., with Texas and Florida leading the way here, too, up 51% and 43%, respectively. Growth in stores and office buildings, which for us includes all commercial, office and lodging, is the primary driver.", "Growth in private construction activity in key Vulcan-served states like Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona, is important, because not only will we realize the attractive incremental margins that Danny referred to, from higher aggregates volumes, but our non-aggregates businesses in these markets will benefit as well.", "Our year-to-date concrete shipments are indicative of this expanding recovery in residential and private nonresidential construction. Through the first 6 months of this year, our concrete shipments were up over 11% compared to the same period last year, again led by Texas and Florida which are up 36% and 23%, respectively. This growth in new private construction activity underpins our expectations for volumes and earnings improvements in 2013.", "Looking now to Slide 12. Highways comprised the largest end market for aggregates demand within public construction. New highway projects, as measured by trailing 12-month contract awards, were up 1% versus the prior year's level, the second consecutive quarter with an increase.", "This table on Slide 12 shows the positive contribution of recent awards to the current year, up 10% year-to-date versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of the stability brought to the state DOTs by the new federal highway bill passed by Congress in September of 2012.", "More significant to us is the fact that contract awards for highways in our served markets are up 14% year-to-date, driven by contract awards for new road projects, which are more aggregates-intensive than any other type of construction. This recent growth provides some evidence that a more stable and predictable highway funding environment leads to improving construction activity.", "The large increase in TIFIA funding contained in the new highway bill should also positively impact future demand. Contract awards for TIFIA projects are projected to add $30 billion to $50 billion to highway and infrastructure construction, substantially exceeding the contract awards for highways from the 2009 stimulus bill. Some TIFIA projects have already begun in 2013, but 2014 and '15 will be much more significant years in shipments to TIFIA projects.", "The growth in new highway projects should help offset recent weakness in other public infrastructure, as shown here on this table. Last year, highways comprised approximately 30% of full year aggregates shipments while other public infrastructure accounted for less than half that amount.", "Turning to our outlook on Slide 13. Our outlook for another year of operating earnings improvements remains on track, and is supported by improved pricing, continued growth in private construction activity, which should drive volume growth, and by disciplined cost management. U.S. construction employment through the first half of 2013 is up 2.8% from the prior year, an indication that construction activity is again growing, albeit from a low base.", "Aggregates demand from private construction is expected to grow mid- to high-single digits overall, led by the residential segment.", "Public construction in the second half of 2013 should begin benefiting from recent growth in contract awards for new highway projects, as well as from TIFIA funding, and these 2 items should create positive momentum in that sector going into 2014.", "As we look specifically to the remainder of 2013, the projects that could materially impact our second half aggregates volumes continue to include a disproportionately greater number of large highway and industrial projects. The timing of shipments to these projects remains outside our control, and in some cases, has been delayed due to project considerations. Additionally, the wet weather experienced in the first half of this year could cause some project work to slow, resulting in backlog carryovers into 2014. As a result, we expect second half aggregate shipments to increase 2% to 4% from the prior year. This volume outlook assumes more normal weather patterns throughout the remainder of the year, and includes the effects of sales volumes associated with acquisitions and divestitures this year.", "On a same-store basis, second half aggregate shipments are expected to increase 3% to 5%. In keeping with our successful efforts to offset the earnings effect of lower volumes in recent quarters, we continue our focus on reducing controllable cost and achieving improved pricing.", "The geographic breadth of pricing gains achieved in 2012, and so far this year, reinforces our expectations for continued price growth for the second half. We expect full year freight-adjusted price growth of approximately 4% for full year 2013.", "Additionally, earnings in each of our non-aggregate segments should improve compared to last year. Asphalt materials margins increased throughout 2012, and we expect material margins to continue to increase throughout 2013 and contribute to earnings growth in this segment.", "Full year concrete volumes and material margins are expected to improve in 2013 as housing starts continue recovering in key states. Concrete volumes year-to-date have increased 11% overall versus the prior year due in part to increased private construction activity in Florida. We expect the increased private construction activity to continue to lead to improved unit profitability in the concrete segment.", "Cement earnings should improve in 2013 due to higher shipments, improved pricing and lower production costs. As a result, collectively, full year earnings from these segments are expected to contribute significantly to earnings growth in 2013 as they have in the second quarter of this year.", "Our full year outlook for 2013 reflects our continued progress toward achieving our Profit Enhancement Plan goals. Through the first half of 2013, we remain on track to meet our target of $100 million in improvement from the 2011 base year. Finally, we will continue to work on additional asset-related transactions that will allow us to strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics, as well as redeploy capital and assets in markets with higher future returns to increase our ability to improve earnings as construction activity grows.", "With that, I'll turn the program over to our operator to begin your questions. Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to responding to your questions.", "Is the operator available? Well, bear with us a moment as we get the line open for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger.", "Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "You mentioned some pretty strong shipments in some of your key states and it suggests that in some other states you had probably a proportionate decline. So I was wondering, what do you think the disparity among the different regions says about the recovery and says about the outlook?", "Donald M. James", "Well, I think in the second quarter, it has, perhaps, more to do with the absence of large projects in Virginia and in Illinois and with bad weather. As Danny Shepherd says, those 2 markets were down significantly compared to prior year. Obviously, though, the states that were hit hardest in the downturn are the ones that are coming back very strong. Clearly, Florida, Arizona, California are doing very well now. Texas is doing extremely well. As you know, it didn't have quite the downturn that some of the other states have had. But clearly, as we've indicated, our business in Florida is coming back very strongly. It's coming back very strongly in Arizona. And California's coming back nicely, and Texas is very strong. The middle part of the country is still not as strong, even though we had a lot of wet weather in the east, particularly up the East Coast, as you can see from the map that's in the slides, we actually had volume growth in several of those states. But we know that we lost a lot of volume, particularly in those markets at high-margin volume in the quarter, which we're looking forward to capturing through the remainder of the year.", "Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my second question was on -- in your -- the prepared statement and the press release, you talked about the historical relationship between nonresidential and how that follows residential construction. I was wondering how tight that is? And what -- based upon your experience, what the typical timing lag is for when you see -- you think the improvement in non-res after residential improvement?", "Donald M. James", "Well, we are students of economic cycles, and certainly, there is a cycle-after-cycle-after-cycle trend that residential leads nonresidential out of recession, usually with a 9-month, plus or minus, lag. As we look at the relationship now about housing starts contrasted to private non-res contract awards, we're seeing the same pattern develop. Housing starts have started up earlier, are more robust today, but private non-res is certainly recovering strongly based on contract awards. So we're, I think, cautiously optimistic that the pattern of prior recoveries in private construction led by residential, followed by private non-res is repeating itself.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Don, can you talk about how you see the public construction cycle playing out, just to continue the discussion on your last point. I guess in prior cycles, this is about the time we would see public construction start to bottom and turn the other way? And wondering if you'd just add some context based on tax receipts or other metrics that you look at for your key states on how you think that plays out?", "Donald M. James", "The relationship between public construction, particularly highways and private non-res, is certainly not as consistent. It's driven by different factors, largely by public spending. We're not looking for a substantial increase this year, in 2013, in shipments into public construction, we are looking for somewhat some growth in the highway sector, but then there's some offsetting weakness in other public infrastructure, water and sewer projects, things like that, which ought to, overtime, follow housing and private non-res construction. But the linkage is not nearly as consistent or as highly correlated as the relationship historically between housing construction and private non-res. That being said, the real wildcard here -- and we said that highway contract awards are up 10% the first half of this year compared to last year, which is clearly understandable. We didn't have a highway bill in the first half of 2012. We do have a federal highway bill, that's given stability and predictability to the states. And they started much bigger bid lettings in the first of the year based on the security of having a federal highway bill in place. But the big wildcard here of these TIFIA projects, I know you're tired of hearing us talk about those, but we're tracking about 50 or 55 big TIFIA projects in our markets. Some of those, as we said in our prepared text, have begun shipping in 2013, or will be shipping in 2013. But there's a big backlog of these projects. The Federal Highway Administration has been a little slower than anybody wanted in getting them approved and out, but they are beginning to show up. And they are going to have a very significant impact all across our footprint. I mean, I'm looking down my list, there's Illinois, Georgia, North Carolina, a lot in Virginia and Maryland and Florida, in Texas and in California. In addition to those, there are a lot of industrial projects, big industrial projects, primarily along the Gulf Coast, including refineries for Exxon and Chevron, LNG, the whole energy sector has got a big construction plan underway. And all of those things rolled up, give us lot of optimism -- give a lot of uncertainty as to the absolute level of volume in the second half of '13, but a tremendous amount of optimism about volume growth in '14 and '15.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And Don, when you add up all the TIFIA projects that you're tracking, what's the aggregate dollar amount, how significant is that?", "Donald M. James", "We don't have -- well, the project value of the 56 projects we are tracking in our markets is $65 billion. And that -- I'm sorry, that's not all TIFIA, that's all large projects. Some of those are not TIFIA and some of them are private industrial. But our tracking sheet -- and we won't get every one of these projects and we won't get all the material in every one of these projects, but there is a pretty good backlog of big projects in our footprint.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And you spoke about the weather element. Can you just step us through to what extent is that keeping you from being more aggressive on price increases, if at all? Does that impact what otherwise would have been stronger price increases into 3Q?", "Donald M. James", "I don't think so. I don't think weather -- weather has had an impact on volume, it's had an impact, as Danny Shepherd said, on our production cost. I don't think we can say it's had any impact at all on pricing.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from Davidson.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Yes, just losses in the concrete segment narrowing at a pretty nice pace here. Are you getting some confidence you'll start to see some profitability in that business next year as you look into the various markets you're exposed to? And sort of second part to that, are you actually profiting in some specific markets and maybe that's just being offset elsewhere?", "Donald M. James", "Yes and yes. We're -- volume growth is the key to -- one of the keys to profitability in the concrete business, and we are profitable in a number of our concrete markets. And we're unprofitable in some others. So it's -- but we will, overall, with particularly recovery in the private sector construction where a lot of our concrete goes, we are -- we're very happy with that. And concrete, the improvement in our profitability of our cement segment also has been very substantial. And those are clearly related because our concrete is pulling aggregates through our system as well as cement through our system.", "Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "That's encouraging. And as these larger public jobs eventually come through for you, I guess, everything else equal, should that have positive implications for your price mix?", "Donald M. James", "Absolutely. A little volume momentum in this industry has very significant pricing and margin leverage. Danny Shepherd had a slide in the presentation which I think would indicate that. If you look at the margin expansion, we experienced driven -- while it's not 1 for 1 in timing, it certainly is an indicator of opportunities for margin expansion. Both in pricing, but also in terms of our cost of production. Being able to run our plants at efficient volume levels really does move the needle on cost.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Keith Maher from Singular Research.", "Keith Maher - Singular Research", "Question about -- would you ever consider doing an equity offering to improve your capital structure by paying down some of the debt?", "Donald M. James", "Yes.", "Keith Maher - Singular Research", "Okay. Any thoughts on when that may occur or how serious you are about doing that?", "Donald M. James", "We continue to look at various options for improving our balance sheet. The options we have are improving our EBITDA, which we clearly are doing and are very focused on doing. Assets, sales of nonstrategic assets is another way, and equity offering is yet another way. So we -- everything is on the table for us in terms of improving our balance sheet.", "Keith Maher - Singular Research", "Okay, great. And on CapEx, I think your guidance for the year was $150 million. It looks like you spent $60 million. Do you think you'll come in under that number, and is that mainly just for maintenance and not capacity expansions?", "Donald M. James", "Most of that $150 million would be for replacement CapEx. We have spent, as I indicated, over the last 12 months, we have made acquisitions totaling about $111 [ph] million. So we're in the -- continue to do bolt-on transactions. We are also very interested, as part of our asset sales, in continuing to improve our portfolio of businesses and geographies. The -- however you measure it, cash margin per ton may be one way to measure. But the assets we've sold have a dramatically lower cash margin per ton than the assets we're buying. So we are very focused on being in the right markets with the right set of assets. And that's part of our ongoing strategy, which you will be -- you've seen played out over the last 12 months and I think you'll continue to see being played out over the next 12.", "Keith Maher - Singular Research", "Okay, do you have any target level for acquisitions and divestitures this year, just in terms of dollars or capacity?", "Donald M. James", "No. We did announce that our goal was to achieve $500 million of after-tax proceeds, pretax proceeds from divestitures. We continue to look at opportunities. We're not going to sell good assets cheaply, but we may have some assets that are more valuable to other players than they are to us. If we can find those opportunities to withdraw our capital from those non-strategic assets and reinvest them either in debt reduction or in other bolt-on acquisitions, primarily aggregates-focused, we'll continue to do that.", "Operator", "We will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Don James.", "Donald M. James", "Well, thank you, all, for being with us today. Given the weather, we are very pleased with the second quarter. I hope you are. We look forward to a positive report at the end of the third quarter, and we will talk to you then. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's conference.

My name is Victoria, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. James, you may begin.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2013 results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference during the call. These slides are also available to you on the webcast.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's third quarter 2013 earnings release.", "Turning now to Slide 3, I want to begin by briefly discussing a few highlights from the quarter. Our net sales increased 13% for the quarter, and gross profit increased 25%. EPS from continuing operations improved from $0.12 per share last year to $0.32 for this year's third quarter. Aggregate shipments increased 9% in total and 10% on a same-store basis, adjusted for the divestiture of our Wisconsin operations and the acquisitions of 3 bolt-on quarries in Georgia and Texas.", "Volumes continued to be particularly strong in Florida and Texas, where shipments increased sharply compared to last year, up 36% and 29%, respectively. Aggregate volumes and other key markets, including Arizona, California, Georgia and North Carolina, all improved at least 14%. Some of the volume improvement relates to a recovery from the particularly wet weather we had in the first half of the year, which we've discussed in our prior conference calls.", "Ready-mixed volumes were up sharply for the quarter and were higher in every market. Cement volumes were up on strength in Florida and asphalt shipments up 4%, were particularly strong in Texas and Southern California. On a freight adjusted basis, aggregates pricing for the quarter was up 2.4% or $0.26 per ton, to an average selling price of $10.89 per ton. This is the highest quarterly sales price in company history. Pricing in our ready-mix segment was up 2% for the quarter. Geographic mix had a slightly negative impact on ready-mix pricing, but all Vulcan states saw higher pricing. While asphalt pricing was almost flat, liquid lower asphalt cost resulted in increased materials margins. Vulcan served states continued to exceed the U.S. average in private construction activity. We have seen improvement in sales momentum and awards in a number of our states. Single-family starts are growing in virtually all markets. And key Vulcan states such as Texas, Florida, California and Virginia are seeing sharp demand growth in private nonresidential buildings.", "Slide 4 provides a summary of our third quarter financial results. Consolidated net sales increased $88 million and gross profit increased $32 million, as both the aggregates and non-aggregates segments reported year-over-year improvements in earnings. Gross profit margin increased 200 basis points. EBITDA for the quarter was $180 million, an increase of $39 million from the prior year's third quarter. Included in 2013 EBITDA is a $9 million pretax gain on sale of reclaimed real estate. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.32 per quarter.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd, who will walk you through our segment results for the quarter.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Thanks, Don. Turning to Slide 5, you see a 9% increase in third quarter aggregate shipments. As often discussed, incremental volume has a significant impact to gross profit, and you can see this during the third quarter. This 9% increase in shipments or $3.4 million additional tons drove a $25 million improvement in aggregates gross profit or $7.35 per incremental tons sold. This attractive incremental margin per incremental ton of aggregates sold demonstrates the earnings leverage of our aggregates business. Non-aggregates earnings increased $7 million, due to improving private construction demand, which benefited concrete and cement volumes, and lower asphalt cost, which increased materials margins in asphalt. The concrete earnings improvement reflects higher shipments in pricing in all of the companies served states. Third quarter shipments of ready-mixed concrete increased 17% and pricing increased mid-single digits in most markets. Cement earnings were down slightly in the third quarter as the earnings effect of higher volumes was offset by higher repair cost associated with the timing this year of a scheduled field outage.", "Now turning to Slide 6. You see that aggregates gross margins increased 130 basis points due to higher volumes and pricing. Aggregate shipments in a number of markets increased sharply versus the prior year. As you'll recall, wet weather had a significant impact in this year's first half. While the wet weather continued into July, we experienced the catch-up effect, as some shipments delayed due to weather were realized in the third quarter, contributing to higher volumes and margin expansion. Aggregates pricing improved 2.4% compared with the prior year. Most markets realized positive growth with year-over-year improvement ranging from low- to mid-single digits versus the prior year. Sharp increase in shipments this quarter led to a 2.8 million ton reduction in aggregates inventory at the quarries. Production levels that were below our level of shipments had a negative impact on total cost for the quarter. These actions negatively affected earnings by $6 million in the third quarter. Our current inventory levels provide opportunity for higher production levels and efficiencies, as demand continues to improve. Additionally, robust shipments to remote sales yards in response to growing demand along the Gulf Coast increased cost of sales $2 million, due to increased freight and distribution cost. Most key productivity and operating metrics improved versus the prior year. Labor productivity and energy efficiency improved, highlighting a solid quarter of cost management.", "As shown on Slide 12, on a trailing 12-month basis, our cash gross profit was $4.24 per ton, 26% greater than it was at the prior peak and trailing 12-month shipments ending in the first quarter of 2006, and this is superior to that of our peers. Because of our disciplined approach to pricing and cost management, the earnings leverage in our aggregates business continues to increase. For the quarter, cash gross profit per ton of $4.83 was the highest third quarter level in company history and the highest of any quarter over the last 4 years. This higher unit profitability positions us well for greater earnings leverage from incremental aggregates tons, as demand continues to improve.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Don.", "Donald M. James", "Thanks, Danny. If you'll turn with me now to Slide 8. Strengthening our balance sheet remains a priority, and we are doing that through both debt reduction and improving EBITDA. During the past 12 months, we have reduced our total debt by $289 million while investing more than $100 million in strategic assets and reserves in Georgia, Texas and Virginia. During the same period, we have increased EBITDA by $137 million. As a result, net debt-to-EBITDA has improved from 6.9x a year ago to 4.5x as of the end of this quarter. We remain committed to further improvement.", "Turning now to our end markets on Slide 9. This slide shows how private construction activity is currently fueling most of the recovery in demand. Trailing 12-month housing starts are up sharply, compared to the prior year, due to broad-based growth in both single-family and multifamily starts. Most Vulcan-served states realize double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12 months ended September 30. We are seeing particularly significant growth in key Vulcan-served states such as Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona. Housing starts in those 5 states accounted for 36% of all growth in trailing 12-month housing starts in the United States. We are also encouraged by leading indicators of future activity for private nonresidential construction.", "Trailing 12-month contract awards, as measured by square feet, for private non-res construction, are up 10% in the U.S. as a whole. Remarkably though, Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona are leading the way here as well, accounting for approximately 80% of all U.S. contract awards for private non-res construction, as measured in square feet. Growth in stores and office buildings, which for us, includes all commercial office and lodging, are the primary drivers. Growth in private construction activity in key Vulcan-served states, like Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona, is important, because not only will we realize the attractive incremental margins from higher aggregates volumes, but we also have non-aggregates businesses in those states that will benefit us well.", "Year-to-date, concrete shipments demonstrate this expanding recovery in private construction, particularly residential construction. Through the first 9 months ending September 30, our concrete shipments were up 10% on a comparable basis to 2012. Highway construction is the largest end market for aggregates demand within public construction. New highway projects, as measured by trailing 12-month contract awards, were up 7% versus the prior year's level, as shown on Slide 9. This recent growth provides some evidence that the more stable and predictable highway funding environment has led to improving construction activity. The large increase in TIFIA funding contained in the Federal Highway Bill known as MAP-21 should also positively impact future demand. Contract awards for TIFIA projects are projected to add $30 billion to $50 billion, highway and infrastructure construction. Some TIFIA projects have been underway in 2013, but 2014 should be a much more significant year in shipments to TIFIA projects. The growth in new highway projects should help offset recent weakness in other public infrastructure, as shown on this slide. Last year, highways composed approximately 30% of full year aggregate shipments, while other public infrastructure accounted for less than half that amount.", "Turning now to our outlook on Slide 10. Our outlook for operating earnings improvement in full year 2013 remains on track, and is supported by continued growth in private construction activity, which should drive volume growth, improved pricing and disciplined cost management. Year-to-date, aggregates volumes were consistent with our earlier expectations. However, the quarterly increases to get to this point have been more uneven due to the wet weather in the first half of the year. That said, growth in residential construction activity and its traditional follow-on impact on private nonresidential construction continues to underpin our expectations for future volume growth and earnings improvement.", "As we look specifically to the remainder of 2013 and into 2014, the projects that could materially impact our aggregates volumes continue to include a disproportionately greater number of large highway and industrial projects. The timing of shipments to these projects remain outside our control, and in some cases, have been delayed into 2014 and 2015 due to project schedules. Full year reported aggregate shipments and pricing are expected to reflect the same growth rate as our year-to-date results through the first 9 months. Year-to-date reported aggregate shipments have increased 2% from the prior year, and same-store shipments have increased 3%, adjusted for the divestitures and acquisitions completed this year.", "Forecasting shipments in the fourth quarter always contains an added level of uncertainty due to weather. Our expectation for shipment activity in the fourth quarter is based on normal weather patterns, which we have certainly enjoyed for most of the month of October. Year-to-date, freight-adjusted pricing has increased 3%, and we expect full year pricing growth to approximate this result. Full year concrete volumes, materials margins and earnings are expected to continue to improve, as housing and private nonresidential construction continues to improve in our key states.", "Strong asphalt sales in Texas should drive full year shipments above 2012 levels. Materials margins are up over 10% year-to-date, and we expect continued earnings improvement in that segment. Cement earnings are ahead of -- on our year-to-date basis, on higher volume and improved pricing, and this trend is expected to continue through the remainder of the year. Finally, we continue to work on additional transactions that will allow us to strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics, while redeploying capital into assets with higher returns.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "First question is on pricing. As you see broader-based recovery in volumes, and our research is showing you're seeing a greater number of new construction projects in particular, how does that impact pricing? And specifically, if you could talk about this quarter, how did mix impact pricing? How should we think about it going forward? And also, if you could clarify what markets were seeing the strongest price increases?", "Donald M. James", "Thank you, Kathryn. Clearly, the visibility of future demand, which we believe is out there, will help shore up our pricing and, I think, industry pricing generally. In terms of the quarter's pricing, we did have a fair amount of negative product mix impact in Florida and Georgia, where we -- in Georgia, we had some very high SMA, Stone Matrix Asphalt, pricing in last year's third quarter and we didn't have nearly as much of that in this quarter. And in Florida, our product mix shift was much more toward some base and shot rock compared to last year's third quarter, based on some large projects that we are currently shipping to. We are reasonably confident we will get to the 3% to 4% price growth full year. And as we look -- the last part of your question, Kathryn, had to do with geography. Pricing across our footprint certainly adjusted for the Georgia and Florida product mix shift, we were up in pricing across virtually the entire footprint. And that's very positive. We continue to believe there are opportunities for price growth supported, as you indicated in the first part of your question, by strong visibility of future demand, as we move into 2014.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "My second question is on aggregate inventories and reduction that you mentioned in the press release in your prepared comments. Do you have any clarity that you can pass on, on how much of the reduction was from base versus clean stone?", "Donald M. James", "I don't know the answer to that. I don't think there was a material difference in the product mix. Basically, what happened is we had a production plan for the quarter, shipments jumped up higher than we anticipated when we set the production plan and we just ended up shipping out of inventory about 3 million -- 3.2 million tons that we didn't get to produce. As we said in the press release, had we produced at the same level in the quarter that we shipped, our earnings on a pretax basis would have been about $6 million higher. So we're looking forward to the opportunities to run our plants at higher and more efficient production levels, as we move into 2014.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Great. And then finally, my final question is on margin -- volume side. We had noted that it'd been relatively weaker out east, and you're seeing some markets catch-up, notably Atlanta, Orlando and the Charlotte markets. What type of projects are you seeing out of markets that you're seeing recovery that previously had lacked?", "Donald M. James", "Well, it's a -- it's very market specific. But in Charlotte, we are supplying a good number of highway projects; in Florida, we are supplying a lot of large commercial-type projects, as well as much stronger housing demand. Housing is coming back in Atlanta, lot development is coming back. That's certainly the significant driver in housing. And in Virginia, particularly in Northern Virginia, around Washington, D.C., there's a tremendous amount of commercial construction. As you know, the East Coast has been -- was, during the first half, weak, largely because of bad weather. We had better weather in the West. But as we sit here today, we're seeing strong recovery in housing in Arizona. A big backlog, as we referenced in private non-res construction based on contract awards all across Sun Belt in California, Arizona, Texas, Florida and Georgia. And as I said, it is remarkable that 80% of the improvement in non-res contract awards is in 5 states for the entire U.S. So we're looking forward to significant opportunities as that end market, which is typically a follow on to residential construction appears to be performing as it has historically.", "Operator", "The next question is from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "First question is on the volume growth that you saw in the quarter. It seems like it exceeded your expectations. It came in faster and stronger than you thought. Is it possible to breakout, maybe, how much of the volume growth was coming from these large projects that you've cited over the last several quarters as potentially getting underway in the back half of the year, versus maybe a little bit more granularity on the pent-up demand that was from the volumes that were pushed out from the first half of the year to the second half? And I guess the third bucket would be just organic growth in your core market.", "Donald M. James", "Among the large projects we are tracking, some began to ship in 2013. Virtually all of them have very significant carryovers into 2014. The TIFIA projects, the Grand Parkway in Houston, the I-75/I-575 Corridor in Atlanta, it will start in '14. We didn't ship any of that in '13. Most of the big projects -- most of the big TIFIA projects did not start in '13, but will start in '14. We have been shipping on some legacy TIFIA projects, particularly in Virginia, on I-95 during the course of the year. On industrial projects on the Gulf Coast, we have been shipping to several energy-related projects along the Gulf Coast. We referenced the fact that we were building -- or we did build inventory in our coastal markets. The majority of that build was coming by ship from Mexico, although we did our building inventory in some rail yards along the Gulf Coast. So that whole market had good shipments in 2013, and we expect that to continue in 2014.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So is it fair to assume that the majority of the strong volume in the quarter was coming from, as you mentioned, a pent-up demand and weather in the first half of the year, just organic growth in your strongest markets?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. We had volume growth across our footprint in virtually every market. And so, there is -- in housing, housing is recovering in most of our markets. And that's driving some of the improvement. But the improvement is coming from virtually all end markets, with the exception of non-highway publicly-funded infrastructure, which is down a little.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then, I guess, can you speak to the bidding environment on some of these TIFIA projects? Is it possible to discuss what pricing is looking like, as you bid on TIFIA work?", "Donald M. James", "Well, we think it is an opportunity for improving pricing. The reason being, these are large projects. The aggregate cost as a percent of the total cost of the project is typically not very high. And as a result of that, reliability, quality, service becomes a bigger factor perhaps than the absolute selling price. And we believe that, that gives us a competitive advantage in the markets. We have booked the midtown tunnel in Norfolk, that's about 700,000 tons over the next 2 years. We booked some of the Grand Parkway in Houston. We booked some of the I-69 design build work in Corpus Christi. As I said, we booked the I-75/I-575 Corridor work, that's about 1.5 million tons over the next 3 years. That will start in 2014. So we've been having very good success. We booked the Folsom Dam project in California that will start early next year. So about 500,000 tons. So we're having good success and we're doing it at good pricing.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, great. And then just one last question, just to follow up on inventories that you're building in Mexico. And just wondering, was there any disruptions, whether as late in the quarter or early into the fourth quarter in your largest quarry there from the flooding that occurred in the region?", "Donald M. James", "No, we didn't have any disruption. The inventory build, Garik, is not at the quarry, it's in the yards along the Gulf Coast, as we are building that inventory in response to higher actual demand, and particularly, projected demand in 2014 [ph].", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ted Grace with Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Don, you certainly painted an optimistic picture of the demand environment. I was wondering, I know you didn't give formal '14 volume guidance. But could you give us maybe a little more of a qualitative assessment of how you're thinking about growth prospects on a volume basis next year?", "Donald M. James", "Well we are -- Ted, we are in the process of rolling up our 2014 outlook from the ground up, and we'll also compare that with the macro view from the top down. The macro, and I'll give you some third-party indication of what -- at least McGraw-Hill, through their Dodge Construction outlook for '14 will see, I'm not saying this will be our outlook, but certainly, we look at this and try to reconcile this with our own internal numbers. But McGraw-Hill sees single-family housing up 26% in dollars and 24% in units in 2014 compared to '13. They see multifamily up 11% in dollars and 9% in units. They see commercial building up 17%. They say institutional buildings will edge up 2%, turning the corner after 5 years of decline. And public works construction, including highways, they see down 5%. Their concern is federal focus on deficit reduction is going to make highway funding more difficult as we move into '14. We believe there's a lot of TIFIA work that will begin in '14 and more TIFIA projects that will be approved in the contracts let. But this is a pretty robust outlook, particularly on the private side. Again, we're not adopting these numbers yet. But in terms of trying to give you views on how we see '14, I think certainly, this will, directionally, we would agree with these numbers.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Yes, we'd agree with those. And then, if you look at the September highway contract awards, I mean, you guys were up 39% in the month of September and on a trailing 6-month basis, you're up 12%. So that's -- I mean, I think we all recognize the challenge on highway federal level. But it seems like your set up in the next year is pretty solid, no?", "Donald M. James", "Well the -- the good thing is, after MAP-21 passed in, basically, September of 2012, it took the DOT 3 or 4 months to start awarding a higher level of highway contracts, most of those are now in the pipeline. So we're -- we have a pretty good, as you can tell from the contract awards, which is a clear example of the pipeline, which includes not only federally-funded projects but state and local projects as well, with essentially flat federal funding, the contract awards in dollars are up significantly, and that builds the pipeline. We're all working very hard, as you know, on trying to find a way to fund the next highway bill. We spend a lot of time and energy with freight [ph] associations and user groups, which are really a key, and the user groups would be companies like FedEx and UPS and Walmart and the American Trucking Association and AAA on the consumer side. I think there's a growing consensus that we are under investing in -- particularly in highways, but public infrastructure as well. As you know, there is a battle going on in Washington, not only between Republicans and Democrats, but between segments of the Republican Party. And so we are working hard to try to make the case for improved infrastructure funding, but at this point, we certainly don't have any crystal ball as to how that's going to turn out.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second thing I was hoping to ask you is just on the Profit Enhancement Plan. Could you just -- I don't know if it's Don or Danny or Dan, but kind of maybe give a sense for where benefits came in for the third quarter, kind of where we are project to date and what's left in the gas tank and what kind of upside we may have to the $155 million?", "Donald M. James", "Yes, I'll let Danny and Dan address that.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "I think the way to look at this is, in 2011, we had an operating EBITDA of $346 million. And if you look at, at street estimates today, I think the average is right around $468 million. So I think it's fair to conclude that we've delivered on the Profit Enhancement Plan, because as we all know, volumes have not improved significantly since our starting point in 2011. It just give you a qualitative comment about the overall program. If you -- when we look at our G&A, our sourcing and our transportation categories, we believe that we've achieved greater than $100 million. And it's our intention to hold on to those savings, as we move forward into future periods, Ted. So we feel good about where we are, and we're going to make every effort to hold the greater than $100 million number that we think we've achieved.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Is there any way to quantify what the benefits were year-on-year in the third quarter? If it's easier to take that off-line, I'm happy to do that.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Let's do that off-line. We had a good the third quarter. We believe that we -- we're right around $20 million in the third quarter of 2013. But we'll give you that comparison off-line, Ted.", "Operator", "The next question is from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Looking at the backlog up in private non-res, can you talk more specifically, Don, as to what kinds of projects you're seeing there? Also, with awards being up 10%, is that quick return than you would expect from -- like from an infrastructure-related backlog, for example. So that 10%, would that be something we could expect a little bit quicker?", "Donald M. James", "Trey, I want to be clear that -- that the data we have given are contract awards nationwide and in our states that are reported, not that we have booked all of that. So we believe we will get our fair share of those particularly given the fact that, as I indicated, 80% of them are in 5 of our key states. That being said, we continue to pursue those vigorously, because that's where the big growth is coming, we think. The kind of projects, some of them are industrial and energy-related projects on the Gulf Coast. But there are still a number of hotels and office buildings and retail that spread across our footprint. That's a pretty broad-based recovery. And I think we were holding our breath that the traditional relationship of private non-res recovery lagging res recovery by 6 to 9 months would hold true to this cycle. And it appears to be doing that. In fact, it appears to be even stronger in a lot of our markets than res has been. The construction cycle for private non-res varies greatly depending on the nature of the project. The bigger more complicated projects, obviously, take longer from contract award to material shipments, retail projects and hotels and office buildings typically can move a little faster, particularly they're not -- have government projects associated -- government restrictions and regulations associated with them. That being said, we would expect -- again I'm not trying to give guidance, but we would expect, based on macro data, that our shipments into private non-res will improve in '14 over '13. To give you a quantification of that, at this point, I'm not able to do.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "I understand. Well, that's helpful. Looking into next year, the highway bill is set to expire in September. Obviously, like you said, Don, you don't have a crystal ball on how that would shake out, but neither do the state DOTs. And given your experience, what are your expectations for the DOT behavior going into the expiration of the current bill, as we look into next year?", "Donald M. James", "Well, I think I'd start with what the DOT behavior was coming out of the passage of MAP-21 in September 2012, and that is the DOTs geared up, got projects out for bid, and they'll move -- they got those projects approved through the Federal Highway Administration and they'll move forward. On the regular Federal Highway Program, typically as we have -- get closer to the expiration of the highway bill, the bid letting at the state DOT level on federal projects will begin to diminish. We are still 11 months away from the expiration of that bill. But so far, the contract awards, on a trailing 12-month basis or year-to-date, are still positive. Again, TIFIA is not part of the regular Federal Highway Program, per se, out of the -- and those projects are funded out of a different funding source. As you know, they have treasury, financing is available for those TIFIA projects, along with some private, typically some private money, and they tend to be revenue-generating projects. So I think, even if the regular federal paid highway program out of the highway trust fund begins to slow in terms of contract award, as we approach September 30, 2014, we are cautiously optimistic that the TIFIA projects, which at $30 billion to $50 billion spread over probably 2 or 3 years in terms of contract awards will help offset whatever weakness there maybe in contract awards in 2013, coming out of the regular state aid federal program out of the trust fund. But as I said, the TIFIA is far clearer that it will move forward in a significant way. And the funding source for the Federal Highway Trust Fund is yet to be resolved.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Fair enough. Last question. The recent transaction with Plum Creek, can you talk a bit about the rationale and then kind of, any update on use of funds? Would you be looking more at acquisitions like you did with the last deal, I believe, with Plum Creek, about a year or so ago? Or is there something else that you have in mind there?", "Donald M. James", "So the thing that makes that transaction makes sense for both Vulcan and Plum Creek is that Plum Creek, of course, is a REIT. They don\u2019t pay federal income tax and their cost of capital is lower than ours. And so a dollar that flows to Vulcan gets taxed at 35%, and a dollar that flows to Plum Creek doesn't get taxed at the REIT level and that makes a big difference in terms of the ultimate distribution of cash from the aggregates business to shareholders, either Plum Creek or Vulcan. As you see, we are paying off debt, as it becomes due. We paid off about $289 million. As we have opportunities that make sense, we want to continue to reduce debt. We also want to continue to look at strategic bolt-on aggregate opportunities. And there are a number out there that we are working on, as we speak, whether we are successful and can find value enhancing transactions, we'll see. But we think there are significant opportunities now. So we continue to look at both bolt-on aggregate opportunities, as well as debt reduction as potential uses for cash.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jack Kasprzak with BB&T.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "I just want to make sure I'm comparing apples with apples. The categories that you gave for McGraw-Hill, is the public category, the all-infrastructure category that would marry up with your -- what you term your infrastructure component of your business, which is highway and all other public?", "Donald M. James", "I believe that's correct. I'll defer to any of my colleagues. I think their commercial construction is private, and their public works construction is public, and here comes the answer. Say it again, Mark. Okay. Yes, highways and non-highway public works construction, and then commercial building is private.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Private. Yes. Okay. On the profit improvement, profit enhancement program and SG&A, I mean I know you're not giving guidance for '14, but done a good job keeping SG&A intact, and with that program, I mean looking forward to '14, I mean, should it be, more or less, flat? Would you expect a little bit of inflation? Just how should we think about that line, if you care to offer any comments?", "Donald M. James", "I think you're getting ahead of us, Jack.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And is there any tax impact from the gain, the $9 million gain, that you reported in the quarter?", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Jack, there's only a very modest impact. First, we fully tax affected the $9 million gain in our income statement. That gain, in terms of cash taxes, will not cost us anything because it's basically going against our net operating loss carryforwards.", "Donald M. James", "But from a GAAP purpose -- GAAP purpose...", "Daniel F. Sansone", "GAAP purpose, we taxed it at the full 39%, 40% marginal rate. And again, it just helps us in the utilization of NOLs.", "Donald M. James", "But you do the math to get to, what, an EPS at...", "Daniel F. Sansone", "About 4-ish, roughly $0.04.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "$0.04, right. And just so, long term, I mean we should -- normalized tax rate should still be in the high 20s or so, we think?", "Daniel F. Sansone", "Yes, when we get to normal operating levels, the key thing that moves our tax rate down from a statutory rate is depletion. And that's worth, at today's volume level, just over $20 million a year of tax benefit. As our volumes grow and our operating income rises, you'll still have that $20 million to $25 plus or minus million of tax benefit for depletion that will bring the effective tax rate down into the range you mentioned.", "John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. Last question is diesel prices in the quarter. Can you tell us what they were compared to last year?", "Donald M. James", "Yes, they were essentially flat with last year's third quarter.", "Operator", "Next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is Matt Rybak on behalf of Jerry. Excellent aggregates volume growth in the quarter. Your outlook comments, I think, suggest maybe a slowing year-over-year growth in 4Q versus 3Q. I'm just wondering if you might be able to touch on the drivers of that? Was there any lumpiness in the third quarter shipments we should be aware of? Or just give us some insight as to how you're thinking about that in the fourth quarter?", "Donald M. James", "Our volume outlook for the fourth quarter, whether it sounds high or low, should be highly suspect, because weather can move that significantly. As we indicated, we had, compared to market demand, depressed shipments, particularly in the second quarter because of weather. We had some catch-up effect in the third quarter. Demand is good and growing. Though I -- we're not -- I would ask you not to focus much on the volume projection for the fourth quarter, simply because there are too many moving parts. But we did have lumpiness in the first 3 quarters of the year, almost totally driven by weather. Although with that weather overlay, there has been improvement in the market demand as we move through the year. So if we can keep that momentum, we're optimistic we could do perhaps better than what our year-to-date volume has been. But if we get unseasonably cold or wet weather or early cold or wet weather, people will shut down and move volume to '14. So we'll have to see how that plays out.", "Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on inventory, you've been reducing them for a while now. I'm just wondering if you could comment on at what point you expect to be producing in line with demand?", "Donald M. James", "I think, going forward, we probably -- that will be our production schedule. As we look at, from the -- and that has to be done on a quarry-by-quarry basis. It's not some high level inventory management structure. Each quarry, each market has to look at projected future demand, timing of shipments, the sizes, the specifications, and has to build a production plan around the sales forecast. Certainly, as we see here today, if we see volume continue to move, to grow in 2014, our production levels should begin to approximate shipment levels, which certainly help our GAAP earnings.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "So Don, a lot of my questions have been answered, but one sort of high level one. On the residential side, you obviously had a lot of nice things to say about what you guys are seeing in the residential markets. Certainly, some of the homeowners, a lot of investors have been concerned about a bit of a slowdown on the front end of what they're seeing in terms of orders and things like that. Can you square the circle a little bit and talk about what you may be hearing from your customers and what they're hearing from their customers?", "Donald M. James", "Well, a lot depends on what information you focus on. One of the factors that has supposedly slowed the sale of housing is the fact that prices have moved up sharply. And an explanation for prices have moved up sharply is the inventory of houses available for sale has fallen sharply. So it depends on whether you are selling an existing house or you're focusing on building a new house on a new lot. You're going to have a very different view about the current state of the housing market. We like the fact that inventory of houses available for sale is shrinking. We're seeing a significant amount of lot development going on, which is really one of the drivers for our product, much more than the actual construction of the house in markets other than sort of central and southern Florida, where there's a lot of aggregate in the construction of the house because of the building codes. I think we are cautiously optimistic that housing will continue its recovery based on demographics and affordability. Obviously, as interest rates are tending to move up and prices of housing is tending to move up, that will have an impact on demand presumably. But the McGraw-Hill data that I referenced earlier, they're saying single-family housing starts up 24% to 785. That's still a modest number compared to history and demographics and the normalized demand rate and construction rate for single-family housing. So while we recognize there are some headwinds to housing, in our markets at least, housing, at least in our -- most of our markets, the housing is -- remains very good.", "Operator", "The next question is from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Quick question. The government shut down, does that have any sort of impact on business? I mean, obviously, the volumes are very strong. But when you think about -- kind of having to think about this again, in a couple of months, I was just curious kind of what you -- how the state DOTs react to that?", "Donald M. James", "It is really hard for us to quantify the impact of the shutdown. If there has been an impact, it's sort of hard to see. But I think it's much more of a macro consumer confidence kind of issue that may have some impact. But it's really hard for us to trace it down to our business.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "And I think an important point is that the highway program, the Federal Highway Program and the trust fund, is insulated from the shutdown itself.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that was my understanding that it, like, sometimes, environmental studies and so forth would be delayed, but it didn't sound like that was a big deal. And then as far as the debt paydowns, you guys have done a great job of that. Should we think about that as more as debt comes due? Or are there any specific debt-to-EBITDA targets you're looking at? Just kind of how to think about that? And also, within the context of the 2015 notes.", "Donald M. James", "Well, we certainly would anticipate paying off the 2015 notes as they become due, whether there's an opportunity to do anything before that remains to be seen. But we do want -- our -- we have a dual strategy here. One is to pay off debt, as we can find opportunities to do that. Also to increase EBITDA, debt-to-EBITDA is the metric that needs improvement. And by increasing EBITDA as we reduce debt, we're certainly getting that back in line, where we want it to be.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Desi, filling in for Bob. Based on the commentary that you provided, it looks like public infrastructure spending should increase materially in 2014 in the states in which you serve, Do you think that growth will be fairly even over the year? Is there reason to believe that volumes will be front or back-end loaded next year?", "Donald M. James", "I don't have a good read on that. It's -- when some of these particularly these TIFIA projects start is a function of weather and the gearing up of the construction consortium in some cases, I would think the regular Federal Highway Program should be relatively stable across the course of the year. The driver for whether we're seeing TIFIA projects begin to show up in a significant way in the first half versus the second half is really wait and see, I think. We don't have a good read on the actual timing of when shipments will go on the TIFIA projects, even those that we already have booked, and in terms of the first half versus second half.", "Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then someone -- a couple of people touched earlier on SAG, how impressive that's been year-to-date. And it looks like -- the Profit Enhancement Plan is scheduled to result in an incremental $25 million of the annual cost savings in 2014. Given the really impressive performance so far, do you think those savings are still available? Or has some of that been pulled forward with maybe this year and 2012?", "Danny R. Shepherd", "We still have opportunities. And we continue to make good progress, specifically in the transportation area. And we've had some really good successes on sourcing. So we believe that, that going forward in all 3 categories, G&A, SG&A, sourcing and transportation, we still have more that we can achieve.", "Donald M. James", "And I think as we see it today, we still believe there's an incremental 25 in 2014 that's not yet shown up on the bottom line in '13.", "Danny R. Shepherd", "Yes, we do. yes.", "Operator", "Next question is from Christopher Olin with Cleveland Research.", "Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company", "I just had a couple of quick questions. Just going back to your operations in Mexico. Are you limited at this point, at any stage, by capacity when you start targeting these growth areas for 2014? I just wondered how much upside can come from that area?", "Donald M. James", "We are not capacity limited in any meaningful way. We can produce 12 million tons easily in that quarry. We have shipping capacity with our own vessels, as well as charter vessels. We also have the engineering work largely completed to expand the production capacity of that plant as we need to in a very cost efficient way. So that plant, which is our largest quarry, has a tremendous upside, as we look at continued growth along the Gulf Coast and in Florida and Texas, those are the principal markets, 3 markets, Texas, Florida and the Gulf Coast. And we have a plan to, as needed, to expand capacity very efficiently. So that is one of the really wonderful opportunities that Vulcan, going forward, is the shipments out of the quarry in Mexico.", "Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay. I guess I was also curious, you were talking about the demand strength across the Gulf of Mexico and building up inventories. I was just curious, within those demand drivers, has there been any impact from this port expansion or potentially people looking to accommodate the Panama Canal growth?", "Donald M. James", "To date, there's not been any shipments to any port expansion projects. But there are, as you know, there's sort of a race among several of the ports to be the first mover and try to be the port that will be able to take the first of the cape-sized container vessels. And we certainly are well positioned to benefit from any of those projects when they materialize. But to-date, I would say -- Danny, you correct me if I misstate this, I don't think we have shipped any of those projects, with the exception of a couple of years ago, we did a very large project in Norfolk at the Maersk terminal. And most of that material came out of our Havre de Grace quarry by barge. And that was plus or minus 1 million tons, I think. So the benefit of the work for us when these port expansions occur is the infrastructure to handle and store and transship the containers, which requires a very large storage and trans loading area, a huge amount of aggregate and a fair amount of concrete that would go into those projects. And so we're happy -- we'll be very happy to see them materialize, but we don't have any that are in any current state of bidding for materials.", "Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay. Just -- apologize if you said it, but did you give a -- the outage cost for the cements line or the maintenance cost?", "Donald M. James", "About $3 million that we spent in the quarter on the scheduled outage.", "Operator", "I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. James for any closing remarks.", "Donald M. James", "Thank you very much for being with us today. We are certainly encouraged by the opportunities that we have to turn growing volumes into even faster growing bottom line. Thank you. We look forward to talking to you again after the close of the year. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's call. This concludes the conference.

Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Angela, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vulcan Materials Company 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]", "Mr. Don James, Chairman and CEO, please go ahead.", "Donald M. James", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today on the call are John McPherson, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who most recently served as our Senior Vice President for our East region; and Tom Hill, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, who most recently was Senior Vice President of our South region.", "We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference throughout the call. These slides are also available to you on the webcast.", "Moving to Slide 2. Let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports and in our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "In addition, during the call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's fourth quarter 2013 earnings release.", "Turning now to Slide 3. We will begin with a brief discussion of highlights from the fourth quarter before we review the full year.", "Our fourth quarter results demonstrate excellent growth potential of our markets and the meaningful operating leverage that exists in our aggregates business. Aggregates volumes increased 7% in the quarter, and we leveraged those incremental tons of aggregates into significantly higher earnings.", "As you can see on this slide, a 14% increase in net sales led to a 48% increase in gross profit. Earnings from continuing operations increased from $0.03 per diluted share to $0.08 per share for the quarter. These earnings improvement were driven by expanding margins in aggregates, earnings improvements in our non-aggregate segments and lower SAG costs.", "On Slide 4, you can see that each of our segments reported higher shipments for the quarter as private construction activity continues to increase in the markets we serve. Aggregate shipments increased 7%. Volumes in Arizona, Georgia and California were particularly strong, up 34%, 29% and 22%, respectively. Texas, Florida and North Carolina all reported double-digit volume growth as well. These improvements continue the success we saw in the third quarter and support our forecast early last year that volume improvements would accelerate in the second half of the year as the construction recovery began.", "Our ready-mixed volumes were up 15% for the quarter. Asphalt shipments were also up 12%. Higher shipments drove the earnings improvement in each segment of our business, especially the aggregates business, where our operating leverage is significant. The aggregates segment gross profit of $112 million was up $30 million or 37% from the prior year.", "Taking a closer look at the aggregates segment results on Slide 5, you see that aggregates pricing for the quarter was up 3.5% and shipments were up 2.3 million tons, or 7%, leading to a 14% increase in segment revenues. This top line growth, along with very good unit production costs, led to a 390 basis point increase in the aggregates segment gross profit margin.", "Cash gross profit increased $0.48 per ton or 12%. The fourth quarter, with higher volumes, higher prices and flat aggregates segment cost, continued the strong result we experienced in the third quarter of 2013.", "And moving now to the full year results on Slide 6. EPS from continuing operations were $0.16 per diluted share and earnings improvement of $0.58 per share for the prior year. We believe this improved performance sets the stage for the beginning of earnings growth going forward. A 9% increase in net sales for the year led to a 28% increase in gross profit as each segment reported improved earnings.", "Full year aggregates segment gross profit increased $61 million, and margins expanded 140 basis points due to a 3% increase in both volume and price. We leverage this increased sales by holding our SAG costs flat with the prior year, leading to a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA.", "Our cash earnings reached $292 million, up $82 million,, or 39%, over 2012. Our expectations for 2013 to be the first year of aggregates volume growth since 2005 were met. Further, the expectation that volume growth would be weighted towards the second half of the year also materialized.", "Wrapping up my comments regarding full year 2013, let me highlight the progress we have made to strengthen the balance sheet and improve our credit metrics. In 2013, we reduced long-term debt by approximately $150 million and ended the year with cash and equivalent balance of about $198 million. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was reduced from 5.8x at the end of 2012 to 5x at the end of 2013. The downward trend in this measurement is a priority for us as we continue our efforts to move to an investment-grade credit rating.", "I will now turn the call over to Tom Hill, who will provide some commentary around the contrast of the first half of 2013 with the second half.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thank you, Don.", "Turning to Slide 7. You can see that the first half and second half of the year were markedly different, as Don just mentioned. Volumes and resulting earnings were overweighted to the second half of the year due to improving private construction activity and the impacts of weather.", "In the first half of the year, volumes were slightly lower than prior year due mostly to the sharp contrast in weather for the comparable halves. In 2012, many of our markets experienced an extremely mild winter, while in 2013, wet weather dampened shipping levels in key shipping months. As a result, first half volumes in 2013 were down 1% versus prior year.", "Consistent with our expectations for the second half of 2013, aggregates demand improved to due to increased construction activity, including some large project work that began to ship as expected without the adverse weather impacts. Additionally, shipments that were delayed in the first half of the year due to weather began to ship in the second half.", "As a result, volumes in the second half increased 8%, driving a $55 million or 27% increase in gross profit. Aggregates gross profit for the year were up $61 million, 86% of which occurred in the second half, demonstrating the operating leverage that results from higher volumes.", "Turning to Slide 8. You can see an upward trend in the aggregates cash gross profit per ton, an important measure of our performance. Full year cash gross profit per ton in 2013 was $4.36. This is the highest in 4 years. It is important to note that current unit profitability is 30% higher than it was in 2005, which was Vulcan's peak volume year. This higher unit profitability sets the stage for better earnings leverage and provides the foundation for our continued optimism for significant earnings growth in this construction cycle.", "Our opportunities to improve our operations leverage have come from the acquisition of aggregates operations and reserves in high-growth markets, like the ones Don mentioned earlier. Additionally, the sale of our Florida area, concrete and cement assets to Cementos Argos, announced in January, will provide immediate improvement to profitability and earnings and allow us to pursue additional aggregates investment opportunities.", "On Slide 9, we summarize this transaction, the strategic rationale and the use of proceeds. After touching on the strategic rationale of this transaction, I'm going to turn the prepared remarks over to John MacPherson for some comments on the financials and use of proceeds.", "Touching first on the transaction. We have agreed to sell our Florida cement and concrete operations to Argos for $720 million. From a strategic viewpoint, this transaction is consistent with our aggregates-focused strategy, and we will remain in the Florida market as a leading producer of construction aggregates.", "The transaction includes a 20-year aggregates supply agreement, which keeps us well positioned to participate in the Florida recovery. Vulcan and Argos are strategic partners in other parts of the country, and we believe our aggregates-focused strategy complements the cement and concrete focus of Argos. We look forward to furthering that relationship by supplying these operations.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to John MacPherson.", "John R. McPherson", "Thanks, Tom. As Tom mentioned, the sales price of these assets was $720 million. The sales price will result in a pretax gain of approximately $210 million and a net impact on earnings per diluted share of approximately $1. After-tax proceeds should be approximately $685 million after the use of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and the tax benefits of acquiring other property through a 1031 like-kind exchange.", "As noted when we announced the transaction, we're deploying these proceeds primarily to pay down debt. On an after-tax basis, we used approximately $550 million to repurchase $500 million par value in bonds. We also acquired a quarry with 136 million tons of reserves in Southern California in a $117 million transaction that closed on December 31.", "As I'll note in more detail in a subsequent slide, our credit metrics have improved significantly, and we believe we're well positioned to add high-quality assets to our portfolio as opportunities arise.", "Moving to Slide 10, and in order to give you a clear view of the impact the divestitures and debt repurchase may have on our nearer-term earnings, we have included summary information from a table that will be included in a Form 8-K filing upon closing of the transaction with Argos.", "The information reflects the company's full year 2013 operating results, assuming both sale of the Florida cement and concrete operations and the repurchase of $500 million in bonds have been completed on January 1, 2013. In other words, you can see what the impact would have been on the fiscal year '13 results we reported today had these transactions taken place at the beginning of last year.", "As you can see, the divested assets contribute approximately $173 million in net sales during 2013. Had the divestiture occurred on January 1, 2013, Vulcan's net sales would have been $2.46 billion as compared to $2.63 billion reported today, or approximately 7% lower. Although sales have been lower, gross profit would have been higher, $449 million as compared to the $427 million reported today. The gross profit contribution of the divested assets, although certainly improving with growing volumes in Florida, remain negative in 2013.", "The pro forma impact on our gross profit margin as a percent of sales is a 210 basis points improvement to 18.3%. Interest expense, given the use of proceeds to pay down debt, would have been $33 million lower.", "Netting these effects on an after-tax basis, 2013 earnings per fully diluted share would have been $0.48 as opposed to the $0.16 we reported today. I'll touch on the impact of these transactions and the impact they will have on our credit metrics in a moment. But before doing so, I'd like to take us back to the goals we laid out 2 years ago.", "Slide 11 draws directly from our February 2012 earnings commentary. The top of the slide notes the commitments we made at that time to improve our profitability, divest nonstrategic assets and reduce debt and leverage.", "Following the close of the divestitures and debt tender announced in January 23, which we expect to happen in the first quarter, we will have accomplished the goals we communicated to you 2 years ago. With respect to profit enhancement, we have increased adjusted EBITDA by $116 million and adjusted EBIT by $173 million over the past 2 years.", "In our core aggregates segment, gross profit has increased 410 basis points, or $107 million despite tons shipped growing only 2%. And as noted earlier, our cash margin per ton sold has improved steadily during this period.", "Now of course, our commitment to delivering on the full profit potential of our aggregates business remains unchanged. We expect margins to improve further in 2014 as volumes continue to recover, and the profit enhancement initiatives implemented over the past 2 years will continue to benefit our business for some time to come.", "With respect to planned asset sales, we committed to generate $500 million in proceeds from the disciplined sale of nonstrategic assets. Following the close of our transaction with Argos, we will have generated over $1 billion from such divestitures. At the same time, we've reinvested approximately $240 million to purchase aggregates operations and reserves in key markets, such as California, Georgia, Texas and Virginia.", "Through the process of these divestitures and acquisitions, we believe we strengthened our core aggregates portfolio and improved our prospective returns on capital now and through the cycle.", "And finally, from a capital structure perspective, we have reduced debt by approximately $800 million and improved our credit metrics substantially, giving us greater flexibility to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders as we move forward.", "Slide 12 gives a bit more information regarding our improved profitability, lower debt balances and resulting stronger credit metrics. The debt figures here for 2013 include the impact of our outstanding $500 million tender, which we compare to our adjusted 2013 EBITDA in order to illustrate the degree to which our credit position will have improved over the past 2 years.", "Following the close of our debt tender, we expect our ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA to be in the order of 3.6x, down from 7.6x in 2011. As Don indicated, our intent remains to return to investment-grade credit ratings, and we're well positioned to accomplish that goal as demand recovers. In the meantime, we have the flexibility needed to invest in our operations and add to our portfolio as opportunities arise.", "Before I hand it off to Don to discuss our outlook for 2014 in more detail, let me once again complement and thank our people. What we have been able to accomplish over the past 2 years and the excitement we have regarding the strength of our position moving forward serve as a direct compliment to the quality of Vulcan's people at all levels of our organization. Their expertise, dedication and drive will be only more valuable as we prepare for the growth ahead of us. We are proud of what we've done so far, and we're genuinely excited about the opportunities to come.", "Don, over to you.", "Donald M. James", "Thanks, John. As John mentioned, we realized a sharp increase in aggregates shipments in the second half of 2013. One of the drivers of this increase is the continued recovery in private construction activity.", "If you'll turn to Slide 13, you can see the -- we expect each major end market for aggregates demand to increase in 2014, led by strong growth from private construction activity. This is certainly good news.", "Even better, we expect growth in Vulcan's served markets to outperform the rest of the U.S. This belief that our markets will achieve above-average growth fuels the excitement John mentioned earlier. Our market position in these higher-growth markets, coupled with the earnings leverage we have improved upon during the downturn, is a powerful combination to grow earnings.", "Private construction activity is expected to account for most of the demand growth in 2014. Additionally, we expect large projects, including both public infrastructure and private industrial projects, to play an important role in overall demand growth in 2014.", "Moving to Slide 14. You will see how this end market outlook translates into volume and price growth for Vulcan. We expect volumes to increase 4% to 7% from the prior year and for growth to occur across most of our markets. This volume growth is expected to provide positive momentum for broad-based price improvement, with the timing and rate of price increase varying across our markets.", "We expect sales growth and earnings improvement from our non-aggregates businesses, while SAG costs for the full year expected to be in line with 2013.", "Interest expense should be $165 million to $170 million, down sharply from 2013 due to the anticipated closing of our announced tender offer for $500 million in long-term debt and the repayment of $150 million in debt during 2013.", "Our DD&A for 2014 should be approximately $275 million, assuming the sale of our Florida concrete and cement businesses closing in the first quarter.", "Finally, we anticipate capital spending of approximately $220 million. This increase in capital spending will support the growth in aggregates volume we see in 2014 and beyond and further improve our production cost and operating efficiencies.", "In closing, let me say that we like our position today as a leading aggregate supplier in the United States. We like our markets, and we like our positions within those markets. We have been working hard over the past 2 years to complete our announced initiatives, and we have achieved our goals.", "We will remain committed to continuing improvement in our operating results and in creating additional value for our shareholders.", "Now if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ted Grace with SIG.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just start by talking about now that we've got the balance sheet kind of more where you want it -- I know you mentioned the investment-grade rating was the goal, but it certainly provide you with a lot more flexibility to kind of go on offense. And so I was just wondering if I could walk through how you're thinking about redeploying that kind of new capital to kind of accept to grow the business more aggressively with the cycle?", "Donald M. James", "Ted, our strategy remains consistent. We want to grow our aggregates business in high-growth metropolitan markets. We have opportunities, we believe, to do that in 2014, and that's where our focus will be.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe could you just elaborate on how the acquisition environment feels and what the -- kind of the prospects for deals looks like?", "Donald M. James", "We believe there are significant opportunities to help us pursue the strategy of adding aggregate operations in some of our best markets. And we are looking at those and working on some opportunities that we hope will materialize in 2014.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second thing I just wanted to ask is in terms of -- think about the CapEx dollars to increase to $220 million, can you walk through kind of where you see yourself spending that between the aggregate business and the asphalt and concrete business, how we should think about growth versus maintenance CapEx? And maybe geographically, if there's any color on -- part of that can go to the extent in this load to increase capacity there. Or any handle there in that regard will be great as well.", "Donald M. James", "Ted, there's both maintenance CapEx and growth CapEx in that $220 million. We will replace some mobile equipment. As we've said before, our maintenance CapEx is really a function over time of the throughput of volume. And as we're looking at higher volumes in 2014 and certainly beyond, we all -- we have a very good plan, which Tom Hill and Danny Shepherd have worked through. The vast majority of the CapEx will go into our aggregates business. But there'll also be some CapEx, in particular, going into our ready-mixed business in the Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C. area, which is a really good business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "We have been noting throughout this year the improvements in markets in the Eastern part of the U.S., which previously had lagged. Could you give a little bit more color on the pace of improvement and in particular, up there, any margin differentials between performance in the Eastern part of the U.S. versus the Western?", "Donald M. James", "Well, certainly our markets in the Eastern U.S. were impacted in the first half. They came back very strongly in the second half. We do get very nice margins in the East, but we also get some really nice margins in the West. So we don't have a big diversity between our margins in the East and the West. Certainly, our margins in California are improving. Our margins in Texas are improving. Our margins in Arizona are improving. So we're seeing improvement in our margins across our footprint.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "And is the margin improvement more a function of just better volumes? Or is there something structural in consolidation that's helping the margin improvement?", "Donald M. James", "I believe margin improvement is coming from price and price discipline. It's coming from operating cost, and it's coming from volume improvement. Whereas we indicated some of our highest growth markets are in the West: Arizona, California, Texas; and where, as we've said, I think, repeatedly, we have huge volume leverage in the aggregates business, which really helps to drive earnings with relatively modest volume growth.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay, great. Moving just to end markets and focusing in -- more on the non res and the commercial demand, could you give a little bit more color what types of projects you're seeing? We are definitely seeing more industrial-focused type commercial projects, so plants, port work. But if you could give a little bit more color on the type of non res or commercial projects you're seeing now and if you contrast that with what you'd seen in prior cycles.", "Donald M. James", "I think -- and I'll ask Tom Hill to comment on this in a minute, but there are 2 pieces, we're projecting in our markets about a 9% growth in private non res. There are 2 components to that. There is the traditional private non res growth, that's retail office, hotels; and we're seeing that in a number of markets. But I think along the Gulf Coast, there are some very significant industrial projects, many of which are tied to the new energy opportunity and how that is creating a boom in those markets, plus aircraft manufacturing and automobile manufacturing in some of our footprints. And, Tom, let me ask you to comment further.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thanks, Don. We are seeing a number of industrial projects along the Gulf Coast, particularly in Texas and Louisiana, tied to energy. We've started shipping a number of those late 2013, and we'll -- that will pick up in 2014. We're also seeing some port expansion projects. And this is in addition to the -- as Don said, the traditional nonresidential that follows the improvement in residential growth.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "And I assume the port expansion is tied to Panama Canal and prep for that eventual opening.", "Donald M. James", "Yes, that's correct.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay. Final question, and this may be in your filings, but what portion of the ready-mixed concrete loss in the quarter was attributable to the Florida assets versus the other geographies that will stay within Vulcan?", "John R. McPherson", "Kathryn, it's John. I think we'll discuss more on that as we close the transaction and move forward. But certainly, the concrete assets we have retained are more profitable than the ones we've divested. And I think absent the divested assets, that would -- the divested assets would be the majority of the loss.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Todd Vencil with Stern Agee.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "This is probably an obvious question, but I will ask it anyway. If I take your very helpful reconciliation, walking through the impact of the divestiture and I just blow out the amount of that in cement, is the rest of the adjustment all in the concrete segment?", "Donald M. James", "Yes.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I guess my main question is as you look at your forecast, Don, where do you see sort of upside or downside risk? And what will drive that for this year to the ranges you have given?", "Donald M. James", "I believe there's upside, Todd, in the industrial and energy-related projects that Tom Hill referenced. There's also upside in the timing of some of the TIFIA projects, which you are familiar with. If some of those get kicked off in a significant way toward the second half of 2014, that's an upside. If we get a new highway bill on time, that could have a marginal impact in 2014. But most of the work on -- that we will get on highways is already based on the existing highway bill and the bid lettings that already occurred and will occur in the first part of 2014. So the big upside is in industrial construction, primarily on the Gulf Coast, and the big TIFIA projects. And there are big TIFIA projects in our footprint, some of which we have booked, some of which we are working to book in Texas, Georgia, Virginia, Florida, California.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Perfect. And since you brought it up, what are you hearing from your better purchase than the one I have about what the outlook or the state of affairs is with regard to the highway bill?", "Donald M. James", "At this point, Todd, we don't see an interruption in highway funding. The mechanism for how that will be achieved, whether it is a reauthorization of the highway bill on October 1, '14, or an extension or funding extension, our belief based on our contacts in Washington is that particularly in an election year, there's unlikely to be any disruption in the flow of federal dollars to the state DOTs.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Makes sense to me. And the final question, I guess, just to follow up on that. On TIFIA, I mean, do you -- I would think it would be a no-brainer to sort of whatever they do with highways to continue funding TIFIA at the higher level that was baked in the last highway bill. Is that consistent with what you're hearing, or is there something else going on?", "Donald M. James", "Yes. And the rationale is that there are far more TIFIA projects that have been submitted than can be funded under the current MAP-21 TIFIA authorization. It is a very deficit-friendly way to fund highway congestion -- or highway construction in high-growth metropolitan markets. TIFIA, as you know, requires a revenue stream to fund the repayment of the treasury lending. And as a result of that, you have to be in high-growth congested markets in order to generate enough revenue to meet the TIFIA financing requirements. So these projects get built in our sweet spots, and we really like TIFIA. And we think it is probably the easiest part of the new highway bill to get reauthorized.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's Matt Rybak on the call for Jerry. Can you just first talk about how much of the volume momentum from the second half of this past year you've seen flowing to the first month of 2014? And then maybe discuss a little bit how you're thinking about the seasonality of shipments in 2014, whether you think they'll again be back-half weighted or be a little bit more smooth.", "Donald M. James", "You can't draw any conclusion from January shipments, so I won't do that. And we'll report on that at the end of the first quarter. We certainly think that there is a lot of momentum going into 2014 from the second half of 2013, primarily in private construction, both residential and non res. We've talked about upside. If there is -- if there are -- if any of these industrial projects get moving in a big way or the TIFIA projects get moving in a big way, we could see stronger second half shipments than first half. But we'll have to wait and see how those things, the timing of those projects come along, and we'll keep you updated on that in further conference calls.", "Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And are you seeing any significant headwind on the Panama Canal project given the stall of activity that's currently taking place down there?", "Donald M. James", "I think the U.S. port expansions are way behind the completion of the Panama Canal. So even though the canal construction has been extended by maybe a year or so, the ports along the Gulf Coast and the South Atlantic Coast have a lot of catching up to do to be ready by the time the canal is completed. So I don't believe there's any -- going to be any slowdown in the work being done in the U.S. ports.", "Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just turning to the public side briefly, can you talk maybe a little bit about how your large public construction project backlog today compares to levels a year ago, and possibly quantify the value of projects you're currently bidding on?", "Donald M. James", "Our public projects, particularly highway projects, are -- we have a higher backlog today than we had a year ago. To give a little color on that, we'll start our shipping the I-90 job in Chicago. We'll start shipping Virginia midtown tunnel. We've got -- we're seeing the I-75/575 job in Atlanta. And we just started shipping the Grand Parkway, the third loop around Houston. So we're seeing the large highway jobs pick up in '14.", "Operator", "Your next question comes with Chris Olin with Cleveland.", "Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company", "I just wanted to go back a little bit to the Panama Canal and port situation. Do you have any type of thoughts on how much aggregates don't -- could be consumed per port? Or is there any way to quantify what the impact could be on the industry?", "Donald M. James", "I think it is too early in most cases to try to quantify that. It all depends on the port design. And so we don't have estimates that we would be prepared to share publicly at this time.", "Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company", "Fair enough. Could you give us a bit of an update on the quarry in Mexico, maybe where it's at from a utilization point of view? And any updated thoughts you might have on expanding the production capacity there?", "Donald M. James", "Yes, let me ask Tom Hill to respond to that.", "James Thomas Hill", "We still have ample capacity at the quarry in Mexico. But if we approach capacity there, we are prepared and ready to expand that operation fairly quickly. We've looked at that and are comfortable with being able to expand that, if necessary, in a timely manner.", "Donald M. James", "We have a very large reserve base there. We have plenty of capacity in our harbor for incremental aggregates shipments. The plant can be expanded efficiently from a capital standpoint, and we look forward to being sold out because we're -- we've got tremendous opportunity coming out of that operation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo.", "Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "The first one was -- going back to the highway bill for a second, if you think about the multiyear outlook and trying to grow your aggregates business back to any kind of resemblance of prior peak volume, how important is it do you think to get a multiyear bill like with the previous ones where you have successive increases in spending? I'm just trying to think about the outlook, and it seems that you're getting more positive on nonresidential. Obviously, residential has been improving. It seems like the infrastructure is the -- is slowing the growth of potential a bit. So I was just trying to think about the multiyear situation, what the potential is for volume growth.", "Donald M. James", "As we indicated in the prepared remarks, our outlook for 2014 is the first time since 2005 that all 4 of our major end markets are projected to grow in terms of aggregate demand. The big growth, obviously, as we pointed out and is contained in our slides, is in -- on the private side, other non-highway infrastructure we're projecting up 3% in our markets and highways up 2% in our markets. So clearly, highways are lagging for 2014. Again, the timing of TIFIA projects could change that. The issue with the Federal Highway Program is, of course, funding. We are seeing, though, a lot of states making moves to pick up their own revenue streams. In particular, Virginia and Maryland have an active state revenue enhancements that will significantly advance highway funding. But if we get -- if -- and our projection for highway shipments in 2014 is largely based on what's already in the pipeline. But if we do -- if we are able to work with our coalitions and Congress and achieve some improvement in the Federal Highway Program, then I think there's a lot of upside there. But at this point, we are projecting only 2% growth in our markets.", "Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And can you remind us what highways are right now kind of in 2013 as a percentage of your overall mix?", "Donald M. James", "Oh, about 30% to 35%.", "Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my last question was the SAG guidance that you gave for flat, does that take into account the divestiture of the cement assets? Because it looks like you had $9 million plus of SAG in that segment.", "Donald M. James", "It has that segment in our SAG through the first quarter.", "Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So that means other -- so just other spending is just going to be up. Normal spending course of business is going to be up by $9 million.", "Donald M. James", "Well, as we continue to grow our aggregates business, both internally and through acquisition, that will push our SAG up modestly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "This is Seth in for Keith Hughes. I just want to ask a question on the concrete business. I'm trying to get a feel for post the divestiture. How should we think about the margins and the volume in this business going forward?", "John R. McPherson", "Yes. Again, I think I answered before, I think we'll give more detail on this after we've closed the transaction and move forward. I would again reiterate that most of the loss reported last year was associated with the divested assets, and the margin structure of what we retained is significantly higher than what we divested. Again, we'll give you more details as we move forward.", "Operator", "And your last question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A quick question you, Don, how quickly can something get into the pipeline and you all start shipping rocks? Is that something that you know -- something in the pipeline that would happen next year, and we're kind of kicking that came down the road? Or is that all of a sudden, we could have kind of a -- I don't want to say influx but things being more expedited? How likely is that?", "Donald M. James", "It all depends on the end market and more -- even within the end market, it all depends on the nature of the project. For example, in highway construction, if there is an overlay project that is a resurfacing project that's bid in February, it can ship in May or June. If it is a project that requires right away acquisition and dirt-moving, the shipments can be delayed by 12, 18 months or more. Housing is relatively quick. As you know, the impact on our demand from housing starts is largely in the infrastructure streets and utilities as opposed to the construction of the house. One exception being in most of Florida, building codes require houses to be built out of masonry, which has aggregate in it. And there's a little more flow-through into residential there. Multifamily residential has higher aggregate content, and those move pretty quickly. I think once the TIFIA projects are finally approved, since they are financed and have to get to a revenue stream, there is an incentive for the contractors to get those projects built faster, which is an incentive that's not typically available in regular highway projects. So -- and certainly with the industrial and energy projects, which are private, once those projects are approved and construction starts, there's all of the incentive in the world to get those projects finished quickly. So the lead times are very different, and we tend to look at things as a big pipeline and projects feed in. And so it's -- the mix of products in that pipeline are often very difficult to say with some precision as to how long between contract award and material shipments. I'm sorry I can't give you any more precise answer, but it's a very flexible result depending on the nature of the project.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "No, no, no, that's great. In the release, there is a line about unlocking capital for more productive usage. So should we think about that continued debt pay-down, then some M&A? And then are we starting to think about a dividend at some point this year? Or is that still kind of to be determined?", "Donald M. James", "I think our board will consider a dividend each board meeting as we do. And certainly, that's one of the opportunities we have. And we've said many times before, we look forward to getting to the point where we can begin to restore a meaningful dividend. And I think we are -- hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to do that sooner rather than later. I'll ask John to respond further to the other parts of your question.", "John R. McPherson", "I think, I mean, use the capital, what parts you're referring to investing more capital on our core aggregates business over time where we enjoy great fundamentals, great returns, great operating leverage moving forward. And you've seen us do that. We've taken some of the capital from these divestitures to both pay down debt, yes; but also to give us the flexibility to make some investments using this make in our core aggregates markets, which are very attractive.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, no doubt. And then as far as the...", "Donald M. James", "The next significant debt repayment is at the end of 2015, and we would expect to be able to repay that out of just operating cash flows.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And as far as the M&A environment, it's been pretty active out there. Have the multiples -- are they starting to creep up as well? And would you look at buying assets or more swaps? Or how do you all think about that as you tighten up the shares within your respective markets?", "Donald M. James", "Well, if we can do bolt-on acquisitions in our high-growth markets, we are very interested in those kind of transactions. We get significant synergy primarily from operating cost and overhead, and that will be -- our principal focus is aggregate bolt-on acquisitions in high-growth markets. If we have assets that may be more valuable to someone else than they are to us, then we would certainly consider a swap as necessary. But our primary focus is on bolt-on aggregate acquisitions in our key markets.", "Operator", "There are no further audio questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Don.", "Donald M. James", "Well, thank you very much for joining us today. Obviously, we're very pleased with the fourth quarter and the second half of 2013, and we very much look forward to 2014. And we will talk to you again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you so much, and have a good day.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Operator", "Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Earnings Conference Call. My name is Phyllis, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. James, you may begin.", "Donald M. James", "Thank you. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our first quarter 2014 results. As the operator said, I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials.", "Joining me today are John McPherson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Hill, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "A slide presentation will accompany this webcast and will be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of the presentation contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's first quarter 2014 earnings release and at the end of this presentation.", "We are very encouraged by our performance during the first quarter and with the recovery in demand for our products. Despite the challenges inherent in an unusually cold and wet winter in many of our markets, our employees delivered solid shipment growth and improved margins.", "During the quarter, we successfully completed the previously announced sale of our Florida area cement and concrete assets to Argos, as well as the related repurchase of $506 million of our outstanding debt.", "Vulcan is well positioned to increase our shipments and our earnings, and to expand our aggregates operations and reserves as we move forward.", "Turning now to Slide 3. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong earnings leverage in our aggregates business. Aggregates volumes increased 6% and we leveraged those incremental tons into significantly higher earnings.", "The 9% increase in net sales led to a 93% increase in gross profit.", "Reported earnings from continuing operations were $0.41 per diluted share versus a loss of $0.47 in the prior year. Included in these earnings improvements are $1.04 per diluted share of income related to the sale of the company's Florida area cement and concrete assets, and $0.35 per diluted share in charges to interest expense referable to the $506 million of debt repurchase.", "Adjusted for these onetime transactions, earnings from continuing operations were a loss of $0.28 per diluted share, a $0.19 per share improvement from last year.", "Reported EBITDA for the quarter was $267 million, which includes a $220 million gain from the sale of Florida concrete and cement assets, and $7 million in other income, primarily from the routine sale of reclaimed land from former operating sites.", "Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA grew 50%, from $26 million last year to $39 million this year. This improvement was driven by both increased aggregate shipments and by higher aggregate prices, which more than offset higher costs resulting from production challenges due to weather.", "Non-aggregate cash gross profit benefited from higher asphalt volumes and higher materials margin.", "With that said, I'd like to now turn the call over to Tom Hill to give us a few more specifics about our first quarter results.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thanks, Don. Taking a look at the aggregates segment results on Slide 4, you'll see the resulting revenue and gross profit impact from higher shipments and pricing.", "Aggregates segment revenues increased 13% and segment gross profit increased 55%. Aggregates shipments increased 6% versus the prior year, despite very cold weather in most of our markets. Shipments in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois and Texas showed strength, each increasing by more than 15% versus the first quarter of last year.", "Due to favorable -- due to unfavorable weather, first quarter shipments in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina were lower versus the prior year. Strengthening private construction demand more than offset the effects of extremely cold weather in Georgia, and unusually wet weather in Florida, resulting in year-over-year growth in shipments in these markets.", "In other areas harder hit like Virginia, the number of available shipping days was cut in half by extreme winter weather. This restriction on construction activity and available shipping days impacted both our aggregates and concrete business in Virginia. That said, we expect shipments delayed beyond the end of March due to weather to be recovered in the following months as the construction season gets underway.", "Aggregates pricing for the quarter was up 2% versus the prior year. These solid results were despite an unfavorable geographic mix due to the impact of weather on volumes in several higher price markets. Without the unfavorable geographic mix impact due to weather, our year-over-year pricing increased 3%.", "Slide 5 highlights the favorable operating leverage in our aggregates business. Trailing 12-month volumes have increased 8 million tons or 6%, while aggregates segment's gross profit improved $84 million or 25% due to higher pricing, the earnings leverage of volume growth and cost control.", "Turning to Slide 6. We compare our trailing 12-month cash gross profit per ton at the end of the first quarter with the prior year and the prior peak volume, which occurred in the first quarter of 2006. Trailing 12-month unit profitability has increased 6% from the prior year. More significantly, cash gross profit per ton is 31% higher than the prior peak volume. This is remarkable considering the fact that current volume is 50% below the prior peak.", "This improvement of more than $1 per ton reflects the accomplishments of our employees to effectively manage cost and improve price throughout this downturn. This per ton gain also illustrates the attractive structural characteristics of our aggregates business. Higher unit profitability sets the stage for significant earnings growth in this improving demand cycle.", "Now I will turn the call over to John to provide some commentary about the outlook.", "John R. McPherson", "Thanks, Tom. Our volume growth in the first quarter and resulting earnings improvement that Tom just discussed are a really solid start to what we believe will be a very strong year for overall demand growth. The demand momentum, which began in the second half of 2013, is continuing in 2014. And our margins are expanding due to the combination of operating leverage, cost disciplines and growth in pricing.", "Turning now to Slide 7. You see a breakdown of our expectations for aggregates demand by each of the major end markets. These expectations are consistent with the demand outlook we discussed during our fourth quarter conference call in February, but let me share a bit of color regarding what we see in the market as of the end of the first quarter.", "Two points to start. First, we continue to expect each end market to grow in 2014, with private construction recovering most rapidly. Secondly, we expect Vulcan's served markets to grow at a faster rate than the markets we do not serve. We're very pleased with how our portfolio is positioned, as the recovery in construction activity continues to take hold.", "Now touching on activity and trends in specific end-use markets. In private residential, we continue to see broad-based growth across our geography, led by states such as Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. But in addition, we're also seeing residential construction activity in aggregates demand recovering in important areas such as Atlanta, Charlotte and Nashville.", "In private nonresidential, our markets are beginning to benefit from some growth in office and commercial work, complemented importantly by rising demand from large industrial projects.", "As we've noted before, these projects can represent large quantities of aggregates supplied over multiple years. And Vulcan is very well positioned to serve these customers, particularly along the Gulf Coast.", "These projects provide an exciting opportunity for our aggregates business. That said, the timing of shipments can vary and we continue to monitor them before the actual shipment days.", "Now we're also seeing strengthening large project activity in the public arena, including in transportation infrastructure. Although it has taken longer than most of us expected, federally funded TIFIA projects are beginning to drive additional aggregate shipments. The Grand Parkway in Houston and the Northwest Corridor in Atlanta are just 2 projects we expect to begin shipments to in 2014, or have already begun to make shipments to.", "Additionally, state-level funding initiatives across several states are beginning to drive new project lettings, with Virginia and Maryland just being 2 examples.", "While the parameters surrounding the renewal of the Federal Highway Bill remain uncertain, large transportation infrastructure projects and the growth in contract awards we've already seen should provide reasonably stable demand in this end market for the balance of the year.", "Overall, we expect modest growth in shipments in the public end markets in 2014, and we're optimistic with respect to public infrastructure construction in 2015 and beyond.", "So while the first quarter does not make a year, our local teams and our customers are excited by what they see in the early stages of this recovery. Activity and confidence are rising across an increasingly broad group of geographies and end uses. And we believe Vulcan's people and assets are very well positioned to meet our customers' rising aggregates demands during this time.", "Before turning the call back over to Don for some closing remarks, I'll comment on 2 additional topics that continue to be priorities, particularly as we look toward another year of earnings growth and hopefully a multiple year recovery in demand.", "The first topic is the strengthening of our balance sheet. During the quarter, both our sale of cement and concrete assets to Argos and our repurchase of approximately $500 million in debt closed as expected.", "As you can see on Slide 8, net debt to trailing adjusted EBITDA is down from 6.4x to 3.6x. Coupled with unit margins and earnings, this improvement in our balance sheet allows us the flexibility to reinvest in growth, whether through margin-enhancing capital projects, bolt-on acquisitions, or other opportunities to strengthen our aggregates franchise.", "And of course, we've continued to add to our portfolio as opportunities present themselves. Over the past 18 months, we have acquired assets and improved on our ability to serve customers in areas such as San Diego, Atlanta, San Antonio, Charleston and Northern Virginia.", "The second topic I would like to highlight briefly relates to the value of the land we own and our commitment to manage these holdings in a manner that generates value for both our shareholders and the communities in which we operate.", "Our first quarter results included $18 million in cash proceeds and a $6 million pretax gain on the sale of 2 properties, a former Baltimore area quarry, of which a schematic depicting the intended use is shown here on Slide 9; and a parcel of land on the river in Chattanooga. Those of you who have followed our company closely know that the disposition -- that dispositions such as these are not at all out of the ordinary. Since 1998, we have generated an average annual cash proceeds of approximately $32 million from land sales.", "Vulcan owns more than 110,000 acres of land, a significant portion of which is in urban or urbanizing areas. We will continue to operate and develop these properties with an eye toward their post mining uses and the ultimate value to both our shareholders and our neighbors.", "I'll now turn the call back over to Don for some closing comments.", "Donald M. James", "Thanks, John. Let me close by saying that we're encouraged by the improving economic fundamentals we see in our footprint. Our outlook for aggregate volume and price growth remains very positive, consistent with the guidance we gave in February. We expect 2014 to be another year of earnings growth for Vulcan, and we're well positioned to capitalize on the multiyear recovery in demand that we believe is in front of us.", "Thus far, in this recovery, we have leveraged modest volume growth and strong growth in earnings due to the operating leverage inherent in our aggregates business and the disciplined execution of our operation and sales teams.", "This operational performance by our teams gives us tremendous earnings upside as volume recovery continues.", "In our non-aggregates segments, we continue to expect to earn $40 million to $60 million in gross profit in 2014. These improved results include higher earnings in asphalt and the return to profitability of our concrete segment.", "With our improved capital structure, we're excited about the possibilities of expanding our aggregates operations and reserve base and further enhancing our footprint in the fastest-growing U.S. markets. We are continuing to pursue a number of attractive growth opportunities that will enhance our earnings potential.", "This is an exciting time and an excellent opportunity for Vulcan, and we remain committed to adding lasting value built around our unmatched asset base.", "And now, the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was hoping to touch on margins. I know you mentioned you were pleased with the performance in the quarter. And specifically on the aggregate side, I was wondering if you could just walk through kind of the puts and the takes on the incrementals, what weather impact may have been in the quarter if you're able to impute it based on shipping days available and maybe just start there?", "John R. McPherson", "Sure, Ted. This is John. First, I'd say there were 2 major weather-related impacts that affected our incrementals in the quarter. One was production, both amount and efficiency. And we had an inventory reduction in the quarter, which led to about a $2.8 million negative variance of profitability for us for the quarter. The other impact, as Tom mentioned, was a negative geographic mix in terms of pricing and margin, and that contributed another negative $3.7 million in headwinds to us. So on a normal geographic mix and on a normal production basis, we would have been $6.5 million or so higher in the aggregate segment gross profit line. When you walk that across and there's one other thing I'd note, I think, Ted, you get to the kind of numbers that you're used to seeing, we continue to believe in the 60% flow-through number that we stated before, particularly through the cycle. And again, I think, when you make those adjustments for both the geographic mix and for production, you'll see the kind of incrementals you're used to seeing from us.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Was there anything on the freight side or the logistics side that was a notable call out in terms of just the dilution would add to the underlying volume-based incrementals?", "John R. McPherson", "Well, there's 1 -- that's an important question. I think, 1 thing to note, within our aggregates segment, we have intentionally grown our transportation-related revenues and this is a profit enhancement for us. These revenues come with substantially no capital commitment but they already lower margin as a percent of sales. So in the quarter, those revenues grew from about $60 million to $80 million as being supporting products and services, transportation-related. So Ted, to be clear, what I call the non-direct stone revenue, that grew at a rate of 32%, 33% during the quarter. It's very -- it lends to our incremental margins per tons sold. It's very good for us to do. It's an important profit enhancement, but it does, if you look at the total segment numbers, dilute the margin.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. That's really helpful. So the last thing I'll ask, and I'll jump back in queue, is you talked about the cash cost per ton being down 8% year-on-year, could you just bridge us what the key variables were in the first quarter and then how we should think about those variables in the second through fourth quarter?", "John R. McPherson", "I'll probably let Tom comment. But the cash margin was up is what I'd highlight, not the cash cost down.", "James Thomas Hill", "The cash cost -- this is Tom, Ted. The cash cost per ton was virtually flat. And that is attributed to our people in that they were operating in really tough conditions, which affect -- negatively affect operating parameters. So we were pleased with a relatively flat cash cost year-over-year.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And then, as we think about that cost dynamic going forward, I know you said there's a lot of labor leverage going forward but are there any other kind of headwinds or tailwinds we should just be mindful of as we kind of model going forward?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think that the rising volumes always help those cash costs because there's a big piece to that. I think, our folks have done a good job keeping our equipment and operations in good shape, ready for rising volumes. And that's a matter of really adding hours at this point.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And the last thing I'll just ask before I jump back in queue, any chance you could just characterize kind of how April started off or the quarter started off?", "John R. McPherson", "I think, Ted, we'll have to answer that when we get into the second half. Our volumes were up more in March than they were in the balance of the quarter. I think, they were up 9% in March. We like the momentum through the quarter and coming out of the second half of last year. But let's talk about April when we get to our second half call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Unknown Analyst", "[indiscernible] filling in for Bob. So if I do the math on your assumptions for end market growth, it would imply aggregates volume growth at the top end of your guidance range. As compared to the outlook provided in February, would you say you were more encouraged about the outlook for volume growth at this point in the year?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, I think, we're experiencing broad-based growth throughout all of our markets. And we're hearing a lot of -- this is Tom, I'm sorry, and we're hearing a lot of confidence from customers, suppliers and employees. To try to give you a little color, throw a local color on that, the California -- the private segment in California continues to improve. UCLA is predicting housing permits up 27%. Texas was really hitting on all 8. Residential and non-res continues to improve in Texas. We're beginning to see new subdivisions in Houston and San Antonio. We secured a number of very large energy-related projects along the coast. The large -- the 4 largest of which would be over 2 million tons. And then, the highway segment in Texas is healthy. We talked about before we secured the Grand Parkway in Houston, which is a TIFIA project, we begin to ship it. The central U.S. is a little slower to return, but we are starting to see recovery. We've secured a number of large projects in Illinois and residential is starting to -- we're seeing growth in residential in Nashville and Knoxville. Georgia is a market that we're very pleased with, the residential continues to accelerate and commercial is following. And while the highway funding is flat, we have secured the Northwest Corridor, which John mentioned earlier, which is a TIFIA project, they'll start to ship probably towards the end of 2014. Our Florida market continues also to improve. Residential continues to grow, commercial is following that healthy. With health -- an example of that is the Doral Breeze project in Miami, where we secured 750,000 tons. The Carolinas, we're starting to see residential improved in the Carolinas, really driven by Charlotte, as John mentioned. In Virginia, we also see improved residential and some big projects like the Midtown Tunnel, which is a TIFIA project. So overall, we have a lot of confidence in our markets. I think, you do have to remember, this is the first quarter, and there's a lot of -- to play out, there's a lot of noise in the first quarter. So at this point, I think, I'd have to tell you we're comfortable with our range.", "Unknown Analyst", "That's great. And then, on pricing, aggregate prices were up 2% versus your guidance of 3% to 5%. And so how much is your expectation for accelerated pricing gains as a function of improving mix versus maybe a true pricing power as volume growth accelerates?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, I think, we're seeing pricing momentum all across the markets. Now as we say early on, every market, even submarket, prices at different times, it is a whole mix there of timing of pricing. But while we -- even through the downturn, we were able to get price increases. So with growing markets, growing demand, growing confidence, it just gives you better pricing momentum. Again, much like volume, we're -- just coming out of the first quarter, there was a lot of noise in there. So we -- I think, we're comfortable with that until we have a few more months of real construction cycle under our belts.", "John R. McPherson", "I think, you hit the keyword, which is momentum. And while it's early, we're really excited about the momentum, both on the volume side across geographies, and as Tom mentioned, on the pricing and margin side in our business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the private nonresidential buildings estimate you have. Very bullish estimate here, both in your markets and as a whole. Can you kind of list off 1, 2 or 3, which of those you think will be the best and which could be potential laggers this year in that segment?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think, the best was going to be the private residential. And that's typical in that the non-res will follow the private -- the housing. But there's a component to the non-res that is a little different this time and that is the big energy-related projects that we've seen along the ports. So the answer to your question, to be clear about it, across the country, residential is leading but non-res is, as usual, comes behind it. But that non-res is bolstered by those -- the big energy plays on the Gulf Coast.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So, and within nonresidential, you would expect the energy and I assume industrial to be the leader in office and retail development to be a little less than that, would that be fair?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think, right now, right at this time, that's correct. But you are starting to see the building and the -- come on and the traditional non-res, strip centers and things like that, you're starting to see those come on which are -- it's following the residential.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And for Vulcan, is the aggregate intensity, how do those end user markets within nonresidential compare?", "Donald M. James", "Well, historically, highways are the most aggregate-intensive. Industrial projects would be next because, particularly the ones on the Gulf Coast, the first step in the process is to build a pad on which you can expand a refinery or build an LNG facility or an industrial plant along the Gulf Coast in low-lying areas. So those are significantly aggregate-intensive. Then, traditional commercial construction will be next and residential is the least aggregate-intensive. Although in the residential area, as you know, the primary use of aggregates is in lot development, streets and utilities and infrastructure. And in this, unlike residential construction 1 year or 18 months ago, we're now in a lot development phase, which is more aggregate-intensive than residential would be thought as steady state.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Question on the $2.8 million inventory drawdown in the quarter. Just wondering, was this primarily in weather-hit markets or is it a bit more broad-based? And if you could talk about the outlook for inventory management for the balance of the year and if there's going to be any impact on incremental margins?", "James Thomas Hill", "Garik, this is Tom. The drawdown on inventory was really due to the bad weather, the cold weather in the East. It is just very inefficient or impossible to run in snow and ice. So that was intentional on our part. And I don't see that inventory being an impact going forward, we'll catch that up and move on. But you just -- you create a lot of cost and a lot of pain for yourself if you try to run in really, really bad weather.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. That makes sense. And I guess, if you could talk about -- you touched upon your views on private non-res. And you've talked about for a couple of quarters now the sensitivity to your guidance, depending on whether or not some of these big projects in the South commenced this year and certain timing around these projects. As you move through the first quarter, as we sit here in early May, can you talk about your visibility with respect to these big projects now as opposed to a quarter ago, and what your level of confidence that they actually get started this year versus next year?", "James Thomas Hill", "We've seen a couple of those projects start. We begin to ship a few of them. But we are still unclear as to the timing of a few others, and that's based on permit or engineering plans. So at this point, we need to see another quarter before we have real clarity on those big projects because when they go, a lot of them go really fast. So we still got some uncertainty on timing at this point.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. That's fair. And I guess, just a couple of housekeeping questions, I think, mainly for John. Could you provide an update on your view on SG&A for the year, as well as depreciation costs?", "John R. McPherson", "Sure. On SG&A, we, of course, continue to manage it very, very tightly. We're very confident that we will be able to offset any normal increases in SG&A due to wage increases or those types of things with other savings. And so we'd expect it to be flat to down for the year. And equally importantly, we are very confident we will continue to leverage sales growth and profit growth through time. On -- does that answer your question?", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes. And DD&A and then maybe interest as well.", "John R. McPherson", "DD&A and interest. DD&A we'd see as $265 million for the full year, and that reduction from last year, as a reminder, is largely due to the assets we divested. So that's $265 million versus I think $305 million last year. Interest expense would be in the range for the full year of $165 million to $170 million. The run rate reduction with our bond repurchase is about $32 million. And to save you asking, tax rate for the full year we see it at around 28%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "I appreciate the color that you had regarding the mix impact on pricing, but one thing I want to talk about a little bit is we look forward and knowing that you're going to have more infrastructure-related projects coming forward, how should we think about managing product mix in regard to modeling pricing, knowing that you're going to have a greater mix of base, which is a lower price point but you're still getting pricing on that. So if you could help us how we should think about that, not just for the upcoming quarter but over the next 12 to 24 months?", "James Thomas Hill", "This is Tom, Kathryn. I'll look back on that, we did not have a big impact on our first quarter for mix. And I think, we have -- going forward, I wouldn't see us having a substantial mix impact on pricing. I think, there's a pretty good balance there. I think, we have a handle on that. And while we will see some large base jobs, we are also going to see substantial concrete rock and asphalt rock work. So I don't see a big mix impact on price.", "John R. McPherson", "You talked a bit for margin also, right?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes. That mix of business doesn't hurt our margin either.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay. Great. And we've been following TIFIA for a bit now. Could you give a little bit more clarity on how much of TIFIA projects are being captured in your current volume guidance for the year? And it's difficult to put it in buckets on a percentage basis, but can you give a better sense of will it be more like 10% or 15% type this year or do you see more momentum into 2015? But in general, giving some sense of the relative mix and momentum of this TIFIA project as they ramp up?", "James Thomas Hill", "This is Tom again. Let me see if I can work you through some TIFIA jobs that we either have or have on the horizon. We have the Regional Connector in California, which is a small job. The Grand Parkway in Houston, which we talked about is a very large job, which will -- has started shipping and will impact this year. The I-4 expansion in Orlando is a job that just bid and was awarded. It's a little bit unclear of where the materials will go at this point and that job probably will not start until '15. The Northwest Corridor that we talked about in Atlanta, which is a very big job, the highway expansion in Atlanta that has an impact of about 1.4 million tons. But again, that will start shipping in late '14. The Midtown Tunnel in Northern Virginia, that job is around 800,000 tons, we are shipping that job currently. And in the Duluth [ph] Metro Rail in Northern Virginia, that's really a concrete job that we'll supply with our Northern Concrete group has an impact of about 140,000 to 150,000 cubic yards. So that gives you a view of what we know about right now. Most of those, we have secured. Some of them we'll ship this year. A lot of that we'll ship in 2015 and beyond. Does that answer your question?", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Yes, it is. It's really we're in a very, very early stages of seeing the volumes flow through, which is helpful.", "James Thomas Hill", "I think, that's right. It's early stages. And I think, when you look at large projects overall, and maybe back to Garik's question, what we have is we have much better visibility to the awards and to the backlogs and to our -- what we have left is those are 2 exact shipment dates. But the momentum in the overall demand is there and is growing and the question is just one of timing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Quick question on the mix again. And Tom, I know you mentioned that you don't expect a real impact and didn't see a real impact as far as product mix goes on pricing. But geographic mix obviously had a little bit of impact in the first quarter. And then, you touched on these large energy projects coming up over the next few years in the Gulf. Also there's some port deepening and other activities going on in the Gulf as well. And with Florida being a pretty high-priced market relative to some, should we expect a positive mix impact from just geographic mix impact on pricing as we look over the next several quarters and the next year?", "James Thomas Hill", "The answer to your question is yes. Obviously, we're hit hard on the East Coast with weather in the first quarter. That will catch up. As that catches up, it will have a positive impact on price. Also Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, which have attractive pricing, as their markets come back, and as the Florida market comes back, we will see positive impact on pricing.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "But just specifically to some of the activity in the Gulf, do you think that those will be priced as such that will -- you'll be able to realize more of that price impact or mix impact, I guess, as these big, large projects come in? Just trying to get a sense for how you think those are going to be situated?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think, those are at attractive prices. And I think, they will have a positive impact on pricing.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, also, kind of on that note, I'm assuming a lot of that, with all the activity in the Gulf, a lot of that would be coming from the Yucat\u00e1n, a lot of that product. So how should we think about margins on that rock? Would they be any different than typical coming out of the Yucat\u00e1n?", "James Thomas Hill", "Those are very attractive margins and they will help us.", "Donald M. James", "And Trey, on the point, we have a very significant competitive advantage on projects on the Gulf Coast because it's a straight shot, as you know, up from our quarry on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. And so those are really good projects for us both in terms of pricing and margin.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "It seems like you guys are set up nicely to benefit from those.", "John R. McPherson", "Trey, one more slightly different point on geographic mix, just worth noting for the group. In our -- again, as Tom mentioned, our Virginia, Maryland markets, and through the Carolinas really were hit by weather. And just to give you a sound bite on that, our ready-mix volumes in Virginia, Maryland were down 19% versus the prior year. They're up everywhere else. And so it obviously impacted our results significantly in that segment for the quarter. But just to give you a sense, Tom had mentioned how we had half the shipping days go away in Virginia and Maryland. And so that will rebound as we go through the year. But you shouldn't lose that as a driver of mix and as a driver of concrete segment performance in the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you talk about the large-scale infrastructure projects that are likely to move towards TIFIA financing? Is your visibility and lead times better than it's been in prior cycles? We're hearing from some contractors that their jobs for mid to late '15 that already visibility is pretty good on, which would be much earlier, I guess, than the typical bid cycle than prior cycles. I'm wondering if you're seeing that as well. And then, just based on the project flow, can you talk about, with a rough sense, of what proportion of your aggregate shipments in '15 and '16 could ultimately be towards TIFIA-related projects?", "Donald M. James", "Jerry, we are -- continue to be very active in monitoring and working with potential contractors on the large TIFIA projects. The substantial majority of those projects are in our footprint and the reason for that simply is these have to be revenue-generating projects. And many of them are toll roads. And in order to get the traffic counts necessary to generate the revenue stream to support the TIFIA financing, you have to be in large, congested metropolitan areas. So California, Texas, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Illinois, those are where most of the big TIFIA projects are located, which happen to be fortunately markets where we have very substantial positions. So we think we will get more than our fair share of the TIFIA projects. And as I said, we want to work very closely with the contractors in order to help them achieve the best value for the aggregates and other heavy materials and products in markets where we have those on those projects. That being said, and I think, Tom took you through a list of the ones that we currently have booked or active and working on, that's a very important part of our future demand. It is not possible for us to tell you today what portion of our projected shipments in '14, '15 or '16 don't go to TIFIA projects because we simply don't know what the timing of those projects is going to be or the level of our participation. We won't get every TIFIA project in our footprint because we have competitive markets wherever we operate. But it will be a significant boost to our volume. But in order to try to give you the kind of specificity as to what percentage growth will be in each of the next 3 years on TIFIA projects, we simply don't have the data to do that.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But it does sound like the visibility has improved, as you pointed out, we've all been waiting for those projects to get moving and it sounds like it's finally starting to play out.", "Donald M. James", "It is. And they've been slow coming out of the U.S. DOT. Part of it was the shift from -- as you know, under the statute, the federal government could provide up to 49% of the total financing. Because the number of projects was substantially oversubscribed, the DOT and the Treasury decided they would cut back maximum participation to about 33%. So some of the projects had to go back and redo their financing in order to meet that 33% test. That's been one of the issues. And just the fact that there was a huge increase in TIFIA, and therefore, a huge increase in the number of projects submitted to the DOT has certainly slowed the process of review and approval. But as we have noted and you have noted, finally, under the new MAP-21 version of TIFIA, which dramatically increased the federal support there, that we're seeing those beginning to materialize.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, from a capital deployment standpoint, you've obviously reduced leverage pretty aggressively here. How should we think about capital deployment from here? Anything to do before your December 2015 notes become due?", "John R. McPherson", "Nothing to do before the notes come due. We'll likely pay those off as they come due out of operating cash flow. I think, the answer to your question, as we noted in our remarks, is that we are very well positioned to pursue growth opportunities as they arise. We'll be disciplined in how we do that. But we think there's a real opportunity in the market these days to smartly grow our footprint and our franchise.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Don and Tom, you guys have both talked about the growth in residential communities, which I guess, were basically dead for a while and are now coming back. Can you talk about whether that community development activity is picking up and how far away you think we might be from reaching kind of parity where, I guess, we're developing a lot for every lot we're building on?", "Donald M. James", "I'll give you one small example. I was in San Antonio last week with our management team and there's lot development going on everywhere. I think, the same thing is happening in Phoenix and Atlanta, lot of other markets, as Tom mentioned, Nashville and Charlotte. I don't have any metrics to say that we will reach equilibrium in lot development and home starts by day X. But at this point, I think, you've seen the statistics that say house prices are moving up sharply in most markets because the inventory levels of new homes are dramatically reduced. You know what incentive that creates for homebuilders. They need lots to build new houses to meet the demand and we're seeing a tremendous amount of lot development. It's very geographically specific, but it's all based on the markets where there's population growth, household formation, job creation. That's been a big driver.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That makes a ton of sense. Is it fair to say, as people, I guess, that worried a little bit this spring about exactly where the starts are and the traffic is, that this is a phenomenon and a trend that's a little longer-term, takes longer to develop the communities. So does it feel a little more durable than maybe the more volatile housing statistics?", "Donald M. James", "Well, I think, we take a fair amount of comfort in the fact that we're still plus or minus 1 million housing starts a year. And so the average over the last, whatever, 30, 40 years has been 1.4 million, 1.5 million. So we're -- housing starts, before they even get to a normalized run rate level, have to go up another 50%. And there got to be lots for those houses to be built on. So there's a lot of noise from month to month and week to week about housing starts and home sales. But when you back up and look at it over the longer term, we're very bullish on housing, particularly given our geographic footprint and the population statistics in our states. One of -- for example, the demographers are now saying Florida has now surpassed New York in population. So Florida has been very strong for us for at least the last 18 months in terms of recovery. It got hit, as you know, dramatically in the downturn. But I think, we are very bullish about housing and don't get distracted by reports about this, that and the other that come out every week about housing. We just think the long-term supply/demand in our markets is very favorable for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Vix [ph] with Jeffries.", "Unknown Analyst", "I have 3 or 4 pretty short questions, hopefully. The first one was the states that had over 15% growth, I was surprised that Illinois was in that state, although you have referred to it briefly in some of the other comments. Could you kind of just summarize why you think that market is so strong? Secondly, I noticed in terms of leverage now, you're looking at net debt to EBITDA. Could you talk about where you'd be targeting in the longer term for that ratio to be? And therefore, give us some idea of the size of corporate activity that you might be looking at? And then, just finally, the ready-mix, obviously, was distorted by Maryland and Virginia, as you mentioned, but it's also distorted by the Florida divestment. Do you have any kind of like-for-like volume change excluding Florida you could give us for the quarter, and did it also have a significant impact on the ready-mix price?", "James Thomas Hill", "Mike, this is Tom. I'll start off with Illinois. As I said in my comments, we have secured a number of very large projects in Illinois that will last throughout the year. So we're pleased with our performance in Illinois and confident that those markets will improve as the year goes along.", "Unknown Analyst", "And there was no weather impact in Illinois?", "James Thomas Hill", "I'm sorry?", "Unknown Analyst", "There was no negative weather impact in Illinois?", "James Thomas Hill", "There was bad weather impact. But the large projects, when they were able to ship, they shipped strong.", "John R. McPherson", "I think, our guys on the ground are just doing a good job winning the work, too, and gaining share. Mike, on your question on balance sheet, we use any number of metrics, we just used this particular one to illustrate the improvement. As stated, our longer-term through cycle goal is to return to investment-grade metrics. It's really less about the metrics and more about the ability to pursue growth smartly throughout the entire cycle, which is what we're focused on. As we sit here today, our view is that we have plenty of firepower and financial flexibility to pursue those options that make sense for us and I think that's a function of both the balance sheet, but, Mike, also the really strong margins and unit economics that we're able to generate from the business, the strength of our operations and sales teams. So we don't see financial constraints in what we do, it's more a question of the opportunities and which ones make sense.", "Donald M. James", "Mike, on your question on ready-mix, I think, John has already mentioned that our ready-mix in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia, which is one of our best ready-mix markets, was down about 19% due to weather in the quarter. Everywhere else, we were up, on average, at least double-digits. California, Texas and Georgia. We had very good ready-mix shipments in the quarter year-over-year growth. We are projecting that our ready-mix segment becomes profitable in 2015, part of that is growth in margin and volume and price. Part of it is not having the Florida business as part of our mix going forward. So we think ready-mix will benefit greatly from the growth in housing, and to some extent, growth in private non-res construction. If you've been to Washington DC lately or -- you see huge amount of private non-res construction there in terms of office buildings and high-rise condos in the district, as well as in Northern Virginia, and that's a very strong market for us, all we need there is a little weather.", "John R. McPherson", "Mike, just to give you another sound bite, the concrete businesses we retained, some asset that we've divested, would have been up on volume, I think, 1.4% for the quarter, and that's despite what is by far our largest position, Virginia, Maryland being down 19%. So the increases in the other markets are very strong. We have increases in pricing, increases in material margins across each of these businesses, and I think, all indicative of the recovery in private residential activity. So we're bullish on it. And obviously, the weather impact in Northern Virginia will reverse itself. I think, if you look at the gross profit mix relative to the expectations in our concrete segment for the quarter, it is almost entirely explained by the volume decline in Northern Virginia, which again, will reverse itself.", "Unknown Analyst", "Is that a high-margin market for you?", "John R. McPherson", "We have a very good position in that market. That's a good concrete market, arguably our highest-margin market.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions.

Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Bridget, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vulcan Materials 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Hill. Mr. Hill, you may begin your conference.", "James Thomas Hill", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2014 results. I'm Tom Hill, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today is John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. We are very pleased with our third quarter results detailed in the press release. We're happy to provide additional color today and spend some time answering your questions.", "A slide presentation will accompany this webcast and be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call.", "Before we begin with the actual results and projections, I refer you to Slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.", "Now turning to Slide 3. We are pleased with our third quarter results and how we continue the strong conversion of incremental revenues in the growth in earnings. Revenues increased 7%, driven mostly by a 12% increase in aggregates shipments. Excluding revenues in the prior year associated with our divested concrete and cement businesses in Florida, revenues increased 15%. Our earnings leverage on higher revenues continues to be excellent. Gross profits and EBIT increased sharply, up 31% and 57%, respectively, due largely to strong earnings leverage in our aggregates business and flat SAG costs. On a comparable basis, earnings from continuing operations increased 93% to $0.54 per diluted share.", "Turning to Slide 4. Our third quarter results continue a trend starting in recent quarters, as shown in this table of trailing 12-month key figures. Over the past 12 months, aggregates shipments have increased 9% or $13 million tons, still well below normalized demand levels. During this time, we've leveraged a 9% growth in volumes into a 38% increase in gross profit and a more than 130% increase in EBIT. We believe we are in the early innings of demand recovery. As we continue to execute our sales and operating plans, we remain very focused on continuing the margin expansion you've seen us deliver in recent quarters.", "Slide 5 illustrates the volume growth in the quarter. The map depicts the 20 states we currently serve. You can see the geographic breadth of the year-over-year volume growth across our markets. Third quarter shipments grew 12% in total, and 10.5% on a same-store basis. Shipments in Illinois and Texas were up 31% and 21%, respectively, due in part to large project work. Other markets, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia reported volume growth between 10% and 15%. This strong broad-based growth is driven by improving private construction activity and our ability to serve growing demand for large project work in both private and public end markets, particularly large industrial projects along the Gulf Coast. Residential construction activity continues to be solid across our footprint. New lot development is increasing. While the growth rate nationally for housing starts has slowed in recent months, many of our key markets in Georgia, Texas, California and Florida continue to post above-average growth rates. Private nonresidential demand in our markets continues to grow faster than in the rest of the U.S. This is driven by office, commercial and manufacturing projects, and by significant growth in construction activity along the Gulf Coast. We are uniquely positioned to serve petrochemical plant expansions and other energy-related major projects.", "In the public sector, shipments for highways remains strong due to strong contract awards in 2013, increases in state highway funding and TIFIA-funded projects in key states. Additionally, the extension of the federal highway funding through May 2015 has provided more funding certainty to state departments of transportation. Given the strength of our strategic positions and our sales execution, we expect to keep outpacing the rate of volume growth of the industry overall. Our markets, despite recently reported double-digit shipment increases, remain far below normal levels of demand.", "Now let me focus on our success in converting these early gains and demand into expanding margins and profits. To cut straight to the headline, you'll see on the right-hand side of Slide 6 our gross profit per ton has increased $0.43 or 12%. Cash gross profit per ton increased to $5.15, a 7% gain over a year ago. Our local management teams are doing a great job of leveraging demand growth into even higher levels of profitability.", "So how have we done this? It's important to remember that our improving profitability in aggregates isn't driven by average selling price increases alone. At Vulcan, we commonly think of 3 major profit drivers that must be managed in combination. These are depicted on the left-hand side of Slide 6. First, price for service. Are we receiving full and fair value for the quality of the products and services we provide, are we helping our customers be successful, and are we getting paid appropriately for that help? Second, operating efficiency and leverage. Are we managing costs tightly every day, and are we using our assets and capital as well as we can? Third, sales and production mix. Are we producing what we can sell and selling what we produce? Are we managing inventories responsibly, and are we converting each ton that we crush into cash in a reasonable amount of time? We manage these factors locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly.", "This quarter's results, again, demonstrate the high quality of work being done by our local teams and our -- and their support groups. Despite a modest 2%, or $0.23, gain in average selling price, our gross profit per ton increased 12%, or $0.43. As I will touch on in a minute, the rate of growth in average selling prices will increase over future quarters. We already see clear evidence of that momentum. But in the early phase of the recovery, when price lags volume gains, it has been very important for us to grow unit margins faster than price.", "Now this is not a new story for us. You can see on Slide 7 that we have, in fact, compounded unit profitability faster than pricing since quarterly volumes began growing in the second half of 2013. During the last 12 months, our average unit price has increased 2.7% or $0.29 per ton. Over that same period, our gross profit per ton has increased 20% or $0.52 per ton. While I'm pleased with our performance, let me be clear, we're not hitting on all cylinders yet. There's a lot more margin out there. I'll refer back to the 3 profit drivers noted on the prior slide. On price for service. The expanding margins that we have delivered so far don't reflect the high- to mid-single digit price gains normally associated with cyclical recoveries. These should take hold in 2015.", "On operating efficiencies and leverage. While our plant managers and their teams have done an excellent job controlling costs, the fact remains that we are operating a capital-intensive production business at 50% to 60% of its capacity. We are well positioned to further leverage fixed cost sales.", "On sales and production mix. We've worked hard to maintain our core production planning and inventory disciplines throughout the downturn. As recovery continues, and as we see a larger portion of new construction activity, we will sell the entire product mix at full value. As we move forward into the recovery, we'll continue to manage and balance all 3 of these factors at the local level, and all 3 are improving. We're entering this upturn in demand with unit margins close to those that we enjoyed during our last peak, a time when we were producing and selling approximately 150 million more tons than we are today. We are confident in our ability to convert incremental shipments and revenues into expanding profit margins and returns on capital.", "Because of our improving margins, we have been able to deliver very good earnings flow-through. Our expanding margins per ton have allowed us to deliver strong flow-through to gross profit of incremental freight-adjusted revenues in our aggregates business. Slide 8 shows our incremental margin performance thus far in the recovery. By incremental margins, I mean the change in segment gross profit in our aggregates business divided by the change in freight-adjusted revenues, with freight-adjusted revenues defined simply as average selling price multiplied by tons shipped. This metric reflects the total gross profit generated for each ton shipped without the margin distortions of our pass-through freight revenues.", "To improve transparency for investors, we've adjusted our financial statement presentation. This should make it easier for you to compare our change in segment gross profit to our change in freight-adjusted revenues for a given period. For the third quarter, the incremental gross profit margin was 65%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in the third quarter of this year. Aggregates gross profit grew $39 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $60 million. As reported, and including acquisitions, the incremental margin was 58%, or $38 million of incremental gross profit on $66 million of incremental freight-adjusted revenues.", "As we've mentioned previously, quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime costs. For that reason, we're also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. As you can see, for the trailing 12 months the incremental gross profit margin was also 65%, adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregate gross profit increased approximately $118 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $182 million. We have included a table in the appendix of our slide presentation which illustrates how we calculate incremental gross profit margins in our aggregates business. We believe this type of gross profit flow-through is an advantage to Vulcan and its shareholders as volumes continue to recover, particularly given our strategic focus on the aggregates business.", "Slide 9 highlights some of the positive indicators we see in the marketplace. These contribute to our firm confidence in stronger price growth. This is demonstrated by the pricing momentum in key markets, where the construction recovery is farther along, and where we are already seeing robust price increases occurring twice a year in some cases. Aggregates volume and price have a lead-lag relationship. Price growth typically follows volume growth but with some delay. We are now coming into a more normalized pace in the cycle. We are also seeing a return of confidence for sustained recovery and that, coupled with continuing volume growth now for 6 consecutive quarters, will positively affect pricing power.", "Finally, we're seeing upward and broad-based pricing trends across our entire geography. These firming prices across the sector include price increases in concrete and cement. Putting it all together, the pricing environment is rapidly improving across all of our markets. We have the makings for robust price growth on top of continuing volume growth and margin expansion.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to John for some comments before taking your questions.", "John R. McPherson", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll touch briefly on our nonaggregates businesses before turning to our full year outlook, and then a summary of our approach to capital allocation through the first 9 months of the year.", "Starting with Slide 10, we'll present the results from our asphalt and concrete segments. Earning results in each of these segments improved versus the prior year on higher sales. Asphalt gross profit improved $1 million due to higher margins and earnings from recently completed acquisitions. Asphalt volumes approximated the prior year but were short of expectations due to the delayed start of several large projects in California until 2015. Concrete gross profit was $5 million higher versus a loss of $4 million in the prior year's third quarter. Adjusting for the company's Florida concrete business sold in the first quarter of 2014, unit profitability improved and gross profit increased $3 million. Collectively, reported gross profit for our nonaggregates segments improved $12 million over the prior year quarter.", "Now turning to Slide 11 and our full year outlook. Our full year expectations for earnings growth and margin expansion remain basically in line with our plans, although we'll get there in a slightly different way. Aggregates volumes should come in a bit higher than our beginning-of-year expectations. And although our growth in average selling prices for aggregates has been modest, both our per ton margins and our incremental gross profit margins are in line with our internal goals. Our execution in this regard has been very strong, as Tom mentioned.", "As just highlighted, our gross profits from our nonaggregates segments had been at the low end of our beginning-of-year expectations, due in large part to delays of certain jobs into 2015. As a result, our overall external guidance for full year 2014 remains largely unchanged from August when we discussed our second quarter results. And as we often note, fourth quarter results can be significantly impacted by weather, particularly as we get late into the quarter.", "Now before I hit the highlights of our full year 2014 outlook in a bit more detail, I'd like to just reiterate and emphasize our view that the business has excellent momentum heading into 2015. The recovery toward more normal levels of demand for our products has a long way to go, but we should be entering our sixth consecutive quarter of meaningful year-over-year growth in shipments. Our unit margins are strong and improving but are yet to benefit from the accelerating gains in average selling prices that many expect over the coming quarters. And importantly, we have the organizational and financial strength required to invest smartly in growth at this point in the cycle.", "I'll now walk through Slide 11 for a brief summary of our updated full year outlook. For reasons of comparison, the format of this slide is the same as we've used in prior calls. I'll be brief, as we have, of course, touched on most of these items in our press release as well as earlier in this call.", "Since February, we have increased our outlook for aggregates volume to reflect stronger demand growth. That stronger demand, combined with strong sales execution, has resulted in our same-store aggregates volumes increasing 9% year-to-date. Assuming normal weather patterns, we expect volume growth in the fourth quarter of this year to increase mid- to high-single digits relative to last year's strong quarter when weather was unseasonably mild.", "For aggregates pricing, we expect full year pricing to be near the low end of our guidance range of 3% to 5%, with recent pricing actions having more impact on pricing in 2015 as opposed to the fourth quarter of 2014.", "For our nonaggregates businesses, we've narrowed our gross profit forecast from prior guidance of $40 million to $50 million to the current guidance of $40 million to $45 million, again, largely due to the delay of certain asphalt paving projects into 2015.", "SAG, excluding acquisition and divestiture-related costs, should remain in line with the prior year. We, of course, remain focused on leveraging SAG to revenues as volumes recover. Our interest expense forecast remains unchanged at $165 million to $170 million for the full year. This excludes onetime charges associated with our tender offer completed earlier. And finally, our capital spending outlook remains unchanged at $240 million. That to support improving demand as we look to 2015 and 2016.", "I'll conclude now with Slide 12 before handing the call back to Tom. On September 30, we announced that we had completed 6 acquisitions during the third quarter. You see these highlighted on the slide. Because cap allocation is an important area of focus for our management team at Vulcan, I'd like to take just a minute to place those transactions in the context of our overall approach to that topic so far this year.", "As noted in our release, Vulcan has generated approximately $890 million in cash year-to-date from operations and asset sales. Approximately $719 million of that cash is associated with the sale of our Florida area cement and concrete operations, the most volatile and capital-intensive components of our portfolio, to Argos. As a reminder, that transaction included a 20-year aggregates supply agreement. Given our aggregates-focused strategy, Argos was a better owner of those assets than we were, and we believe that transaction has been and will continue to be a positive strategic move for both parties.", "Now moving to the balance sheet for a moment. Year-to-date, we've paid down $516 million of debt. Our ratio of total debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA has improved approximately 3.6 versus a measure of 5.9 a year ago. Our overall credit outlook is solid and improving. These moves and the other actions we've taken to improve our core profitability put us in an excellent position to make the investments we made in the third quarter. We are well positioned both operationally and financially to grow our total profits and unit margins and, where the right opportunities present themselves, to grow our asset base.", "Now touching briefly on our third quarter acquisitions. In total, we invested approximately $320 million in attractive markets with which we are well familiar, as you see, again, highlighted on Slide 12. Approximately $275 million of the investment was cash, with the balance being in stock. Collectively, the acquired operations shipped approximately 8 million tons of aggregates in the most recent year, a figure we expect to grow in 2015 and beyond. And these transactions added 450 million tons of reserves to our portfolio. The integration of these operations has moved forward smoothly, a real credit to both our local teams and our shared support groups. The acquired operations will contribute incrementally to earnings in 2014, but should be accretive to EPS in 2015. As Tom has noted, our pipeline of potential bolt-on acquisitions remains very attractive. That said, we will remain disciplined in our approach to these investments, maintaining our focus on fundamentally attractive markets where we can establish a #1 or #2 position. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for a closing comment. Tom?", "James Thomas Hill", "Thanks, John. We are pleased with our third quarter performance, and we're looking forward to the months ahead. We are very excited about the opportunities we see. Our recent acquisitions are already performing well. We're excited about the volume growth, pricing momentum and strong margin expansion we see across our markets. Our operations continue to run with great efficiency and are best-in-class in the industry. I thank our employees for their outstanding performance in these exciting times. I am very proud of our people, and our future looks great. And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Tom or John, I was hoping you might be able to touch on 2015 in a little more detail. I know there wasn't kind of explicit guidance. The commentary was encouraging or is encouraging. One of your big competitors kind of laid out a framework. I was wondering if you might at least speak to kind of an agreement on that and that was one that kind of pointed towards infrastructure being up mid-singles in '15, private nonres being up in the high singles and residential being up in the double-digit range. And to the degree you're comfortable just giving us a broad framework, could you maybe start there?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes, Ted. Right now, we're in the middle of the planning process for 2015. But let me give you a little bit of how we view it. We are continuing to see, as we stated earlier, lots of pricing momentum, demand continues to grow, our employees continue to give us great margin expansion. We continue to focus on those 3 profit drivers, sales and production mix, price for service and operating leverage and efficiency, and all 3 of those continue to improve each month.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough.", "John R. McPherson", "Ted, this is John. The only thing I think we'd add is we do -- we're not ready to give any explicit guidance, obviously, for next year, but we do continue to see all LNG segments up for '15 directionally. And I think, importantly, as Tom said in his comments, we believe our market will continue to grow faster than the industry as a whole. We like our geographic mix. They were more depressed than the market as a whole, and they're recovering faster than the industry as a whole.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. If I can ask a second, just I know at the end of your prepared remarks, you touched on the balance sheet, John, and I guess, exiting '13, we had you at about 5x leverage. On our numbers, you'll exit this year at about 2.5x, and exiting next year, we'd have you at about 2x debt-to-EBITDA. So a huge improvement and a lot of strength. Can you just talk about how you might redeploy that capital? And how you think about whether it's acquisitions or CapEx or buybacks or all the options, and kind of where you are at this point?", "John R. McPherson", "Sure. First, I'll just say the obvious, which is how we think about capital allocation, how we think about return of cash to shareholders, how we think about our capital structure, all really important topics in a business such as ours. We're always evaluating a variety of different options. I think given the strength of our asset base, we actually have many options. I think what you can count on us for is to have a plan, not just to swing from one latest idea to another. More to the point on your question, I think we're very comfortable with the strength of our credit position and the financial position right now. I think we have several good options for the redeployment of capital through time. Certainly, reinvestment of CapEx into our business to support growth, but also to support the margin expansion to which Tom referred. I think we continue to see a pipeline of potentially attractive bolt-on acquisitions of a nature similar to those that you saw us complete in the third quarter. Always more difficult to kind of predict how those will turn out, though. And I think you'll see us, over time, have a balanced approach to reinvesting in growth and returning cash to shareholders. Now the exact form and timing of that return of cash is to be decided later, but I think you'll hear us talk about a plan for that approach.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's Matt Rybak on behalf of Jerry. To follow up on the capital deployment discussion, just wondering, are there any opportunities here going forward to set up on an MLP-type structure for a portion of your assets?", "John R. McPherson", "I think anybody could see that our aggregates business and some of our product lines will likely qualify for MLP treatment. But that said, I kind of come back to my answer to Ted's question, which is we're always evaluating a wide variety of options for improving our capital structure and our capital costs. We think that's of critical important -- critically important part of our jobs. Those options could range from the mundane such as the ratio of fixed to floating debt in our portfolio to options such as MLPs that may be a bit different. I think the good thing for us is that we have a lot of options. We're very disciplined in how we look at them. And I think it's the kind of topic you should expect us to talk more about at our Investor Day. Not MLP specifically necessarily, but our approach to the capital structure and capital allocation overall.", "Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then turning to volume briefly. Just wondering if you can maybe say more on the cadence of volumes over the course of the quarter. We've heard that some highway job start dates have been impacted by the highway bill timing. September and October growth sounds like it was much stronger than July and August. Just curious what you've seen on that front?", "James Thomas Hill", "We -- I think the only highway jobs that we had delayed were in Northern California for any significant volume. It hurt our asphalt volumes. Other than that, we've seen very -- we saw very good highway shipments in the third quarter. We continue to see very large highway jobs start to ship in 2014. Most of those will actually go in 2015. And with those, I'm referring to some of the TIFIA jobs like the Grand Parkway in Houston. We shipped a little bit of that this year, the majority of it will go next year. I-75, 575 in Atlanta, we have 1.2 million tons of backlog on that job. We will only ship -- we've not begun shipping. I think we'll start in December and probably ship 40,000 tons in '14, the balance in '15, '16. So -- then we've got the I-4 work in Florida, which is 1.7 million tons of concrete rock and probably 2 million tons of base and fill. That job has actually been awarded to the contractors, but the construction materials has not been awarded. So we'll, for sure, get part of that, but that will ship second half of '15 and '16. So we didn't see any slowdown in the third quarter, but we think it will pick up in '14 if weather holds, but for sure, in '15.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "First, on the acquired assets during the quarter, could you clarify the revenue opportunities for these? And what portion are plug-and-play versus others that may require a little bit more work?", "James Thomas Hill", "Kathryn, would you -- I'm sorry, it's Tom. Would you repeat your question?", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Yes, on the acquired assets during the quarter, could you clarify the revenue opportunity for these? And what portions are plug-and-play, so really don't require as much handholding, versus others that require little bit more work? So just the understanding that it's not an even margin with all of the acquired assets. It doesn't have to be a specific dollar amount but just even a rough percentage in terms of understanding how much will require some -- a little bit more work to get up to speed versus others that are really good as a standalone right now?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, I think, if you look at those assets, we had a partial quarter in the third quarter with the assets. They were already profitable in spite -- accounting for marking up inventories to market levels. We expect they are -- all of those are tucked into existing markets, except for New Mexico, and the New Mexico market is a very attractive market when it comes to profitability. So we think we'll hit the ground running with them in 2015, and they will be accretive in 2015.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay. This is more of a Texas policy question. Could you provide any color on the impact of Proposition 1 referendum? And what that impact could be for TxDOT, if passed? And when would the dollars become available, if you have knowledge of that, if that referendum does, in fact, pass?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes. It will be -- and actually, let's cross our fingers because it's being voted on today. It is $1.7 billion of new funds. It's from the oil and gas taxes paid by the drilling companies from the state's rainy day funds. Knowing how TxDOT works, I would say that they would be, if it passes, they will be available immediately, but probably, you won't see that flow through to -- at the earliest second half, probably second half of '15. Those will be a lot of overlays because this is really driven by the damage to the roads with all the truck traffic, with all the big energy plays and drilling in Texas. So I would -- and I don't know this for a fact, but my guess is that those funds would -- you would start seeing volumes from that sometime second half of '15.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Right. And speaking of energy, are you seeing any slowdown in energy markets given the drop in oil prices?", "James Thomas Hill", "We have not, and it's -- I think it's too early for that. But we continue to see that go very strongly, particularly the Gulf Coast projects. I think we'll ship about 500,000 or 600,000 tons on those jobs on the Gulf Coast in 2014. We'll see another -- I know we have another 2 million that we've backlogged to ship in '15, and there's probably, well on the books, on paper, there's another 10 million tons to be let. Now all of those -- probably all of those projects probably won't go, but even if half of them goes, it's a great shot in the arm for us.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "And just to clarify, those are more energy-related versus port expansion related to Panama Canal?", "James Thomas Hill", "That's exactly correct.", "John R. McPherson", "Kathryn, it's John. Just back on your acquisition question quickly, I think if you look at them collectively, the profitability of those businesses on a unit basis should match or exceed our company average once we get past the very early integration phase. And again, these are bolt-ons. There's not a tremendous amount of hard work to do to pull them into our business. Our folks are doing a very good job of that already.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay, great. And then final question on volumes. Just any more color on the type of projects you're seeing in Illinois and Texas? And what's the tail for these projects from a volume standpoint?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think that, on Texas, we've mentioned the Grand Parkway, which is, I think, a total of 1.2 million tons. Of that, we'll ship 400,000 or so. We will ship 400,000 at the end of 2014. The balance will go in '15. Again, we mentioned the energy projects in Texas. I think that this proposition, you'll see a lot of big asphalt work coming up. I believe that will pass. And then we're -- in Texas, you're just seeing all markets hit, residential, nonresidential, all of them are hitting. In Illinois, we have a number of projects. At O'Hare Airport and the widening of I-90 have been 2 very large projects for us. But again, we're starting to see the residential and the western suburbs of Illinois start to pick up also.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Tom, you mentioned that new lot development is continuing to increase, and I wanted to drill in a little bit on that. I mean, how much of a pickup have you guys seen in sort of the lot development as opposed to just aggregates to build houses as the recoveries kind of crank on?", "James Thomas Hill", "It really depends on where you are. In the more mature markets, California, Texas, Florida, parts of North Carolina and even Georgia, we're starting to see new subdivisions. And those are the places where we're starting to see the pickup. Kind of give you an idea where overall housing, we're seeing up low double digit, but if you look at specific markets and what demands happened in 2014 with aggregates, we've seen Los Angeles up 23%; San Antonio, up 23%; Dallas, up 18%; Nashville, which has been a little bit slower, up 12%; Atlanta is already up 15%; and then in Florida, Fort Myers is up 37%; Orlando is up 30%; Charlotte is already up 22%; and Baltimore is up 21%. So in those markets, where it's a little farther along, you're starting to see the subdivisions come in. Kind of the center of the country, we're still building out lots.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it, got it. And is it safe for me to assume that once you start getting those land development activities in place, they're a bit sort of longer tails and more steady than what might be sort of a bit more volatile kind of housing starts-driven stuff?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes, absolutely.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, good. All right. Jumping around, looking at Texas, your volumes were up significantly in Texas. You didn't mention that as an influence on the average price. What does your price in Texas look like relative to the average?", "James Thomas Hill", "Now Texas is -- the pricing has jumped already. It will -- we don't give specific pricing, but let me just give you an example on that. We -- and depending on the market in Texas, in October, we secured between $1 and $2 of price increase, and we'll see another price increase of April of between $1 and $2 depending on the market. So you can tell that where the markets, as we talked about, where the market recovery is more mature, we're seeing big price increases, and in some of those markets, we're seeing price increases every 6 months instead of every 12 months.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Is that across the whole state?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's great. And just to sort of circle...", "James Thomas Hill", "I mean, when I said across the whole state, each one of those markets is different, but all of them have sharp price increases, and they all have a lot of momentum.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Makes sense. Is it -- without trying to pin you down, was your average Texas price in the third quarter, was it above or below average?", "James Thomas Hill", "Oh, it's well above. I'm sorry, Todd you mean, company average?", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "James Thomas Hill", "Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant price increase percentages.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "No, I'm sorry, yes. Just absolute price versus the company average price.", "John R. McPherson", "I think, Todd, back to not pinning it down, I think it would have been offset elsewhere by other volume changes. So the geographic exception for pricing for us for the quarter was really Illinois-related. I think that's the best way to look at it.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then final one for me right now. Just looking at that Slide 5, where you sort of give state-by-state on the volume increases. Rural South Carolina is the one that jumps out as being the only one that's not green. What -- anything in particular happen there?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes, the guys in South Carolina are probably listening to this call hanging their heads, but it was only down 2%, and the impact was not so much demand. It was the fact that we had some very large project work last year that we don't have this year.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Wanted to ask, Tom, maybe if you could provide some color. You're doing $3.93 gross profit per ton, up 12% year-over-year. How should we think about that going forward? And I just wanted to get a deeper understanding. You were talking about price for service, and it sounds like you have some good pricing power, and expect to see that in 2015. Does that imply that your 60% incremental margin can actually move higher if you realize that price?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think, on average, we stick to the 60%. Obviously, price increases will help that. And, obviously, we're operating at 50% to 60% of our production -- our peak production. The operating leverage in the plants continues to get bigger. But I think over time, it'll shoot up and come back down, but over time, I think that 60% is probably in line with what our expectations are.", "John R. McPherson", "I think one takeaway, Bob, is we have a long ways to go in the margin expansion and the positive flow-through. That story is still, just like the volume story, it's still in its early innings.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. But you're doing kind of margins consistent with where you were at 150 million more tons. So it seems like you've taken out a cost -- a lot of costs out of the system, and I'm just trying to figure out how to think about profitability, assuming your volume strength continues into '15.", "John R. McPherson", "Well I think you're asking the right question. I'd encourage you to keep thinking about profitability on a per ton basis, and that's that way we present our financial statements. And that per ton profitability will, of course, be affected by pricing through time, which we're focused on every day, and we have some tailwind to there. It'll be affected by operating leverage and operating efficiency at our plant level. And it's, of course, also affected by a healthier product mix through time. I think all of those 3 things, we still have a long ways to go on. And our takeaway is that despite being, if you will, near previous high levels of unit profitability, we're nowhere near a cap or ceiling.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And then when you're talking about sales and production mix, is there -- what's the opportunity look like there from a mix standpoint if you get better demand across the product line?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, with new construction, you'll see an increase in sales for fines and base, which just allows us to sell the complete product split. And it just -- while those are low priced, they're very high margin, and they fill out our hand in selling the complete product line.", "John R. McPherson", "You saw a little bit of that in the current quarter. Our product mix hurt us on average selling price, but we still drove significant improving margin per ton, and that was one of the factors in this quarter.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, it's just tough to grasp externally a little bit just because of the moving pieces. John, just also wanted to understand on your guidance for 7% to 9%, what's -- on that 7% to 9%, what's the contribution from the recent acquisitions? So is that like 1 point or 0.5 point?", "John R. McPherson", "You're talking about the volume guidance, is that right, Bob?", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That's correct.", "John R. McPherson", "I would think of a high end of that range on a same-store basis, so excluding impact of acquisitions for the year.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So what percentage in the 7% to 9% should we attribute to acquisitions?", "John R. McPherson", "0.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "0, so it's negligible.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "A question on transport costs. And the news here, back in the quarter, any impact we should?", "John R. McPherson", "Keith, I can't quite hear you.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I'm sorry. The question's on transport costs. Just was there any transport cost impact in the quarter? And should we expect any in near-term quarters?", "James Thomas Hill", "We didn't see any impact from transportation costs, rail, barge or ship. In fact, they were -- rail was flat for the quarter, I think barge was relatively flat.", "John R. McPherson", "Keith, and the way we present our financials, for freight-adjusted pricing and the way we flow that through, you wouldn't expect to have a significant impact for us the way we report our financials.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But from a cash perspective, no impact in the period outside of your expectations?", "James Thomas Hill", "No impact. Year-over-year, no impact.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Secondly, looking at, of course, we have another temporary highway bill taking it through the spring. Any new views there you're hearing, your trade routes [indiscernible] along the things of that nature?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, we continue to see growing bipartisan commitment for infrastructure. Last month, Senator Boehner urged President Obama to work with Congress in 2015 for both tax reform and a multi-year transportation bill. Leadership in both parties want to find funding solutions, and I think all of them are tired of going back to the general fund and getting embarrassed about it. Last week, we did have House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tour our Chula Vista operation in San Diego. And he -- while he was there, he stressed congressional leadership's intention to get a highway bill passed in 2015. So we continue to see momentum behind it. I wouldn't expect it in the lame-duck session, but we've got our fingers crossed it will happen in '15.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Does a Republican Senate help you or hurt you towards that goal?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think, like I said, we're seeing bipartisan commitment, and I'm not sure if it helps or hurts us because they all want to fix the problem.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple questions left for me. One, you talk about the M&A environment, and you said some potentially attractive acquisitions. Can you talk about just kind of the valuations and how those are looking out in the market now versus what you've seen over the last few years? Are people starting to get a little bit more rational? Just any color you can give us on that, please.", "James Thomas Hill", "Sure. There's a lot of activity out there, and we see a lot of opportunities. Now with that activity, there's a lot of them that are very unattractive. There are some that -- there are a lot of them that we're looking at for our footprint that make a lot of sense for us. I think they're fair deals, and I think they're also acquisitions that we can improve dramatically by fitting them into our family. But it is busy, and there's some great stuff out there, there's also some junk.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's fair. And I guess, just kind of on the valuation front. I mean, you got some junk and some others that are attractive, I guess, those are being priced accordingly then.", "John R. McPherson", "I think, Trey, I think just a lot of this comes down to the reason -- a lot of the reason we're focused on bolt-ons is the synergies you bring to a transaction, which typically, we don't pay for in a deal. And I think if -- and we're not going to get into the valuations of the individual deals we've done. But if you looked at them all collectively, again, in the most recent year, producing 8 million tons roughly. That has a lot of growth behind it, at or above our per ton profitability as a company. You can kind of draw your own estimates for valuation collectively. Again, individual deals vary. But I think what really drives it from our point of view and we're very, very focused on is the -- is obviously, the synergies with the rest of our market positions. That's what makes it go from I've kind of got a good deal to a very good deal, and a lot of what will drive the accretion in the next year for us.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And Tom, you mentioned -- you touched briefly on some of these bigger energy programs down there, jobs that are being done over the next few years in the Gulf. What is the -- if you kind of look at that market, I know Texas overall is priced lower, but that market specifically, is that a higher priced market than Texas overall? And kind of how do we think of that from a profitability standpoint since that is one of your long-haul markets?", "James Thomas Hill", "It is a very profitable business for us. The pricing has very much improved over the last 18 months. But it's also, you got to remember, we are in the unique position to service those out of Mexico. So we have a dramatic freight advantage, which improves our profitability to service those markets.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "That makes sense. And then last one's kind of housekeeping here. With the pullback in oil and just trying to get a sense for any kind of benefits you guys may see going forward, how much diesel are you guys using in your quarries now kind of post some of the recent acquisitions and divestitures and how that's moved?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think one way to look at diesel may be to look at it on what happens to the per gallon cost of diesel because it's -- we've got diesel cost in quarries, we have it in asphalt, we have it in ready mix. But right now, a dime movement per gallon of diesel would mean about $4.5 million for us annually.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Quick question on the M&A environment. Do you expect to see more -- I guess, as more sort of the private smaller type transactions are out there, do you expect to see more downstream assets kind of like what you picked up in New Mexico as part of the deal on a go-forward basis?", "James Thomas Hill", "Every one of those is different, and our focus is aggregates. We don't have any interest in picking up downstream unless it has aggregates attached to it. And when you look at those, some of those markets that have the downstream business attached to them, those downstream business are very profitable. And if they are, and we can -- we run them with a good return, we'll keep them. If not, we'll keep the aggregates and sell the downstream product lines.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Perfect. And then I apologize if I missed it, but on Slide 6, you kind of highlighted the 3 profit drivers. Is there a way to kind of rank order them from most contribution out of those 3?", "John R. McPherson", "I'd try -- I'd say no. I think the point is that you have to balance these and manage them in combination. And I think just the very heart of the business is you can't rank order them, you've got to make trade-offs at a local level between these factors.", "James Thomas Hill", "I would agree with that. I would also tell you that as the volumes come back and demand comes back, and new construction, the balance between those 3 gets a whole lot better, and as so our unit margins improve.", "Operator", "And we have reached our allotted time for questions. So I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Hill for closing remarks.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call. Have a good day.", "Operator", "And thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Megan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vulcan Materials 2014 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Tom Hill, President and CEO of Vulcan Materials Company, you may begin your conference.", "James Thomas Hill", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter 2014 results. I'm Tom Hill, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan. Joining me today is John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. A slide presentation will accompany this webcast. It will be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call.", "Before we begin the actual results and projections, I refer you to Slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.", "In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.", "Before we get into details today, I'd like to speak to you about some things that are immensely important to me and our management team. We executed well in 2014, particularly in the fourth quarter, and I am proud of our people and the job they did, but we are focused on the future. When I think about the job our people will need to do in 2015, 3 words come to mind: momentum, execution and discipline.", "Momentum. We are seeing accelerating momentum in demand throughout our markets. Demand in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations despite our California business being waterlogged, and recall that we are comparing against a strong fourth quarter in 2013. There is accelerating pricing momentum in many of our markets, and we are going to reap the benefits of that momentum. The momentum that we've seen thus far will carry forward through 2015 and likely well beyond, and we are going to take every advantage of it.", "Execution. Our teams throughout the company are executing very well. We are pleased with the results detailed in today's press release, and these outcomes directly reflect the great efforts of our people at all levels of the business. In particular, I'm proud of how our local businesses have continued to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit. We are servicing our customers well and helping them grow while operating our business safely and efficiently. Despite only modest gains in pricing so far, our people are making the most of this initial phase of recovery. They have set the stage for even stronger performance ahead. My personal focus in 2015 and the focus of our management teams will be on pricing improvements, margin expansion, smart uses of capital and safety.", "Discipline. We are very well aware that now is the time for continued discipline, not congratulations or complacency. Our people will continue to show great discipline in the delivery of quality products and services to our customers safely and efficiently, and we will emphasize continued discipline in how we deploy capital and in how we pursue price and margin improvement. We will be highly focused in 2015 on accelerating gains in pricing for our core aggregates business so that we earn a fair and full return on the significant investments that we have made in our business. We have made progress, but we are not where we need to be. It is also paramount that we continue our disciplined performance in operational excellence and cost control. We will remain extremely disciplined in our use of capital, deploying it to further build on our strategic base of world-class assets while improving our balance sheet and our return on shareholders' capital.", "The momentum, execution and discipline that were hallmarks of 2014 will be our watch words as we build an ever stronger business in 2015.", "Now let's move on to the rest of the call. You'll see that many of these slides line up with those used in our third quarter call, in large part because our focus on driving improved margins and fully capitalizing on the recovery in demand has not changed.", "The results on Slide 4 demonstrate the quality of our fourth quarter execution and how we continue the strong conversion of incremental revenues into growth in earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, a 32% increase. We achieved these results despite a temporary rise in SAG costs as a result of business development and performance-based incentives. Our underlying profitability continued to improve significantly, whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.29, including $0.02 for business development expenses and restructuring cost.", "On Slide 5, you can see that our fourth quarter results continue the trend in recent quarters. Looking at full year results, we have seen a 38% gain in gross profit on an 8% gain in revenues. That significant increase is due to margin discipline, particularly in our core aggregates business, and the positive impact on the divestiture of our lower-margin concrete and cement businesses in Florida. SAG was up due to the items just mentioned. You will see later that we forecast a decline in SAG going forward. Adjusted EBIT nearly doubled for the year and adjusted EBITDA was up handsomely. For the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.91. Including the Florida divestiture and debt tender offer, earnings per share were $1.56. Now turning to our core aggregates segment.", "Slide 6 tells the story of volume growth across Vulcan's footprint in 2014. This growing momentum is driven by strengthening private construction activity across all end-use markets and an increasing number of large projects, along with increasing highway demand. These trends gained further momentum in the fourth quarter, with shipments growing 15% in total and 12% on a same-store basis, even with the impact of bad weather in California and Georgia.", "For the full year, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Texas and Virginia saw shipments increase by more than 10% on a same-store basis. Aggregate shipments in California and North Carolina also realized solid growth. Shipments in Alabama and South Carolina were down slightly with slower recovery in construction activity in these states.", "Now let's talk about how we are converting this momentum and these early gains in demand into expanding margins and profits. Last quarter, we discussed the 3 major profit drivers that we can focus on.", "As you can see on the right-hand side of Slide 7, our industry-leading gross profit per ton increased $0.66 in spite of a modest overall price improvement of $0.21 per ton. Cash gross profit per ton increased to $5.18, an 11% gain over a year ago. Our local management teams are doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into even higher levels of profitability by managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, sales and products.", "This is not a new story for us. As you can see on Slide 8, we have compounded unit profitability faster than pricing for the last 6 quarters. During the last 12 months, our freight-adjusted average unit price has increased 2% or $0.25 per ton. Over that same period, our gross profit per ton has increased 18% or $0.52 per ton. Excluding our 2014 acquisitions, trailing 12-month gross profit per ton was up $0.56 or 20%. This is a higher figure than when these operations were producing twice the volume. We are completely focused on ensuring that our unit margins continue to grow.", "In speaking to you last quarter about our incremental margin leverage, we discussed our best-in-class incremental flow-through that we enjoy with volume growth. Slide 9 depicts incremental margin performance in our aggregates segment. As you can see, incremental gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 79%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the year.", "Aggregates gross profit grew $45 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $57 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65%, reduced due to acquisition accounting. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime costs, we are also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. We'd encourage you to focus on these numbers.", "For the trailing 12 months ending this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was 66% adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $132 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $201 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our gross profit flow-through is an advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover.", "Slide 10 highlights our asphalt and concrete results for the fourth quarter and full year. Earnings results in each of these segments improved versus the prior year on higher sales. Asphalt gross profit for the full year improved $5 million due to higher margins and earnings from existing operations and from the acquisitions in Arizona and New Mexico. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 4% from the prior year and unit profitability increased 6%, driving a same-store gross profit improvement of $3 million.", "Full year concrete gross profits were $2 million versus a loss of $25 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested concrete business, unit profitability improved and gross profit increased $6 million.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John for some comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John?", "John R. McPherson", "Thanks, Tom. In our last earnings release and call, we placed emphasis on capital allocation, particularly with a view toward putting the recent acquisitions we made in the context of our overall approach and plans. The topic of capital allocation remains, obviously, a critical area of focus for our management team. And with that in mind, I'd like to now use Slide 11 to recap our actions during 2014, update you on the transaction we closed last week and highlight the goals and options we have in front of us.", "As you know, in early 2014, we successfully divested of our Florida area cement and ready-mix concrete operations to Argos. Given our aggregates-focused strategy, Argos was a better owner of those assets than we were. As a reminder, our divested cement and concrete operations were among the most volatile and capital-intensive businesses in our portfolio. We remain very pleased with that transaction, and it has positioned us very well for Florida's continued recovery in construction activity.", "Also during 2014, we further strengthened both our balance sheet and our core profitability. Our ratio of total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA has improved to approximately 3.3 versus 5.4 a year ago, and it should decline further with continued EBITDA growth in 2015.", "As Tom has noted, our core profitability, as measured by the cash gross profit we generate for each ton of aggregate shipped, improved another 9%, compounding prior year gains, and we expect it to improve further moving forward. As I'll touch on in a minute, we expect same-store shipments to grow approximately 8% in 2015, as the recovery in construction activity progresses. We are very comfortable, very comfortable with our credit position and how it is improving toward our stated investment-grade target.", "We spent $225 million on CapEx, excluding M&A, during 2014. This capital deployment not only maintains our physical plant, but also improves our efficiencies and ability to meet our customers' needs. We've now returned to more normal levels of what we call maintenance and enhancement CapEx, and we expect this use of capital to grow more in line with shipments moving forward.", "In 2014, we deployed $332 million of capital for targeted acquisitions that strengthen our asset base now and for years to come. We've made good progress with the integration of the 7 acquisitions we made during the year, and we expect these operations in total to contribute approximately $50 million to our EBITDA in 2015. And as we indicated we would, we began the process of growing our dividend as we grow earnings.", "Each of these actions contributed to the current and long-term value of our company. Equally importantly, they collectively improved our flexibility and optionality moving forward. As we look to 2015 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to sustain our capital reinvestment in our current asset base, to recover and maintain an investment-grade credit position, to accelerate the return of capital to our shareholders and to prudently pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions.", "To be clear, we will also consider additional asset divestitures and swaps. We believe it is important for us and for others in our industry to challenge ourselves regarding whether we are the best owner of our individual assets and operations. This logic supported our 2014 transaction with Argos, and it underpins the much smaller transaction we closed in late January.", "As noted in our earnings release, we recently concluded an asset swap with CEMEX, under which we've exchanged our Southern California ready-mix concrete operations for 13 asphalt plants, primarily in Arizona. Under the agreement, we will continue to supply aggregates to the exchanged concrete operations. Given its operations and strategic focus in these markets, each party should be able to earn a higher return on the exchanged assets than the prior owner. This exchange will be immediately accretive to Vulcan, and its expected impact is incorporated into our 2015 projections.", "Now let me turn to our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. I'll begin on Slide 12 with an overview of our outlook for demand for aggregates in the markets we serve. The headline here is that we see another year of high single-digit demand growth as recovery toward normal levels of construction activity continues. The pattern of the recovery is increasingly broad-based as we see growth in each of our primary end-use segments and in the clear majority of our geographies. And from what we can see, demand in Vulcan-served markets should continue to grow faster than the U.S. as a whole.", "We certainly cannot predict the future, but we currently anticipate a gradual recovery lasting several more years before we return to aggregates consumption levels consistent with long-term trends. As you can see on the slide, we see aggregates demand from private end uses up 14% to 18% during 2015. The growth in our fourth quarter sales to these end-users reflects the strong underlying momentum. Private growth continues to be driven by the recovery in employment and the continued recovery in single and multifamily housing.", "We see demand from public end uses in our markets up 3% to 5% during 2015. Construction award momentum remains positive and stable in Vulcan markets. The south and west continue to see more growth than other areas of the U.S. And as state and local tax revenues approach all-time highs, they should provide the support for new public infrastructure funding.", "Our 2015 outlook for these end-use markets, although tailored to our specific mix of geographies, does not vary significantly from the consensus of external industry observers. And finally I'll note that we have not significantly altered our 2015 demand forecast to account for recent declines in oil prices, the status of federal highway bill negotiations or shifting predictions regarding interest rates and credit availability. Certainly, these factors introduce a degree of uncertainty. But at this point, we see a continuation of the momentum witnessed over the past 6 quarters. As always, we'll monitor actual local demand patterns throughout the year and respond accordingly.", "I'll turn now to Slide 13 for a summary of our full year outlook. I'll be brief as we've touched on many of these items in our press release, as well as earlier in this call. We are, for 2015, giving a range for adjusted EBITDA, excluding any gains associated with the sale of property, of between $775 million and $825 million. I'll touch now on certain of the assumptions underpinning that EBITDA projection.", "We currently project 2015 aggregate shipments of approximately 180 million tons, consistent with the demand outlook I just highlighted as well as with the continued strong sales and customer service execution at the local level. On a same-store basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions made in 2014, we project shipments to be up 8% over the prior year. We currently expect average aggregate selling prices on a freight-adjusted basis to be up 6% over the prior year. As a reminder, our pricing decisions are made locally and outcomes will vary significantly by geography and at different points in the year.", "But as Tom noted earlier in this call, as well as in our prior call, we've seen the pricing environment continue to improve with the recovery in demand, and we remain intensively focused on earning a full and fair return on the investments we've made to serve our customers. We expect total gross profit for the aggregate segment to be approximately $735 million. Margins per ton should expand further as we work not only to achieve higher pricing, but also to leverage fixed cost and maintain strong production efficiencies and cost controls.", "Over the course of the full year, the flow-through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue to segment gross profit should remain consistent with recent trend, although as we've said, results will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.", "For our non-aggregate business segments, we expect gross profit of approximately $70 million in total. This projection reflects the impact of the asset swap I mentioned previously and includes approximately $50 million in gross profit from our asphalt operations, approximately $17 million in gross profit from our concrete operations and approximately $3 million in gross profit from our calcium business.", "Please note that the actual material margins and gross profit margins from these downstream businesses can vary substantially at the local market level and throughout the year.", "SAG expenses, excluding acquisition and divestiture-related costs and other items, should be approximately $265 million in 2015. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG to revenues as volumes recover.", "We expect DD&A for 2015 to be approximately $270 million as compared to $279 million in 2014. And we currently plan to spend $250 million for maintenance and enhancement capital in 2015, excluding our capital spending for acquisitions or a significant expansion of our distribution and logistics capabilities.", "Now a couple of final notes before handing the call back to Tom. First, I should remind everyone that the projections I just noted are certainly subject to revision throughout the year. While we believe our visibility to demand has been improving as we get further into the early stages of recovery, there certainly remains some uncertainty in the macro environment, whether due to oil prices, federal and state transportation funding decisions or other factors. That said, our focus remains on making the most of whatever recovery scenario we are presented with.", "Second, I'll note that our profit projections do not necessarily account for the full production cost benefits we may realize if diesel prices were to remain at current levels throughout the year. Our production budgets are built bottom-up, plant by plant, and our operators remain focused, as of course they should be, on the efficiencies within their control. We'll do our best to note the impact of shifting energy cost on our business as the year unfolds.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for a closing comment.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thanks, John. We were pleased with our fourth quarter performance, but our eyes are on what's in front of us. Last year, we put down a solid foundation. Now we will build on it. We're going to be highly focused on superior execution of the business, price improvement, lowering cost, margin growth and capital discipline. The momentum that we found so encouraging in 2014 and that was so apparent in our fourth quarter results will only continue to grow. Along with accelerating demand growth, we're going to see accelerating momentum in our ability to secure price improvements and in our ability to continue executing on our first-class operational discipline, controlling and lowering cost. We fully recognize the importance of executing on price and operational discipline to give our shareholders a superior return on capital. And as I said earlier, we will continue to be extremely disciplined in our allocation of capital.", "Regardless of what the markets may do, we will stay focused on the things that we control, executing on price improvement and margin expansion. We'll also remain focused on servicing our customers so they continue to reap value from their relationships with us. Working together, we will win. I'm excited about our company and its future, and I look forward to continuing to report to you as we keep growing and succeeding in the years ahead.", "Now if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I understood your commentary of not predicting the change in diesel, but obviously, it's in the news. I had 2 questions around that. If you could give us a rough idea in '14 how much diesel fuel you used? And then question two, if prices do stay down throughout this year, will that affect the price of aggregates in the market as the year progresses?", "James Thomas Hill", "I'm sorry, would you repeat your first question?", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, the first question, if could you could give us a rough number of how much diesel fuel you used in '14, gallons or something along those lines?", "James Thomas Hill", "Total gallons we used in '14 was just over 44 million gallons.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And if we see the prices down the way they are now for the rest of the year, will that have a negative effect on aggregate pricing just around the shipping cost?", "James Thomas Hill", "No, it won't have any effect on pricing. We've got a lot of pricing momentum. We do not price on cost. It's market-driven in the value of our products and the services to our customers. So the price of oil won't have an impact on the price of aggregates.", "John R. McPherson", "And Keith, it's John. Also, keep in mind, we report freight-adjusted pricing, so the impact of diesel on shipping cost won't show up in our freight-adjusted pricing.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I guess what I'm getting towards is this could be clearly a big benefit for you this year, again, if it stays down. Would all that benefit accrue to the bottom line or would there be some give back, whether it's around driver cost or anything like that?", "James Thomas Hill", "I don't see any place we'd give back cost savings on fuel. I think when it comes to fuel, what we concentrate on are things we can control, which is using our procurement and management systems to buy fuel at the most competitive prices we can. And then we monitor fuel usage at every location, over 300 locations. We manage the tons per gallon of fuel we use so that we make sure that our equipment -- we're operating our equipment as fuel efficiently as we possibly can.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Final question on Slide 6, you have Texas as one of your really good markets here in 2014. We all know the questions around that. Can you give us any sort of scale for what Texas represents for the company?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes, first of all, we sell very little directly to the oil patch in Texas, so the immediate impacts, we're not going to see any. There is a lot of momentum in Texas, residential, nonresidential. Texas just passed Prop 1, which is an additional $1.8 billion to their highway funding, which is also right in our wheelhouse because a lot of that is focused on rural markets where we operate. We just think there's a lot of momentum there. At this point, we don't see anything happening for 2 or 3 quarters after that. I'm not sure we want to predict it, but there's a lot of folks out there predicting that.", "John R. McPherson", "Quickly back to your first question on diesel and impact on aggregates pricing. Just a reminder that diesel is a relatively small portion of our total production cost, what, 7%-ish?", "James Thomas Hill", "7%.", "John R. McPherson", "Right. So our biggest cost in our product is the stone, the assets, the quarries we own, and we price to earn a return on that. So minor fluctuations up and down in 7% of our cost isn't going to affect our pricing strategy.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "I appreciate your color on the 11% volume growth in -- for 2015. How much of the -- rough estimate, how much of the 180 million tons projected for next year are contributed from acquisitions?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think that's -- hold on, I'll get that number for you. I believe that's about 7 -- between 7 million and 8 million tons.", "John R. McPherson", "Kathryn, I'd say, without acquisitions, we'd be sort of in the 173-ish range, roughly. And where we've done bolt-on acquisitions, there's a little bit of art to what volume comes from the acquired asset versus what comes from other quarries in the same market. But roughly speaking, I'd point you back to that 8% same-store growth rate.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay, great. What is your -- you talk about return on invested capital in the earnings release. What is your bogey for return on capital? And what other mechanisms, above and beyond dividends, are on the table to return value to shareholders?", "John R. McPherson", "To your first question, I don't know that we're going to give you a specific bogey. I'd underscore that our focus both now and long term is to earn a fair and full return on the full asset base, and particularly because we've made those billions of dollars of investment on behalf of our customers to serve them well. And so while we're pleased with our current results and pleased with the margin expansion and pleased with the outlook for '15, there's further to go on that, much further to go. And your second question was actions to accelerate -- what was it, Kathryn?", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Well, what other mechanisms, above and beyond dividends, are on the table at least to return value to shareholders?", "John R. McPherson", "I'm not going to specify. I don't think we're going to specify any of that. That's really a board decision. But I think we'd be open to -- and have in the past as a company, deployed several mechanisms. So we'll have to think about that, keeping the cycle in mind. But I think we're committed to accelerating that return of capital over time.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Back to the fundamentals, some of the volumes that were impacted by weather or other project delays, how do they stand now and how should we think about modeling them into 2015?", "James Thomas Hill", "They're in our -- those volumes are in our 2015 numbers. We knew that the projects in California were going to be postponed in the third quarter, and they're included in our '15 outlook.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay, finally. And my final question, I know that you don't have a significant amount of volumes that go specifically into the oil industry or the energy industry, but have you taken a stab at quantifying your best estimate of what percentage of your volumes specifically go to the energy industry?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, as I said earlier, very little goes directly into the oil patch. We'll ship over 2 million tons to large coastal energy projects in 2015. Those jobs are underway or getting underway. They won't be postponed. There's a few jobs that have not -- there's a few projects on the coast that we're hearing rumors of delay, but they would not hit until '16 or '17 anyway.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Quick question on the mix impact on price. And my call dropped off for a second, so forgive me if you guys did touch on this. But is that largely behind you guys or is there any anticipation that, that could creep into 1Q or any other period for that matter?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, I think the mix issue was we sold big projects in -- up and down the Mississippi River and in Illinois. While those were at lower prices, they were very good volumes. I think the fourth quarter headline pricing belies the pricing momentum that we're seeing across our footprint. If you kind of step back and look at pricing in the fourth quarter on a market-by-market basis, and we look at the markets where we're seeing higher growth or the recovery is a little more mature, and I'll read these off to you. We're seeing price increases in the fourth quarter 7.8%, 6.5%, increase of 5.8%, 5.7%, 4.8%, 4.6%. Now offsetting that in some of the markets where recovery is not as far along or where we sold some big basin finds job, we've seen price increases in the fourth quarter of 2%, flat, flat, minus 1% or minus 1.4%. And that's not all bad because if you look at the margin expansion across that same footprint, we're seeing nice margin expansion in almost all of our markets. So as far as pricing going into 2015, there's a lot of -- we're confident that the conditions and the momentum is there for good price increases. I'm focused on it. I think our team is focused on it. And we're secure about our pricing outlook for '15.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great. That's helpful, Tom. And then my second question is a lot of talk, obviously, around infrastructure funding. The President's budget proposal called for an increase there again. I think the current bill expires in May, if I'm not mistaken. What are you guys looking for? I know you guys are pretty in tune with what's going on in Washington, what's being kicked around. What are you guys looking for if you were to take a best guess on how things shake out in May? And then as we kind of look into '15, any hopes for some type of a longer-term bill?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes, we're seeing a lot of positive momentum for a new highway bill. Leadership of both parties stated their intention to pass a well-funded bill. The timing, that's not clear. It may be difficult to get a bill by May, but -- and we may need an extension, but Congress has shown over and over again that they're going to fund the highway program, and so extension may have to happen and -- I mean, it will. The lack of a highway bill is not going to hurt us. The highway bill is not in our outlook. It could only help us. And we think there's a reasonably good chance of getting a bill in 2015.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "So then with your assumptions in guidance, I think you said public is going to be up 3% to 5%. What is the -- it sounds like you're going under the assumption there won't be a new highway bill in that, but what's driving the up 3% to 5% in a flat kind of funding environment that's in the guidance.", "James Thomas Hill", "That's a good question. If you look at our -- we've got a number of very large jobs that we'll be supplying in '15, the Grand Parkway in Houston, 575 -- I-75/575 in Atlanta. So there are a number of very large jobs across our footprint that we started in '14 and will really kick in, in '15. But there's some other pieces of that. We've got 6 TIFIA jobs that will ship in 2015, be north of 2 million tons in '15 for those jobs. So you're starting to see the TIFIA program really mature from people talking about jobs or planning jobs to actually shipping materials on them. And then we've seen a number of state highways increase their funding. In Florida, Governor Scott announced a $10 billion highway funding bill for this coming year. Texas, as I mentioned earlier, passed Prop 1, which is an additional $1.8 billion. We've gotten more funding in Virginia. Georgia got a proposal for an increase of $1 billion. So the state funding is up on top of all of that.", "John R. McPherson", "So Trey, one thing I'd -- just to point out on all of that is, our funding environment in our states, in our markets is not flat. When you look at the TIFIA projects, when you look at the rises in state and local funding, when you look at the rises in deployment of that funding to projects, our markets have funding increases consistent with our 3% to 5% outlook for our markets.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "First off, great quarter. That was very impressive both in terms of the revenue performance and profitability. Slide 8 caught my eye, you have a big improvement in rolling gross profit per ton on a 12-month basis. And I was hoping one of you gentlemen could kind of see the -- you posted $3.35 a ton, where can that go to in 2015 given the demand profile and the initiatives?", "John R. McPherson", "Well, I think we expect to see, I'd say, 2 things. We'd expect to see our incremental margin on incremental revenue, freight-adjusted revenue in our aggregate segment to remain consistent with past trend for the next year. And along with that, I think you'd see similar increases in unit profitability. I come back to the point about earning a return on capital over time. We have quite a long ways to go in terms of margin performance to tie it back to the kind of returns on capital we'd like to see. So not only do we have room in '15, I think we have room for a very long time. You can go -- on a gross profit basis next year, I think if you work through the math, I think north of $4 on a trailing 12-month basis is sort of within our sights. And that's on a gross profit basis. On a cash basis, you could see north of $5.25. Keep in mind that our current levels of profitability, as Tom mentioned, on a unit basis are higher than they've been at the past while we're still operating at a little more than half the volumes we produced in the past. And with the kind of pricing we see in front of us, with the leverage of fixed cost we see in front of us, we're very focused on improving those numbers.", "Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's actually what I was looking for. I just wanted to ask Tom, it seems like you have some good visibility on some heavy-tonnage jobs coming up, and I was hoping -- you already addressed kind of what you're seeing on the public side. What are your expectations for private nonresidential and private residential? And if I could just dovetail that, how confident are you in kind of the 8% same-store volume growth and the 11%? Is it more confident now than you were 12 months ago?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think we're very confident in our outlook. When we do these bottom-up, our guys and gals come in each quarter in each market to build that volume up. As far as -- we had a very good 2014 in non-res. Some of that driven by traditional non-res, construction of office buildings, big-box, strip malls. On top of that, we saw the bulk from the large projects along the Gulf Coast. We'll continue to see that. There's a lot of confidence out there in the marketplace, both our salespeople and our customers for non-res. And as I said earlier, we -- our shipments to the large energy projects along the coast will be higher in '15 as those projects mature than they were in '14.", "John R. McPherson", "Hey, Bob, as another reminder, Tom always points this out. But despite the good growth numbers over the last 6 quarters, we're nowhere near normal levels of demand or construction activity in the vast majority of our markets, nowhere near. So we both have a little bit better visibility. We've got good momentum, as you've seen in the last 6 quarters and the fourth quarter. But part of our confidence, as a reminder to folks, is we're still getting volume growth just out of recovery from a deep trough in demand. It's not predicated upon dramatic overall economic growth in the U.S. It's recovery of construction activity to things that begin to look like sustainable levels.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how we should think about costs in the aggregate division. Kind of appreciate that diesel is a relatively small portion of the cost, but we also are aware that the sensitivity of a 10% move in diesel is pretty significant. So as we think of potentially lower diesel, think about incremental margin, at least within your guidance, that's consistent with prior trends, are there any cost offsets to the potential diesel benefit, whether it's in blasting or explosives or contracting services or any other items that we should be aware of?", "James Thomas Hill", "When we do -- first of all, when we do these plans, they're from a bottom-up perspective with over 300 locations across the country, so everybody's fuel is using a different fuel cost. Embedded in that is also off-road and on-road diesel, and that mix changes. So trying to get a solid comparison for a diesel price is really tough. Now there may be some savings embedded in it, but as I said earlier, our focus will be on the things that we can control, which is how we buy it, and buying it as economically as we can, and then how we use it, with measuring tons per gallon. So there may be some embedded there, but that's really hard to define and take apart across our footprint. As far as other costs or concern, there's always different commodities we use always. They do have price increases in a number of those. I think we also have the operating leverage, but I think we'll turn in -- continue to turn in improved pricing numbers as the year progresses. And I think our folks are really doing a good job at focusing on the key drivers of cost. Now you also got to remember, we're still operating at 60-some -- a little north of 60% of our peak volumes, so we've got a lot of room to be able to optimize our operations and our cost as volumes continue to grow.", "John R. McPherson", "Hey, Garik, it's John. We don't -- there's only really one area in cost where I think we see a major trend that we're wrestling with, the guys wrestling with that jumps out. It's not a direct offset to diesel per se, but repair cost remain an ongoing challenge for us, not a major thing. That's something we're working on that ties to our CapEx focus over time, but we don't see major increases, I'm calling it inflationary increases at the moment. And keep in mind, we own our major input so...", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "My second question is on asphalt. Your guidance implies, I think it's about a 30% increase in profitability. Your volume guidance when we look at infrastructure demand for the year, low- to mid-single digits. That's strong leverage. I was just wondering, maybe if you can provide a little bit more color on the drivers behind the asphalt profitability. Is it more margin expansion of lower liquid asphalt cost or is it in the markets that you're servicing on the asphalt side, you're seeing accelerated volume growth or I guess conversely, is it the acquisition or the asset swaps that you engaged in that's going to be driving most of the profit improvement?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think that -- we do have some improvement in our existing operations. There's a little volume there and some margin expansion, but the big jump there is with our acquisitions and the swap and the asphalt operations that we acquired. I think if you look at it, the asphalt business, we're going to show a gross profit improvement of about $15 million, about $12.5 million of that is acquisitions, about $2.5 million of that is improved volume and unit margins on our existing businesses.", "Operator", "And your next question comes the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was hoping to kind of focus on capital allocation and just kind of get a sense for how you'd encourage us to think about the dry powder you've got. I mean, to your point, John, you exited last year at about 5.5x leverage. This year, you'll be exiting at about 3. On our numbers, at the end of '15, you're kind of sub 2. And so I just want to kind of revisit how we should think about your targeted capital structure across the cycle, is kind of the first question.", "John R. McPherson", "Let me start with where we are and then a couple of comments on the cycle. We'll probably touch on this topic more later. First, we're very comfortable with our current leverage ratio -- current amount of leverage. I think what we'd highlight is, we've taken a number of actions over the years to get ourselves in a position where we can, a little bit, do all of the above. So we can reinvest in our business as we need to, in our plant and equipment, in our asset base. We can achieve and maintain an investment-grade credit rating, which matters to us, so we have access to capital at all points of the cycle, to your question on the cycle; so that we can accelerate the return of capital to shareholders, whether that's through dividend or other mechanisms over time. So I expect you to see us have more of our cash flow each year go back to shareholders as part of the mix. And so we can still pursue prudent acquisitions and have a strong return, like you've seen us do in the last year. I think we've got ourselves in a spot, to your point on dry powder, that so long as we're prudent and cognizant of the cycle, we can do all of those things. In terms of how we think about it through the cycle, let me just say now, we're still closer to the trough of the cycle than anything that's normal. We think we've got several years of growth and margin expansion in front of us. And as we -- if we deliver a year, like you said Ted, per your model or your expectations, we're going to have a lot of options. And I think the good news is that we're going to have a lot of options. And we've worked hard to be in that position, but I think we'll have more options than, if you will, we'll have trade-offs. I think we'll be able to do, again, the right mix of all of the above.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe as a follow on to that, could you just talk about what the M&A pipeline looks like right now?", "James Thomas Hill", "It's still healthy. There's still a lot out there, Ted, but I think the important piece of that is discipline. We have to be disciplined about what we're going to buy. We're disciplined about what we pay for it. And then as important as anything, disciplined about how we integrate it. And as quickly as we can, bring it up to the Vulcan standards of profitability and unit margins. So while there's a lot out there, we'll just have to make sure we're disciplined. I think we're pleased with our '14 acquisitions. And I think so far, we're very pleased with the integration and looking forward to their adding to our profitability in 2015.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners.", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Most of my questions have been asked, but looking into 2015, are there any regions which you're capacity constrained and utilization is higher than that average 50% to 60% you saw in 2014?", "James Thomas Hill", "I wish we had that problem, no. As I said earlier, we're still operating 60% than where we were at the peak. We've got a long ways to go before anywhere we consider capacity constraints.", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay. That helps. And then just a clarification. You paid down a lot of debt in 2014. What's your interest rate likely to be as you go -- or interest expense likely to be as you go into 2015?", "John R. McPherson", "I'd say roughly $160 million, but I think you should expect us to continue as a company to take a hard look at our debt portfolio and its coupon cost and its duration and those kind of things, back to Ted's questions about some of the options we have in front of us. But if you're modeling, I think about $160 million roughly of interest expense, I think, and -- which is roughly consistent with last year. Part of our debt paydown last year was a use of proceeds from the divestiture of Argos. We're now in a position where, as I said, we're very comfortable with our current level of debt and our credit standing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Merrill Lynch.", "Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just want to clarify one of the things that you said earlier. And I've asked you this in the past, and I just kind of want to get your take on it. When you talk about your visibility improving as the demand grows, what does that mean exactly and how far out is your visibility?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, I think we're looking at 2000 -- what we're really talking about is 2015. And the reason the visibility gets better is, you're starting to see -- your backlogs are solid, you have confidence of jobs in your -- of -- coming up and your contractors and your sales force. You feel the momentum, for -- like example, in residential, you're not building out subdivisions anymore. They're starting new subdivisions, which are much more aggregate-intensive. So you just get a feel for the confidence and you start to see the jobs that you have secured much larger and more numerous.", "Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then along those lines, if we were to get some sort of action from the government regarding a way to finance and finally pass a multiyear highway spending program, is it fair to say that the real benefit would start to flow through more into 2016, 2017? How do you think about what that would look like?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think based on the timing, that's spot on. That where the bill has to flow through, you have to get jobs ready, so I think you'd be looking at '16, '17.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Quick question, just from a timing perspective with some of the weather issues last year, should we expect the cadence of the volumes through the year to be materially different or kind of more of a normal seasonality?", "James Thomas Hill", "If I could predict the weather, I'd answer that question. The first quarter and the fourth quarter are always dicey. You just never know what's going to happen. What we were talking about in the presentation was, last year, our fourth quarter had great weather. It was really strong. So we were very pleased with the performance in this year's fourth quarter versus 2013. I don't know how to answer that except for, if you look at it, we just have to base it on normal weather patterns, which would mean the first and fourth quarters are always a little dicey.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Fair enough.", "John R. McPherson", "It's John, real quick. This is not quite an answer to your question directly, but it may be a related point, which I think there's historically been a tendency as you all model quarterly results to, if you will, over-model the first quarter. And just -- I'd just remind you that first quarter results, given typically low volumes and erratic weather, can be a little more unpredictable, whether that's a question on price or cost. So I would say that people often fail to understand some of the volatility that's inherent in our first quarter.", "James Thomas Hill", "Well said.", "Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Very helpful. But as far as the SAG cost, we'll see some nice leverage in the coming year. But outside of acquisitions or incentive comp, is there any reason to think that, that number cannot continue to be leveraged on a go-forward basis into '16 and beyond?", "John R. McPherson", "No, we fully intend to leverage that number in '16 and beyond. And Tom would say exactly the same thing. And when we took a bunch of actions to reduce our SAG cost, we worked hard to do it in a way where it can be leveraged going forward, including systems investments and other things we've done. So that is our intent and focus.", "James Thomas Hill", "As John likes to say, we've been through that pain, we're not going back there.", "John R. McPherson", "That doesn't mean the number won't go up some. But -- obviously, if our volumes grow like we think they will, but as a percent of sales, it should decline significantly over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "If I go back to your original comments, Tom, about momentum. Obviously, you are seeing momentum in volumes continue 2014 and 2015. You see a momentum in price sort of picking up 2014 and 2015. You talked about a gradual recovery lasting several more years. Can you give us some sense of whether you think as we look beyond '15, given that you don't have a crystal ball, but can you give us some sense of whether you think momentum can continue to sort of grow and rates of growth can stay at the levels they've been or even expand on price and volume?", "James Thomas Hill", "As far as confidence beyond '15 and our outlook there, what gives us confidence is we're so far below the structural demand of aggregates, even with our outlook in '15. And for our country to stay healthy and strong like it is, that structural demand has to continue to grow or get back to more normalized levels. So a lot of confidence there. It's also the momentum you just see out there in all segments of the market. And yes, as far as continuing to expand margins, we plan on, as I said earlier, continuing disciplined execution of price and our operating disciplines.", "John R. McPherson", "Todd, one of the focal points of our Investor Day will also be -- maybe to your question -- what's the earnings power of our business at normal demand and what are we planning to do to get there as a management team. So not to put off your question, but we will dig into it deeper when we -- in that setting.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Sure John, you can give me a preview right now, if you wanted to. I'll let you go on that.", "John R. McPherson", "I guess, I don't want to, Todd.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Fair enough. I appreciate that answer. And thinking about the 2015 guidance, are there any -- where are the sort of points of sensitivity or push points in that where you could come out sort of above the guidance or below? Or put another way, what could happen this year to bring you in above your guidance or below it?", "John R. McPherson", "I think, Todd, the official answer. One, I can't give you an answer on Investor Day early. Our guidance is our guidance.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough", "John R. McPherson", "So I think your question within that, I think I'll just refer you back to some of our comments. We haven't tried to bake all the potential benefits of lower diesel prices into our estimates because we don't know what diesel prices are going to be. So that could -- for this year, that can swing a bit, obviously, in our production cost, as it did in the fourth quarter. So that's an example, but I think you could go through a lot of things and have an example. But that's one that's kind of outside our control, if you will, that we would think about. And again, for that reason, we didn't try and bake in some assumption that we can't control into our models.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Obviously, a lot of questions have been asked. I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the -- your gross profit per ton and the operating discipline you talked about. How much of that is volumes coming back and you guys just being prudent on adding back fixed costs? And how much of that is true productivity improvements you're making to the business?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think there's a lot of that in true productivity improvements. As I said earlier, we're operating at 60% of our peak volumes, so you've got plants in some markets where we were having 2 crews run full plants, and there's just a lot of inefficiencies with that, along with a lot of fixed cost in these plants. We also need to go back and look at -- well, you can look at margin improvements, that mix, the slide that has the circles on it, it's a mix of price, of cost and then the blend of the products we're selling that give you the total -- the total maximized profitability of an operation where you make as much money as you can. And that's why we call it a local market, because just the plant manager and the salesman, they have to be there looking at their stockpiles, knowing what the market is going to have, where can they go with price, to put all that together to maximize profitability.", "Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess just a follow-up to that. I can't believe you gave as much color on incremental margins in '15, and you said it should be consistent with recent trends. Is there a point where that inherently starts to trail off, the incremental margins, either -- you've been talking about 3 years out, you'll be back to kind of normal aggregates volume, is that when you might see a trail off?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think you got to go back to the fact that -- and this is -- and I keep repeating myself, but it's so important that we're still operating at 60% of our peak volume. So you got so much productive capacity that you will reap the benefits from -- as volumes go up, as far as being efficient in those operations.", "John R. McPherson", "Just to clarify, by the way, I don't think we said that we think we'll reach normal volumes in 3 years. So we've got a good long ways to go, but we haven't given a prediction about that timing.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies.", "Michael Betts - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just 2 quick questions from me guys. Firstly, the SG&A going down slightly in 2015. I presume that the incentive compensation goes up again significantly, given the thought -- the increase in gross profit you're forecasting. What's bringing it down? I mean, were there some one-offs, I guess, I'm asking in 2014 or maybe a bit more explanation of what's bringing it down? And then the second and final question, assets held for sale, I noticed, were up $4 million to $5 million in the balance sheet. In your forecast for 2015, is there any assumption of higher ongoing quarry and land sales in 2015 than in 2014?", "John R. McPherson", "Mike, I'll take a first shot at those. First on SAG, and I'll just give you a rundown of some of the kind of things we saw in the fourth quarter. A lot of it is business development-related, more than a couple of million dollars. We had some incentive comp that was really tied to our Florida divestiture and a gain on that sale as part of our system. So that's kind of a onetime event. We had a significant land donation, another $1.5 million roughly, which ends up as an SAG cost and then down as a gain on sale of land, so it negatively affects the EBITDA. We had other costs associated with the acquisitions we made. So a lot of the things that drove SAG were not repeating themselves. Yes, the core incentive comp, we'll keep an eye on as part of the overall business mix. But much of the factors driving the $8 million variance in Q4 and really the variance for the full year had to do with one-off or nonrecurring items. On your question about assets held for sale, I believe the answer, if you're looking at the same part of the balance sheet I am, is that those were held for -- that was the CEMEX swap. And that we knew we were working on that transaction, expected to conclude it. We concluded it in January. So at the time of the balance sheet, we were holding those assets for sale. Rough fair value associated with the asset swap for both sides was about $20 million, just to give you a sense of the size of the transaction, no cash involved.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I'm wondering if you gentlemen can talk about the cadence of pricing over the course of the year. You're exiting at 4%, guidance at 6%, can you get to that 6% in March, beginning of the construction season, or you're anticipating an acceleration over the course of the year?", "James Thomas Hill", "Thank you. That's an insightful question. When you finish the year, outlook as an average of 6%, that will take some time to flow through. Normal cadence with that is to be a little lower in the first quarter and grow as the year goes along, and that's what we would expect.", "Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And in terms of just the additional price increases over the course of '15, can you talk about how many markets you'll be pushing pricing multiple times in '15 versus how many markets in '14 you were able to do that?", "James Thomas Hill", "I'm not sure of that. We will push price in every market that we have and work on it hard. Normally, every market is different as far as timing and amount. Normal cycle with that is January/April in a lot of markets, but some you'll have midyear, and some you have in October. So it's really all over the place, but we'll work on it in every market that we're in.", "Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just following up to Ted's question, just related to the M&A pipeline. Any opportunities that you see for potentially meaningful asset swaps or how, I guess, intense are those discussions? Or was comment earlier, Tom, the fact that you'd like to see more of those? Just trying to gauge, trying to read your prior comment.", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, I think what I was saying was that the pipeline has a lot of acquisitions in it, which we'll obviously have to be disciplined with. I don't know of any -- that I would be prepared to talk about any potential swaps out there. But again, we have to be picky about that. We have to be disciplined and be able to integrate them.", "John R. McPherson", "Let me underscore, as we think about capital allocation discipline, it's not all about acquisitions, it's also sometimes about divestitures and swaps. And I think it's an important thing for the industry to stay focused on.", "Operator", "And there are no more questions at this time.", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, thank you for your questions. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We look forward to speaking to you at our next call and many of you at our upcoming Investor Day. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Tabatha, and I'll be your conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.", "Mark D. Warren", "Thank you, Tabatha, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.", "Please note, a slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks by management and is available via the webcast. A copy of this presentation as well as a replay of the conference call will be available following the conclusion of this call at the company's website.", "Before we begin the actual results and the outlook, I refer you to Slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom, you can proceed with the call.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thank you, Mark. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring my confidence in our full year outlook. We're excited about the continuity and accelerating demand across our markets. We're excited about increasing pricing momentum, and pricing will continue to escalate throughout the year. We're also very pleased with our operating performance in the quarter.", "In spite of the difficulties posed by bad weather, our local teams did a great job driving incremental revenue to the bottom line, balancing price, volume, sales and production mix, along with operating efficiencies and leverage. The first quarter is always choppy, but we still saw healthy growth and good operating execution.", "Adjusted EBITDA was up 97%, total gross profit increased 128%, and same-store shipments increased 9%. Cash gross profit per ton increased 17%, with strong flow-through in aggregates gross profit, 68%, on incremental freight-adjusted revenue. Same-store pricing increased 4%, with strong pricing momentum across most markets. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. We are extremely well-positioned to achieve strong earnings growth in 2015 and beyond.", "Slide 3 shows the quality of our first quarter execution. It shows how we continue to convert incremental revenues into earnings growth. Total revenues, excluding freight and delivery, increased 8%, while adjusted EBITDA almost doubled to $77 million. This was due to strong earnings growth in aggregates and earnings improvement in each of our non-aggregates segments, while we held SAG cost flat.", "Our profitability continued to improve significantly whether measured by a margin percentage or per-unit profit. We achieved these results despite the prolonged bad weather in many key markets.", "Now let's look at our aggregate shipments map on Slide 4. I like the color of this slide. Momentum in shipments continue, with strong growth in key states such as California, Florida, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois. Volume in Texas was up 22% or 15% on a same-store basis, and North Carolina was up 29% despite bad weather. Georgia volumes were down due to extremely bad weather, but Georgia construction activity continues to heat up and Georgia is on the road to a very good run.", "Slide 5 shows the continuing volume growth across Vulcan's footprint. This momentum is driven by strengthening private construction activity and supported by highway construction. It's occurring across all end-use segments. This is a result of the increasing number of large projects and growing highway demand as states ramp up their highway programs. Shipments grew 13% in total and 9% on a same-store basis in the first quarter, even with the impact of bad weather in the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and in Texas.", "The growth rate in aggregates volume on a trailing 12-month same-store basis has continued to accelerate, led by strong growth in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia, while aggregate shipments in California and Georgia also had solid growth.", "We continue to see healthy price growth, and pricing momentum is accelerating. We had a number of markets with high single-digit or double-digit price increases. For example, Miami was up almost $1.50 per ton; Tampa, over $2.40; Charlotte, over $1.70; Charleston, almost $2 per ton; and the Houston market was up $2; and overall, Texas prices were up over 10%.", "We did have some headwinds on both geographic and product mix, with high volumes in lower-price states like Arizona and Illinois, and much larger shipments of base and finds on new construction and large projects, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Now this is not a bad thing as the volume and product splits helped our overall profitability.", "We continue to see confidence in our customers' view of the market and their acceptance of price increases. There will be a lot more to come as we have secured April price increases in a number of key markets. For example, Texas, Georgia and Alabama all secured new increases of over $1 a ton in April. Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices -- as new price increases are initiated and realized on both fixed plant work and new bid work. The pricing momentum is what you have come to expect from our industry and from Vulcan. What we are equally excited about is our ability to take top line freight-adjusted revenue growth straight to the bottom line.", "In our last couple of calls, we've talked about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding margins and profits. On Slide 7, you can see our gross profit per ton increased 62%. So in the quarter, price was up $0.44 per ton, but gross profit was up $0.80.", "Our sales and operating teams continue doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into higher levels of profitability. They are the best in the business at managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product.", "This story of unit margin expansion isn't a new one for us. There's a trend here, not just a quarter story. As you can see on Slide 8, looking at this over time, we've continued to compound unit profitability faster than pricing. During the last 12 months, our freight-adjusted average unit price has increased 3% or $0.30 per ton. Over that same time period, our gross profit per ton has increased 19% or $0.63 per ton. This is a higher unit profit than when these operations were producing twice the volume. We are still in the early stages of recovery. We are very pleased with this momentum.", "Demand for our products continues to accelerate, and I am extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth. Slide 9 illustrates our incremental margin performance in our aggregate segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the quarter was 68%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in 2014.", "Aggregates gross profit grew by $31 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $46 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 52% as the gross margin on those revenues was impacted by acquisition accounting and seasonality.", "Since quarterly figures could be distorted by weather or onetime costs, we are also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For the trailing 12 months that ended this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was also 68%, adjusted for the same acquisition.", "Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $148 million on incremental revenues of $229 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, gross profit flow-through is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover.", "With Slide 10, we can step back and look at the big picture, seeing the significant progress in the aggregates segment of our business. Before the recovery began, our annualized volumes troughed at 140 million tons for the 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013. Since that time, we've added 26 million tons on an annualized basis. Nice, but still a far cry from normal demand. However, we've been able to increase segment gross profit by $216 million, with unit margins increasing 35%.", "Again, our people were executing on the disciplines that grow gross profit. These results also foreshadow the earnings power of our aggregates business as we return to more normal levels of demand and as pricing fundamentals begin to improve.", "Slide 11 shows our asphalt and concrete results for the quarter. Both of these businesses are improving on a same-store basis and as a result of transactions that we have made to improve our portfolio.", "Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was approximately $9 million, a year-over-year improvement of $4 million, driven by higher margins and earnings from existing operations. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 6% from the prior year. Unit profitability increased sharply.", "First quarter concrete gross profit was $1 million compared to a loss of $9 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested Florida and California concrete businesses, unit profitability improved dramatically. Gross profit increased $6 million.", "Now I'll turn the call over to John for comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John?", "John R. McPherson", "Thanks, Tom. Capital allocation and capital efficiency, of course, remained critical areas of focus for our management team, and we gear our approach towards sustained value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to the allocation of capital across our business portfolio, let me remind you that in the first quarter we completed an asset swap with CEMEX, under which we exchanged our Southern California concrete operations for 13 asphalt operations primarily in Arizona. Vulcan will continue to supply aggregates to the swapped concrete operations, and you'll see a $5.9 million gain on this transaction included in this quarter's financials. We believe this transaction will prove valuable for both parties as each should be able to earn a higher return on the acquired assets than the prior owner.", "Now let me turn from business development activities to the ongoing management of our capital structure and capital costs. As part of our February 25 Investor Day presentation, we outlined certain actions intended to refinance near-term maturities, lower our weighted average interest expense and extend the overall duration of our debt portfolio. Slide 12 summarizes these actions, which are now substantially complete.", "On March 16, we issued $400 million of 10-year notes priced at 4.5%. This issue was very well-received, and the pricing reflects our now stronger and rapidly improving credit profile. Those funds, along with borrowings under an expanded revolving credit facility, have been or will be used for the refinancing of $620 million of maturities otherwise due between now and 2018, as well as 2 smaller notes due in '21 and '22, for a total refinancing of approximately $640 million.", "The left-hand slide of -- side of Slide 12 summarizes the relevant sources and uses of cash. And the right-hand side of the slide presents the relevant accounting charges, both the $21.7 million incurred in Q1 and the $46.9 million we project to incur for Q2.", "Now let me turn briefly to Slide 13 to recap the impact of these recent transactions on our overall financial strength and flexibility. Let me first remind you that we have maintained our overall level of debt at approximately $2 billion. We're quite comfortable with that level of debt at this time given our expectations for 2015 EBITDA and our strengthening outlook. Though we have improved the structuring cost of our debt portfolio, as you see on the slide, we now effectively have no maturities due before 2018 and a total of approximately $500 million due before 2020. By the end of this year, when we refinance our 2015 notes at maturity, we will have added a modest amount of lower-cost floating rate debt to our mix, a move which makes sense for our business. In total, our weighted average interest rate will have dropped by approximately 120 basis points to 6.5%.", "We expect to achieve credit metrics consistent with investment-grade benchmarks during the course of this year. And as our credit position continues to strengthen, we should have further opportunities to improve the overall structure and costs of our debt portfolio. We should also have the cash flows and the investment capacity needed to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareholders.", "Now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. As noted earlier and as you see reflected in our Q1 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan-served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. As outlined in our February call, we continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve.", "The Federal Highway Program receives much attention at the moment and deservedly so. Like other observers, we expect an extension of the current legislation, during which time leaders in Congress will seek agreement on funding sources for a new long-term bill. Although several states have delayed work due to uncertainty at the federal level, we currently do not anticipate a major disruption to our projected volumes for 2015. In fact, given our current backlogs and the patterns of new project starts in Vulcan-served states, we remain confident in growing our shipments to public transportation and infrastructure end uses.", "Now the deteriorating state of the nation's transportation infrastructure and its very real cost to the average American family become more evident with each passing month. We believe that our congressional leaders understand this fact and we're hopeful that they will find a way to at least begin to address this pressing need.", "But amidst all this frustration at the federal level, there is some encouraging news at the state and local level. And with that in mind, we did want to highlight on Slide 14 some of the positive trends we are seeing at the state level for infrastructure funding.", "In general, state and local tax revenues have grown and mirrored the overall economic recovery. As state and local tax revenues approach all-time high levels, they provide stronger support for public infrastructure funding. Additionally, many states, and including several in Vulcan's service area, are tapping into other funding initiatives to bolster transportation and other infrastructure construction. At some basic level, this is a matter of responding to the demands of voters, servicing the requirements of growing population centers and, importantly, competing with other states.", "Our primary goal today is simply to note this important trend as it is one reason we remain confident that aggregates demand associated with public highway and infrastructure spending will at least continue to grow at a slow but steady pace for the next several years.", "To just briefly highlight a couple of very recent examples, I'll point to Georgia and Texas. Georgia very recently enacted new funding for its DOT, providing approximately $900 million in additional dollars annually, indexed to CPI and fuel economy standards, and a near doubling of the overall program. This legislation also eliminates or heavily constrains transfers of transportation revenues to other uses. This improved state-level funding complements the decision of several counties in Georgia to levy an additional 1% sales tax for local road funding. This is very good news for our Georgia business.", "In Texas, the State House and Senate each recently passed bills to increase transportation infrastructure investments further. Should final legislation be enacted along these lines, annual funding would increase by a projected $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This commitment comes on the heels of Proposition 1, approved by voters in November, and which directed approximately $1.8 billion in new funds to road repairs and maintenance.", "Again, these are just 2 examples of the type of action we're seeing across more and more of the states we serve. States recognize the federal program is necessary but not sufficient, and they are moving to tap new sustainable sources of revenue to protect those funds from being redirected to non-transportation usages and to invest in their future economic competitiveness.", "I'd now like to review our full year outlook, which you see summarized on Slide 15. We have not, at this time, adjusted our full year EBITDA guidance from the range presented in February. As we've noted many times, overall first quarter results do not always provide a reliable read-through for the full year. That said, the underlying volume and pricing fundamentals during the first quarter were certainly encouraging, and they underscore not only the improved -- the improvements embedded in our 2015 outlook, but also our longer-term targets. If diesel prices remain around current levels, we currently would expect to finish 2015 toward the high end of our EBITDA guidance range.", "In support of this of view and our overall sense of confidence and excitement, let me briefly walk through the assumptions underpinning our full year outlook. With respect to aggregate shipments, our 9% same-store growth in Q1 was on track with our full year outlook of up approximately 8%, despite weather deferring some shipments into later in the year. The gradual recovery in demand appears to continue across all end-use segments and across the vast majority of our geographies. We remain very excited about the continuing recovery in demand and its implications for our full year shipments.", "Moving now to aggregates pricing. The momentum we currently see is consistent with or trending ahead of our 6% outlook for the full year. As Tom noted, April 1 price increases appear to have held up well, and we expect to see more price improvement throughout the year. We remain confident in the 6% target, and we expect many of our markets to see price growth well in excess of that rate. Pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets.", "In terms of overall gross profit for the aggregates segment, our local teams continue to execute very well, converting well over 60% of incremental freight-adjusted revenues into gross profit. Unit margins continue to improve and to improve faster than pricing alone would indicate.", "Diesel prices, as noted, have provided a tailwind and have helped offset certain costs inherent in meeting rising demand during often wet, cold operating conditions. We remain very confident in the full year gross profit outlook for the segment.", "Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability, both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisitions, divestitures and swap activity. These businesses remain on track to meet or exceed their full year gross profit targets, although we should note that margins in these businesses can be more difficult to forecast.", "And finally, SAG for the quarter remained flat to the prior year. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG expense to revenues as the recovery moves forward.", "All in all, our business is enjoying strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing very well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they can control. If history is any guide, we're likely to hit a quarterly bump or 2 somewhere on the multiyear road to normal construction activity, but the underlying fundamentals remain very exciting.", "With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments.", "James Thomas Hill", "Thanks, John. We're very pleased with our first quarter performance. We're pleased with the accelerating volume growth, pricing momentum and strong margin expansion across the business. We're seeing growing construction activity in our markets. We have a lot of large projects already booked and more to come. Residential and non-residential construction in our markets is growing. And key states are also rising to the challenge of increasing funding for their highway programs. Meanwhile, we remain completely focused on the execution of the business. Price improvement, lowering costs, margin growth and capital discipline. Our teams all across Vulcan's footprint are doing that. We are very excited about the opportunities we see ahead of us and look forward to sharing the good news with you in the future.", "And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I guess I was hoping just to touch on pricing. I guess there's 2 elements to the question. One, we know reported was up about 4%. Can you talk about the headwinds and how we might calibrate around an underlying pricing number? And then the second question would be just kind of broader commentary, I know you mentioned that you're trending in line to above plan, which is good. But maybe if you could just talk about what you're seeing overall, and then if you could just compare and contrast kind of your results to kind of other data points throughout the quarter, that would be helpful just to get some context around Vulcan versus Martin and peers -- sorry, Vulcan versus peers.", "James Thomas Hill", "Okay. First of all, as John said, we're on track, if not ahead, I think of our 6% pricing guidance. First quarters are always, as we said, choppy, and so we saw good price increases that stuck in January. We've had very good price increases stick in April. But when you look at the first quarter, it's really not a problem from a mix or headwinds, but it's more -- it wasn't just base and finds, it's also when you have real wet, really cold weather, particularly along the East Coast, you're not shipping to what we call fixed plants, which is your asphalt and concrete customers, which is some of our highest pricing or not very much compared to other jobs. So that's also a mix impact. But if you look at the underlying momentum of what's going in pricing, we have -- it's really going very well and we have a lot of confidence in where we see ourselves at the end of the year.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And can you talk about kind of the range of price increases that you put in April 1?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes, it was -- in most places, it was around $1. Texas was higher. It was anywhere from $1 to $2. And that was the range.", "John R. McPherson", "Ted, a couple of additional points and color to add, just to build on Tom's comments. I guess the thing we headline most is that we feel very confident of the underlying momentum, and the underlying momentum is obviously more consistent with our annual guidance than it would be the number you would see in just the first quarter. But a few other comments. I think -- and just because you asked, Ted, in comparison to other numbers, and let's just take Martin's number from last week, certainly, that's a very good headline number and we take it as another indication of the improving fundamentals in many of the markets that we serve. It's very hard for us as outsiders to make a true apples-to-apples comparison when you take into account freight impacts and geographic and product mix impacts, the impacts of the TXI acquisition and those kind of things. But that said, I think if we step back, our best guess would be that we're seeing many of the very same things. As Tom noted, our pricing in Texas for the quarter was up 10-plus percent. Our overall pricing outlook for the year, frankly, is roughly in line with Martin's new guidance, even though we don't measure pricing exactly the same way. Our flow-throughs, I think, were very consistent despite the difference in headline price numbers. So when you step back from all that, I would guess or expect that we see very much the same thing. And we, just to reiterate, again, confidence in the full year price outlook we've put out there, confidence in the trends, confidence in the ability to convert incremental shipments and pricing into gross profit and confidence in the longer-term fundamentals beyond just one quarter. What we're seeing in terms of volumes, what we're seeing in terms of price, what we're seeing in terms of margin expansion, all still on trend.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just to circle back around to one question real quick and ask it in a little bit different way. Did you -- did I miss it? Or can you quantify how much you think you lost from mix on that price increase number? Or is it just more of a general kind of concept?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think it's just really hard to do in the first quarter because of what I talk about, the mix effect of fixed plant versus just bid work, and that's really hard to pull out as opposed just base and finds. It's a big piece of where the clean stone goes and how much of it is in there.", "John R. McPherson", "And one thing we -- to Tom's point, I mean, it's from a one -- from a first quarter-to-first quarter can be very difficult to make accurate comparisons. The momentum is obviously stronger than the 4%, as you can tell by our full year outlook. I'd also just note that despite the strong reported numbers in terms of shipment growth, we still had, by our estimate, something on the order of 400,000 tons in each of Texas, Georgia and Virginia deferred from Q1 and delayed a quarter due to weather. And a lot of that, as Tom mentioned in his pricing comments, was fixed plant business. So again, that's not abnormal for a first quarter. But given the wet days we had in those markets and given its impact and available construction days, not an insignificant impact in the quarter, both on volumes and, by extension, on pricing.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. And sticking with pricing for one more, any plans for a second round this year, either in the summer or the fall, of increases?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes, you'll see a number of price increases go into effect midyear. You'll see some in October. And then as we bid work throughout the year, we will raise prices on the bid work. And as all work works off, it will impact pricing.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Great. Great. And then I want to ask kind of a general question. I think if the word for the day on the last earnings report was momentum, the word for the day this time is probably accelerating. And that's -- we would term that too in terms of price increases accelerating, volume growth accelerating. But I mean, when you think about the momentum and the business, and I know you've talked about this, but if you think about the momentum in the business, you think about the acceleration of the rate of growth here, what's that being driven by? Is that just sort of a -- you have mentioned large projects, but is it a little bit of everything everywhere? Or is there some particular end market or job type that you're seeing a lot of?", "James Thomas Hill", "It's, as you said it best, it's a little bit of everything everywhere. All market segments are increasing. Now the private is moving faster than the public, although we've got very good highway jobs, big jobs in our footprint that we secured and also some very big jobs along the Gulf Coast. But it is absolutely everything and all -- it's everywhere and everything. I think large projects are just a piece of it, a very nice piece, but just a piece of it.", "L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Good. And, John, a final question just to nit. Do you have an outlook for interest expense for the year given some of the bond work that you've done?", "John R. McPherson", "Yes, I think you can subtract the charges from interest expense labeled in the release. It's $221 billion roughly,$218 billion. And then you've got about a $69 million of charges that you could subtract out from that, that would give you this year's interest expense. But just to keep it simple, think about a 6.5% weighted average interest rate on a $2 billion debt portfolio. And so if you think about it for next year, you're looking at about $130 million, if you just take out the, I call it the messiness of this year. And obviously, we'll give guidance around that again as we get to next year. But think about $130 million as a run rate on the $2 billion debt portfolio as it currently stands.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "On your 8% organic guidance, I think you may have touched on this a little bit earlier, give as much detail of what you're expecting from the various end-user markets to make up that 8%.", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes, if you look at the -- if you look at highway, we'd say low single digit. Infrastructure would be low single digit. Residential would be mid- to high double digit, and non-res would be probably mid-double digit.", "Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And within non-res, a distinction there between manufacturing versus office and things like that, any view there?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, I think it's 2 things. It's your traditional non-res, which is office buildings, malls, buildings. It's also -- we've seen big growth in very large projects. As I mentioned earlier, the energy projects along the coast, we'll probably ship almost 3 million tons to those projects this year. And they're special to us because of our unique position in Mexico and our ability to supply those jobs via ships in the quantity and in the time that they need to be supplied. So -- and so that's not a 1-year play. We'll see that much volume or more in 2016. Those are also very, very profitable jobs again because of the advantage we have with blue water transportation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners.", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "The first, with oil prices remaining lower than last year, what are you seeing in the asphalt business? Are prices declining there? Or are you seeing any volume pickup from the lower prices? Could you help us understand a little bit of those dynamics?", "James Thomas Hill", "We haven't seen any price decline at this point. There's other drivers on asphalt than just oil. It's a big one. But we have not seen pricing decline in asphalt. Always, lower liquid prices help, but that's -- that changes across our footprint. Remember, we're shipping asphalt -- we're making asphalt everywhere from Texas, all the way up through Northern California. So there's -- while overall, liquid has gone down, we've got some markets where it's not going down nearly as much as it has in others. Overall, though, I think our, at least in the first quarter, our profitability was up. We had good efficiencies in asphalt. We had good pricing. We had some headwinds due to weather, where it was cold. But so far, our -- we're pleased with our performance in the asphalt product line.", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay. And then switching gears, could you just update us on the M&A pipeline? Is there any shift in the regions you're focused on, given the near-term dynamics? Or are you -- or is it pretty much as it was?", "James Thomas Hill", "I don't think there's any big shift for the reasons we're interested in. There is -- there are some attractive things out there that we work on. We are also very pleased with the integration we've seen of what we picked up in 2014. Those performed well and on plan, even in spite of some seasonality.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "First off, you guys mentioned, obviously, weather kind of played a role in some of your markets in 1Q. But that should be -- that volume should be pushed later into the year. How quickly can you guys recapture that volume? And can you kind of talk about what kind of demand trends you're starting to see there through April and May?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, let me talk about the first quarter. What we saw there was when it was dry, our shipments were very, very good across our footprint. So there is a lot of pent-up demand. It will, as the weather falls, it will come back to us. It wasn't just -- in the first quarter, it wasn't just cold wet weather, it was prolonged wet weather. And so the times we did have dry weather, everybody showed up and it was there. So we expect it to return sharply.", "John R. McPherson", "Trey, I guess the best answer, because let's not comment on specific quarters in terms of second or third, but we still have plenty of time in the year to recover that demand. And the way we think about it, our customers still have plenty of the time in the year to get that work done.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just geographically, are you guys seeing any shifts or notable trends geographically since the weather has started to cooperate?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think what you're seeing is -- Texas is doing very well, but I think what you're seeing is the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic states really starting to pick up momentum. This will be a much better year in those markets than 2014 as demand continues to accelerate.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And as we think about mix in light of that comment, is there any mix that we should be aware of, mix change that we should be aware of given the your geographic kind of outlook?", "James Thomas Hill", "When it comes to mix, as the recovery returns, as we always say this, we'll see a more -- a bigger mix of base and finds, which is a very good thing for us, because overall, it adds to our profitability. But as far as our guidance on price, in spite of mix, we're confident in it. And I would also say that the return of new construction with the demand for base and finds is a very good thing for us.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "All right. My last one is, John, you mentioned earlier, and this is just kind of a point of clarity, that you don't -- you guys don't measure pricing exactly the same way as Martin Marietta, and I know it has to do with the way you guys look at freight. But can you clarify, just so everybody is on the same page here, what you meant by that comment, please?", "John R. McPherson", "Sure. The way we report pricing is freight-adjusted. And so we take out the -- I think it was net of freight. So instead of reporting gross pricing to the customer, including freight charges that are effectively a pass-through, we report net pricing net of freight expenses to the customer, again, because we think, for us, that's a more accurate depiction of the underlying economics and it's the number we focus on internally as we manage our business. So if rail rates to our customers go up or if we have a broader mix of business that goes by rail or other long-haul transportation, it's not going to affect the net pricing number we report.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I wanted to ask you specifically about any weakness that you might be seeing on the energy markets or how you're thinking about that as the year progresses.", "James Thomas Hill", "I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your question.", "Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you hear me better now? No...", "John R. McPherson", "Any weakness in the energy markets or do we see that...", "James Thomas Hill", "No.", "Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes.", "James Thomas Hill", "We -- yes. I guess to answer your question, we don't ship much to the drilling -- to the energy market. When I say the energy markets, I'm talking about the oil patch, where they're drilling, where it's affected by the price of the barrel. So we wouldn't see it. We ship very little to that market. Now when you talk about energy when it's about the jobs along the Gulf Coast, which is the LNG jobs, refinery expansions, we continue to see that go very well. As I mentioned earlier, we'll ship over -- probably around 3 million tons of that for those jobs this year, at least that much next year, and we continue to see a number of those projects be bid and go through construction planning.", "Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So seeing that consistent, it sounds like?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes.", "Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Cool. And yes, I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about priorities for uses of cash in light of the options that you might have with your M&A choices out there looking similarly strong, just your priorities, if you could remind us of those.", "John R. McPherson", "Just to give the quick walk through, and I'll start. Tom can comment. First, we're obviously going to continue to make the required capital reinvestments back in our franchise. And those protect the long-term health and value of our asset base, and they actually drive many of the productivity benefits you see in our quarterly results quarter-after-quarter. So that, for this year, that $250 million of CapEx, that's obviously a priority. We'll continue to do that in a very, very efficient way. But we're not going to shortchange our core asset base. It's too valuable. Secondly, as we've noted, we're going to maintain our financial strength throughout the cycle. Given the actions we've taken, that shouldn't be a significant use of cash in the foreseeable future. But I would call it out as something we're committed to maintain. Next, on dividends, this is obviously a board-level decision. But it's our expectation that our dividends would continue to grow with earnings, and we think earnings could grow quite quickly during the recovery part of the cycle. But again, that's a board decision that they will take in due course. Then we turn to largely bolt-on M&A, really of the kind you've seen us do in the last 2, 3 years. We think that's a very good use of capital, tends to have very good returns, both on a standalone basis and in terms of its impact on the rest of our business. And so as we find the right assets at the right price, we'll continue to pursue those opportunities. We work through all that and we expect that over time, we will still have some excess cash after all of those other uses. And as stated, we will look to return some portion of that cash in the recovery cycle, if not most of that cash, to investors and through a mix of dividend and share repurchase, but I'd say, primarily, opportunistic share repurchase will be our current thinking.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "First, just to touch back on base and finds that you discussed earlier in the call, could you clarify where you are in terms of working down the inventory of base and finds inventory? And what regions require greater work in terms of working down these inventories versus others?", "James Thomas Hill", "Good question. First of all, I'd say that I think our operating folks and our sales folks did a really good job in the downturn of managing inventory, so we're starting from a pretty good place. As we do have some, I wouldn't call it a problem, by any means, but it sure does make your operations run smoother when you have large sales of finds and base. It just balances it out, makes the -- it lowers your -- actually lowers your cost and increase -- because it just increases your efficiencies in the operations. So not a problem with inventories, but it sure will be helpful as the cycle goes along to see those base-and-find jobs come through and go to the bottom line.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Are there any regional differences with the base and finds inventory versus any other region?", "James Thomas Hill", "No, I don't think I see any big regional -- not that I can think of off the top of my head. I think we're -- like I said, we did a -- we took a lot of pain in the downturn to make sure we didn't have a problem with that, and I think, again, I think our operating people did a really good job of biting the bullet, so to speak, when times were tough to make sure we weren't left with a problem.", "John R. McPherson", "And, Kathryn, well, part of Tom was referring to, and I think you understand this, is that we resisted the temptation. And this is the management team before us deserves credit for this, but we resisted the temptation to build inventory, if you will, to produce the profits as opposed to customer demand during the downturn. And so we've come into this in pretty good shape from an inventory point of view. And I think you see that in our flow-throughs and our incrementals. You see that in our results. So this is more about maintaining balance as we serve rising demand and as production ramps up than it is having any kind of problem.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay. Great. This is more a question related to acquisitions. Could you clarify the acquisition contribution in the quarter revenue, volumes, operating earnings? And maybe clarify a little bit more the delta between acquisition and incremental margins versus same-store sale metrics?", "James Thomas Hill", "First of all, I think, the -- for the acquisitions, and this is not counting the divestitures of the concrete, the acquisitions EBITDA was around $5 million. And I would tell you that that's -- we're pleased with that based on the seasonality we saw and we still had the headwinds of some purchase accounting in those numbers, which hopefully we've worked through most of that. Our guidance on those -- or our outlook on those operations for the full year remains in plan. And I think we're pleased with the integration.", "Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Great. And on the -- I guess you specifically cited Georgia weather impact. Where in Georgia were you seeing a greater relative impact? And in general, when you talk about weather, which was cited several times in the release, was it later in the quarter? Was it more a product of precipitation? So first, specifically to Georgia, but then more broadly speaking in terms of that weather effect in the quarter.", "James Thomas Hill", "I guess Georgia was all over, but obviously, the biggest market is Atlanta. And it wasn't a matter of how many inches of rain or snow we had, it was days lost due to wet weather. It was how prolonged it was versus the prior year. So it just shut us down longer than before. But I think we had, in Georgia, I think we had, for example, we had 10 more wet-weather days than we did in the prior year.", "John R. McPherson", "And, Kathryn, that comes out specifically, as Tom mentioned again, in things like our shipments to our key asphalt customers, key fixed plan asphalt customers in the quarter, which are, I'm going to call it, were 400,000-plus tons, if I recall, below plan for the quarter. And that's kind of booked jobs, booked business, so you feel confident calling it out as something that -- our customers weren't able to do the work to get the crews out and so we deferred our shipment to them. Again, it's a lot of asphalt -- yes, a lot of asphalt business and some fixed plan concrete business, but primarily asphalt businesses around Atlanta.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.", "Garik Simha Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "A follow-up question on the acquired assets. Just as you think out over the next 3 quarters of the year, incremental margins in the first quarter were soft for the reasons that you cited, purchase price accounting, seasonality, but is there anything within those assets that are fundamentally different from your, I guess, legacy assets that would depress or impact incremental margins moving forward?", "James Thomas Hill", "No, I don't see anything different in those assets. They always take a little time to integrate and, again, we had some seasonality, but I see no reason that they won't perform fairly quickly, or at least over time, as our current assets do.", "Garik Simha Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then just looking at your volumes, very strong in the quarter. I get why you're hesitant at this point, early stage of the year, to raise your volume guidance. But can you just talk maybe about some of the, if any, risks that you would see to end-market demand, specifically which of the major end markets, if any, are you, I guess, less bullish on? Because the tone of the call, with the theme of \"acceleration,\" things appear to be perking up really nicely across your footprint. Is there any one area or, if any, that is cause for concern at all?", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, obviously, I can't -- we can't predict worldwide events that may some catastrophic impact, but just assuming that all of that is neutral, I don't see any big risk. We've obviously got to go get a federal highway extension and a federal highway bill. I think there's very low risk that we -- that funding -- federal funding for highways is going to run out or that Congress will let it slip, in fact, a very low risk with that. But we still have to go get a long-term bill. While states, we saw, as John mentioned, a number of states are upping their funding and we actually see momentum with that, we're very pleased with it, states get nervous when there's not a long-term bill out there and they will start holding multiyear large jobs when they're insecure about the federal government's paying the highway bills.", "John R. McPherson", "The only other one that I think we've talked about internally that jumps out, I'm just kind of thinking this was a good question, is Texas longer-term, with the decline in oil prices and we, of course, monitor it like anybody else. We haven't seen any impact yet, I think it's fair to say, particularly in our business, and you can see that in our Texas shipments this quarter despite a wet quarter in Texas. But that's one that obviously we, like other people, will continue to monitor just to see if that creates any dislocations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I'm wondering if we can just talk about what proportion of your markets do you expect to enter your price increase on April 1, and then maybe share a similar data point for July 1 or how were you thinking about mid-year.", "James Thomas Hill", "Price increases, and we say this all the time and as we're not hiding behind it, but it's really true, pricing happens at different times in different markets, when I say that, even submarkets. So the pricing in -- for concrete rock versus asphalt rock in a market may be on different timing depending on the personality of the market. As far as April price increases, we had, as I mentioned earlier, we had price increases in Atlanta that went into effect in April. We had very large price increases in Texas that went into effect April 1. They were from $1 to $2, depending on where you were in Texas. And then we saw some price increases that went into effect in April in Florida. We'll see some more in different market segments in Florida mid-year. And as the year goes along, and as I said earlier, when we bid work, we'll continue to build price increases in that bid work on individual jobs, coupled with as you work off old backlog work, it will also give some momentum to price increases.", "Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the asphalt and concrete businesses, you folks have been pretty vocal with earning a fair return on your aggregates reserve and needing to get there. Can you just talk about how to get there in asphalt against concrete? Are you looking for outsized pricing to get there this year? Or is that a 2016 event? Can you paint the path for us for those assets?", "James Thomas Hill", "Yes, if you -- let's take concrete first. And our pricing in concrete for the quarter on a same-store basis was up almost $7, so we're seeing good momentum in concrete with pricing. And as I talked about earlier, some momentum in not just the aggregates business, but across the entire construction materials segment, so as you see that momentum in concrete, cement, asphalt, and it makes it just that much easier for pricing to flow through with aggregates. So -- and we saw price increases across our footprint on a same-store basis on our concrete product line. When it comes to asphalt with -- you probably won't see a lot of big price increases in asphalt with the impact of liquid. But the profitability in asphalt overall was up sharply, probably over 30% on a unit basis in asphalt. So again, you're seeing the momentum when it comes to profitability and the downstream products, which sets the table for continued price increases on aggregates.", "John R. McPherson", "And, Jerry, if you step back and think about our -- just our portfolio longer-term, building on Tom's remarks, our asphalt business has earned quite good returns on capital through the cycle. Material margins period-to-period can be volatile, but through a cycle, earn pretty good returns. In concrete, what we have left, the concrete businesses we continue to own, are doing well and earn good returns for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "I wanted to ask another question about your incremental gross margins on the aggregates line. The factors that impacted you in Q1, most of those were weather-related. I guess some were not. Have any of those negative factors carried into Q2?", "James Thomas Hill", "I think -- I'm sure -- I'm not sure I understood your question. Would you repeat it?", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Yes, I mean, the incremental gross margins in aggregates were lower than you saw last year. And my question is, the factors that caused that to happen, did any of those carry into Q2?", "John R. McPherson", "I think if you look at it on a same-store basis, the incremental gross margins continue to improve. So I think the key for you is probably look at it on a same-store basis to get an accurate read on the numbers. But if anything, we would expect our unit margins at our aggregates segment to continue to expand.", "James Thomas Hill", "I also think -- you've got to remember, we've got a first quarter in there, which is, as we say, is always choppy. If you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, it's improving.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. The price increases in Texas, you noted were a little bit higher than other places, but you also said you're watching Texas for potential slowdowns. So just curious why you're seeing stronger pricing trends there.", "James Thomas Hill", "The demand in the market is more mature than other markets. It's just further in the cycle. It's actually foreshadowing what will happen across the rest of our markets as demand continues to recover. You've got to remember Texas never had the big fall that some of our other markets had, and then they were early in the recovery. They were bolstered with all the big energy plays. So the demand in Texas and where we are in the cycle is more mature than we are in other markets. So pricing should be ahead there.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, we're 1/3 of the way into the year, and I'm curious on the private construction side, are you seeing demand that's in line with your initial expectations for the year? Or is it slightly better?", "James Thomas Hill", "No, we're seeing it in line. We're actually -- we're seeing very good momentum in the private construction segment of the market.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Collin Andrew Verron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Collin filling in for Bob. I just have a quick question on the public side. So in your presentation, you noted that the states have really been increasing their funding levels. But you have seen some projects being delayed. Can you discuss what states you've seen that in? And where you'd expect this -- expect to see this as uncertainty continues?", "James Thomas Hill", "The projects -- the places we've seen projects delay because of the lack of a long-term bill are really in Arkansas and Tennessee and just really some large projects that they have. They haven't gone away. They just said we're not going to commit to them and put them out for bid until we have more secure long-term federal funding.", "Operator", "And at this time, I'll now turn the call over to Tom Hill for closing remarks.", "James Thomas Hill", "Well, again, we were pleased with our first quarter, and we look forward to the coming quarters and sharing our good news with you. Thank you so much for your interest in Vulcan Materials, and we look forward to talking to you over the coming months. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Kayla, and I will be a conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.", "Mark Warren", "Thank you, Kayla. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, President and CEO, and John McPherson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.", "Please note a slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks by Management and is available via the webcast. A copy of this presentation as well as a replay of the conference call will be available following the conclusion of this call at the Company's website.", "Before we begin, I refer you to slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in the Company's SEC reports including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call Management will refer to certain Non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?", "Tom Hill", "Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining us today. Let me begin by thanking our employees for their outstanding performance in the second quarter.", "As you all know, weather conditions were unusually bad during the quarter with prolonged wet weather and serious flooding impeding construction activity in many parts of the US. In spite of these challenges, we operated safely, served our customers well and delivered strong results. The metrics and slides we'll talk about today are largely the same as in prior quarters. We are on track to have a very good year. Our focus hasn't changed and neither has our optimism regarding continued performance improvement. Construction activity and materials demand continue to recover.", "Pricing momentum is accelerating, and our employees are doing a really good job converting incremental revenues into incremental profits. Despite the bad weather in many of our markets we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring our confidence in our full-year outlook. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. As you can see on slide 4, adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations were $0.66 per diluted share, an increase of $0.30 from the prior year. Although overall average shipments were lower than expected due to weather, we continue to see expanding gross profit margins and expanding EBITDA margins.", "As you can see, overall gross profit margins increased by more than 450 basis points. These strong margins were supported by robust pricing momentum. We experienced strong earnings growth in aggregates and in each of our non-aggregate segment. This was also accompanied by declining SAG costs as a percent of sales.", "In spite of the weather challenges, our people did an outstanding job taking incremental revenue to the bottom line. As we've noted before, our local teams across our footprint are doing a great job managing sales and production mix along with pricing. At the same time, we continue to reap the benefits of improving operating efficiencies and resulting leverage. Total gross profit increased 34%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 33%. Same-store shipments increased 5%, and same-store pricing increased over 6% with strong pricing momentum across most markets. Our profitability continued to improve significantly whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit.", "Now, let's look at the monthly trend of our aggregate shipments and the impact of weather on slide 5. Rain in the second quarter reduced the number of available shipping days in key markets, and it certainly postpone shipments. Slide 5 shows the year-over-year change in monthly shipments. You can see the impact of rain on shipments in April and May up only 5% and 2% on a same-store basis. In April, it was pervasive across most markets with above average rainfall in 13 of our states. In May, severe wet weather affected plant operations and construction activity in Arizona, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.", "In June, with the important exceptions of Illinois and Virginia the weather allowed for more normal days of construction activity, and shipments were robust revealing again the momentum and demand. The map on Slide 6 shows a breakdown of 5% growth in aggregate shipments across the country on a same-store basis. Even with all the wet weather the vast majority of our states experienced healthy growth.", "Momentum in shipments continue with solid growth in key states, same-store shipments in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia saw shipments growth ranging from 5% to 11%. Although California volumes were down 3%, due to several large projects that had been delayed until the second half of the year, our full-year outlook for shipments growth in California remains unchanged. In our view and that of our customers' this is demand deferred not lost.", "I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 7, aggregates pricing. As we've discussed before, pricing growth tends to lag volume growth. We experienced in the second quarter the initial stages of this improving pricing momentum.", "We are pleased with the nice increase in freight adjusted aggregates price of 6.4% in the second quarter, and we fully expect to see pricing accelerate. This is supported by the confidence we see in our customers' view of the markets. We had nine major markets where price increases ranged from $0.60 to $1.20 and another three approaching the $0.50 range. In limited instances where we didn't see such robust pricing it was a function of product mix. We experienced much larger shipments of basin pines on new construction and large projects especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Growing volume in basin pines may detract from price but improves overall profitability.", "Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices are initiated and as we finish older jobs. At this point, we also expect second half price increases to exceed 8%. Pricing momentum for Vulcan will continue. We are focused on earning a good return on the significant investments that we in this industry make on behalf of our customers.", "We talk a lot about the three profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits, because they are important. On Slide 8 you can see that our second-quarter and trailing 12 month gross profit per ton increased 21% and 23% respectively. So in the quarter, price was up $0.71 per ton, but gross profit margin was up $0.76 per ton. Our sales and operations team continue to do an outstanding job turning demand into higher profitability. Nobody in the business does a better job of managing the combination of price, operating inefficiencies, volume and products. We continue to be excited about the ongoing very positive trend in unit margin expansion for Vulcan. It's not a new story.", "As you can see, on Slide 9 we have now seen eight consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. Since our volumes began to grow in the second half of 2013 our gross profit per ton has increased sharply, and we are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations we're producing twice the volume.", "In the most recent quarter we saw an increase in repair maintenance and labor costs. This is not surprising. Growing volumes are requiring us to run our operations longer resulting in more repairs, and wet weather negatively impacts labor inefficiencies. This is something that we will be managing very carefully even as we see pricing momentum and continued unit margin expansion that more than offsets these costs. Even though we are still in the early stages of recovery, we are very pleased with this momentum. Demand for our products continues to escalate, and I am extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth.", "Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in our aggregate segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the second quarter was 74% excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $44 million on incremental freight adjusted revenues of $59 million.", "Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 61% with a gross margin on those revenues impacted by acquisition accounting and weather. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or one-time costs we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12 month basis. For the trailing 12 months that ended this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was 72% adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $157 million on incremental revenues of $219 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to John for additional comments regarding our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?", "John McPherson", "Thanks, Tom. I'll start with Slide 11 which effectively serves as capstone to many of the metrics and trends Tom just highlighted. On this Slide, we summarize the improvement in our aggregate segment results since the recovery in volumes began in the second half of 2013.", "Before the recovery began, our annualized aggregates volumes troughed at 140 million tons. That was two years ago. As of the quarter just ended our trailing 12 month shipments are 170 million tons. So we've added 30 million tons of aggregate shipments on an annualized basis. This gain reflects a sustained early recovery but remains well below the shipments we'd expect under normal demand conditions.", "Now, importantly we've been able to increase segment gross profit by just over $260 million during this two-year period with per ton gross profit increasing more than $1 or over 40%. Certainly a central part of our strategic and operational focus remains on sustaining these trends and fully capitalizing on the continued recovery toward normal levels of demand for the materials we provide.", "Now let me turn to Slide 12 to briefly look at our asphalt and concrete segment results for the quarter. These businesses also performed well in the quarter especially given weather related challenges in Texas, Virginia, Arizona and New Mexico. Our local management of these operations continues to service customers well while also effectively managing material margins. And segment results for both asphalt and concrete have benefited from recent transactions that better focus our asset portfolio. Year-to-date the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plans despite weather related challenges. Looking at the asphalt segment, you see the gross profit for the quarter was approximately $21 million, a year-over-year improvement of $12 million driven by strong cost disciplines and margin management as well as the impact of acquired operations.", "On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 8% from the prior-year, and unit profitability increased sharply. In looking at the concrete segment, you see second quarter gross profit was approximately $5 million compared to $3 million in the prior year as margin improvements helped offset the impact of work deferred due to weather including a record wet June in the Virginia, Maryland area where we have our largest concrete operation.", "Moving now to capital allocation, Slide 13 highlights certain second-quarter actions and updates consistent with our previously communicated capital allocation priorities and capital structure goals. These priorities and goals have not changed, and we continue to work diligently against them. First, we continue to make the CapEx investments necessary to sustain the long-term value of our franchise and to meet our customers rising requirements. Our core CapEx spending for the year remains in line with prior communications at approximately $250 million.", "In addition, we've committed to replace two of our three Panamax-class ships which transport product from our high-volume quarry in Mexico. The vessels being replaced have over 30 years of service each, and the advantages of our Bluewater distribution network easily merit the investment. We expect progress payments on the construction of the new ships to be approximately $36 million this year with another $85 million spread across 2016 and 2017.", "Next, we intend to maintain our financial strength and flexibility at all parts of the cycle. Consistent with this goal we've now completed the major components of the refinancing plan outlined during our February investor day and discussed at length during our first quarter call. These accomplishments include extending maturities on approximately $620 million of debt otherwise due over the next five years, establishing a new $750 million unsecured credit facility, and lowering our average weighted -- or lowering our weighted average interest rate.", "Our second quarter results include $45 million or $0.24 per diluted share of expense associated with this activity. In addition, we took steps in the second quarter to streamline our corporate legal entity structure. These actions improve our flexibility and reduce certain should of burdens, for example, significantly reducing the number of state income tax filings we prepare. We expect another outcome to be a more appropriate and efficient allocation of interest expense and overall taxable income across the states in which we operate. We currently anticipate a $3 million to $5 reduction in the annual state tax expense or an approximately 100 basis point reduction in our overall effective tax rate for 2015. In addition, we may be able to utilize over time all or a portion of approximately $60 million in state level NOLs which may otherwise have expired unused.", "Next, we continue to pursue bolt on acquisitions. During the second quarter for example we acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready mix operations in Arizona and New Mexico for approximately $21 million complementing our existing positions in those markets. The pipeline of bolt on acquisition opportunities remains active. But we will remain a disciplined buyer, and as such the number, size and timing of future transactions remains difficult to predict. As our performance improves, so does our capacity to return capital to shareholders. We continue to believe that we will have the ability to both reinvest for growth and return capital to shareholders as the recovery toward normal demand unfolds.", "Now let me take a couple -- now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and then our outlook for the balance of 2015 before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks and Q&A.", "As Tom noted earlier, and as you can see reflected in our Q2 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. Looking through the weather and the noise in Congress, we and our customers continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve. Shipping rates on clear days underscore our recovery demand across geographies and across end uses. With few exceptions, construction activity in our markets remains well below long-term through cycle trends, but the recovery continues. That would be the main message here.", "Now to touch briefly on some of the underlying trends in private and public construction. With respect to private demand we continue to see manufacturing and other industrial related projects contributing to significant nonresidential construction growth. And as you probably know, housing starts despite month-to-month volatility continue to trend upward across most Vulcan served markets. On the public side, large projects have driven recent strength in Highway awards. State and local level funding initiatives support continued growth in road and other infrastructure spending particularly in the intermediate term. At the federal level, we remain optimistic that a multiyear bill may pass sometime in the fall. Tom will have more to say on this in a moment, but the need for a meaningful multi-year program is understood on both sides of the aisle, and recent developments have been well covered in the press.", "So to the extent we harbor modest concerns regarding our full-year 2015 volumes relative to plan, they primarily relate back to first half weather and the capacity of our customers to complete deferred work during the remainder of the available construction season. In several of our markets, key customers find themselves six or more weeks behind on scheduled work, and they face short-term challenges in adding the capacity required to catch up. In addition, the extension into the fall of uncertainty regarding the federal Highway program may impact the start date and timing of shipments to certain road infrastructure projects. Again, the marginal risk we see to 2015 shipment is one of timing and potential deferral into 2016.", "Now I'll turn briefly to Slide 15 and our outlook for the balance of the year. As noted in our earnings release, our full-year EBITDA guidance range remains unchanged at $775 million to $825 million, this despite the weather related challenges of the first half of the year. In short, we anticipate better than expected pricing and margin momentum to offset a potential shortfall in 2015 shipments relative to plan. The continued improvement in pricing and unit margins matches our strategic focus and bodes very well for the longer-term performance and value of our franchise.", "I'll now touch on certain of the modest adjustments we've made to assumptions underlying our full-year EBITDA guidance. As stated previously, please view these figures as indicative midpoints of our range of expectations. We want to give you a good feel for how we see the business performing, though we don't want to convey a false sense of precision regarding each and every metric.", "With respect to aggregates shipments, we've reduced our midpoint expectations for the year from 180 million tons to 177 million tons. This change reflects the challenges many of our customers face as they try to catch up with deferred work, the longer than expected ramp ups in production at certain of our acquired operations, and marginally higher uncertainty regarding start dates and shipping pace for certain large projects. Our fundamental view of the continued gradual recovery and demand remains unchanged. With regard to aggregates pricing, we've raised our midpoint expectation for year-on-year growth from 6% to 7%. As Tom noted, pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets. We expect the rate of improvement in the second half to exceed that of the first half. At this point, we would expect these pricing trends to continue into 2016.", "Due to the potential shortfall in 2015 shipment volumes, we have slightly reduced our midpoint expectation for aggregate segment gross profit. We expect the rate at which incremental freight adjusted revenues flow through to incremental gross profit to remain roughly in line with recent trailing 12 month trends. Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisition, divesture and swap activity. As a result we raised our midpoint expectation for full-year gross profit from these segments from $70 million to $80 million. Our expectations for SAG, DD&A and CapEx remain largely unchanged.", "All in all, our businesses enjoy strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they can control.", "The underlying fundamentals of our business remain very exciting. With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?", "Tom Hill", "Thanks, John. As John stated it we are confident in our full-year outlook. We are pleased with our team's performance in the second quarter despite the challenges of extreme weather. Our markets continue to improve in each market segment and across most of our geographic footprint. This growing demand is causing pricing momentum to pick up robustly which is clearly demonstrated in the second quarter results. I am confident in our employees' ability to execute on the disciplines of operating efficiencies that drive cost control and customer service that drives value and price all of which improve our unit profitability. We are very proud of our employees' hard work and dedication.", "We are also pleased with the level of activity on the Highway bill in Congress over the last two weeks. This culminated on July 30 in the Senate's passage of a new six-year bill the Drive Act. The Senate and house also last week passed a three-month extension to Map 21, the current bill. This will allow the house time to complete work on its version of the new bill.", "House and Senate leadership has stated their intention to go to conference with their respective bills and send a new, multi-year built to the President for his signature in the fall. This gathering momentum in Congress to address federal highway investments coupled with growing initiatives to improve roads in many states is very encouraging. We along with many other transportation stakeholders will continue to press for additional much-needed investments in America's aging infrastructure. As we look forward to the balance of 2015, and into 2016 we are excited about the accelerating momentum and demand in pricing and the improving execution by our employees. They are finding new ways to improve this Company and our profitability every day.", "Now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens.", "Trey Grooms", "Good morning, guys.", "Tom Hill", "Good morning, Trey.", "Trey Grooms", "Tom, you mentioned accelerating demand. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color around what you are seeing in specific geographic markets now that the weather has started to cooperate. If you could kind of give us an idea more specifically there.", "Tom Hill", "Overall we are seeing growth in all market segments as I stated and in the vast majority of our geography. About half of our individual markets we think will experience double digit growth this year. So all across the board we are seeing strong demand. Texas is probably the hottest market we have even with the impact of weather we saw same-store shipments volume up 8% in Texas. Florida continues to be extremely healthy. I think we were up some 11% in Florida for the quarter; Georgia very, very healthy. And actually Georgia got hit a little bit with weather, but there's -- that demand is just pushed back, and every time the sun comes out in Georgia, where shipping very strongly. So overall everything is -- the vast majority of the market is going well. If there is a spot that was a little behind the rest of the country I would say it was Alabama, Mississippi, that area. As I stated, California while the second quarter was a little slow because we had some jobs pushed back, and it may be a little bit behind the rest of the country, overall its demand growth is steady.", "Trey Grooms", "Okay, great. Thanks for that color. You guys have been putting up some really good incrementals, great unit margins continuing to improve. Just wondering at what point -- I know John mentioned again, touched on the mid-cycle demand expectation of 250 million tons or so. At what point in this recovery coming off of 170 LTM tons do we start to see these incrementals start to slow down some or subside a little bit and maybe the unit margins start to slow with the growth there or improvement?", "John McPherson", "I think as we talk about these same operations in the peak would've done 300 million tons, we're sitting at as we said 177 million so -- and we said norm was 255 million, so we've got a long ways to go before we start looking at any reduction in incremental revenue -- in incremental returns.", "Tom Hill", "Trey, all I would add is that while in a few areas we are seeing some rising costs -- some trends in rising costs we are able to manage those so far. You see that in our margin performance. Our operator to local teams did a fantastic job. We don't see any immediate or near-term change in the recent trajectory but I would reiterate that our more long-term, through the cycle commentary and guidance on flow-throughs, is more on the order of 60% than the recent trends you've seen. But that said, don't take that as a signal that we expect some eminent decline in recent performance.", "Trey Grooms", "Understood. And then on asphalt, very strong, the incrementals and the margins there tracking well above our expectations. Is there anything going on in the quarter there? Do you expect these trends to continue in asphalt?", "John McPherson", "As the asphalt segment was up some $12 million, $9 million of that was on -- without the same-store basis. $3 million was the acquisition. So we are pleased -- you've got to remember a lot of that asphalt is in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona so they did have the headwinds of weather, so we're very pleased with our operating group being able to deliver value to our customers, manage material margins and operating costs and give customer service with all of that rain. That's tough to do. On top of that, the $3 million that improvement due from the recent acquisitions, we believe that that's a sign those have been integrated well and quickly. In those -- in that, we've got a lot of talent, that we are glad to add to the team. Both the same-store and the acquisitions we're pleased with performance. I don't see anything in this that would slow that down at this point.", "Trey Grooms", "Thanks a lot for the color. Good luck.", "John McPherson", "Trey and for others, just to remind people folks newer to our business, we tend to earn pretty good returns on capital in the asphalt segment through the cycle and over time, so we are pleased with those investments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. First, is a clarification from acquisition contribution in the quarter both on a top line and a EBIT or operating margin -- operating earnings contribution. You may have had this but I may have missed it. How many tons of aggregates were acquired?", "Tom Hill", "I think that the tonnage in Q2 from acquisitions was a little north of $1 million. If you look at the overall performance of our acquisitions, we are pleased with it. We had slightly higher costs that was due to two things. Remember a lot of those were in Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, again, the weather issue which both dampened shipments and hurt us on cost. We also recognized in a couple of those operations that with some capital and some modifications, we could greatly improve our long-term product offering, quality of our products, and operating efficiencies. So you had those modifications in the first half of the year. I think those are starting to come -- we'll see the fruits of those probably in a quarter or two. But overall, I think we're pleased with it. We are on track to hit the plan that we had for EBITDA of $40 million to $50 million, and I think my folks have done a good job with the integration.", "John McPherson", "Kathryn, just as a reminder for everyone, we acquired not only some aggregates operations but also some good asphalt and concrete operations. So in total for the quarter the revenue from those operations was approximately $50 million. As they get ramped up and as we put some additional costs into them as we ramp them up and I'd say ramp them up and as Tom mentioned hit some particular product needs of particular customer groups, the EBITDA contribution in the quarter was about $11 million year-to-date. About $16 million from those acquisitions and generally on track as Tom said with our expectations.", "Tom Hill", "Let me correct one thing. That volume was just north of $1.4 million, I misspoke, in aggregates.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Helpful color on that. In terms of aggregate pricing. We always understand since it's a local market, and it's -- also pricing can be vary widely according to geography and then also to mix. With that in mind, do you -- two-part question. One, with pricing accelerating as the year progresses, how much of this is a function of higher magnitude price increases versus a greater mix of higher priced markets finally gaining pricing? Thank you.", "Tom Hill", "I think in all pricing was up in all markets except for Virginia. And that was really a mix issue. We had some very large sales of base and fines which as we say is a good thing. We like that. It actually improves our profitability. We are seeing robust price increases in most of our markets. I'll give you a little flavor on that. If you looked at South Carolina, Arizona, Alabama, we saw price increases from $0.40 to $0.50 in the second quarter. In the middle of the country which would be Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas and Illinois, we saw price increases in the $0.60 to $0.75 per ton range. And then we saw in a few markets we saw some very marked price jumps in the $0.80 to $1.20 a ton range in California, Florida, Georgia and Texas. But overall our -- it's still a local business, and our local teams are working hard to make sure we deliver value and quality and service to our customers. I think we have a lot of confidence that the pricing momentum is across all markets, and we feel good about it at this point.", "John McPherson", "Kathryn, I think those are the most important points. We haven't had much tailwind to pricing at based on geographic mix if that was your question. It's more prices across many, many markets improving.", "Kathryn Thompson", "That was just to the point I was going to follow up on. Given you haven't seen a tailwind from geographic mix and you are also flowing through costs from acquired assets, you should see theoretically, all things equal, improving incremental margins as the year progresses.", "Tom Hill", "All things being equal.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Absolutely understood.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ted Grace from Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace", "Hey guys, congrats on a nice quarter.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you.", "Ted Grace", "I was hoping to follow up on Trey's question first on the demand side. Mother Nature wiling, we've got three to four months left on the construction season. To the degree you are comfortable framing out how you're thinking about the out year, it would be great just to get a sense for what the leading edge indicators are that you're looking at, how quoting activity seems this early looking out into 2016 kind of maybe quarterly business review highlights. Anything you can point to on that front that would be helpful handholding.", "John McPherson", "Ted, this is John. Why don't I give a couple of numbers just to lay out a couple benchmarks maybe and Tom will add some additional market color in terms of what we're seeing from customers. All in all, we estimate that we've had about 4 million tons of aggregate shipments to start there deferred out of the first half. You can tell that we expect to catch up maybe about 1 million of those in the balance of the year, just by the change in our indicative guidance. A lot of that will, as you said, depend on Mother Nature and how long the remainder of the construction season is. And it really depends a good bit on how well many of our customers, and Tom can comment more, how much capacity they can add, and how much work they can just get done. To give you a rough sense of the 4 million tons we have seen deferred on the first-half roughly we'd expect to catch up about 1 million tons of that in the second half. That is less a function of any demands concern and just more a function of the time and capacity of our customers to get their work completed.", "Tom Hill", "I think well said. Ted, as you said we probably have four months of solid season left. It will come down to constraints from contractors. Can they get in to get the job? How many ready mix trucks can they get? How fast can they get crews laying asphalt? But overall, remember this is work that we see if we don't get it in the third quarter, fourth-quarter this year it will follow in the first or second quarter of next year. So it won't go away. It's just postponed. And it's very normal when we have this kind of weather to see it push back, and when the sun comes out we are shipping hard.", "Ted Grace", "Okay. So, maybe asked a little bit differently, if we were to think about the comments on a gradual recovery, normal recovery, would it be fair to think, at least the way you're thinking internally, is growth rates of end markets in 2016 could approximate 2015? Anything you might share on that end?", "John McPherson", "Ted, we haven't giving any guidance, obviously, and we will do that at the right time but there's nothing -- overall across what is a fairly diversified geographic portfolio for us, we don't see anything at this point that would indicate a slowing momentum heading into next year.", "Ted Grace", "Okay. That's really helpful.", "John McPherson", "There are always state specific issues, right? But across the portfolio in total, although we're not giving guidance, we don't see any decline in momentum.", "Ted Grace", "That's helpful. The second point of clarification, could you give us a bridge on EBITDA 2Q 2014 to 2Q 2015 -- I know there pricing is a tailwind, volumes are tailwind, energy is a tailwind, acquisitions are tailwinds. Can you just maybe help bridge it so we can understand the headwinds more granularly. I know R&M, labor was up, SG&A, a bridge there would be great, and I'll get back in queue.", "Tom Hill", "Really I think the only headwind that we saw was probably (inaudible) was costs in the quarter was slightly higher. Labor costs, and I mentioned R&M were up. The labor piece, weather causes inefficiencies in the stone operation, actually ready mix and asphalt also, but -- so weather affected labor. It also affected the rest of our operating efficiencies and tons per gallon of fuel and electrical power. We are also beginning to run our plant with increased demand. We're starting to run our plants a little harder and longer. When you start to do this to start finding a few weak spots in the fixed equipment.", "We also took the opportunity in the second quarter when we were down to do repairs so R&M costs was up. But if you look at it from a longer-term view, our year-to-date cost is down about $0.10. On a same-store basis it's down $0.16, trailing 12 month is down $0.22. But the disciplines in operating efficiencies and operating costs is something that everybody focuses on every day. It is something you just got to stay on top of, or it will get away. I think our people are very focused on the things they control and the efficiencies in those operations. The headwind that I saw in the quarter was really one of cost and it was a mix of R&M and weather-related inefficiencies.", "John McPherson", "Ted, if it helps at the gross profit line we basically as Tom was describing had a wash between some diesel benefits we had and other cost increases. So on a per unit basis that was cost structure basically a wash at the gross profit line so really the biggest bridge, if you will, of course, gets back to volume. And again if we had 4 million tons deferred out of the first half of aggregates we would estimate that's about a $35 million impact or so plus or minus at the EBITDA line. But the biggest factor in the quarter -- the costs were ultimately a wash, managed well. Volume of course is a headwind. If that's helpful.", "Ted Grace", "I can get more into that offline. Thanks and best of luck this quarter, guys.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Armstrong from Vertical Research Partners.", "James Armstrong", "Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a good quarter. My first question, a follow-up on the asphalt segment. How much of the incremental operating margin was impacted due to oil prices, and if oil was a significant part of that, do you believe that you'll have to pass on some of that as the year progresses, or will you be able to maintain those margin levels for the remainder of the year?", "Tom Hill", "There were definitely tailwinds with oil, but I think you have to look at it to separate that out when you're running over 50 asphalt plants and across the whole Southwest is really difficult to do. It's really a matter of managing the usage of oil with recycled asphalt products, recycled shingles each mix design maximizing it out and then maximizing operating efficiencies and the costs just to run the operation along with sales and service and value and price. So I think to try to separate that out is pretty tough to do. As far as giving that back, giving back any savings on oil, we don't see -- we don't see that -- those headwinds at this point. You don't know that for sure, but I think that right now we're pretty confident in our ability to manage the combination of customer service material margin operating costs and continue what we're doing today.", "James Armstrong", "Thank you. And then on the aggregate segment as we go into the back half of the year, have the regions in which you are seeing pricing momentum changed from what you saw in the first half of the year, and can you detail that a little bit more for us?", "Tom Hill", "I don't know that anything has changed as far as the momentum we see in the pricing. Obviously, the margins that are more mature in the recovery margins because price lags volume are seeing the bigger jump in pricing. But overall I think the trend is pretty steady. I think it will continue. Not only is it steady, but it will continue to improve as we go forward and as we said earlier, we'll be back half loaded with a price improvement.", "John McPherson", "The range varies substantially across markets but I think to come back to what Tom said, I think all of our states saw pricing increase in the same-store basis at some level. So a trend if we went back a few quarters would be that it's broadening. The rates vary substantially across states, but the trend would be that it's been broadening.", "James Armstrong", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "PT Luther", "Hi, John, it's actually PT Luther in for Timna today. You made some pretty universally positive comments in terms of demand trends. I just wanted to check and see if you are seeing much leakage just from the weaker energy markets in any of your -- among any of your customers maybe in LNG projects things like that.", "Tom Hill", "If you look at the energy projects along the coast, the LNG projects, the refinery projects we are actually seeing that continue to pick up. My guess is we'll ship over 2 million tons to that segment on the coast. Remember, the reason why we are so advantaged with our blue water delivery to those projects require big volumes by water in a short amount of time. So if you put that over 2 million to 2.5 million tons this year I would tell you that next year for what we know right now we will -- and this is what we have probably under contract we'd be just south of 2 million tons. Is probably on the drawing board another 8 million tons in projects that are out there that haven't bid, they are still in the permitting or planning process. So no slowdown in the energy projects along the coast.", "PT Luther", "Great. Thanks. In terms of the pricing momentum you're talking about in the second half, is that primarily from price hikes that you've already implemented and announced in the first half? Or does some of that assume some additional price hikes in the second half as well?", "Tom Hill", "As we always say, our pricing is across dozens of markets, so each one is individual. Then you've got, within those markets, you have fixed plants where you have got price increases that come at all different times of the year. And then you've got quoted work which you are pressing price with each quote, each week. So, it is a combination of what we've secured, pricing that will quote higher in the second half and then announced price increases in the second half. And then you are also working off of old work, so you've got to put all that into the mix and again you've got to aggregate all those pricing movements across all those markets.", "PT Luther", "Great, that's helpful. Thanks again.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research", "Garik Shmois", "Hi, thank you and congratulations. First question is on diesel had a nice benefit here in the second quarter. Coming into the beginning of the year we thought there could be potential upside because of diesel savings. Just wondering how you're thinking about diesel costs in the back half of the year as it relates to your overall EBITDA guidance.", "Tom Hill", "I think if you look at our guidance, this goes into individual operations, and so there is diesel savings built in from a ground-up perspective in the second half of the year. There's also built into that is labor costs and repair and maintenance costs and operating supply and parts. So I think when you put all that together if you look at our guidance we do have diesel built into it.", "Garik Shmois", "Okay. Thanks. I guess it's fair to assume that some of the other costs you've mentioned will partially offset.", "John McPherson", "I think that's the right way to think about it, Garik, I don't know that we're the world's best to predicting future diesel prices and those kinds of things, but we will begin to comp over, if you will, lower costs as we get into the third and fourth quarter. So I think you summed it up well which is, we would expect to continue to manage to improving margins in the second half in total, and underneath that is a mix of several factors probably a little help from diesel costs, probably a little bit higher repair and maintenance costs than we have seen in the past.", "Garik Shmois", "Makes sense. Shifting to capital allocation, you mentioned think it was $30 million or so to update your Panamax fleet. Just wondering if this is in relation to any sort of capacity addition that you are undergoing in the Cancun facility and if we should anticipate increased volumes coming out for your long-haul operations?", "Tom Hill", "These are specific replacements for the ships that we started that operation with. So those ships are some 30 years old. It's time for them to retire for all kinds of reasons. Now what we will get in the new ships is, with technology, we'll have a little more payload. We'll have much better fuel efficiency's and probably a little better speed out of the ships, so we'll get better efficiencies, but the bottom line of that is those ships are replacements.", "Garik Shmois", "Okay. I'll ask the highway bill question. You sounded pretty optimistic in your prepared remarks around a new highway bill. Just wondering, it's early, but if you could provide some thoughts on if we do get a multi-year bill towards the end of the year potentially what kind of volume opportunity would that imply for aggregates demands moving forward?", "Tom Hill", "I don't know that we put a number to that, because we've got so many unknowns in that highway bill and what does it mean. We have not at this point. The one thing I will say is that a long-term bill, even at the funding we have today, is a good thing for us. Because it gives security to those states so that -- we've got a number of states that are pushing back big jobs because they don't have security that they're going to get paid by the federal government. So worst-case if we get flat funding with a long-term bill we look at it as a very good thing. At the same time, we've got a number of states which have already substantially increased their funding, and we have a number of very key states to us including California which are looking at ways -- recognize that they have to increase their funding and are taking steps towards that. So overall, with the steps that the Senate is taking and that the house is taking we're pleased with it. We've got high hopes for it. We think we've got a lot of momentum. And on top of that you've got the momentum of improving state funding or the recognition that state funding has to increase.", "Garik Shmois", "Got it. Thanks again.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich", "Hi, good morning.", "Tom Hill", "Good morning.", "Jerry Revich", "Just to continue the discussion on the regulatory side. California is in session, or the legislature is in session about potentially increasing state highway funding. How optimistic are you that something goes through and what's your sense on where that process stands now? [Multiple Speakers]", "Tom Hill", "Let me give you a little background on California. Their highway bill right now is at about $11 billion annually. If things stay status quo, they've cut that to about 5% to about $10.5 billion. They recognize that they have to take steps to not only keep that whole but to improve it. There's Senate Bill 16 which is out there right now which would increase it by another $3 billion. It is too early to give you a guess on that at this point or a prediction. I think the good thing is that they recognize that they have a shortfall. They're going to have to address it, and they are taking steps for it. Of there's any place that needs roads, California sure does. They do recognize it, and the leadership there is taking steps to improve it.", "Jerry Revich", "What's your sense on timing? How do you expect it to play out what are the negative -- ", "Tom Hill", "Too early to tell. I think it's too early to tell. I wouldn't take a guess at it at this point.", "Jerry Revich", "In the press release you highlighted stripping costs just naturally in mine plans evolve as companies get price increases. Can you just counsel us on how to think about stripping costs over the next couple of years? How much are you changing mine plans as pricing is picking up here?", "Tom Hill", "I don't know that were changing mine plans with pricing. That wouldn't drive a mine plan. It's really based on the long-term operations of a quarry. Obviously as volume goes up you just have to strip more because you have your producing more tons. I think other times, as we are opportunistic when we strip, so it may be that when we are not running operations for whatever reason we take the crew and equipment and go strip because is it's just good sense and good use of costs. But overall, I don't see -- price doesn't have an impact, volume obviously does, because you just have to strip more with more volume. And in each individual mine, it's based on what that operation has to do for the long-term. We're running these operations for decades, not a few years, so -- and stripping is the big part of the long-term planning.", "Jerry Revich", "Alright, thank you.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Adam Thalhimer from BB&T Capital Markets.", "Adam Thalhimer", "[Indiscernible] Thanks.", "Tom Hill", "Good morning.", "Adam Thalhimer", "John, I think you said for this year -- you did say for this year up 7% price you were previously saying up 6%. I thought I heard you say that that level of pricing growth is a good number for 2016 as well. Is that right?", "John McPherson", "I think what we said -- I wouldn't put down a specific level, but we currently see this kind of pricing momentum continuing into 2016. It's not just -- this is a more structural trend in our business. It's not a one or two or three quarter trend. But not trying to give you guidance for any specific number for 2016.", "Tom Hill", "Let me add a little bit to that. I think it's more about momentum. And you are seeing -- we told you that price was going to follow volume. And that as volume continued to grow, pricing would grow behind it. And that was very apparent in the second quarter. I think as we continue to see volume grow, you will continue to see pricing momentum grow. Not just the percentage, but overall pricing will continue to accelerate.", "Adam Thalhimer", "You gave a good breakdown of volume by month in Q2. I'm just curious whether you can share figures for July.", "John McPherson", "No, we're not -- we can't give guidance at this point on that.", "Adam Thalhimer", "Worth a shot. And just in general it feels like volume -- it feels like you've been a little conservative with the volume expeditions in the back half. I guess you're assuming that 3 million tons are either lost because of the weather or maybe push to 2016?", "Tom Hill", "I think for sure they are not lost. Those jobs are not going away. Our customers have a backlog and are going to do the work. It's really a matter of if you look at hundreds of jobs and even the fixed plant with hundreds of jobs, can they get on that job? Can they get it all done in the compressed amount of time they have to do it in the construction season 2015? So if they don't get it done, it will push back into first quarter, second quarter of 2016. If you look at asphalt for example, asphalt and our ready mix plant is do they have the plant capacity and the truck capacity to catch up from where they are? Again, it's not lost. If it doesn't happen in 2015, it will happen in 2016. As I said earlier, this is really normal for when we have severe weather like this. We'll do the work. It's just a matter of timing.", "Adam Thalhimer", "Okay. Thanks, Tom.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'll now hand the call back over to Tom Hill, President and CEO, for your closing remarks.", "Tom Hill", "Thank all of you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. We are proud of our second quarter, and we look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. We'll talk to you then. Thank you.", "Operator", "This is the end of today's call.

My name is Tabitha and I'll be your conference call coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.", "Mark D. Warren - Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Tabitha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, President and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.", "Please note a slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks by management and is available via the webcast. A copy of this presentation as well as a replay of the conference call will be available following the conclusion of this call at the company's website.", "Before we begin with actual results and projections, I refer you to slide two of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. At Vulcan, we posted another strong quarter, and we remain on track to have a very good year. Our solid performance, continued revenue growth and margin expansion are a direct result of the great efforts of our people. Today, you're going to hear about steady recovery, solid price improvement and about our sharp focus on the things we can control.", "Now, we won't be giving guidance for 2016 in today's call, but as we begin our planning cycle for the next year, our fundamental trajectory remains intact. We continue to experience a gradual, steady recovery in demand and shipments, although the details, of course, vary from market to market. We also continue to see a positive pricing climate with appropriate increases either announced or planned for next year. We remain well positioned to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at an impressive click.", "We're excited about the opportunities ahead. Our people know that they must remain highly focused on margin improvement and continue to drive ongoing improvements in our business. We're focused on capitalizing on our momentum. Our people are engaged and entrepreneurial and they are sharing best practices across the organization. They know that they are empowered to serve our customers and keep making our company more profitable and better in every way. We also, all of us, remain highly focused on safe operations protecting the health and safety of our employees at all times.", "Now to company specifics. The recovery in construction activity continued across most of our markets. As we will show you, the metrics are certainly trending in the right direction. While demand is recovering gradually to more normal levels, we've enjoyed sustained margin expansion and we continue to grow our profitability in a disciplined manner. As construction activity and materials demand continue to pick up, we're also seeing improving confidence in pricing.", "Now, we've had some cost increases during the last two quarters. Even though some of this is expected given volume growth, we are very focused on continually improving our operating performance. These efforts began to pay off in September, when we saw marked improvements in our costs. We are going to stay very focused on this. Our employees are doing a really good job turning incremental revenues into incremental profits. And let me add, we see these trends continuing. We are heading into 2016 with the wind at our back. That said, we are totally focused on finishing this year strong.", "Now, let's talk about the third quarter. Demand continued to recover gradually in the quarter. Our results demonstrated the earnings leverage in our business model. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continued to expand. As you can see on slide four, a 19% increase in total revenues converted to a 39% increase in gross profit. This also drove a 47% increase in adjusted EBIT, and a 31% increase in adjusted EBITDA.", "Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 82%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.95 per diluted share and an increase of $0.41 from the prior year. Gross profit margins increased by 490 basis points and were supported by pricing momentum. We enjoyed strong earnings growth in Aggregates as well as in our Asphalt and Concrete segments.", "We continue to manage and leverage SAG. SAG costs did increase in absolute terms. Here, one-time items offset lower head count related costs. What's important is as a percent of sales, SAG is trending towards 8% for the year, down about 1% from the prior year. All in all, I am very pleased with our peoples' performance, whether measured by margin percentage or per unit profit, our profitability continue to improve very significantly.", "Now, let's take a look at our shipments across the U.S. The map on slide five shows a breakdown of our growth in shipments of Aggregates on a same-store basis across the country. In the quarter, we saw solid demand growth, even though many customers faced bottlenecks impeding shipments. It's important to recognize what a good job our local teams are doing working with our customers to meet rising demand effectively and efficiently.", "Momentum continued with solid growth in key states; shipments in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana each grew by 10% or more. In contrast to the majority of our markets which were up, Illinois was down about 10%. This was due to significant large project work completed in 2014. Now at the same time, California saw healthy growth in the third quarter as major projects kicked off after being delayed in the first half of the year.", "I'd like to turn your attention to slide six, which shows our year-over-year growth in shipments. As you can see, this is very similar pattern to the last slide, with solid year-to-date growth in Aggregates shipments of 10% in total or 7% on a same-store basis. Both our East and West Coast markets continued to enjoy healthy growth as did Texas. Shipments in the Gulf Coast markets were also strong, with the exception of the central Gulf Coast region.", "Turning to slide seven, you can see that our pricing continues to strengthen, and for the quarter, it improved in line with our expectations, up 8% over the prior year's quarter. In a number of markets, we saw year-over-year freight adjusted price improvements in excess of 10%. These increases were fairly broad-based and occurred across all product types. And in more than half of our markets, we had price increases, ranging from $0.60 to $1.20 per ton.", "For the quarter, we didn't see this level of price increases in Virginia, South Carolina and Arizona because we had much larger shipments of base material and fines on new construction and large projects. As discussed before, volume in base and fines can detract from price, but it improves overall profitability. Let me emphasize the fact that pricing momentum will continue for us.", "There are three primary reasons that the pricing climate should remain positive. One, customer confidence continues to improve. Two, increasing demand builds backlogs. And third, construction related businesses are increasingly focused on earning adequate returns. Effective pricing performance remains a key focus for our management teams across our footprint. We are focused on delivering value to customers, while earning a good return on the significant investments that we make on their behalf.", "This ties directly to providing excellent service to our customers \u2013 the right product, the right quality, the right time and being paid the right price for superior service and value.", "Now, we've talked a lot on past calls about the three profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits. That's because it's important. As a reminder, the three profit drivers are sales and production mix, price and operating efficiencies. We call these the three circles.", "As you can see on slide eight, our third quarter and trailing 12 month, gross profit per ton increased 23% and 25%, respectively. So in the quarter on a same-store basis, price was up $0.86 per ton and gross profit margin was up $0.90 per ton. Our sales and operations people are doing a superior job turning demand growth into higher profitability. Our local teams continued to do an outstanding job managing the combination of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product mix. This is something we will stay focused on every day. With respect to the three circles, we've talked about the positive pricing environment and we've talked about new construction improving the impact of product mix on profitability.", "Regarding the third circle, operating efficiencies and leverage. We continue to emphasize production planning and operating efficiencies across the business. Despite improvements in unit profitability and same-store costs, we have seen some areas of rising costs. As I mentioned, I'm not satisfied with this and neither are our people. Still, we've seen some costs rise; about two-thirds of these increases resulted from geographic mix and fringe benefits often outside our control. In addition, during the last two quarters, we have begun to see a trend of rising repair and maintenance and labor costs in some areas. Even though this isn't surprising, we are not going to accept it.", "Growing volumes are requiring us to run operations longer, resulting in more repairs and higher than budgeted spending on parts and supplies. And labor costs in some areas were up in the first eight months of the year. We saw costs go up, we focused on them, and we realized improvements in September. We will continue to manage these costs very carefully.", "Let's turn to slide nine. Our employees can be very proud of this chart. It clearly shows that our people are highly focused on continuous improvement and quality of earnings. We're excited about the ongoing very positive trend in unit margin expansion. We have now seen nine consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin and we'll continue to post improvements.", "Since our volumes began to grow in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton has increased sharply. We are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations were producing twice the volume. Again, I would expect this trend to continue into 2016.", "Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in the Aggregates segment. This underpins the margin improvement you saw on the previous slide. Our incremental gross profit margin for the third quarter was 72%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $60 million on incremental freight adjusted revenues of $83 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65% with a gross margin on those revenues impacted mainly by higher costs at acquired operations as we bring them up to our standards and by higher costs for repair and maintenance.", "Now, since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or one-time costs, we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For this time period, incremental gross profit margin was 73%. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $177 million on incremental revenues of $242 million, adjusted for the same acquisitions.", "On a trailing 12-months basis, the flow through rate was consistently \u2013 has consistently exceeded the company's stated goal of 60% since volumes began to recover in the second half of 2013. Given our strategic focus on the Aggregates business, our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Thanks, Tom. I'll begin with slide 11, and as we did last quarter, use it to recap many of the trends Tom just reviewed. On this slide, we highlight the improved profitability of our Aggregates segment, both in total gross profit dollars and on a per ton basis, since the recovery in volumes began in the second half of 2013.", "On the left hand side of the chart, you see that for the trailing 12 months just ended, we shipped 175 million tons, 35 million tons more than for the trailing 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013, just before the recovery began. Now, looking to the right hand side of the chart, you see that Aggregates segment gross profit for the 12 months just ended was $682 million or $324 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began.", "So, on 35 million of incremental Aggregates' tons shipped so far in the recovery, we've delivered $324 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.35 or 53%, and a 25% increase in shipments has been converted into a 90% increase in segment gross profit.", "These facts, we believe, illustrate the impact of the continuous, compounding performance improvements you heard Tom reference, and that in many ways characterize our current Aggregates centric strategy and execution focus.", "Now turning to slide 12, which shows the solid performance of our Asphalt and Concrete businesses for the third quarter. Segment gross profit and unit profitability in each of these segments increased significantly versus the prior year, and year-to-date the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plan.", "Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was $30 million, a year-over-year improvement of $15 million driven by improving same-store volumes, strong cost disciplines and margin management, as well as the impact of acquired operations.", "As a reminder, our acquisition and swap activities have added 19 Asphalt plants to our portfolio since the second half of last year. On a the same-store basis, Asphalt volumes grew 20%, in part due to work deferred from the first half of the year, and Asphalt gross profit grew $11 million. Vulcan is among the five largest producers of asphalt in the country and these operations complement our Aggregates operations very well.", "Third quarter Concrete gross profit was approximately $10 million compared to $5 million in the prior quarter \u2013 in the prior year. Margins in this business segment have benefited from divestitures and other actions to focus our portfolio. The operations we have divested lost $2 million at the gross profit line in the prior year quarter. On a same-store basis, Concrete volumes were flat versus the prior year and gross profit improved by $3 million.", "I'll now wrap up with slide 13 and a recap of our full year 2015 outlook, before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks. In short, our outlook for the full year remains largely consistent with that presented in our second quarter call, and we are reaffirming our expectations for full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $775 million to $825 million.", "As usual, we note that weather patterns can impact results in the fourth quarter significantly, particularly if they shorten the total construction season. But, and as you've seen earlier in this call, the business is performing well and it is performing as expected.", "Now, ticking through a few of the individual drivers. We currently expect full year volumes of approximately $177 million tons, up 9% year-on-year in total and 7% on a same-store basis. As noted earlier, we see the gradual recovery and demand continuing across most of our markets. However, capacity constraints at various points in the construction chain \u2013 for example, the availability of skilled construction labor in certain markets \u2013 have made it difficult for many of our customers to catch up fully on work deferred due to rain in the first half of the year. And the continued uncertainty regarding federal highway legislation has begun to impact timing of certain road projects on the margin.", "With respect to pricing, we expect the currently positive environment to persist. And we currently expect to finish 2015 with a year-on-year increase in average freight adjusted selling prices of approximately 7%. As we'd indicated, pricing momentum in the second half of the year has been stronger than in the first half of the year.", "Our Asphalt and Concrete segments have performed ahead of plan, both on a same-store basis and as a result of moves we've made to strengthen our portfolio. These segments should generate full-year gross profit of approximately $95 million. But again, please note that fourth quarter weather patterns can significantly impact actual results.", "SAG remains roughly in line with plan and declining as a percent of sales. Importantly, direct salary and wage costs for SAG head count have remained flat this year. And we do not expect the rise in the pension and other post-retirement benefit costs that we've had this year to reoccur next year.", "Core capital spending, excluding dollars committed to the purchase of new ships to service our Yucat\u00e1n quarry, remains in line with plan. As noted in our earnings release, we may elect to pull some spending forward from 2016 in order to capitalize on certain procurement opportunities.", "As has been our practice, we plan to issue guidance for our 2016 year during our February earnings call. And certainly a number of the things can change between now and then, including federal highway legislation which Tom will touch on in a moment. But as we sit here in early November, we see volume and pricing trends similar to those we've seen year-to-date continuing through the fourth quarter and into next year.", "And we, of course, remained intently focused on converting that top line revenue growth into cash flow and earnings growth, to the very best of our ability. As Tom, said at the beginning of the call our basic trajectory remains intact. Tom, back to you.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, John. Our employees are working hard to ensure our strong performance, continue revenue growth and margin expansion. I can't say enough good things about our people. They never quit, always try to do things better and have enormous pride in what they do; and I see this every day.", "Our priority is continuous improvement. We're going to stay very focused on the things that we can control \u2013 on keeping our people safe, on customer service, on controlling cost and on price. We'll get fair value for the major investments we make in this business. I can tell you, it's all about creating value for our customers and our company.", "Now, before I conclude, I'd like to say a few things about the highway bill. I reported in our last call about the significant progress in Washington towards a new bill. The Senate, with great leadership, did its job when it passed a new six-year bill, the DRIVE Act, on July 30. The House transportation and infrastructure committee marked up its version of the highway bill two weeks ago.", "Congressional leaders believe it may be possible to compress the two bills and pass the final highway bill before the end of November. We are encouraged by the bipartisan progress that is occurring in Congress to address America's infrastructure challenges. We have been very engaged in efforts to encourage Congress to step up to this challenge. A new multi-year highway bill will be a step in the right direction and our nation's leaders will need to take additional big steps in the years to come. This is important for our country, our industry and for Vulcan.", "In closing, I truly appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Looking forward to the rest of 2015 and into 2016, I want you to know that we are very energized and engaged. We are focused on the fundamentals, on finding new ways to grow our company and its profitability every day.", "Now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question will come from the line of Ted Grace of Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you, gentlemen.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Ted.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hey, Tom, I hate to lead off on a question on 2016 given your opening comments. And so, I won't ask specifically for guidance, but just as it relates to maybe the slope of that trajectory heading into next year, it seems like depending on whether 4Q probably comes in a little bit below plan given some of the commentary; obviously one of your large peers gave some guidance that people are interpreting as off-trend growth. And so, I'm just wondering if you could give any kind of hand holding, whether it's market related expectations on how people should think about that slope. I know John just said basic trajectory intact, but any way you could kind of frame out, anything would be helpful, if we could start there?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me start with demand. We're seeing demand growth in all of our major markets \u2013 the vast majority of them \u2013 and in the market segments. More than half of our markets in the third quarter saw double-digit growth, a little bit of lagging as we talked about with Alabama, Mississippi, kind of the center of the country. But overall, we continue to see healthy demand growth, whether that's across geographies or market segments. So, we don't see anything that would give us pause for slowdown, whether in the fourth quarter or afterwards. Now, if you look at \u2013 on the same thing on price \u2013 we continue to see very healthy climate for price increases. That's built by customer confidence and by rising demand.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay, that's super helpful. And then maybe if I can just quickly tuck one in on costs. I know you talked about being somewhat above expectations in the last couple of quarters. You mentioned some of the factors in the third quarter, including more recently, labor and R&M ticking up, taking some proactive action to address that. Just when we think about the normal framework of incrementals you've talked about, is there any tweaking we should think about in kind of the next one or two years that could affect that to any meaningful degree or is that still kind of a useful framework as we think about just normalized flow through rates?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Ted, I don't see anything that would change the fundamentals of our earnings leverage or our trajectory \u2013 just \u2013 it's not there. And I'll address the third quarter; our costs in the third quarter year-over-year on a same-store basis were down about a nickel. Built in that was diesel was down about $0.23. The increase occurred in fringes and geographic mix was about two-thirds of it, which geographic mix is usually remote distribution network or higher cost markets. That will always \u2013 fixes itself \u2013 so that will come back around. The fringes are one-time or won't last.", "The other piece of that was R&M, which is natural for this time of the cycle. And then in some areas, we had labor costs that some \u2013 that were up in the second quarter and the third quarter \u2013 we recognized those. I think our folks did a good job of addressing those and we saw marked improvement in cost overall in September.", "So it's \u2013 what's important here is that we focus on the things that we can control. It's imperative that we always try to improve that. And it's that compounding effort of every day in every quarry of making it better and compounding those earnings.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "So, Ted, I think if you just checked through each of those three big drivers of costs, none of them are really structural in our view. One is geographic mix, shipping from higher cost locations or markets, and frankly, that comes typically with higher priced and higher margin markets as well. So, that as Tom said, correct itself and that's not a bad thing.", "On fringes and those employee benefit related cost, most of that, including the pension accounting issues, we don't see repeating next year and we'll correct for. And then, I think, Tom gave you a clear explanation for how we've addressed to some degree already, some of the somewhat temporary headwinds we think we've seen in repair and maintenance cost and labor cost.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Kathryn.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions today. I think that you helped to answer some of the questions I had about the higher costs, which were more one-time in nature versus embedded cost on a go forward basis. Just to clean up that question that you had \u2013 the answer that you were just giving in the previous queue. How far along are you in terms of resolving some of those costs that \u2013 I know you said you made progress in September \u2013 but is this something realistically it will be more of a Q1 before you really kind of fully cleaned up? Or will there just be some residual, particularly from a geographic mix, that we see lingering in Q4?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me give you an example of labor. I think we got ahead of ourselves in a few markets on labor, where we thought volume's going to come back faster than it did. We hired too many people and actually we had to go correct it when we saw it wasn't going to happen. We also \u2013 we're running in a number of the places \u2013 we're running, say, four plants with two crews and we've made some structural scheduling mistakes there, which we corrected. So a lot of this, I think, we've taken really good steps to recognize the problems, why we have good metrics and our folks look at it really hard and they've corrected it. And then as far as the geographic mix that will come and go, I don't see anything structural to that. You'll get that back actually.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay, super. Thank you. And then, if you could \u2013 I know that the year ago quarter you made quite a few acquisitions. Could you once again just break out, how much the contribution from the quarter were \u2013 in terms of revenue and earnings contribution \u2013 were from the acquired assets versus just core growth?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, the adjusted EBITDA for the acquisitions in the quarter was in the range of $13 million. I think overall, our acquisitions' performing well. We're pleased with the assets and the personnel that we added at Vulcan. I think \u2013 I'm very happy with the job \u2013 the integration job that our folks did in getting those tucked in and going. We're pleased with how it fits into our network. So overall, we're very pleased with the acquisitions and like what we've got.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "And Kathryn, we can break out for you revenue or gross profit contribution by segment of the acquisitions offline, if you like.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "I think in total, we're probably trending toward \u2013 I think we'd said $40 million to $50 million of EBITDA at the beginning of the year \u2013 we're probably trending toward the low end of that range full-year. Still, very satisfied with performance, but as we've noted, we've had some increased investments to better manage some mine plans and improve production capacity of certain product types in some of the acquired facilities. And that explains some amount \u2013 that explains part of why we're at the lower of that range \u2013 but that's basically where we're tracking, around $40 million, but not towards $50 million.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Perfect. And then my final question is around Aggregate pricing. You've seen some accelerating in pricing as the year's progressed and really actually from prior year and carrying into Q3. Twofold question, are there certain markets we're seeing greater pricing leverage? And then two, we've just received anecdotal feedback from the field that, particularly in the Southeast, you have \u2013 I don't want to say changed your pricing structurally \u2013 but are certainly being more proactive in terms of gating pricing equally across all of your main product segments being base, fines and clean stone. Maybe if you could flesh that \u2013 either confirm or flesh out that feedback that we've been getting in the field. Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think that the pricing trends we see right now are very positive and very predictable, with the pricing following the volume. I think what the good news is what we are seeing going at the end of 2015 and going into 2016 is a very healthy pricing environment. We've got steady rising demand in the vast majority of our markets; that's driving customer and construction industry confidence, which is always a good thing for pricing. But, one of the things we always have to remember is pricing is a campaign; it's something you do every day. It's thousands of price decisions every week, and it's also about the compounding improvements over time of not just pricing, but margin expansion.", "So, our employees are striving hard to improve the value for our customers, and I think that if you step back and look at it, the environment that we're in right now and that we close into 2016 is very healthy for pricing improvements.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Thank you. I just want to touch on demand and maybe if you could speak to any change in trends with respect to the demand segments, whether it's infrastructure, non-res or residential. I know you've commented that you're seeing steady progression on volumes, but has there been any, whether it's change in bidding or acceleration or deceleration, in any of these segments?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think that, as I said earlier, we're seeing good demand growth across all segments. Now, in the non-res piece, like you, we see the leading indicators. And we've seen them dip a little bit, but on the ground, whether it comes to shipments or bidding projects, we have not seen any dip in non-res demand. The good news is we're starting to see improvements in residential and in highway work. So, overall we're continuing to see good, steady growth \u2013 demand growth.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Garik, a few maybe pieces of the additional color since I know this \u2013 we know this is an area of focus for folks. From a geographic point of view, it's almost easier to talk about the ends of the spectrum. So, in terms of recovery toward normalized demand for us, on one end of the spectrum, certainly we have some Texas markets that are a bit further along in the recovery; in our view, still doing quite well, but a bit further along.", "And on the other end, as Tom has mentioned before, we have our Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, kind of our middle of the country markets, that really haven't gotten much momentum yet in terms of the recovery moving along; but everything else is making pretty good progress. The facts and circumstances vary by market, but everything else is making pretty good progress.", "The one issue that we do continue to see in some markets, and it will inform all of our plans for 2016 when we get there, is just the pace at which this growing demand and recovering demand really gets turned into Aggregates shipments. And again, in some markets that's \u2013 that's a function of large project timing and how quickly DoT's can get their raised level of funding out the door into new projects; so we'll monitor that closely. And in other markets, that's a function of these, if you will, bottlenecks in the construction supply chain that we've referenced, where availability of crews or equipment or developed land or skilled trade labor, those can really be the determinants of how quickly we grow. So, net-net, we continue to see across our portfolio, a steady, gradual repeating recovery that's basically on the same kind of trend we've been on for 2015.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Great. That's very helpful. Just wanted to dive in a little bit just on around the fourth quarter and your annual guidance and this fairly wide range that you've left for EBITDA for the fourth quarter. Just wanted to be clear on that range and what could drive the upper and lower end? Is it really just a function of weather and project timing or is there anything else that we should be paying attention to?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Hi, Garik, it's John. I wouldn't \u2013 we're not trying to signal anything by the breadth of that range. So, I wouldn't read too much into it first. I'd read it as unchanged from our last call. That would be the probably the main message because as I went through, most of the underlying drivers that we see are basically still on track with our last discussion on our last call. So, I think the read is largely unchanged. Yes, weather can affect it one way or the other, but I don't know that I'd try to read too much into the fact that we didn't change or narrow the range.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. That makes sense. And then just lastly, just highway bill question. You sounded a bit more optimistic, and certainly the discussions around in Congress have been more optimistic, and I think there's greater hope that a highway bill will gets passed relatively soon. If so, could you maybe talk about how this might end up impacting Aggregates demand, whether it's 2016, 2017, and what the medium to longer-term impact would be from the highway bill?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think, first of all, we're very optimistic that the bill is going to get passed. We believe that the House will vote on the bill this week, as a matter of fact. When this happens, it will give certainty for states. So you'll see a number of states which are starting to \u2013 have held back funds for large projects \u2013 which is Arkansas has done that. We've seen \u2013 and now we see Georgia is talking about it \u2013 and a number of states have done it. Well, they'll have certainty for the future going forward, which will be very good for us. That is a compounding impact because a number of states have raised their funding.", "But you've got to remember, there's going to be a lag here between, whether it's the increase in state funding or the federal funding, just because they've got to be able to get the funds. And then, they've got be able to set up plans and let the projects, and the projects have to start construction. So at best, I would say it'd be the end of 2016, but I think the highway bill, the impact of that, you'll really see towards the end of 2016 and into 2017.", "What is hidden in there is, you will start to see states have great relief with unlocking large multi-year projects. Even if they said they're not doing it, we've got a number of them that are just hesitant to do anything until they see that bill. And that I think will flow through towards \u2013 start to flow through in 2016 \u2013 but real impact, I believe, will be in 2017. John?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "That's right.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question come from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey, good morning.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Trey.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey, just one point of clarity, I know you've talked about kind of the \u2013 some of the states there in the middle of the country that you guys are in that have been laggards \u2013 but just one, if, kind of going back to the slide deck, it looks like year-to-date, North Carolina was in the greater than 5% category. But then, if you look at just for the third quarter, it was in the flat to down category. Can you talk about kind of what's driving that? Have you seen deceleration there or just your thoughts around \u2013 that just kind of stood out to me?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I wouldn't read anything into that Trey. North Carolina last year, we had two very large paving jobs that we completed that weren't included in shipments of this year. So, I think that as you look at North Carolina, the demand's still healthy; it's across a broad range of whether it's res, non-res, highways or infrastructure. In fact, the North Carolina DoT just passed a bill to substantially up their funding in that state.", "So overall, we feel good about North Carolina. We feel good about demand growth, think, it will carry into 2016. And we'll start to see some flow through of the $700 million increase in state highway spending \u2013 now, that won't come through right away \u2013 but you'll start to see some of it, probably end of 2016, but healthy.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Trey, you might even take that as just an example, and I know you know this very well, but of why it's a bit dangerous to extrapolate too much in our business from single quarter trends. And that's, of course, in the volume side, why we include both the quarterly view and the trailing 12-month or year-to-date view. Whether it's a volume trend or whether it's a pricing or cost trend, we're always going to encourage people to make sure you also take a slightly longer-term view and don't focus only on one quarter just because there can be so much volatility.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Yeah, understood. Thanks for the clarity there. And also, I guess as a follow-up, you guys had been fairly acquisitive, I guess, with some tuck-in deals that seemed to make a lot of sense. I guess recently \u2013 more recently \u2013 you've kind of taking your foot off, at least apparently, taking your foot off the gas a little bit there. Can you talk about, I guess, what you're seeing out there and how multiples are trending in the space? And then with that backdrop, kind of update us on your thoughts around capital deployment", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'll start, John. I think, Trey, there's really a good pipeline of acquisitions out there. As we've talked about a lot, they will come when they come. That's something we can't control. Last year, they all seemed to bunch up in the third quarter. I think what's important for us \u2013 well, the timing of that's unknown \u2013 what's important is the discipline of what we buy, what we pay for and then how we integrate it. And we need to be real clear about the synergies that are unique to Vulcan and how we leverage those. So, don't read, because something that happened that the pipeline's dried up, because it hasn't and we are not \u2013 we have not put \u2013 taken our foot off the accelerator at all.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "And Trey, on overall capital allocation priorities, I think the key message is that our priorities have not changed and that we're making good progress on the direction we've laid out. Just to quickly tick through a few, as I mentioned, our core CapEx, reinvesting in the franchise, maintenance haz-mat capital, that remains on track and it is been executed well.", "In terms of financial flexibility and our overall balance sheet, making good progress, and again, going forward, that's not a use of cash to de-lever, and we've also reduced our average interest expense a bit; we'll continue to look at that of course. We remain committed to a dividend \u2013 and the return of capital to shareholders through that dividend \u2013 that grows with earnings. That's a board decision, but nothing has changed there.", "Tom just touched on opportunities for M&A-related growth where, we have many, it's just a question of discipline and to some degree, seller expectations that may be ahead of where they need to be. And then of course, as we continue to generate substantial free cash flow through time, substantial operating cash flow, we expect to have a balanced approach of reinvesting that, whether that's CapEx or M&A-like growth and returning it whether that's through dividend or share repurchase.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "That all sounds good. Thanks a lot and good luck.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.", "Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Turning back to the highway bill, the various proposals out there have some level of inflation factored in their six year view. Can you just remind investors, would the impact of that be greater than the actual dollar because of the types of projects and the long-term nature of projects? Just getting for a feel of \u2013 we haven't had a six year bill in so long \u2013 sort of a refresher course of what to do with those numbers if this thing gets passed?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, let me start with the escalators in the \u2013 the Senate bill escalation is 3% annually \u2013 which would mean, you start at a baseline of $41 billion; in year three, it'd be $45 billion and in year six it'd almost be $49 billion. That compares to a House bill, the drafted House bill, which is at 1.9% annually, so a little less. Now, where we end up, our vote is for the Senate bill obviously or something beyond that, but who knows how that's going to turn out.", "While those increases are really important and we'll take all the funding we can get \u2013 more importantly, our country needs it \u2013 the confidence that this gives the states to move forward with long-term projects or very large projects is really important. It also \u2013 even if it's a six year bill that's only funded for three \u2013 it locks in policy for six years, which also builds confidence, not just for the states, but for the entire construction material cycle. So, you'll see this also builds on that confidence we talk a lot about for pricing momentum, because there will be funding out there, which means there'll be projects out there, which means there'll be work out there for our customers.", "And so, that overall confidence is really important, not just for our customer base and pricing, but also for the states that allow them to free up more work and drive demand.", "Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "So, a 2% to 3% increase, whatever it ends up being in dollars allocated, could we assume when the dollar \u2013 when they hit \u2013 it would grow the infrastructure piece of your business greater than that?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "And keep in mind, that the parts of that funding that are non-federal, are growing typically in our markets at a higher rate.", "Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good point.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "So the state and local funding is growing at a substantially higher rate in many of our markets than you see the federal dollars, but as Tom explained, the long-term federal program is certainly helpful to getting those state level funds and revenues sources from being collected to actually being spent on key projects.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Along those lines, while we've had a number of states in our footprint increase their funding, we have a number of them right now that are critical, that are debating increasing their funding, okay. This will give confidence and it will give \u2013 it creates momentum for those states to go do their part where there is much needed funding from a state and local perspective.", "Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "And at one point on \u2013 I think it was in the DRIVE Act \u2013 there was a talk of elimination of TIFIA. Is that still a topic that would be on \u2013 potentially on the table?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, that's really a reduction of TIFIA. TIFIA was budgeted at $1 billion a year. The DRIVE Act cuts it down to $300 million. And actually, truth be known, that's not bad news for us because we weren't getting to \u2013 we know $300 million is about as good as anybody got to, if they got that far \u2013 to using those funds. So more than half of those funds went unused. That will go into work on intermodal and infrastructure projects. So what our view of that is, it's actually pretty good news and that we'll get what we were using in TIFIA; the unused funding of that will go into major projects to address intermodal and infrastructure projects they'll actually ship materials on.", "Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask you, you've had a lot of success in driving gross profit per ton from $2.55 up to $3.90. And like how do we think about your ability to keep driving that \u2013 because I got to credit you, that's a ton of incremental improvement \u2013 but how much more runway is left?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Bob, it's John. Our view is pretty straight forward. We think there's substantial runway left. As you recall from our Investor Day, and we laid this out on a cash gross profit basis on Investor Day, but as we continue to move forward in the recovery, continue to move back toward normal levels of demand with the kind of pricing environment we expect, we should be able to continue converting that incremental revenue at about 60%. And doing that through this period of time gets us to a cash gross profit number that instead of being a little bit less than $6 this quarter will be a little bit above $8.", "So, substantial room left. I'd remind people that as an entire construction complex, more and more people are appropriately focused on earning fair returns on capital. And earning these kind of incremental margins is consistent with that view. So, we are very, very focused on it and we don't see anything from where we sit that should limit our progress on that dimension in the near-term.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Cool. That's encouraging. Tom, I haven't heard you this bulled up in a long time; it's a really solid quarter operationally. It looks like you're getting price for service. In your forecast, you're looking at 7% price for the full-year and you obviously gave a confident view of demand trends going into 2016. So, I'm trying to reconcile a little bit how we should be thinking about pricing trends next year. You have a tough comp if you're up 7% this year. Should we expect pricing next year to be low single-digit, more like consistent with this year? Thanks and good luck.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks. It's all about the environment and I think it's in momentum. As you go into the fourth quarter of this year and into next year, as I said earlier, we continue to see that demand going up and very steady demand. It's about customer confidence. They have backlogs; they have backlogs with profitability in it, so they can raise their prices. So, it is that confidence in the pricing environment that is so key, and as we talk about a lot, it's very predictable trends that as that volume continues to trend up, pricing will follow it.", "So, as we said earlier, it's the campaign of pricing and those compounding improvements over time, but going into the fourth quarter and into 2016, what I'd tell you is that that pricing environment is very healthy.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Could you just get a little more specific in thinking about 2016 to guide us? Is it more like, hey, you're at great pricing, lot of demand, we're up 7% in 2015? Against that comp would you expect to be at the low single-digit into the range next year or in a level more consistent with like 5% to 7% or 6% to 7% like this year in 2016?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Hey, Bob, it's John. While I appreciate the effort, we're not going to give guidance for 2016 on this call. But I'd just reiterate what we've said, which is, as we sit here today in early November, the core trends that we see in terms of demand recovery and the pricing environment, we see continuing into the fourth quarter and into 2016. So we don't see a significant shift in overall trajectory, but we're not prepared at this time to give specific guidance.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Totally cool. Good luck.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.", "Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Hi, thanks, guys.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Hey, Todd.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Todd.", "Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Let's take, hopefully, short shot at beating that almost nearly dead horse here one more time. Just real quick, and briefly I think, are you guys seeing deceleration in any aspect of your business anywhere, and if you are, where?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think we've got some watch points. I'm not seeing deceleration anywhere. The watch points, as I mentioned earlier, were, one was non-res just because of some of the leading indicators. As I said earlier, we're not seeing that on the ground, what we're bidding and what we're shipping; but we see that, we watch it, and I think our folks and Todd, I'd agree, (54:32) are very confident.", "The other place to watch is, as we talked about earlier, is to watch Texas, with the reduction in exploration drilling and the impact on jobs. While we've not seen any impact yet, it's been an odd year in Texas where it was the rain in the first half of the year back-loaded the year. So, if there is a drop off, it would be masked and it's a place we'll watch. But other than that, I think we're pretty confident.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "This isn't a direct answer to your question, but I would just remind folks on this \u2013 as Tom was saying \u2013 on both price and volume, there is of course, as there always is, a lot of variability across our portfolio geographically. So, if you were to look at the rates of volume growth or the rates of price growth, they're pretty well dispersed around the average. And so, we have \u2013 of course, as we get a little more clarity on our 2016 plans \u2013 we're going to have some geographies that are certainly slower growth than others, and some that are faster growth than others, and we'll have to incorporate all of that into our guidance for next year.", "Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Perfect. Thanks for that. And then, same question. You guys talked about bottlenecks in some places. This is something that we've heard from builders and contractors and guys who use contractors. Can you talk about how much of an impact that's having and if there's any rhyme or reason? Is it certain geographies? Is it certain trades that you're seeing it in?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't know that I can put a pattern to it, but we have seen a number of our customers run into bottlenecks which impacted third quarter shipments and will impact fourth quarter shipments. Now, that volume's not going away; it will be shipped. So whether that's in ready-mix business, it's trucks and drivers, it's finishers. In the Asphalt business, it's crews and lay down machines. And they're not going to ramp up \u2013 they'll ramp up a little bit, but not going to add \u2013 just have it slow down.", "I think what is key to what we saw in the third quarter and you're seeing happen at the end of this year versus last year is the sense of urgency by our customers. When I say that, last year if they got delayed, they just put it off to the next week or till the weather got right. Whereas this year, we're seeing contractors work on Saturdays and Sundays; we're seeing a lot more sense of urgency of getting these jobs done, which is very good news for us because that means they have backlogs now that they got to get this work done, so they can get on to the other work, which really signals from a macro perspective that there's more work out there and we continue to see the steady growth.", "Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Got it. Thanks for that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi, guys, good morning and congratulations. Quick question on the pricing or did you guys highlight kind of what the regional mix was versus the absolute pricing?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think that, as we said earlier, usually the places where we are further along in the cycle, we see better pricing. So, we saw better pricing in Texas in a number of places where the cycle's further along. And as we go into next year, I think that pattern or that trend tends to hold true, that the places where the cycle is a little more mature, you have a little more confidence in momentum and pricing.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Stan, it's John. One thing I just continue to underscore for those on the call is just as with volume, and I'll highlight both, but if you look at pricing by our general manager areas, if the average for the company was around 8% for the quarter, we have \u2013 and I'm just looking at what numbers I have in front of me \u2013 we have some that are 14%, 12%, 12%, 11%, 9%, and we do have a couple that are 3%, 2%, negative 1%, negative 3%. So there's a lot of dispersion based on local market factors, and in a single quarter, mix of business and other things.", "The same is true on the volume side of the business. If the average volume is roughly 7.5%, then you've got some that are up 20%, 19%, 13%, 11%, 10%, 10%. But you also have a couple, as we highlighted, that are nearly \u2013 like Illinois \u2013 nearly down 10%. And so, again, any single quarter view is going to have that kind of dispersion amongst our geographic businesses, and therefore all the more reason to make sure you also take these kind of trailing 12 month or longer-term views of the business.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I appreciate that. What I was trying to get at is that some of the markets that have say mid-teen sort of absolute pricing compared to kind of some of the low double-digit pricing, just how that's influencing the overall? And my guess is that as some of those higher ASP markets continue to improve, the whole pricing complex will improve as well?", "The comment about the bottlenecks and allowing some of the volumes to slip over into kind of, for the quarter or even into 2016, was that a material amount or is there any way to put a number around that?", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's really hard to put a number around. You know it's happening; you could see it happening. When you talk to your customers in the different markets, it's pretty widespread, but to put a number on that's pretty tough.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Sounds fair. Thanks guys, and best of luck.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Hey, good morning guys. The environmental charge in the quarter, is that something we could see going forward or is that really one-time issue?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "I think it's primarily \u2013 this is John \u2013 primarily a one-time issue. And you saw some, if you will, elevated above recent trend cost and relating to other income and expense. And a lot of that had to do with some one-time environmental charges including some settlement of past liabilities. So, I would think most of that is one-time.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And then, you mentioned that there was some places where you have ramped up labor in anticipation of demand that wasn't quite as strong as you had hoped. Where was that?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Southeast.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And let me add to that. It wasn't that demand that was off or demand was poor, it just wasn't as good as they had hoped it would be.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "And Tom, we've talked it about a lot, I mean they're going to be \u2013 as we continue to transition our crews and our scheduling levels, like many in the industry, from operating most of our plants as shared crews to having fully staffed plants again, there's going to be a little \u2013 the transition is not going to go perfectly. The key for us is to monitor it, manage it, correct it and to stay on top of it. But they're going to be some things like this as we transition from such historically low shipment levels back to something that's more normal, particularly given that we've been operating in some of these markets with shared crews across two or three plants. Just changing that staffing model is going to \u2013 is not going to be frictionless.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Great. Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "That concludes the Q&A portion of the call today. I will now turn the call back over to Tom Hill for the closing remarks.", "J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan. As you can tell, we will finish 2015 strong and we're very excited about what lies ahead of us for 2016. We look forward talking to you next quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Operator", "Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Alicia, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.", "And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark D. Warren - Director-Investor Relations", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.", "To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available, during this webcast and on our website, supplemental information. Rather than walk through each slide, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our quarterly results and outlook. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions.", "With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure, the highly competitive nature of construction materials industry, and other risks and uncertainties. These are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. As you saw reflected in our financial results, our teams really hit on all cylinders during the first quarter, particularly in our core aggregate segment. We met our customers' needs for higher volumes of material. We continue to migrate prices upward with an eye towards longer-term returns on capital. We leveraged fixed cost and lowered our unit cost of goods sold even after excluding the impact of lower diesel cost. And obviously, our margins and total profits for the quarter grew rapidly as a result.", "On a 21% gain in total freight-adjusted revenues for the company, our teams delivered 112% gain in total gross profit. It is certainly true that you can't extrapolate the full picture from a single quarter's results, but when you look at our results in the context of the last several quarters, you see very solid and improving fundamentals. Several things about this quarter really stand out in my mind, and I'd like to spend a little time discussing them with you.", "As a starting point, I want to emphasize that we continue to believe that the recovery in our markets still has a long way to go. Our business is in the midst of a long, gradual recovery in demand. It's not unusual in such recovery to experience periods of relatively faster and slower growth. And certainly, our first quarter saw a number of positive things come together all at once, but we are still in early stages of recovery for the construction economy. For example, to underscore a point, we entered 2016 in terms of per capita Aggregate demand relative to long-term averages, pretty close to where we were at the time of the 1982 recession.", "Having said that, clearly, the fundamentals of our business and our core aggregate focus strategy are very strong. This is, to our way of thinking, a recovery with real staying power. Of course, we will take 17% shipment growth whenever we can get it, but what impresses me about the quarter, and really the last 12-plus months, is a solid additional evidence of a sustained and sustainable recovery. It's supported by growth in all of our end-use market.", "With public demand just beginning to strengthen, it is taking hold in more of our key market and is leading to volume gains in more of our key facilities, and it is supported by longer-term fundamentals, including sustained gains in construction employment, state and local revenue health, and early signs of rising wages and income. We will see some ebbs and flows in the rate of demand recovery and our shipment growth, but that's to be expected, particularly quarter-to-quarter.", "The first quarter reinforces an important point. This recovery is real. It's broad based and our geographic breadth and positioning will serve us well as recovery moves forward. The first quarter provided a clear snapshot of this fact. Our overall shipments grew more than 15% even though our Texas and California businesses were flat to down. This is another indicator of a recovery with real staying power.", "A second point is that our local teams throughout the company are not only executing well, they're also adapting well to changing market conditions. They have performed well and have maintained operating discipline and focus while challenged by rapidly increasing volumes. Their focus and ability to adapt, their expertise in balancing product mix, pricing and greater efficiencies day-to-day and week-to-week bode well for our future. It can be easy to lose our focus when adjusting and adapting to rising customer demands for quantity and quality of product, all the while hiring new staff and adjusting shift structures.", "And finally, you have some profitability tailwinds at your back, such as lower diesel costs and higher product pricing. There could be a tendency to lose some operating discipline, but this hasn't happened. When demand has risen, our plant level teams have adjusted just as quickly to meet customer needs. They're highly focused on the operating details, critical to our long-term success, and are acting with discipline to ensure peak operating efficiencies.", "Our sales teams have also responded effectively to ensure we're serving each market segment well, and our sales and operating teams have stayed coordinated in balancing production and demand. We're driving earnings while helping our customers grow. We're going to face some operating challenges as the recovery continues and as we grow. That's just the nature of operating more than 340 facilities across many states. But I take an extra measure of confidence from how well our teams have responded over the last two quarters.", "Finally, a third point that strikes me as I reflect on the quarter and trends in our business, that's the payoff from our aggregates focus and from our commitment to continuous, compounding improvement in all aspects of our business. We brought our division presidents, our senior line of leaders from around the country together recently. And one of the things we discussed was the importance of keeping our energy which is electric. I can tell you right now that our people remain driven hungry for growth and improved performance. Our people, many of whom have 15, 20, even 30-plus years in the business, know that we are a long way from more normal demand and the corresponding profitability in our business.", "We live this every day with many plants still running part-time and many crews still without full-time work. Our people are balancing immediate customer needs with the maintenance and investment required to serve the growth that is coming. So, our job is to keep tapping into that pride, that sense of ownership and competitive spirit in order to keep getting better day-in and day-out. And certainly, our shareholders benefit for this emphasis on continuous, compounding improvement.", "As you've seen, we continue to expand our margins faster than pricing alone. And that improvement drives better returns on capital and allows for financially sound reinvestment. Since recovery began in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment has improved $2, or 78% on a trailing 12-month basis. The drivers of this improvement are many and to some may seem dull, but the impact on our lasting franchise value is anything but dull.", "Having shared these observations, I'll now hand it over to John for some brief commentary regarding our outlook. John?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the headline which was also noted in our release. Our full-year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter tracking toward the high end of that range.", "Now, looking at our first quarter results and at our momentum over the last few quarters, as well as listening to the comments Tom just shared, some of you may ask why are we not raising guidance at this time. Well, we'd like to be clear one more time that it's not because we lack confidence in the business' long-term fundamentals. If anything, that confidence has risen. And that's confidence in a recovery with multiple end-use segments and geographic drivers, and a constructive pricing climate allowing for more fair and adequate returns on capital as we move forward, and in our internal ability to execute and to adapt to changing market conditions, nor do we see any imminent threats that we're just failing to mention.", "Simply put, it's early, and we need to take some care not to over-interpret any single quarter's results. We caution against it. As we've said frequently before, we encourage investors to also focus on longer-term trends. We believe that help separate the signal from the noise, if you will. And for this reason, you see us incorporate trailing 12-month figures and other longer-term trend information into our release and supporting materials.", "With those caution shared, let me offer a few more comments regarding our current outlook for the balance of the year. We currently expect same-store aggregate shipments to be up 8% to 9% for fiscal year 2016 over fiscal year 2015. This compares to our early February expectation of about 7%.", "Certainly, our first quarter shipments evidenced underlying strength in demand even after adjusting for weather and other favorable factors. Publicly funded construction activity has shown some year-over-year strength, although the effects of the Federal FAST Act and recent state and local funding initiatives have for the most part yet to flow through the system. And some of our end customers appear to be adding some capacity, albeit prudently and gradually.", "Our updated same-store shipment growth expectation is roughly in line with the rate seen over the trailing-12 months. Again, we expect that growth rates will fluctuate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter as the recovery moves forward. That has been the pattern of this recovery and of past recoveries. So we're also seeing a recovery, although it has a good ways to go, that continues to see more geographic markets and more end-use segments participate fully.", "With respect to aggregates pricing, we continue to project year-over-year growth in freight-adjusted average selling prices of approximately 7%. First quarter prices showed approximately 2% sequential improvement over fourth quarter pricing. Price increases that took effect in January and as of April 1 were generally well accepted by the marketplace and in line with our beginning-of-year expectations.", "Aggregate unit margins should continue to expand faster than pricing, although the pace of that growth may vary quarter-to-quarter. As you saw in the first quarter, we're beginning to see some very good operating leverage as we leverage fixed cost to sales. And our overall cost performance of late, has benefited from lower diesel prices. Of course, those costs may rise as the year moves forward with some lag in corresponding product pricing.", "We continue to expect year-on-year gross profit growth in our Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segments of approximately 20%, collectively. Our local leaders continue to manage material margins in those businesses very well, although they may see some downward pressure from currently strong levels as the year moves forward.", "SAG costs were elevated in the first quarter, primarily due to incentive compensation-related accruals tied to our financial and stock price performance. We currently expect full-year SAG cost to remain roughly in line with our February guidance, and we will continue to leverage SAG expenses to revenues. Absent the effects of performance-based compensation and certain investments in our sales capabilities, overhead expenses have grown at an approximately 3% rate since 2013.", "Our target for core capital expenditure investments remains at $275 million for the year, although we may elect to pull forward some future spending if justified by compelling sourcing opportunities, for example, lower heavy equipment costs resulting from pressures across the global mining sector. You'll see $108 million of PP&E investment reflected in our Q1 financials. A couple of comments. We typically work to frontload our spending on heavy mobile equipment in part so that we can see the benefits of associated operating efficiencies during the heavy construction season. And the PP&E spending figures and the financials also includes certain internal growth capital investments. For example, ships to serve our Yucatan operation, development of new quarry site, and development of new distribution facilities such as the railyard we just opened in Savannah, Georgia.", "And including these internal growth investments, our total cash outlay for the year could be approximately $400 million. Vulcan's financial strength and flexibility allow for a balance of smart re-investment, pursuit of acquisition-led growth opportunities, and the ongoing return of capital to shareholders. Our overall capital structure and capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. During the first quarter, both S&P and Fitch raised our credit ratings to investment grade status. During Q1, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased 257,000 shares during the quarter at an average purchase price of approximately $103.", "I'll conclude my remarks by noting that our Q1 results represent another solid step toward our longer-term goals for the company's profitability when market demand recovers to long-term, normalized levels. Inside of Vulcan, we very much keep our eye on those longer-term goals. We have a lot of growth and a lot of work ahead of us. But the continuous, compounding improvements that Tom referred to have us well on track and well-prepared for the opportunities and challenges that will inevitably arise over the years to come.", "Tom, back over to you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. I'd like to once again thank our people, many of whom listen to these calls, for their hard work and dedication. I congratulate you for accepting the challenge of finishing 2015 strong and then repeating that performance to kick off 2016. For those of you in the investment community, I'd like to assure you the response to these strong results is to sharpen our focus to control what we can control and stay committed to getting a little better every day. In the course of doing this, I want to emphasize that we remain very committed to pursuing strategic M&A opportunities as they arise, further strengthening our asset portfolio in high growth markets across America.", "We take confidence in what we've accomplished thus far in the recovery. And we have many opportunities ahead of us, but nobody is letting up. Taking just the basic measure of EBITDA, for example, while we're excited about our progress, we know that we still have a long way to go. And I can assure you that the Vulcan team is determined to reach our goals. Thank you again for your interest in Vulcan Materials.", "And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. We'll go first to Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Gentlemen, I'm wondering if you can comment about early indications of pricing cadence for April. Last year, you were able to push pricing sequentially over the course of the year, and you had a 3% increase sequentially 2Q versus 1Q. I'm wondering how is this year shaping out. Do you think you'll be able to push pricing over the course of this year once again?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. As you look at the first quarter, I think this was a really good start to pricing. It was pretty consistent how we thought pricing would be accepted throughout our markets and with our plan. Overall, the climate for pricing remains very healthy. I think the environment is good throughout the construction industry. In fact, we would see some pockets of tight supply.", "As the year goes on, we're going to comp over higher and higher prices with our success with that last year. But it's also about making profit in this business. It's about the balance of price mix and volume and that \u2013 and what's really important is that compounding effect of pricing. So I think, at this point, we're really pleased with our people's execution of their pricing plans, and we have really good confidence in our guys.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And can you talk about, on the public construction side, what's the speed of DOT request for bids turning into actual project where \u2013 how is that timeline shaking out? I guess on paper the DOT budgets look really good this year, and I'm wondering if you're seeing that materializing in terms of projects moving forward on time.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think the DOTs are working really hard and really fast to turn their funding into projects, not the least of which is because of the political pressures that they feel. I think that if you look at the new \u2013 most of the new DOT spending that went into law the last \u2013 over the last year, you're not going to see much of that in 2017. I think they're plugging hard to get it out there, maybe a little \u2013 excuse me, you're not going to see much of that in 2016. Most of that will come in 2017. You may see a little bit at the end of 2016.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "But they're working hard to get it out...", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "...if they can.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Very aggressive. And Jerry, back on pricing, just with an eye toward the longer term, to echo Tom's point, we do like the climate we see. Everything seems constructive, very much in line with recent experience. And importantly for us, we seem to be a bit ahead of track on both pricing and margin improvement as it relates to our longer-term goals that we outlined at our Investor Day. So we're pleased with the results we see and it's a compounding improvement again, so we're looking to get it better quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions today. Just there's been obviously a great deal focus on the public end market, but I wanted to switch gears in terms of what you're seeing in the non-res end market because there's been some speculation that \u2013 could that market continue growth as we've seen. So, to that end, what are you seeing in terms of market demand trends from non-res projects, color on growth rate either by the quarter or for the trailing six months, and the types of projects you're seeing growth, growing best in your most important markets?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Kathryn, we continuously grow with the non-res. We look at the leading indicators, but what we're seeing in our markets and backlogs, are our customers continues to be healthy. As far as growth rate is concerned, it may not be as fast as last year, but it's still growing. I think that one of the things you'll see here is that the res is growing at a very fast rate, and usually non-res, particularly the retail construction will follow that. So, on the ground, we continue to see the growth. We still have a number of the large projects that we'll ship this year on the coast, and we also see some pretty healthy manufacturing growth.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Kathryn, one thing we're seeing that's a bit of a shift or a transition is our local teams are seeing a lot of small commercial work that's really popping up, and it's difficult to predict. This kind of pops up and gets executed pretty quickly. But we're seeing that in a number of markets, including (24:27) Nashville. So we think that bodes well for the overall health, mix, sustainability of the recovery to see this uptick in small commercial work across many of our markets.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Great. Thank you. And then on Georgia, last quarter, volumes were up 20%-plus. Our checks have seen at least a similar, if not healthier growth rate there. What are you seeing in terms of just how that state performed? But also importantly, just revisiting the prior quarter question which is have you seen any pickup in increased funding from that state, just increased volumes from the funding that was passed last quarter?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Georgia is really hitting on all cylinders, every market segment is growing. It's very healthy, housing, non-res. The highway is \u2013 actually, we've got a number of jobs that were backlog \u2013 very large jobs that were backlog prior to the funding. The state DOT has had a lot of pressure on it to turn out jobs in the new funding. So we may see some overlay work towards the end of the year in Georgia. But the real \u2013 I think, the real hit of the doubling of Georgia's funding will come in 2017 and 2018.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay. And final question on Texas. In the past conversations we've had, you had said that Texas is really the only market that's getting close to getting back to normal. Are there any other markets that are getting kind of back to that normal market? And then, also just for the benefit of folks on the call, if you could differentiate within Texas what markets are \u2013 or what you would view back to (26:11) normal and what percentage of your Texas revenues are in each of those markets? Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. First of all, Texas is the only market we have that's anywhere close to normal demand. As far as commenting on the market in Texas, it's \u2013 as you said, it's a big place with many different markets. Overall, it remains very healthy. Dallas and San Antonio are still very strong. We're seeing rural Texas gets stronger and that's a \u2013 we have a big presence there, particularly the asphalt presence and that's good for us because it's driven by the increases in highway funding and the damage that was done to the roads from all the oil explorations.", "Houston, we probably see some softening in res and non-res. It's a watch for us. The coastal work, we still have a lot of large work that we're shipping. There's a \u2013 when I say coastal, I mean from Brownsville to Beaumont. There's also \u2013 including Houston, there's also a number of jobs that are coming there. Now, timing of all that with big jobs, as always, you'll see ebbs and flows. But \u2013 so, overall, with the except for the watch on res and non-res, I'd tell you Texas markets are healthy.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Trey Grooms of Stephens.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Congrats on a great quarter.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. Good morning.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Thank you, Trey.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "So, looking at \u2013 I guess kind of sticking with the geographic theme here, can you talk about how the geographic mix that you're seeing as well as product mix could be impacting your pricing and kind of your expectation there as we look through the balance of the year?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Trey, for the quarter and as we look for the balance of the year, they are really in total, I'm going to call it, geographic and product or customer mix issues were kind of awash. So, there's really no big impact in that in our pricing for the quarter. Back on the geographic point and really the broadening of the recovery, we do see more of our, if you will, Atlantic Coast markets and Southeast markets, really beginning to participate in the recovery more and more fully across more end-use segments. How exactly that plays out in terms of price and product mix impact over the course of the year, we'll have to see. But that's not a big driver and the pricing or margin results you've seen of late.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got you. Okay. And then on California being down, I mean, it sounded like in the fourth quarter that was a pretty good market for you, and then you noted seeing a slowdown there, and you pointed out some infrastructure work. Is that just timing? And then I know weather was obviously a factor there. Can you talk about kind of what the California market looks like when weather is cooperating for you guys?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. As we said, California was hit really hard in the first quarter with rain. We still see solid growth in demand in California. Short term, we could see some issues with Caltrans funding or timing of work. I think the good news for us about California is that market is very diverse. Our out (29:32) markets in California are very diverse. So this year on top of healthy residential market growth, we'll see a number of water projects, high-rise projects and airport projects start in 2016. So what I'd tell you is overall, long-term, we believe that the California will continue to experience sustainable growth.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. It's helpful. And then the last one for me is, I think that you had \u2013 when you first gave your guidance on your 4Q call, you had expected volumes to be more kind of back-half weighted. But obviously, with the big volume quarter now you guys just put up, just trying to think about how that changes your expectation for the quarterly cadence or kind of how the volumes kind of shake out as we progress through the year. And then with that, the obvious question we've been getting, do you think there was any pull-forward from some of these stronger markets that benefited from weather, kind of pulling forward into 1Q from 2Q or some other period?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Trey, it's John. I'll start and Tom could chime in. On the guidance, what we're trying to note is some of the El Nino-related weather effects that we did in fact see. And of course, you saw our \u2013 both our California businesses, and some of our Mountain West businesses, and a little bit Texas affected by that. In addition, as Tom just mentioned, we had a bit of a low on some large public construction work in California. But then, of course, despite those challenges on the volume side, we posted the results you saw today.", "It's difficult to say if we had a little bit of pull-forward or a little bit of, I'm going to call it, overflow from 2015 where, for example, in North Carolina and South Carolina, some fourth quarter shipments were delayed by the bad weather they had. But as best we can tell, however, you adjust for it, we are seeing some strengthening in demand across more geographies, across more end-use segments. And as a result, you've seen us move our expectation for the year from 7% growth to 8% to 9% growth, in line roughly with what we've experienced over the last 12 months. We're seeing a recovery that still has a ways to go, but has more and more engines driving it, if you will. I think...", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Great. That's it for me. Thanks a lot, guys. Keep up the good work.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Garik Shmois of Longbow.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. Thanks and congratulations. You called out in the press release that you're starting to win share on large projects. And I remember a year ago at the Analyst Day when you indicated that this is \u2013 part of the strategy is we work through the recovery. It seems like it's bearing fruit. I was wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit more context around where you are with your share gain platform as it pertain to perhaps the quarter and the last 12 months?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. If you remember, I think what we said was we \u2013 I think we probably lost some share in the downturn, and it's always \u2013 as the markets come back, we'll recover that. As the recovery continues to mature, you'll see higher and higher shipments in the really high growth quarters in our markets, which is where we are.", "So, naturally, those jobs will be in our zone of natural advantage, so to speak, we're located. You'll also \u2013 we're also seeing more and more very, very large jobs, both commercial and highway work, and those also fall right in our wheelhouse. So it's just a natural recovery as the market returns.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "So, Garik, it's a little \u2013 it's a little hard for us to quantify that, especially kind of at this timeframe in the recovery. But as Tom said, I think it wouldn't surprise us if you're beginning to see some of the larger, more sophisticated producers recovering a little bit of share that they gave up in the downturn.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks. Just want to switch to some of the cost buckets within aggregates. Specifically, is it possible to indicate what your diesel cost was in the quarter? And then also on repair and maintenance, it has been trending up over the last several quarters. It was up again in the first quarter. Can you provide an outlook on R&M costs as you move through the balance of the year? Is it still going to be elevated on a year-on-year basis, or will some of those costs start to plateau?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Sure. I'll start, Garik, and then Tom will chime in, in just an attempt to give you some more color as best we can. Again, first thing we'd highlight that is if you look on a trailing 12-month basis, even excluding the positive effects of diesel, our overall unit cost of sales is essentially flat. So what's really behind that, if you take a \u2013 again, a trailing 12-month view is that our teams are doing a great job and they've been able to get some real operating leverage as volumes have increased, and that's offset some of the cost pressures that come from higher R&M that we've been talking about.", "So all in all, they're doing a great job. We've really seen that for the last two quarters. We hope to keep seeing it going forward. We'll keep an eye on it. But we're certainly very pleased to see that cost performance.", "In the quarter, our average diesel price is probably about $1.30, probably $5 million, $6 million benefit from that in total. But, again, what we'd underscore. And then our R&M in the quarter, as we said, it was still elevated. To give you a rough order of magnitude, the way we look at it, it's probably $0.08 up per ton. So that's an issue we manage tightly. We keep an eye on it. But in the context of our overall margin structure, it's not a defining characteristic.", "So again, we'll continue to manage it well. Our team is doing a great job. We're beginning to see some real operating leverage. And importantly, even excluding the benefits of diesel, we've been able to keep cost relatively flat.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'd tell you, I'm not surprised to see R&M cost at this point in the cycle and that may continue for a while. We're still playing catch-up on putting plants up, run the plants harder. We've got to remember we're still in the early stages of this, a lot has been on gradual recovery. The volumes are still \u2013 the rather recovery is still early. I think what \u2013 as John said, what I'm pleased to see is that over the last 12-plus months or five quarters, we're seeing a trend of the other cost and the operating efficiencies start to improve which tells me that we're leveraging the volume not only on fixed cost, but also on some of the variable cost and the operating efficiency.", "So, to John's point, I think our folks are doing a really good job adjusting and adapting to rapidly changing volumes. We have a long way to go. And I think that as this continues to mature in the recovery, we'll continue to see that fixed cost and variable cost volume leverage.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "That's super helpful. Last question is just quickly on the asphalt volumes that declined in the quarter. Was that mainly driven by some of the commentary that you indicated that California had experienced over the last quarter?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. California asphalt was hit hard. You just can't lay it obviously in the rain. I think we're pleased with our overall asphalt performance. Despite California being down, Texas volumes were up, driven by \u2013 a lot by both textile work and private markets. I think we \u2013 our folks have done a good job of managing a mix of price, cost of material margins and all the while serving our customers, and that's tough to do in the first quarter with icy weather. So even with California down, I think we're pleased with our performance in asphalt for sure.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Thanks, guys. Good luck.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Thanks, Garik.", "Operator", "We'll go next to James Armstrong of Vertical Research.", "James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Good morning. Good start to the year. Congrats. First question I had is on the weather impact as we go into the second quarter. Obviously, the South has been really, really wet in places. Are you seeing any impact of that as we go into the second quarter, or have you been able to pretty much overcome that so far?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Obviously, April has been wet. Anybody can look at the weather and tell that. But we would always tell you that we're going to \u2013 quarter-over-quarter or even month-over-month, yes, you're going to have weather, yes, you're going to have things that will affect you positively and negatively, but you can't judge it quarter-over-quarter or month-over-month.", "You really got to look at long term. So regardless of what the weather does, the demand is there, and if they don't \u2013 if it gets delayed, it's not going away. It's just postponed. And it always catches up and it always happens. But month-to-month, we're going to have periods of good weather and bad weather.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "And, James, we're not going to comment on April sales on this call. So, we'll talk about that in our next call.", "James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yeah. And then going to asphalt, margins were absolutely fantastic there in the quarter. Should those continue or should those come under a little bit of pressure as oil prices start to march up? And can you talk about the lag in asphalt and oil?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. If you look at the \u2013 the quarter material margins are probably a little ahead of schedule \u2013 a little ahead of our expectations. We could see some pressures with \u2013 as \u2013 the changing liquid AC prices. Again, I think our folks are doing a really good job of managing that, and this is a balance of volume, price, cost of material margins. So \u2013 and there is a lag there, we're trying to predict what that is and how that is. Asphalt sometimes runs through the cadence of it and sometimes it doesn't, but we'll manage that as it comes along.", "James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Hey. Good morning, guys. I'd also say congrats.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Adam.", "Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "I wanted to ask about firstly on M&A. Maybe some updated thoughts on that, you putting your investment grade rating to work.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "First of all, I'd tell you that we are in a \u2013 we are very pleased with the purchases we made over the last 18 months and how they performed, and they performed very well. The M&A market continues to be healthy. We continue to be \u2013 so, it's a huge focus for us. It's something that we pay a lot of attention to. We're very busy with it. Obviously, we can't talk about anything we're working on, but we'll let you know when that happens and when those come \u2013 when those finalize. But it's healthy. We're focused on it and it's a priority for us.", "Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Would you \u2013 are you going to preference either the smaller deals or larger deals at this point in the cycle?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We'll \u2013 I think what we look at and what we concentrate is what fits us both large and small, what are \u2013 is unique synergies to us and making sure that we buy it for the right price and then we integrate it, so it's both.", "Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And then, also as we think about 2017 and the potential for DOT work to benefit from the FAST Act. Is there anything we should be aware of in terms of whether pricing on that work is lower or maybe the incremental margin opportunity on that work is less, maybe just some color on that would be helpful?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think that the impact of DOT spending both state and federal coming to fruition, and shipments will only help pricing.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "And of course, not just \u2013 we'd always encourage you to focus \u2013 you and anybody, not just to focus on pricing, but overall margin performance. And that volume, that mix, that's good for our overall balance of price. The operating efficiencies, product mix, let's just say, we're looking forward to it.", "Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Great. Thank you very much.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Hey. Good morning, guys.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Hey, Timna.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "These should be fairly quick. We've talked about a lot of these topics, but I just wanted to touch on 2017 because some of the independent forecast for non-residential construction have been tapering their enthusiasm into 2017. So is that just maybe excess enthusiasm on their part or is there something that you might be able to help us understand about tapering in 2017 activity, whether that be some of the big projects rolling off or anything else?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Timna, honestly, we haven't given any guidance for 2017. So just with that qualification first, I think where we come back to in case it's helpful is what we see if you will on the ground. And the momentum that we're seeing overall as it relates to private construction and private non-res is \u2013 is largely unchanged. I mean, there are going to be specific geographic markets, for example, Houston, that with layoffs, et cetera, we keep an eye on. But in total, we still like the momentum we see, the breadth of the recovery, the breadth of the end markets, the higher levels of small commercial work that we see. So from our kind of humble on the ground view, the death of non-res has been announced prematurely.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think on the housing piece, the housing recovery still remains pretty modest compared to historical cycles. And most forecasters would expect it to continue to gain steam, so \u2013 and non-res will follow that.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "And the large project pipeline we have seen as it relates to larger industrial projects, still largely unchanged. So, again, we obviously keep a close eye on it. We haven't \u2013 we're ways away from anything that we consider 2017 guidance in our part. But what we do see, and we've talked about more for 2017 also, is just the beginning of the increase in public construction beginning to kick in, strengthening public demand, and we're kind of getting to the point in the cycle where that's beginning to kick in a bit more also.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. The other question is about your high quality problem which is a very low dividend yield. And I understand that you just doubled your dividend, but I was just wondering if you could talk around the way you think about it philosophically, and is there a target yield, is there something that drives the way your board thinks about the dividend or the right level of it?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Sure. I'll start. I think you're right, a high quality problem to have. First, we're focused again on balancing re-investment in the business, investment in growth, including the M&A opportunities that Tom discussed, and ongoing return on capital to shareholders. We think we have the financial flexibility and strength to balance those goals over time. We do not have a target dividend yield.", "And it's really a board decision as to revisit it, of course, periodically. We do think of it in the context of overall return of capital to shareholders and balancing those other objectives very much including growth. But we do not have a target dividend yield. We do expect our payout ratio over time will be roughly consistent with companies of our credit rating and size.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Keith Hughes of SunTrust.", "Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thank you. You don't have any more notes due until 2018, so how would you characterize the use of cash flow the next couple of years between acquisitions, debt pay-down and share repurchase?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "Our capital allocation and cash usage priorities have really remained unchanged from prior communications. So just to briefly echo some of those, one, we have intentionally managed our balance sheet so that we have the kind of flexibility that you just mentioned. We will make the appropriate operating capital investments back in the business to maintain the value of our franchise. We do not expect to need to use cash to pay down debt. Obviously, we don't have maturities due in the near term, but we're comfortable with our current level of debt.", "We will continue to pursue growth opportunities aggressively, whether those are M&A related or, as we mentioned in our release and in our comments, whether they are internally driven growth opportunities, investments in new railyards, new quarry sites, the kind of things that we would do internally. We have several opportunities there.", "We \u2013 to the point the question just asked on the dividend, we would expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with our earnings for a while. We're very focused on the sustainability of that dividend throughout the entire cycle. And then as we said before, we will be opportunistic as we go forward and potentially using share repurchases or other means to return any excess cash to shareholders after those other priorities.", "Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "In acquisitions, would those be in the current footprint, or are you willing to look outside the current footprint for the right opportunity?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "To answer your question, both, and we've done both. Some of our highest returns on capital are the bolt-ons because they complement your existing operations and they defend some of your existing \u2013 the operations. But we'll look outside of our footprint. I mean, we just did that with New Mexico over the last 18 months. But I think would we go outside our footprint, we would want to go in as a number one or number two producer, or a path to be number one or number two. So \u2013 but to answer your question, it's both.", "Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mike Betts with Jefferies.", "Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Thank you very much. I'd like to come back on the cost question please. And looking at the $0.68 per ton saving in Q1, I think that equates to about $27 million. You've kindly explained diesel's saving of $5 million or $6 million, and I think the R&M was an offset of about $3 million. So, I'm still missing a big number there, sort of $24 million, $25 million. Is that all operating leverage because the volume growth was so high or is there anything else there? That's kind of my first question.", "My second question, when we're looking at the full year in terms of costs, you highlighted the trailing 12-month flat cost. Is that a pretty decent assumption to make for the full year? Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think that to start with your first question, I think it's a combination of operating leverages and improved volumes and operating efficiencies on the variable side. So, it's a combination of both of them. There is a lot of volume leverage in that, but it's a combination of the two.", "Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Are there any one-offs in there?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "(50:19).", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think one of the things, timing of stripping, Mike, I would say maybe had some benefit of it that will \u2013 that's always comes in, get some stars, but it's not a whole lot.", "Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Okay.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "And, Mike, for the full-year outlook, we'll see. We're very focused, as Tom mentioned, on continuing to drive these operating efficiencies to control what we can control, to use Tom's words, and to leverage our cost of sales where we can. We'll see how it come out. There are a lot of moving pieces in the business like ours, but it's something we're very, very focused on.", "Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Stanley Elliott with Stifel.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Question back on the cost side, at what point do you start to add more and more shifts, is this kind of more later in this year or into next year, and \u2013 or maybe think about it, can you meet the 9% sort of same-store sales growth on the existing head count maybe running a little bit of over time? Just, how do we think about adding shift work on a go-forward basis?", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, first of all, I wish we were running two shifts everywhere. I'm a little operator guy. And that \u2013 that's \u2013 life is good if that happens. I think that \u2013 but it's on a market-by-market, plant-by-plant basis. So for example, you've got \u2013 if you go to Texas, you've got plants that are running two shifts already. You go to some markets in our some of our Atlanta operations, they're running \u2013 they're not even running full shifts. So, it's such a local business and that is market-by-market. So there's not a broad-based statement. But I don't \u2013 overall, we'll do that a little bit at a time, but we're nowhere close in most markets to adding shifts. It's really adding hours or even adding a full shift on a \u2013 a full shift on a full plant, but we would love to have those problems.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "That's great news.", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "We also, Stanley, back to Mike's point, we're probably getting \u2013 with the breadth of the recovery, we're probably getting to a point where we have enough volume and more of our key facilities to begin to realize a little more operating leverage, leverage and fixed cost. Now, we're long ways away, and Tom, we discussed it from many kind of operating sweet spot, and we're even further away from production capacity. But one of the benefits to us of getting more volume and more places is that it helps on the fixed cost leverage.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. And on the growth CapEx piece, I think it was like $125 million for Savannah and for the ships. I imagine the cost realization is pretty immediate when all this starts to flow through. But how should we think about that? Does that pick up more into next year, or is that even kind of more into \u2013 closer to 2018 when you start to see the cost savings from these investments really start to come through?", "John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer", "I'll break it into two pieces for you. Think about \u2013 of the $275 million of operating and maintenance CapEx, for many of those investments, we begin to see operating efficiencies pretty darn quick if we are improving or right-sizing mobile equipment fleet, if we're replacing screens or otherwise improving our production processes at a plant level. We try and work those as best we can to have pretty quick return periods on those investments.", "For the $125 million, for the course of the year that we may spend on growth-related PP&E, it's really going to depend on the nature of the investment. These aren't long-term payoff things. These aren't things where you invest one year and you get the benefit 10 years down the road. But it's highly variable whether it's a new railyard or incremental reserve capacity at a quarry or whether it's a new ship, so it's hard to say on the growth capital.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "No. Fair enough. Great, guys, and congratulations.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "That's all the time we have for questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks.", "J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.

My name is Sherlon, and I will be the conference call coordinator today. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.", "And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren please begin.", "Mark Warren", "Good morning everyone and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO, and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this Webcast and on our Web site supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide, Tom and John will summarize the highlights. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions.", "With that said please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of Federal, State and Local funding for infrastructure, the highly competitive nature of the construction materials industry, and other risks and uncertainties.

You'll find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?", "Tom Hill", "Thank you, Mark. And thank all of you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call.", "Our business continues to perform very well, even with a slower rate of shipment growth in the second quarter, our margins continued to improve considerably. We remain on track, consistent with our guidance to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. The fundamentals of the business continued to strengthen.", "I'll mention three areas in particular. One, the factors underpinning the continued gradual recovery and demand remains intact, notably, with higher levels of public funding, supporting further growth in 2017 and beyond. Two, our internal execution remains very solid. We're meeting our customers rising needs and we're balancing volumes, pricing and product mix. Our teams are continuing to do an outstanding job converting incremental revenue into profits. And three, the core profitability of the business continues to improve, trading 12-month gross profit per ton in our aggregate segment increased by 31% to $4.77 per ton and adjusted EBIT on a trailing 12-month basis increased 62% to $682 million. So, the foundation for multi-year growth continues to strengthen in demand outlook, in execution and in our core profitability.", "Now, regarding second quarter shipments. I want to reiterate a point made in last quarters earnings call. A single quarter's result doesn't always give a good picture of the underlying volume trends in the business. Now obviously, the 3% growth rate for aggregates shipments in the quarter contrast sharply with the first quarter rate of 17%. Prolonged bad weather in certain markets, large project timing, sales mix and other factors can cause our business results to vary substantially week-to-week and month-to-month. Certainly, we've seen that variability over the last two quarters but the underlying drivers and the basic trends remain unchanged.", "For example, if we pull back to look at just the first half of the year as opposed to looking at two quarters individually, we see that our core aggregates business has posted shipment growth of 9% over the first half of 2016 and pricing growth of 8%. Those results are in line with recent trends and with our plans for the year. I'll comment in more detail on individual geographies during Q&A. But taken as a whole, the bottom line is that we still see our core demand drivers and longer term project pipelines strengthening across our footprint. In fact, we anticipate sustained growth in all end use segments, even though we've yet to see much benefit in terms of shipments from rising public funding.", "We'll see continued recovery in private construction. Public funding will start to pick up in an important way by 2017 and beyond, as states commit to large long-term projects on the strength of the FAST Act and we see a healthy number of large projects that we will serve in the queue for 2017 and 2018.", "Now moving back to the second quarter. Just as a number of factors combined to boost the rate of shipment growth in the first quarter, several factors combined to affect shipments in the second quarter. We saw extremely wet weather in several key markets. At the same time, certain markets experienced a lull in large project starts both public and private. This was despite a healthy pipeline of projects and in retrospect, it's likely that some work was pulled forward into the first quarter.", "As you know, we typically see a fairly high degree of variance in shipment patterns across our individual markets, particularly month-to-month, but I think it's fair to say that the second quarter brought with it a higher than normal degree of variance. The second quarter could be seen as a story of the haves and the have-nots. Virginia, Texas, California, Illinois combined saw aggregate shipments decline by 10% versus the prior year, while the remainder of our states combined grew shipments by 14%. We continue to see strong shipment growth across most of the Southeast where the recovery has really begun to take hold over recent quarters and certain of these states for example, Georgia have put in place higher levels of public funding that will support higher materials demand in 2017 and beyond, even though we haven't seen much of that impact yet.", "For California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, we've seen a mix of weather and large project timing impacting year-over-year shipment rates. All of those specifics vary by State and market. I'd note that California, Texas and Virginia each have healthy longer term growth prospects and what we're experiencing now is more transitional or timing related issues.", "In contrast, we don't currently see a similar path to longer term demand growth in Illinois. Due to that states well known fiscal challenges, although our team there has done a nice job of growing its profits and cash flows. I mentioned the significant fluctuations in shipment rates month-to-month throughout the quarter.", "As you saw in our press release during May, this resulted in daily shipments declining by about 5% from the prior year. On the other hand daily shipments rates in April and June were up approximately 8% and 6% respectively. These kind of fluctuations are not uncommon. All the more reason to avoid extrapolating from short-term volume trends in a business such as ours. Even though these swings in shipments activity at the local level can create some operational challenges, our teams have done a superb job adapting to changing market conditions and consistently meeting our customers' needs. So ultimately I don't find the recent spikes and lulls in demand to be a great concern. It's just the nature of the business.", "Regarding our local teams ability to adapt to changing market conditions, I'm pleased with the way our people are delivering continued profitability gains despite modest overall shipment growth and shifting delivery in production schedules.", "Regarding pricing; our average price freight adjusted selling prices for aggregates in the quarter were up 7% over the prior year, despite some headwinds from geographic and product mix. Meanwhile, our unit costs of sales were flat and unit cash gross profit per ton increased $0.86 or 15% from last year's quarter. Our incremental flow through rate exceeded 80% for the quarter and 75% on a trailing 12-month basis. We also enjoyed healthy margin expansion in our asphalt and our concrete segments, despite low rates of volume growth.", "On a total company basis and excluding the impact of freight and delivery revenues, gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 500 basis points over last year's second quarter. Those are strong results and they aren't one offs. They represent a next step on a long-term path of continuous compounding improvement. We provided additional information regarding our longer term profit improvements and our release and the supplemental slides. So I won't repeat that here.", "Other than to highlight that on a trailing 12-month basis, our gross profit per ton and our core aggregates segment has increased by 87% or $2.22 per ton since the recovery began in 2013.", "Now, before handing it off to John, I'd like to share a few thoughts regarding our expected results for the balance of the year. As I've already noted we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We finished the first quarter trending towards the higher end of that range although we gave some of that back during the second quarter. We continue to expect full year aggregate shipments to exceed 190 million tons, but our ultimate results will depend in large part on three things, just as was the case in the second half of 2015.", "One, on the ability of our customers to catch up on weather delayed work. Two, on the start and completion timing of larger projects, and three, on the number of shipping days allowed by weather conditions particularly in the fourth quarter.", "The demand fundamentals are there and strengthening. The pricing and unit profitability is there. It's on track and it's growing, so then it's really a matter of timing, how we finish will largely depend on how much of the work that is clearly there can be completed by the end of the year before we move into 2017 where demand will only grow.", "Let me sum it up. We saw a strong first half with 9% shipment growth and 8% pricing growth in our core aggregate segmented. Longer term demand fundamentals are in place, pointing towards a strong scenario developing for 2017. In the near-term, we've seen rapid growth across the Southeast but a lull in large project activity in parts of California, Texas and Illinois. We are benefiting from excellent continued improvements to our core profitability, even during a quarter with slower volume growth. The pricing climate remains positive and as was the case last year, we need to make up for some weather delayed volumes in the second half. I'll come back in a moment with some final remarks, but for now let me hand it off to John for a few brief comments regarding our overall cost controls, our balance sheet strength and our capital allocation priorities. John?", "John McPherson", "Thanks, Tom.", "I'd like to start with one more complement to our local teams and their operational performance and cost control discipline throughout the early stage of the cycle. Although we have had and will likely continue to have ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter, the overall cost trend has been impressive. For example, in our core aggregates segment, our unit cost of sales per ton as measured on a trailing 12-month basis, has declined consistently with each reporting period since the recovery began in the second half of 2013.", "So over a three year period, when our average selling price for a ton of aggregates increased by about $1.64, again measured on a trailing 12-month basis, our average unit cost of sales declined by about $0.57. Lower diesel prices have aided these results, but strong daily operating disciplines, effective coordination among local production and sales teams and a commitment to continuous improvement have also played a central role.", "We often talk about how seemingly small improvements compound and add up to a sizeable impact on our business and in this case, our ongoing local operating disciplines have contributed meaningfully to the strong conversion of incremental revenue and to incremental profit that we've reported throughout the recovery so far.", "Unfortunately, we cannot make entirely similar observations regarding our SAG costs, despite the fact that we've held administrative headcount basically flat since the recovery began. As you've seen, second quarter SAG was $13.5 million higher than the prior year. A bit more than half of this increase results from the amount and timing of accruals for performance based incentives and deferred compensation plans. Approximately another quarter of the rise in second quarter SAG resulted from higher salaries and relocation expenses, primarily related to investments in our sales and business development talent and the strategic rotation of sales leadership across geographies.", "We will continue to make strategic investments in our sales talent and capabilities. Those costs and higher incentive accruals will cause run rate SAG costs to be elevated in the near-term, with our full year projection now at $310 million.", "Although we are not fully satisfied with our recent results and trend, we will continue to leverage SAG to sales throughout the recovery and beyond. The investments we're making are sound and ultimately support a higher volume growth at higher margins.", "I'll touch now briefly on our balance sheet strength as the facts have continued to improve but the fundamental story remains unchanged. Our stated goal as you know is to maintain an investment grade credit position throughout the cycle. We have achieved such a position. And of course, our cash flow profile continues to improve. In short, we have the financial strength and flexibility needed to pursue a balanced mix of capital reinvestment, growth investments including M&A, and return of capital to shareholders.", "Finally, I'll note that our weighted average cost of capital has declined significantly since the recovery began, in part due to our improving financial performance and credit position and in part due to our focus on aggregates and the divestiture of our cement and concrete assets from our portfolio.", "Turning now to capital allocation. Our summary message is that our recent and planned activities remain consistent with the priorities you've heard us articulate several times. We do remain active in terms of business development and the pursuit of acquisition opportunities that fit us strategically. And I think it is fair to say that we are aggressive but disciplined. We're looking at a number of opportunities at various stages of development, and again, we have the financial capacity to grow without overly straining our credit position. And we have continued to return additional capital to shareholders via share repurchases. As you know, we have not committed to a specific repurchase target. Instead we will remain opportunistic and seek to balance a return of capital and reinvestment over time.", "And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom. ", "Tom Hill", "Thanks, John.", "Before taking your questions, I'd like to say a few words about my confidence in our company. I've been with this company for over 26 years and I believe our business is stronger and more resilient than it's ever been. We're in the midst of a sustained multi-year recovery. We're enjoying an ongoing recovery in private construction and on top of that, we are just beginning to see a new wave of increased public spending. We'll highlight these demand trends for 2017 and beyond during our aggregates date event on September 29.", "We have an amazing aggregates focused asset base that positions us extremely well to serve the demand growth that is coming. Our core profitability and cash flows are very strong and just keep improving. Our balance sheet is strong. Our financial condition gives us a lot of flexibility to do smart M&A, to reinvest in our operations and to return capital to our shareholders. And our culture at this company is great. Our people are helping each other get better every day and they are upbeat and they are on their game. Our position is frankly an enviable one, especially when viewed against the back drop of uncertain times and I really like our position looking out over the next several years.", "At some point, our country must address the major infrastructure challenges that we still face as a nation. Look, it's good to have a five-year federal highway bill, but we still have a degraded highway system. Major U.S. infrastructure investment must and will occur eventually, whether as a matter of smart proactive economic policy, reactive fiscal stimulus, dire necessity, or some combination of these. We don't assume such a scenario in our longer term outlook, but we will be well positioned to meet that need when it arises.", "In the meantime, we remain very confident in our business and are focused on making a strong franchise even stronger.", "Let me conclude by thanking our outstanding employees for their performance during the quarter and for the work they continue to do every day to deliver another year of very strong results. And thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.", "Now, if the Operator will give the required instructions we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Kathryn Thompson, Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today.", "Tom Hill", "Good morning, Kathryn.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Good morning. First going to focus on more specific states. For Georgia in particular how much of your strength was driven by the new funding initiatives with House Bill 170, new rail lines in Savannah, or just overall improved economic health of the State. Just really helping us to balance because each of those are different types of buckets one being a new business opportunity, one being new funding and one is just day-to-day business.", "Tom Hill", "At this point Kathryn, it's all just organic growth in Georgia. You aren't seeing flow through from the new highway funding. Might see a little bit towards the end of this year, but that's really going to be 2017 and 2018, so that's just really healthy growth in Georgia.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Okay. And nothing really from the new rail line to Savannah?", "Tom Hill", "Not at this point.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Okay. Flipping to two states that were softer, California, Virginia. Virginia we were well aware of some of the wet weather, but specifically addressing those two states, to what degree were volumes impacted by large project delays, wet weather or any other relevant factor we should take into consideration and if you're able to comment on how trends are progressing in each of those states as we go into Q3.", "Tom Hill", "Yes. I think if you're asking me, do we see some kind of change or deceleration in demand growth in these states or -- the answer is no. Both the private side, residential is very healthy, non-res saw a little bit of softening in the second quarter, but the leading indicators in the pipeline very healthy. The public side will only get better. We'll see a little bit of a lull in California while they are responding. But overall, we don't see any deceleration in either one of these states.", "I think that take them one at a time. California very positive. Our strength there is large commercial and highway projects. We saw a lull in that of recent, commercial side some of our customers maybe didn't pick up as much work of late as we would have liked. In Canada, we can do a better job with that. On the highway side, we'll see a little bit of a short-term decrease in funding because of gas price, lower gas prices, but that's got to rectify itself. California is rated the worst roads in the U.S. There's a number of bills in the State government for funding from roughly $3.5 billion -- increase of $3.5 billion up to $7 billion. And then there's I think around more than 10 measures that are on the ballot for November for local and county work that would total roughly an increase -- annual increase of about $2 billion. So overall, California is going to be fine.", "Virginia as you said we saw extreme weather and also had a little bit of timing with projects we had two big projects last year the midtown tunnel and a large wind farm that was going. We had one pushback this year the Fairfield marine terminal. But, just to give you a little flavor around that. If you took three large jobs that are coming I66 in Northern Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay bridge job, and the Fairfield marine which I just mentioned, that would be -- put those jobs together you're going to be around 7 million tons. So demand in Virginia will continue to grow.", "John McPherson", "And Kathryn, it's John. Just to put a little more color on the four states we called out and just to give you support, and again, to echo Tom's point, we do not see any cyclical change here in these states or across our portfolio. Really the only one if you back up and take a trailing 12-month look that's down on volume for us is Illinois. And we've talked about Illinois before that's just a bit of a different fiscal picture rolling over some large projects that we didn't have this year that we did have last year. That's the one place the demand growth outlook just isn't as clear. Everything else that we're calling out is primarily a timing issue. It's weather related, it's pulling work forward into the first quarter, or it's just how large projects get started and they flow through the pipeline so Illinois is a little bit different but everywhere else is basically on the same track that its been.", "Kathryn Thompson", "And Illinois, how should we think about modeling Illinois not just for the next quarter, but for 2016 and what's your view going forward and how we should think about modeling Illinois volume? Is it a situation where we should expect a decline or flat, any color would be helpful? Thank you.", "Tom Hill", "We probably expect in Illinois and I'll make sure we follow-up on this with you. But, just to give you a sense, I'd expect flat to kind of low single digit growth from where we are today. Going forward, so it's not rapid decline, it's just not the same kind of growth on the shipment side. Now the other thing we call out in these states, California, Texas, Virginia, Illinois of note is the businesses are still strong, so don't take near-term volume challenges as fundamental business challenges. I mean just to give you a sense, those four states had pricing growth over the last 12 months in the double digits.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Okay.", "Tom Hill", "They had improvement in cash margin per ton over the last 12 months over 20%. And so the businesses are good and sound. It's just a question of project timing and flow. Virginia for example, was up strongly in volume in the first quarter over 20%. So we probably pulled some work forward there. We call it Illinois because it's the one place we just don't see the same kind of longer term robust growth that we see in rest of our portfolio.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Okay, great. And final question for me today. You talked about mix and geographic mix having an impact on average pricing in the quarter. Are you able to give a little bit more granularity of which was a greater factor in the quarter? Thank you.", "Tom Hill", "I think it was a combination of the two. We saw shipments get impacted in coastal Texas with weather, extreme weather and some timing of projects, it's healthy pricing, so that was geographic. And then, you saw some substantial base jobs and shot rock jobs particularly in Florida, so you put all those together was just under a percent.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "Tom Hill", "Good morning.", "John McPherson", "Hi, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich", "I'm wondering if you could just say more about what you saw demand by end-market across your footprint sounds like private non-res may have slowed, can you just flush that out for us either based on shipments in the quarter or based on indications that you're hearing from your customers? Thanks.", "Tom Hill", "Yes. I think what we've seen is the growth in recent activities weakened just a little bit. Longer term our backlogs are growing, the pipeline has strengthened, employment levels and other factors point to sustained growth and at any given time that activity at different geographies will vary pretty widely. But, if you look at the leading indicators, the Dodge Momentum Index, ABI, they point to renewed pace of growth in 2017 and beyond. And then just simple fact that you've got single-family construction growing at the pace it's growing will pull non-res up and that we'll see that coming.", "Jerry Revich", "Okay.", "Tom Hill", "Our shipments to private non-res work in the quarter were still pretty healthy. So they can vary market-to-market. But I think we've all probably called the death of non-res spending prematurely several times now. Even if we see a little bit of weakness in near-term start indicators with our customers, and then, the data we look at we're seeing just as much if not more strength in the longer term pipelines. We still see growth across all of the India segments we are talking about.", "With the one thing that surprised us being slow kind of jumps out is really public infrastructure spending. So again, the outlook there is strong, but we haven't seen as much in public infrastructure as we would expect it so far this year giving all the fundamentals, all of the fundamentals are there, but the spending really hasn't been quite where we thought it would have been.", "Jerry Revich", "And John, Tom, can you say more about that last point? Is it an issue of timing in terms of some bigger jobs getting started or getting the bidding process done, what are you seeing as driving that delay and how broad based is it?", "John McPherson", "On the infrastructure piece, it's really just now you're starting to see the big capital projects, water, airports those kind of projects. If you look at tax receipts in our markets they are at or near all-time highs. So it's going to happen. It's just a matter of timing and I think the local governments making the decision to go forward with the capital projects. But you'll see that come on in 2017 and probably more in 2018.", "Jerry Revich", "Okay.", "John McPherson", "And it's a little bit of -- I'm going to call it a little bit of conjecture from us Jerry. But, we at least hear some comments about just I'm going to call it overall election cycle uncertainty, putting some near term breaks, some public infrastructure spending in some places. But again, as Tom said some of the spending on things like sewers and water infrastructure is not even really discretionary if you're going to build as much new residential, as we are building you are going to have to build new water. So it's really a question of timing in our view, but its one area that so far in 2016 we haven't seen the kind of growth we would have expected.", "Jerry Revich", "Okay. And lastly, I'm wondering if you can comment on how volumes and pricing looked in July, so May obviously stands out as a month of downside in the quarter. Can you just give us some context on how July looked?", "John McPherson", "Well, Jerry I'll jump in and say as the CFO that we can't comment on the third quarter yet. But in the spirit of that question, I guess one thing I'd note is, if May had had the same kind of shipping rate trends that we had seen in June and April, you would probably have a very different feel to this call and results. We wouldn't be asking some of these questions. So as Tom said it's not uncommon to have some variability in shipping rates week-to-week, month-to-month in a business it's all outdoors. But again, we haven't seen anything from our view that would indicate any kind of deceleration or anything that would take us off long-term trend. This is still a business with solid outlook for 2016, strengthening visibility for 2017 and in our view multiple years of growth ahead of us.", "Jerry Revich", "All right. Thank you.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Wetenhall, RBC Capital Markets.", "Bob Wetenhall", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to -- and maybe this is for John. You guys had commented on your last conference call that the high-end of the range for capital spending would be around $400 million this year and I think you're about running at $200 million. And what are your expectations? Are you going to still keep up with that $400 million number or given what you're seeing in the market are you going to tap the brakes a little bit?", "John McPherson", "I think Bob, we'll keep up with that number. But let me give you a couple of important reminders. Our core CapEx spending as a portion of that $400 million is about $ 275 million. So think about that as core operating maintenance capital. And then there's another $125 million in that number that's essentially growth capital. Non-M&A growth capital.", "So our CapEx outlook both now and through the balance of the recovery remains unchanged. We have not seen anything in the marketplace conditions and I'd underscore this that would cause us to put brakes on our own capital spending or on our pursuit of M&A. Again, our view on the business and its outlook if anything is probably strengthening, so nothing from a external market condition point of view that would cause us to adjust our capital spending.", "Bob Wetenhall", "Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you. And one question on profitability. Your gross margin expansion was pretty tremendous at 500 basis points and that came in ahead of what we were anticipating and I wanted to understand what were the drivers of that? Was it more about getting favorable pricing as obviously a huge tailwind for that, but how much was also operating leverage and what kind of relief did you get from lower costs for diesel fuel?", "John McPherson", "Yes, Bob, obviously we had healthy price in the quarter and that will continue. But I thought our folks did a really nice job with their operating costs particularly with a little bit lower volumes and they continue to not only leverage the volume, but also just improve on the key operating efficiencies and disciplines that drive the profitability of the business. So it was a combination of the two. To answer your question on diesel, total diesel was an impact of about $7 million.", "Bob Wetenhall", "Got it. Okay. And just one final. I think you guys doubled your spend on share buybacks for the quarter from $23 million in the first quarter to $46 million. Any thoughts as you look out into the back half of the year about share buyback activity and what's left under the authorization? Thanks and good luck.", "John McPherson", "Thanks, Bob. I think we have over 2 million shares left on the authorization. So I think that it's not a question of authorization. Our path on share repurchase I would call unchanged as we've said before, we'll continue to return excess cash to shareholders at this point in the cycle primarily through share repurchase, we'll remain opportunistic in doing so as opposed to give any particular commitment to a certain level of repurchase activity in advance. But again, our basic approach to capital allocation remains unchanged and as such, we may continue to repurchase shares as another way to return capital to shareholders.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens.", "Trey Grooms", "Hi, good morning.", "Tom Hill", "Good morning, Trey.", "Trey Grooms", "Couple of questions on kind of getting back to the lull in the large projects that you guys mentioned. I know you touched on some of the public stuff, but you also mentioned that there was some private projects there. And then also, May being the weaker month in the quarter, I'm guessing weather played a big role there that you highlighted. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is that the timing of when these projects that were either pushed to the right or what have you when those could come through. I mean, is that a third quarter event or fourth quarter would they be more like into 2017? How do we think about the timing?", "Tom Hill", "Well, I think it will be all over the place obviously with large projects. Let me give you kind of a little bit of a view on some large projects and put a little flavor on that. So if you look at Virginia for example, I mentioned Northern Virginia, the Route 66 projects will be probably 6 million tons, I85 and that job actually will go in 2017, I85 in Southern Virginia is over 800,000 tons, but you'll see some of that in 2016, but a lot has got pushed into 2017. And in North Carolina, the I85 widening it's probably 1.2 million tons and those will see a little bit of that in 2016, but a -- majority of it in 2017 and the Northwest Corridor in Atlanta is 1.5 million and that's the widening of I75 and it's a 1.5 million tons and that will probably do a little more, we will probably get 700,000, 600,000 tons in 2016.", "So it will be all over the place. And again, as John said earlier, it's going to be a matter of timing. The good news is the contractors and our customers want to get the work done, they are going to press to get it done because they have visibility and know what's coming in 2017, and so they've got to get this off their books so they can free their crews up and go on to other projects. So the desires there, it's just a matter of, will they have the crews in the fourth quarter, will the weather allow them to do it.", "Trey Grooms", "Right. So kind of with that, I'm just trying to get a feel for how we should be thinking about the quarterly cadence kind of looking into the back half. Third Quarter or Q3 obviously faces a tougher comp, but it's also generally a seasonally stronger quarter for you guys and then with kind of the back drop of weather and how things have moved around, anything unique about the seasonal cadence or your expectation there as we look in the back half?", "Tom Hill", "I don't think there's anything unique about it except for very similar to last year. I would underscore what I just said about the contracts and desire to get it done. They are pressed even more in 2016 than they were in 2015 to get this work done because there's so much work coming for 2017. You'll see both on the commercial side and highway side, so desires there and the third quarter is always healthy, but depending on weather the fourth quarter could be great too. We'll decide to just wait and see.", "Trey Grooms", "Got it. And then, last one for me and John, I mean, you guys in the whole team impressive incrementals and gross profit per ton. And I think last quarter you said that you expect to see incrementals for this year a little higher than the longer term kind of 60% target. And with half the year behind us now and the current cost environment, can you update us on your thoughts there?", "John McPherson", "Sure, Terry. I think we still say 60% is our long-term as in through the entire recovery and expansion cycle number but that's a multi-year view. We've obviously been doing better than that of late, sometimes substantially better. I think for the balance of the year, I'm not sure we see a much different trajectory than we've been on so far this year in terms of incrementals. Some of that in a very short period of time if you took an individual month or maybe an individual quarter can be influenced by the mix of price and volume in our growth. But overall, our team has continued to do a great job.", "Again, I come back to something Tom said in his remarks. The work is there. The demand is there. Importantly Terry to your question, the profitability is there, core profitability in our business maybe running a little ahead of our plan. And so we come down to for 2016 is really a question of timing of the shipments and how much gets done this year versus next. But again, the work is there, the demand is there and importantly the profitability is there and we see that trend continuing.", "Trey Grooms", "Great. That's it for me. Thanks a lot.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Garik Shmois, Longbow Research.", "Garik Shmois", "Hi, thank you. First question is, just you talked about the weakness in Illinois sounds like there's a fundamental change perhaps when you think about that market. Could you just speak to perhaps the importance of that market strategically. And then just broadly what you're seeing and what your appetite is for either acquisitions or divestments at this point in the cycle?", "Tom Hill", "First of all, as John said, you've got a lot of well known funding and budget issues, although they did reaffirm the highway spending in Illinois on one hand the positive and they also cut the toll way spending in half, which will cost us about $700 million in the State for next year. I think the positive side of that is you're still seeing growth on the private side. And as John said, this is a very good business for us and we have a very, very strong market position and our teams up there have done a great job of improving their unit margins even with some falling volume.", "Some of that volume Garik is, we were at two very large jobs one at O'Hare and one the toll way that we were working on last year and we're starting to wind down so some of that's just again timing of projects. But overall, it's a strong market for us and an important market and one that I think our folks have done a nice job improving.", "Garik Shmois", "Okay. And could you touch on just second part of the question with respect to M&A at this point in the cycle, what are you seeing out there as far as valuations are concerned, what's your appetite for additional deals and how do you balance that relative to your capital structure?", "Tom Hill", "They're still out there. We've got a number of them as John said in his comments that we're working on, when they will close is always, each one separate, each one is timing. But you always have to be disciplined about what you're buying and what you are paying and what the unique synergies that we have for Vulcan are and how do we leverage those so it's there. We're hot on that trail and we've got a number of them in the pipeline.", "John McPherson", "And only thing we would add to your question, which I think we also addressed in our comments is, if anything we're pushing harder on opportunities particularly those that fit us strategically. We're going to stay disciplined on valuations obviously but we've worked hard to be in a position where we now have the financial capacity to really do good deals where they exist, to make the right ongoing capital investments in our business and to return some capital to shareholders so we can balance all those things and we will certainly have the financial flexibility to pursue M&A of that growth. All that said we're going to stay really disciplined about it.", "Garik Shmois", "Okay. Thanks just want to shift as my follow-up question to the coastal markets in Texas clearly weather impacted demand in May in particular. Are you seeing anything fundamentally changing or decelerating along the coast? If so, how does that impact the productivity out of your Cancun quarry, and then, also would there be anything for us to think about over the maybe in the medium term if there is deceleration in the coastal markets in Texas around price mix given it was a headwind in the quarter?", "Tom Hall", "I think that the story as you said in Texas was the coastal piece of it. Weather was a big impact. Let's face it coastal Texas was under water for more than a month and so that impacted. We also had as John says timing of large projects we have the grand parkway and some big energy projects we are working on last year. We've worked some of that work off, there's still some in the pipeline, golden pass, Beaumont LNG, so you'll see that come -- some of those tons come back next year.", "It's hard to tell what's going on in res and non-res with the weather pattern we had in the second quarter, probably some softening in Houston. But behind that, you've got huge increases in highway spending that we've seen some of that in 2015 and 2016 but you're going to see more of that in 2017 and 2018 and 2019.", "And nothing Garik was already summed up, the visibility is not great because the weather is so bad, in a quarter where you have volumes drop to 30% in one market, it's hard to get a lot of visibility with that kind of drop. But as you look at it, you've got strengthening public spending that should offset potentially some weakening private spending. We haven't seen that weakening elsewhere in Texas yet by the way. The little bit we've seen around Houston we've not seen spread to the rest of Texas.", "And finally your question about price impact or impact on logistics out of our quarry in Mexico, I don't think anything I'd call material anyway-- ", "Tom Hall", "Well, I think you have to remember the quarter in Mexico we shipped to some 17-18 port facilities all the way around from Brownsville all the way around to Jacksonville, Florida. So where you might have some temporary softening and timing of projects on the coast of Texas, you've got the Southeastern Florida and those markets picking up substantially. So there's a lot of flexibility in that overall business. And we think we're fine with it.", "John McPherson", "And again on pricing, which is just really a mixed issue not a fundamental underlying price issue. I don't think we would expect these kind of declines we saw in the second quarter and future quarters. So I don't see anything that I would try and model in on pricing.", "Garik Shmois", "Okay. Makes sense. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Timna Tanners, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Timna Tanners", "Hey, good morning guys. ", "Tom Hall", "Good morning.", "Timna Tanners", "So I was curious about your comment on the election year having a numbing effect or people whatever you said maybe on the local side. And just wanted to get a sense of, if you could characterize the political sentiment you're getting from you're canvassing of Washington in light of kind of the positive spirit of dialogue lately on public infrastructure spending.", "Tom Hall", "I think the good news there is everybody is talking about it. Both Presidential candidates, who got a number of people in Washington concerned about the countries infrastructure. They all know it's an issue. And they also understand that it is stimulus if we do it correctly. So like I said we have a five year bill, but we still have degraded highway system and that bill is not going to improve that grade. So it is an issue and now what's going to happen we don't know, we know what's going to happen with the election, but it is an important issue in one that people are putting out there in front of everyone.", "John McPherson", "And Timna, it's John because I may have made the comments just to add to that. And my comments weren't reflective on the nature of the dialogue around future infrastructure spending which we actually as Tom said is quite positive at a federal level, State level and local level across many of our geographies. It's more just a negative tone and some degree of uncertainty that would seem to affect private investment levels. And you'll know more about this than us but you may have seen some of that in second quarter GDP data. And we probably have some customers who on balance just given negative tone out there particularly on the private side are a little more reluctant than they would be in a different time to add their own additional capacity to make their own big capital investments whether that's a new equipment or land for development or larger staffs.", "So I wouldn't want to make it too big a deal. What's interesting though is, just this disconnect between the tone you're going to hear in the middle of an election cycle which is really negative and what we see in our own business which frankly is pretty positive but nothing longer term, the dialogue around higher levels of public infrastructure spending particularly on road infrastructure and other infrastructure we are pretty excited about.", "Timna Tanners", "Okay. And then to wrap up with a couple other thematic questions. So are you seeing much for small on labor constraints that we've been hearing about on construction? Is that an issue at all for you? Second of all, how good is your visibility relative to normal levels in light of that kind of more cautious sentiment?", "Tom Hall", "I think that the first of all the labor issue, yes, we're seeing shortages with our customers whether it's ready mix truck drivers or finishers or carpenters on residential. So there are constraints -- there are labor constraints out there. And it is a bottleneck for our customers and therefore for us. I think they are working through it. We've been on this theme for now about a year and that's actually good news because it means it's growing and it's growing faster than they can fill the ranks and the work isn't going to go anywhere it's a matter of getting enough timing.", "John McPherson", "And on your question about normal, it wouldn't change our view of normal, but as we've discussed many times before, these bottlenecks whether they are labor or others that some of our customers face, they probably do constrain on the margin, the rate of growth or the rate of recovery keeping us for now in the 7%, 8%, 9% rate as opposed to something that the underlying demand would justify being higher. Flip side is that it can create a generally positive pricing climate but it may make for a longer recovery at a slightly slower rate like that 7%, 8%, 9% rate as opposed to something that would get up into the sustained double digits for a very long period of time.", "Timna Tanners", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Stanley Elliott, Stifel.", "Stanley Elliott", "Hi, guys. Thank you for fitting me in. A quick question on the outlook for costs -- the unit costs on the aggregate side. Obviously, the incrementals are going to be strong this year. Diesel has been a bit of a tailwind. How much longer can diesel realistically, be a tailwind for you guys and then maybe speak to some of the investments that you're making either on the sales side or on the production side to help us keep these incrementals as strong as they are or at least tracking above your historical average.", "Tom Hall", "As you look out towards the second half of the year and the price of diesel last year versus the price of diesel this year is probably not going to be a big cost advantage going forward. I think that -- as I said earlier, I think our folks are doing a really good job of concentrating on our own operating efficiencies that we can control. Volumes are coming back, can help that. So I feel pretty good about our cost and our ability to take incremental revenues to the bottom line.", "As far as capital projects, they are all over the place. Some is as simple as replacement of mobile equipment, screens and crushers, usually when you do plant capitalist a combination of both replacement and process improvement to get more throughput or reduce down time, which helps on your cost obviously other than just like-for-like replacement.", "On the growth side, we've got a number of facilities who are working on our distribution network both rail and blue water that were all of them are different stages of completion and then we've got a number of greenfield projects that we're working on at different stages in completion.", "John McPherson", "Only additional color I would add is while we may not have the same tailwinds from diesel moving forward we should be beginning to work out of a period where we had elevator repair maintenance costs kind of earlier in the recovery. So we're hopeful those trends will offset each other a little bit some more work to do there.", "And just a reminder we've got a lot of fixed costs yet to leverage in this recovery. So as Tom said we're pretty proud of what our teams did and particularly as an example in a quarter without much volume growth and still with very uneven production schedules due to weather challenges to control your costs in a quarter like the one we just finished, is a good sign of the right disciplines, so we have a pretty positive outlook about our margin performance looking forward.", "Stanley Elliott", "Absolutely I agree. And just a reminder, when do the new ships come on line? Is there anyway to talk about either improved efficiency or cost savings or anything along those lines around the ten new vessels? ", "Tom Hall", "Yes. They will come on line at different stages next year. And they will both be more efficient both particularly in fuel also they have less draft and more tonnage capacity. So we'll see improvements cost wise with those ships as they come on line and we'll be excited to get those.", "John McPherson", "Probably a little early to talk about it specifically though. That may be something more a 2017 item probably a little too early to talk about it specifically but they are good investments.", "Stanley Elliott", "That sounds fair. And then, lastly on the M&A side, obviously, plenty of flexibility within the capital structure, are you thinking more on the bolt-on side or there new markets you'd be interested in entering, how should we think about that from a footprint perspective?", "Tom Hall", "Both, primarily bolt-on. I mean those are some of our best returns and it proves out the efficiencies in the overall franchise, but and it's healthy, so and then as far as new markets we did that 18 months ago in New Mexico and where we have a path to number one or number two position, we'll look at new places and if not we probably won't.", "Stanley Elliott", "Is it still fair to say mostly aggregate focused and potentially some downstream assets but certainly not the primary focus?", "Tom Hall", "You said it well. We like aggregates.", "Stanley Elliott", "Perfect guys. Thanks very much and best of luck.", "Tom Hall", "Thank you.", "John McPherson", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robert Norfleet, Alembic Global Advisors.", "Nick Chen", "Hi. This is Nick Chen for Rob. Thanks for taking our question this afternoon. You guys touched on a little bit earlier just discussing California, but I was hoping you could opine a bit on just some of the State level funding bills that you guys are tracking and sort of where you expect them to have the biggest impact going forward?", "Tom Hall", "Sure. I talked about California. They were going to lose a little bit of funding but there are a number of three bills in particular that would add between $3 billion and $7 billion. And they have to address their roads, and then, the local impact, which is in total if they all pass would be $2 billion a year. So Texas is one of the fastest growing highway markets. We saw a 30 in our markets in Texas in just the highway lengths alone. In 2016, we'll see an improvement of over 30%, state is a whole improvement of over 20% and a lot of that will really actually go in 2017. And then you'll have improved funding again in both 2017 and 2018. That will go up about 15% or 20% in 2017, and then, there's another over $2 billion that comes on to Texas in 2018.", "Georgia basically doubled their highway funding that passed a year ago and we'll see a little bit of that in 2016 as I said earlier majority will come in 2017 and 2018. North Carolina has improved their funding as has Florida, as has South Carolina, as has Virginia. There are bills being discussed in Alabama and probably won't be addressed until 2017.", "I'd tell you a similar story in Tennessee where it needs to be addressed, they have not, it won't happen in 2016, hopefully will happen in 2017. So as I said, a lot of our states have marked improvement in funding and the vast majority of that except for Texas will flow through in 2017 and 2018. So we're really looking forward to this. And this was a real bright part of our future.", "Nick Chen", "That's really helpful. Thanks so much.", "Tom Hall", "You bet.", "Operator", "We'll go to Brent Thielman, D.A. Davidson.", "Brent Thielman", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Tom Hall", "Good morning.", "Brent Thielman", "Is there a way to think about the moving pieces of these various issues in May in terms of the impact you reported average price for the quarter?", "Tom Hall", "I think the average price as I said earlier was healthy in spite of some geographic and product mix issue, probably one of the bigger impacts in the quarter was on that was -- just the mix issue was coastal Texas as John said volumes were down 30%. It's a very -- it has healthy pricing and so that had a little bit of an impact. But overall, the environment for pricing across our footprint remains healthy, it's strong, throughout the entire construction segment pricing is moving up and that's driven by demand increases and is also driven by the visibility of what everybody sees coming in 2017 and 2018.", "JohnMcPherson", "Just giving little more color if it helps, I think our average selling prices, if you take all of the moving pieces and adjust as best you can on a like-for-like basis probably would have been $0.03 or $0.04 higher than what we reported. Again, a lot of that is having a big decline in coastal Texas. Now at the same time that's accounting for some of our South Eastern markets which have good pricing too growing pretty quickly. So on a total like-for-like basis, when you look at geographic issues and the product mix issues, our rate of price growth year-over-year would have been a little closer to eight than what we reported. But I wouldn't let any of that distract you from what Tom said which is the core pricing outlook and climate remains positive given where we are in the recovery.", "And I'd also just remind you prices went up pretty healthy in those very same markets that were volume challenged, so Virginia, Illinois, California, Texas those are all markets that have had good pricing and margin improvement not just in this quarter but for the last few quarters.", "Brent Thielman", "Okay. That's helpful. And then you've talked about the variability and timing of all of these large projects in terms of volumes. When we think about your outlook for potential volume for the year and kind of the company overall, is it more heavily impacted by larger projects than what we would typically see?", "Tom Hall", "No. I don't think it's more. I think this is just a piece of it. So part of it is going to be the large projects. As we said earlier part of it just across the entire market segments is going to be, can the contractors and can our customers get the work done in the time that they have. So we talked about labor shortages, you have those and those are an issue so it's about both timing of large projects, our customers ability to get work out. And then how many days do we have of construction in the fourth quarter. All that will go together to really see how the year turns out. But I'll remind you this is exactly what we saw in 2015.", "Brent Thielman", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jim Margard, Rainier Investment Management.", "Jim Margard", "Hi. Thank you. Could you comment a little bit more on the mix as you mentioned, the Texas coastal situation was impactful and presumably that mix will turn more favorable so simply by virtue of that. But could you elaborate a little bit more going into the future and also were there any other mix issues other than coastal Texas and as you go more into your bigger infrastructure build, in 2017 and 2018 what are the implications for the mix in that?", "Tom Hall", "Well, first of all, in the quarter, pricing was a combination of the mix impact was both geographic which was Texas and then mix. So we had some large base work in the southeast and we also had large shot rock projects in Florida. And while they may have an impact on price it has a overall positive impact on profitability because you've got to sell those mix of products and some of them are cheaper to make. And so the price of the margins while the price maybe lower the margin is very healthy and you need to sell the full product line to maximize profitability in our operations.", "On your question about highway construction and coming highway construction, that really plays into our hand in that -- it is a really healthy mix of what our plants produce. It has a combination of base and fines because it's new construction and it has asphalt rock, it has concrete rock, so it gives the full flavor of everything we produce and just pushes the overall profitability up.", "John McPherson", "And when you think about it geographically, we really like the -- particularly -- well, we like it now, we like it longer term, the breadth and positioning of our particular geographic mix. These trends we're seeing and where we see the growth and the nature of the increased public spending we commented on earlier. If anything these should give us tailwinds from a geographic mix point of view. We're well positioned against where the growth is coming.", "Tom Hall", "Over and beyond that on aggregates it also fits into our hand with our asphalt business. So we have very strong positions in a number of states with asphalt, which is a lot more public driven, so all of the spending on highways will help that business.", "Jim Margard", "Great. Thank you.", "Tom Hall", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "At this time, we'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Tom Hill for closing remarks.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials and we look forward to talking to you this quarter and over the balance of the year. And I would like to thank our employees for all of their hard work and the things they do to make this company great. Thanks.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Analysts", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Laura and I will be your conference coordinator today. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. Additionally, today's call is being recorded.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.", "Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide, we will focus on the highlights. We hope this approach will provide more time to respond to your questions.", "With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports including our earnings release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.", "Additionally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you, Mark. Thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll keep our remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Aggregates Day event in Atlanta.", "Looking at the third quarter and our recent performance, four main points stand out. First, we obviously saw shipments declined in the third quarter. However, to my second point, we see it as localized, not cyclical. Third, our profitability continues to grow. And fourth, our prospects for sustained growth remain very exciting.", "Let me address each in just a little more detail. First, we obviously have seen a drop in year-over-year shipments. This is due in part to a period of relative weakness and new construction starts across much of our footprint. It's also due to weather and other location-specific factors, impacting our business in California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois. Third quarter year-over-year shipments in these four states were down 15% collectively.", "Now in stark contrast, our other markets experienced combined year-over-year shipment growth of 6%, and in fact, several markets saw strong double-digit growth to the order of 12% to 21%. Second and importantly, we continue to view these volume headwinds as temporary or a transitional lull in a multiyear recovery that is still intact and sound and actually with a long way to run.", "To this point, the variation in results across our footprint reveals volume challenges that are clearly localized rather than cyclical. Notably, our daily aggregate shipment rate increased from August to September and from September to October with October exceeding the prior year period by about 3%.", "In addition, according to Dodge reports, trailing 12-month construction starts showed sequential improvements in both August and September, picking up from a noticeable slowdown in March that lingered all the way through July. In short, the fundamental foundational drivers of a multiyear recovery remain firmly in place.", "To point number three. Our core profit engine remains very powerful. We're on track to deliver $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year, and this is despite volumes that are below our original expectations. In our aggregates segment, third quarter freight-adjusted selling prices were 7% ahead of third quarter 2015, and gross profit per ton rose 9%. For the 12 months ended in September, gross profit per ton has increased 25%. The flow through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue into incremental gross profit has exceeded 80%.", "Also for the 12 months ended September, the total business delivered net earnings of $371 million and $981 million of adjusted EBITDA with an adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 27%. This is an improvement of 430 basis points over the prior year.", "Fourth and finally, we remain excited about our long range growth prospects. We are well on track to achieve our profitability goals. And near-term, we like the volume, pricing and profitability momentum we see for 2017. We also like the very robust pipeline of projects that we see building for 2018 and 2019.", "Now John will share a few thoughts regarding our current momentum and outlook in a minute, but first I'll offer a bit more insight into how our business has been performing across our footprint. As we discussed during our Aggregates Day in Atlanta, the recent demand climate has made it a little hard to distinguish the signal from the noise.", "For example, there has been clear accelerating growth in the longer-term project pipeline. The impact of the federal highway bill, the FAST Act, and higher state level funding are beginning to show up in the mix. At the same time, there has been a softening in the rate at which this water behind the dam has been released in the form of construction starts.", "There was also a lull in state highway spending during the first half of the year and this was as states work their way through the remainder of a fiscal year that did not include new FAST Act points (07:06). Notably, this has now started to turn in a positive direction. The latest OTMA (07:15) report on highway contract awards shows them increasing by 30% in September. And this is the second consecutive month of growth following weak contract award activity during the first half of the year.", "Looking closely, this isn't too surprising as many states have entered a new fiscal year with the FAST Act money flowing into their pipelines and a backlog of projects ready to go.", "During the slowdown period early this year, a number of markets saw adverse weather conditions, shortages in skilled labor and other factors that have constrained the rate at which existing construction projects could be completed. A number of our customers have found it difficult to catch up in the near-term on work deferred due to bad weather earlier in the year.", "Generally speaking, our operations across the Southeast and mid-Atlantic states continue to post solid gains in volumes despite these challenges. Florida, Georgia and North Carolina enjoyed robust double-digit volume growth to the tune of 12% to 21%, and this was accompanied by strong pricing and unit margin performance. Now Virginia on the other hand is an example of a market where we're seeing good pricing momentum, although volume momentum hasn't picked up yet.", "Turning to Texas and California. Shipment levels in these states remain challenged in the third quarter. This was below the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Shipments in Texas were down 21% in the quarter. This was driven in part by Coastal Texas shipments which were down 27%. All of Texas was impacted by bad weather throughout the quarter, most notably in August. Business in North and South Texas fell off accordingly from what would otherwise have been a much stronger performance in those areas. Houston and the Coast, however, in addition to the well-known downturn in the oil and gas industry and extensive flooding also experienced a delay in TxDOT work.", "So, when we talk about Texas and volume declines, it is, in fact, largely isolated to the coastal area of the state, separating out statewide weather impacts. But despite a transitory period of volume headwinds, there is ongoing pricing momentum in Texas and it simply highlights the underlying confidence and continued growth in the Lone Star State. At the same time, our core profitability, which has also been strong, keeps improving. The bottom line is that, overall, we expect continued recovery in Texas market.", "In California, shipments were down 17% from last year's quarter. We continue to see a slowdown in large project work in public and private sectors. This is work we are well positioned to serve. Caltrans also continued to grapple with highway funding related to diminished excise taxes. This created a bigger slowdown in project work than anticipated. We have reason to believe that political leaders will ultimately reach agreement on new state funding measures for California roads, which are rated the worst in the U.S.", "Putting it all together, we expect to see a return in 2017 to a pattern of recovery and growth in California. Our sales force is aligned to take advantage of these growth opportunities. Large projects are getting back on track. The pipeline of major projects continues to get bigger and bigger. Construction starts are back on the upswing and there will ultimately be improvements in state funding for roads along with local highway improvement initiatives.", "In fact, we're already seeing early signs of improvement. Highway contract awards in California were up 98% in September as these new FAST Act funds are starting to flow into the system. Underlying these facts are fundamental strengths. In our California business as well as Texas, our core profitability continues to improve. And in California, as in Texas, despite the lull in shipments, pricing has remained strong, in the high single-digits, underscoring the basic confidence in the trajectory of California markets.", "Across our company, our focus on core profit improvements, the little things that make us better every day, is keeping us on track towards our longer-term goals and you see it in our results.", "Now I'll hand it over to John for some brief additional comments regarding our outlook for 2016 and the momentum we see heading into 2017.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everybody. I'd like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in Atlanta.", "First, and as Tom noted, we continue to project $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2016. And due to continued gains in unit profitability and overall margins, we think we can reach the low end of our beginning-of-year guidance range despite shipments falling well below our original forecast.", "Now, to put this outlook into some context, let's take a look at results and trends, particularly with respect to our improved profitability over the trailing 12 months. As you heard Tom say and as you've seen in our release, during that period, we generated net earnings of $371 million and adjusted EBITDA of $981 million. But behind that, it's important to note that our average freight-adjusted selling prices in our aggregates segment have increased 8% over that time. Our average gross profit per ton has increased 25% over that time, and our overall gross profit as a percent of freight-adjusted revenue for the company has risen from 34% to 39%.", "As we consistently call out, fourth quarter results can be impacted significantly by weather and the effective length of the construction season and our strong results from Q4 of 2015 present tough comparisons. But our improved core profitability should be sufficient to allow us to reach our stated goals for 2016 if recent shipment momentum holds up through the quarter.", "Now turning to 2017. I'll begin by reiterating that it remains too early for us to give specific or firm guidance. We're primarily focused on finishing the current year strong and we're just at the beginning of our internal planning cycle for next year. But from what we can see today, from the data we see today, we expect continued volume recovery in 2017 along with further improvements in pricing and overall margins. In other words, continued progress on track with the longer range goals we've outlined previously.", "With respect to volumes, and again, we're not yet in a position to share specific numbers, we currently expect growth in each of our primary end use segments next year, residential, private non-res, highways and other public infrastructure. And we also expect to see broad-based growth across our geographic footprint and growth in substantially all of our key market areas.", "We've noted that construction start data points have recently turned back up after several months of softening. And highway contract awards in our key states have also turned up recently. And on top of that, longer-term project pipelines continue to strengthen from our already strong levels. But the relative start weakness we've experienced earlier this year combined with strong first quarter 2016 comparisons suggest that 2017's volume growth on a year-over-year basis could be back half loaded.", "We expect the pricing climate to remain positive and constructive for 2017. The strength of longer-term project pipelines and significant increases in dedicated public transportation funding reinforce confidence in a sustained recovery. And materials producers and others in the construction supply chain remain focused on earning adequate returns on capital. Competition remains intense, but overall and generally speaking, we're battling over value and not just volume.", "Given these dynamics, we'd expect our free cash flow profile and overall financial condition to strengthen further next year. We should have the financial capacity and the flexibility needed to support reinvestment in our franchise, growth including but not limited to M&A, as well as additional returns of capital to shareholders.", "Tom, back over to you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks, John. We're pleased with the continued strong earnings growth and margin expansion we saw in the third quarter despite lower shipment levels. The drivers of recovery in shipments remain very much in place. Our core profitability continues to improve and our fundamental outlook for the future of the business remains unchanged.", "Given that positive outlook, I can assure you that we will invest in our business accordingly. We will keep investing internally. For example, we will plow about $125 million into internal growth projects this year. These projects will help us serve our customers better, increase efficiencies and add to the bottom line. They include five new rail yards, three in Texas, one in Charleston, South Carolina, and another one in Savannah, Georgia along with six greenfield sites that's new quarries, that we're developing in growth markets across the country.", "At the same time, we will continue to aggressively pursue bolt-on acquisitions in key markets as well as other strategic acquisitions, all of which will further strengthen our leading position in the industry.", "I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their commitment to improving every day, to working safely, to finishing this year strong and to delivering another year of even stronger results. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.", "And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. We'll take our first question from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. Really just want to focus on certain geographies and I know that you gave some color in your prepared comments, I just want to dig a little bit deeper. First on California, a lot of their budget with Caltrans has been tied to gas prices. Do we see gas prices move up? How has that impacted your conversations with Caltrans regarding the budget? Also, when you look at the volume softness in that state, how much of it was large project delays versus the budget related issues which seem to be(19:52) apparently tied together, or any other relevant factor that we should take into consideration?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning, Kathryn. I think \u2013 let me just kind of comment on California overall. I think we feel optimistic about demand in California. We see sustained strength in residential and kind of smaller private work. And the headwinds that we faced this year shouldn't repeat next year. If you look at the pipeline data, start data and listen to our customers, we feel better about California even though we haven't seen the shipments come back yet. And we feel good about the public funding situation in California. The elements are in place for this to come together for state funding. You got to remember that California still has the worst roads in the country even with a little bit of increase in the gas taxes from (20:43) price. We'll start to see the FAST Act start kicking in and then we saw a August redistribution of federal funds at just under $ 0.25 billion to California. And then you've got, as you know, you've got the local initiatives that are on the ballot for next week that if they all pass would total about $2.5 billion annually. So, for us in California, as we say, it's not if, it's really about pace and probably the pace of large projects. So I think we're feeling pretty good about 2017 and the longer-term outlook is pretty bright for California.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Thank you. And then on Illinois, that state has been a little tougher when you think about just kind of the state from \u2013 not only from the public side but also from a private sector spending. How should we think about...", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, I think...", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "...Illinois and as we go forward?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think that's a real contrast to California where we feel like California's fundamentals are really good and coming back very strong. Illinois is a weak spot for us and it's really about public funding. The private side is actually not too bad in Illinois, but the public side is just going to be tough for us. I would say this much. Even with volumes down, I'm proud of our team in Illinois. They have \u2013 their profitability is up and facing some pretty good headwinds.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And Kathryn, just to add a little bit of color on those two states, I think it's instructive to contrast Illinois and California a little bit. Illinois, for us, the business is doing quite well as Tom said. There's actually some green shoots in their funding, some toll road funding, some other funding that's not as dependent on the overall public sources. As you probably know, there are some efforts to, if you will, protect transportation funding from other needs in the state. But Illinois is the one place we called out where we just don't see the path to long-term growth that we see in the rest of our footprint. If we contrast that with California which, yes, is going through a little bit of a lull right now, particularly on some large public funding, even the outlook next year for California is quite bright and we see growth in California in 2017 and beyond.", "And so those are very different situations in our view. One which is doing well and profitable but doesn't right now have the long-term growth visibility. California is quite different. Yes, as you know quite well, Caltrans is challenged with some of their funding this year. Yes, that impacts us disproportionately because of our large asphalt presence and the customers we really lined up to serve well. But we don't expect to see anything like the same headwinds next year that we've seen this year in California. And I'd also just remind you, just to give you a sense of that visibility and how it plays out in the marketplace, our pricing in California is up nearly double-digits. So very different situation between those two states.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Thanks. That was a good segue for my next question just for the consolidated aggregate pricing in the quarter. How much was product mix and/or geographic mix impacting total average price of the quarter?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "There was an impact from geographic mix, probably just under 1%, negative impact.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And Kathryn, a lot of that is \u2013 think of how much our business in a place like Coastal Texas was down and that's one of our higher priced markets, and that \u2013 even that by itself had a significant impact on total pricing for the business.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay. Perfect. And then finally, just more broadly speaking, would love to get your thoughts or color on are you starting to see FAST Act dollars flow through these states and how much was that a contributor to strength in the markets that did have solid growth?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think that you're starting to see FAST Act dollars flow through in lettings. I don't think they've flown through to shipments yet. And I think you'll start to see that in the first, second quarter, probably second quarter of 2017. But so we're backlogging jobs right now that are in the letting. The lettings are picking up because of FAST Act spending, but I don't think we've seen much of that get into shipments yet.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, not into shipments. But we saw \u2013 we began to see a real uptick as several state DOTs turned into their new fiscal year. And we are seeing some of that FAST Act money, as Tom noted, begin to be more aggressively allocated, including a reallocation of funds to California that happened just recently. So the money is getting put to use, but we really haven't seen it impact our actual aggregate shipments very much yet at all.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay. Great.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Provides visibility for pricing, so it's probably a positive on pricing but not a big impact yet on shipments.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next we'll turn to Trey Grooms with Stephens.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Morning, Trey.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "I guess quick question on one of the comments you had in the prepared remarks about October. I think you mentioned that it was trending up kind of around 3%. First, was that pretty broad-based across your enterprise? Or was it more geographically isolated to certain markets driving that improvement?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "It was pretty broad-based. We're still facing some challenges as we said in California, but other than that and a little bit of weather on the East Coast, it was broad-based. And I think that what you're seeing there is some of the projects starting to come through, both res and non-res, and that'll pick up as we move into 2017.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Trey, just for a little more color for you all \u2013 and as Tom says, obviously very broad-based. But just to clarify a little bit further, it has bounced back in Texas. It has not, as Tom said, bounced back yet in California. Although as we just discussed, we see a lot of positive signs for next year in California. If you took California out or if California were flat, that 3% up number would be up 5% to 6%. I'm just trying to give you a feel for how broad-based in relative strength ex-California.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Yeah.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "So California's still a little bit soft in October for us. Again, we see a lot of positive signs, but it's taking a while to flow through. Texas is already rebounding, and you'll get a feel for what the rest of it adds up to. So \u2013 now to be clear, when we say that's daily shipment rate \u2013 again, to give you all a feel, we're shipping a little more than 800,000 tons per shipping day.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And I just want to be clear now so that doesn't get misinterpreted, that's per shipping day. So we had 21 shipping days in October. It's not per calendar day, if you will.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "I got you.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "But that'll give you a feel for how much a week longer or week shorter construction season can also have in the fourth quarter for us.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Sure. Okay. That's super helpful. And then I guess with that being said, I don't know if with October behind us now, at the Analyst Day, you said you guys are going to have trouble hitting the 190 million tons of the original guidance that you had. So, with October behind us now, with the third quarter and October behind us I guess, can you help us tighten up that volume range for the year at all as far as kind of how we should be thinking about it if we get, I guess, normal weather in November and December? Anything more granular we can get there?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think as always, as you know, the fourth quarter is about weather and timing and the number of workdays we'll have will be important. Will our customers have enough wherewithal to get the work done in those days? I think that the demand is there. We're seeing the projects coming. Our customers have \u2013 really want to get the work done because they see what's coming in 2017. So the work is there. The desire is there. It's just it's always about timing, and can you get it all done in the number of days you've got left in the year. John?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And, Trey, just to give you a number, given some of those capacity constraints with our customers just getting the work done, we're probably looking at, we'd guess, 182 million tons to 184 million tons, in terms of millions of tons for the year.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And again, keep in mind, there's a lot of variability around that. Again, we're shipping 800,000 tons a day right now. So \u2013 but to answer your question, that's probably what we're looking toward. And at those levels, we think we're still in line with the overall EBITDA guidance we've given.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got it. Thanks. And my last one is more I guess kind of looking into next year. Directionally, you've talked about volume and price just very broadly and directionally, which I get why you don't want to go into any more detail with that yet. But can you give us, as far as like gross profit per ton and how we should be kind of thinking about that, even if it's just directionally as we look into next year, given the fact that we're expecting volume growth, we're expecting pricing growth, but any geographic mix that could impact and without the tailwind maybe as much on diesel, just how to think about your broad thoughts on gross profit per ton next year.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, I'll start with price. We continue to see a really healthy environment for price, and that's driven not just by demand but really about the visibility that our customers and the market sees with the pipeline that's coming. The majority of our markets have already announced price increases for our fixed plant work. Those will be effective anywhere from January 1 to April 1, and if you just kind of look at the price without putting the markets beside, as we've announced price increases, and I'm just looking at a list of $1, $1.50, $0.75, $1, $0.50, $1.75, $1.25, $1, $1, so healthy price increases. Timing will vary with that. I would tell you, at this point, when we look at it, it's pretty generally accepted in the markets and the markets are healthy with that and all of that's driven by that visibility and confidence in that pipeline that's growing. So that'll give you some kind of idea of what we're seeing on pricing out there. When it comes to cost, I think our folks are doing a really good job managing costs and the operating efficiencies that drive those costs, at the same time, keeping our people safe and volume will only help that.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much for the color. Good luck, guys.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Trey, just to \u2013 for everybody, we don't \u2013 there's nothing that we see on the cost side that would throw us kind of off track on recent trend on improving profitability, whether that's flow throughs well above 60%, whether that's our ability to get operating leverage in the system and leverage each step in the P&L, and certainly as we finish off our planning cycle internally, which again, we're just beginning, as you know, we focus quite a bit internally on our profit per ton one market at a time. So I guess we'd be quite surprised if our profit per ton didn't continue to grow a good bit faster than pricing alone would indicate.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Good deal. It's encouraging. Thanks a lot.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next up is Stanley Elliott with Stifel.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My question, you mentioned Illinois, I know you have a Safe Roads Amendment coming out. Assuming it passes, is \u2013 when would one \u2013 I guess when would you start to see money flow through from a project perspective? And then, two, I mean is that only thing or what else do you need to see in the crystal ball to help that piece of the market recover? Because generally speaking, it looks like the other markets in the portfolio are going to do pretty well next year.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, I think what that really does is not new funding or additional funding, it's protecting the funding that's there which is important. Because in Illinois, those funds have been rated in the past, and so it just protects it or safeguards it which is important and a good thing. Illinois, for the public side, they just got to fix some of their funding issues. As John and I said earlier, we don't see that happening for 2017. It's going to take a while. But the private side is still going pretty good in Illinois.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And, Stanley, we don't want to give the impression that Illinois is like in some kind of freefall. It's stabilized at lower level. We just don't see the same kind of longer-term growth fundamentals yet in place that we see in \u2013 really I'm trying to give other exceptions. But across the vast majority of the rest of our footprint, you hear us \u2013 if I contrast it with California again, you hear us talk about things, and you know how this works, population growth, employment growth, state of public revenues, so forth and so on. In a place like California, that story is still very positive. In a place like Illinois, it's less clear. So I don't want to give the impression that it's in some kind of freefall. The business is doing quite well as Tom said. Our team there is doing quite well, but we don't have the same view to one, two, three, four, five-year growth that we have elsewhere.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. No, that's fair. I was just trying to see if there was any sort of inflection point coming up to where it could kind of get a little bit more back on track, but very helpful. And secondly...", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "We're hoping the negative inflection point is behind us.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Well, you know what at some point, I think you're exactly right. But could you help us with \u2013 you mentioned the cost side being favorable. Can you talk a little bit about the enhanced sales initiatives that you mentioned in the press release?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Sure. And again, that's just an area of an investment in the business. As we see long-term growth in the businesses, as we're very focused on providing better service to our customers, to be more valuable to our customers and to get full value for our product, we are continuing to invest in some of our sales support systems, customer support systems, people. Really nothing out of the ordinary, Stanley.", "Those can be just very important investments to support growth and important to customers' needs. And they tie back to a strategy that's very focused on earning full and fair value for our product. And as such, we need to be providing full service to our customers.", "So, for a lot of our customers a lot of the time, we are more than just a material supplier, and we want to make sure that as the markets recover, as things get busier, as they face their own constraints, that we're in a position to help them be successful. That's how we're successful.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, to add to that, I think we're seeing what's coming in the next four, five years with growth in all market segments. In order to do that, we need to invest in the sales group so we can add value for our customers and be ahead of that growth curve.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Sounds good. And last question for me. On a lot of these internal initiatives, how should we think about whether it's in terms of payback or kind of hurdle rates, anything that you would care to share about all the growth investments that you have going on internally? Thanks.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, I think this is normal part of our growth. We just don't grow through acquisitions, and this is about protecting and adding value to the franchises that we have. So greenfields are normal projects for us, whether that is distribution of rail or bluewater or new quarries. They take a long time to develop, and you've got to get out ahead of the growth curve. But these are normal projects for us and well above the cost of capital.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "They're actually generally quite attractive, Stanley. As you can imagine, and you know enough about our unit economics, about our margins. We're really doing these kinds of things in markets that we're already in, particularly in a risk-adjusted basis. These are good investments, and we're quite happy to have the financial flexibility to invest in that growth.", "Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Agreed. Best of luck, guys. Thanks.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Now we'll move to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Hey, Timna.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Not to hammer home, but on the Q4 commentary, I was a little bit confused because you talk about if the shipment momentum continues then you're on track to meet guidance. But I thought that October was the usually strongest quarter. So do you mean that adjusted for that seasonality if shipment continues? Or what did you mean by that, and if you could just clarify?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think what we're saying there is we're seeing those jobs pick up that we've been talking about and starting to come through. We feel good about the fourth quarter as always. You've got a limited number of days to work through particularly as you get towards the winter months. And so, if not, I don't think it's \u2013 we're seeing the work there, and we're seeing the projects as a matter of constraints for our customers to get it done or number of working days.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. All right. That makes sense.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Timna, unless something odd happened and shortened the construction season by a lot, we'd expect to be, just be clear, on track with our $1 billion of expected adjusted EBITDA for the year.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "We're not trying to send any weird signal on that just to be clear. It's the same message as we delivered in Atlanta.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Helpful. In the past, you've talked a little bit about your utilization and talked about raising that utilization and what the incremental costs might be and characterized them. Is that something you can update us on?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, if I understand the question correctly, Timna, this is John, and Tom will chime in of course, but from a plant utilization point of view, if that's your question, we are still \u2013 the vast majority of our facility is well below what we would kind of call sweet spots of operation. So we have a lot of operating leverage in front of us.", "Probably like others in our business, as we've started the recovery and started to ramp back up production, we've had to work through some periods of higher \u2013 particularly maintenance cost, showed up first in mobile equipment. Now shows up a little bit for us this quarter in our business and takes plant or processing equipment. This is you running things harder and getting them ready for future growth. But to a question that was asked earlier, we should be very well set up to continue to deliver really good operating leverage in what's still largely a fixed cost business for quite a while to come. There will be moments in time where our local operators are wrestling with, and this is obviously a good problem to have, how to add a shift or add a crew and do that most efficiently, most safely, most economically. But if you step back from it and you think about our improved margin structures, you'd think about our incremental flow throughs, the conditions are in place for those numbers to still be quite attractive for quite some time.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, we've got plants that are still running part-time. Even with the volumes that we've seen come back, we're nowhere near optimal operating leverage or efficiencies in these plants. So our operating people are really happy about the volume improvements with the exception of maybe Texas where we're running some plants. We've got lots of run room ahead of us, and I think it will be fun to watch this over the next two or three years.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And while we had a couple of headwinds this quarter, our teams have kept operating costs over the trailing 12 months effectively flat which is a really good accomplishment given the ups and downs in the production side.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So are we talking 60%, 65% still, utilization?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yes.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I mean, probably \u2013 every market's different. Demand, different plants when you run them, but yeah, that's where you're talking about.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then final one for me, John. I know I like to harp on this, but you got that high quality problem of a low dividend yield. Is it fair to assume that the next review by the board would be in February and not before then? And are we just going to continue to grow with the company? Or are we going to start to express some of the greater earnings power that you like to talk about?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Well, obviously the board \u2013 let me first say it's a board decision, so I don't want to preview their decision. Obviously reviewed every board meeting. If our past pattern holds true, we'd be announcing something in February.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Again, that's if past pattern holds true. I don't want to prejudge the board's decision. But nothing to our knowledge has changed from our past communications which is, we would expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings throughout the recovery period. And of course, we're very focused long-term on having a sustainable dividend. But really nothing changed, Timna, and February is probably the most likely date.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Again, I don't want to prejudge the board, but that's probably the most likely date.", "Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next we'll move to Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. Thank you. Just have a follow-up question on pricing, how we should think about that moving into 2017, provided some color around mix and some of the percent in dollar increase announcements that you have already scheduled for 2017. But if we're to think about the volume growth as potentially back half weighted to next year given the tough comps in the first quarter, given just the timing around state budgets and how funding is going to flow through on the infrastructure side, should we think about the pricing growth opportunity in 2017 as back half weighted as well?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think, as always, what I was giving you in the price increases was fixed plant pricing which will \u2013 timing will all be different, but those will kick in. But you've got to remember, a lot of pricing for our work is bid work where we're quoting one job at a time, and that'll be a campaign. So you'll see gradual price increases in those markets as you are able to raise prices throughout the year. So I don't see anything different in the cadence of pricing as we got coming up versus prior years. The one thing I would tell you is that the environment for pricing and the acceptance of it is very good.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one last question on asphalt, good performance in the quarter despite some challenging volume conditions in California. But if we're thinking about asphalt and the oil prices and potential inflation on the cost side into 2017, how should we start to think about asphalt margins in that backdrop?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think it's one of those where when \u2013 as you see inflation in liquids, you will also see price increases, and I think our folks do a really good job of managing \u2013 creating value for our customers with cost improvements and managing costs along with margin management and material margin management. So my view of that is if you see increases in liquid, could it have a very short-term impact? Yes, as you work off oil work. But overall, the pricing will follow it.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And Garik, we don't, from a financial management point of view, we don't have a lot of long-term exposure or anything like that on the liquids side. So it's more a short-term fluctuation in material margins. As you would well know, Garik, material margins in asphalt are just inherently a little more volatile than they would be, for example, in the aggregate side of the business. But they're also generally pretty attractive through a cycle and you get good returns on the capital through the cycle. So we like that part of our business. Now it's tied in to our aggregates franchise, but we very much like that part of our business.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think the other thing I'd add to that is you're going to see pretty good demand increases in Asphalt, particularly as the public funding starts to flow through. You'll see a lot more highway jobs which will improve the demand, which will \u2013 and our customers in the market see that visibility. They know what's coming. So I think we're pretty optimistic on the profitability with asphalt, despite what happens with liquid, even if that hits us a little bit short-term. Longer-term, I'm pretty pleased with where the asphalt's going.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much and good luck.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll next move to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey, guys. This is actually Marshall (46:32) on for Bob this morning.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning, Marshall (46:34).", "Unknown Speaker", "How're you all doing?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good.", "Unknown Speaker", "You already touched on the dividend. But it looks like you also pretty aggressively bought back some stock in the quarter, and I don't think that any of you all have really sold anything meaningfully. Maybe if you could just tie that to where you see the stock now and the outlook for the business through 2017 and beyond.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Marshall (46:56), this is John. I'll start. Yeah, I don't know if I would use words like aggressive or not, but we bought back 790,000 shares in the quarter. We've bought back a little over 1.4 million shares for the year. As we've said and this is just consistent with the capital allocation priorities we discussed many times, we'll continue to look to return excess cash after a variety of other priorities to shareholders in the form of opportunistic share repurchases. We reserve the right to turn that on, turn that off. We'll report to you kind of after the fact.", "We're always judging that use of capital relative to M&A and growth investments. And as Tom mentioned, we think we will have some interesting M&A opportunities over time, although they're difficult to predict and we're still active in that marketplace. And we do think of it as both an investment and as a return of capital. So, look, would we be doing it at those levels if we didn't think it was a good investment? No, if that's your question. We think it's a good use of capital. And again, we'll continue to report out on future actions after they occur.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah, I think we still see a good outlook both for, as we talked about, the internal investments and growing our business with new quarries and new distribution. But also, the market out there for acquisitions is good. We're working on a number of those. We hope to have some of those to talk about soon, so the growth opportunities in the business are very good.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And, Marshall (48:40), just to \u2013 maybe to answer your question a little more directly. Our fundamental outlook on the business has not changed. In fact, we have a lot of confidence in the profit engine and where that's taken. And a lot of the fundamentals regarding long-term demand recovery, if anything, are more in place now than they were when we had our Investor Day roughly a year-and-a-half, not quite two years ago. So, if you believe those conditions, then in our view, putting some additional capital back into our stock is a good investment. So it's not exclusive of other things we'll do with capital, but we think it's a good use of capital.", "Operator", "Anything further, sir?", "Unknown Speaker", "That's it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we'll conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back to Mr. Hill for any additional and closing remarks.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan Materials and your time this morning. We look forward to talking to you over the next few months.

Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Operator", "Please stand by. Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Jessica, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.", "And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.", "Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available on our website supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide on this call, we will focus on the highlights.", "Please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you, Mark, and we appreciate you joining us for the call today. We had a good start to the year. Our first quarter aggregates volume and price were consistent with our expectations and we are reaffirming our guidance for the full year.", "Three points stand out. One, we are where we need to be to deliver on our plans and projections for the full year. Two, market conditions continue to improve nicely across our footprint, including California, and demand just keeps on building. Three, we're finding good opportunities to grow our asset base and further strengthen our customer service capabilities. These investments in growth reflect our strong confidence in the sustained recovery and continued acceleration in our profitability.", "Now, let me expand on these three points. Regarding our good start in the first quarter, I'm pleased with our operating results and with the quality of our execution. Aggregate shipment rates for the quarter were encouraging, particularly given weather in California and the comparison with Q1 2016 when we were up 17%.", "Excluding California, aggregate shipments were essentially flat with the prior year. California shipments were down 20% in January and February due to record rainfall before beginning to recover in March. The continued recovery in demand across our Mid-Atlantic and Southeast states helped offset the effect of the two-month decline in California. Taking into consideration the season and California floods, our first quarter shipments were in line with full-year expectations.", "Now, when the weather finally improved in California in March, business immediately improved. Aggregates pricing also continued to improve in the quarter, with an average freight-adjusted sales price up $0.57 despite modest headwinds from product mix. Our fixed plant price increases have been duly well accepted. Some of this went into effect January 1 and some April 1.", "We realized higher average prices across nearly all of our states. We completed the first quarter in line with our full-year plans on price and on volume.", "Aggregates segment total cost of sales increased $0.69 per ton. This included some $14 million of higher cost associated with diesel, stripping, the California floods, and the dry docking of one of our ships as we transition to new, more efficient vessels.", "From an operational perspective, our core unit profitability in Aggregates, which leads the industry, continue to improve again in line with our full-year plans. Our non-Aggregate segment also performed well in the quarter, beating last year's strong comparisons.", "I want to point out the quality of execution that creates results like these. We're serving our customers well, providing solutions as well as product so that they stay with us for the long haul and we keep growing our customer base. We're investing in the business and building new skills for our people, with particular focus right now in our sales teams, the same time we're controlling our operating costs. And most important, we are continuing to maintain a safe work environment.", "For example, last year, we had our second best safe deployments in the history of the company, and Vulcan has always been an industry leader with a strong safety culture, but that ain't good enough. This year, we're off to an even better start with a meaningful reduction in accidents. Hereto, we are keeping the focus on taking something that's good and making it better every day. The engagement, discipline, commitment and attention to detail that underpin our safety performance also say a lot about the strength and quality of our people and our overall company performance.", "Stepping back from the first quarter's results, let me expand on my second point. Market conditions continue to improve in very important fundamental ways. At a macro level, as the Dodge data clearly shows, the pre-construction project pipeline keeps getting bigger and bigger. Construction starts also have continued to recover from last year's weaknesses. Generally speaking, we're continuing to see solid recovery in private construction activity across many markets.", "As one indicator, you may want to note the 22% rise in our concrete shipments in the first quarter that was driven largely by higher levels of private construction in Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia. This is our largest concrete market and a major added position for us.", "On the public construction side, we are getting ready for multiple years of increasing demand in our key states. While the federal highway bill, the FAST Act brought stability, visibility and increased funds for the nation's highway systems, many of our key states and cities have stepped up to address their own needs. For example, last month, California and Tennessee passed major transportation funding legislation and South Carolina is on the brink of passing a new highway bill.", "California's $52.4 billion transportation bill, SB 1, is a game changer for that state. And remember, Vulcan is California's largest producer of aggregates and asphalt. On top of that, local ballot measures passed last November in California added another $1.2 billion annually for transportation projects for years to come. This was primarily in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where we have the most strategic aggregates and asphalt positions.", "Tennessee's new highway bill will bring in $350 million annually, helping tackle a backlog of more than 900 projects valued at $10.5 billion. And South Carolina is on track to ultimately add $630 million annually for roads and bridges.", "Vulcan is the number one producer of aggregates in Tennessee and South Carolina, and also the largest asphalt producer in Tennessee, with strategic locations throughout the growth quarters in both states. As you know, Texas, Florida and Georgia all have made significant increases to their funding programs in recent years, raising their highway programs to record levels. Other Vulcan states including Virginia, North Carolina and Maryland have also increased their highway programs.", "Altogether, key Vulcan states that make up 77% of our total revenue have significantly increased their highway funding. And more such legislation will pass in other Vulcan states, along with more local ballot initiatives. The need is just that great.", "Now, obviously, these funding measures add significant value to our business. They will extend and amplify this recovery. They improve long-term visibility and they foster additional economic growth across our footprint", "Our customers are getting ready for the next wave of large public transportation projects slated to start later this year. We will be the primary supplier for many of these large projects. Projects like the 202 Loop around Phoenix, Highway 281 expansion in San Antonio, the I-285/400 interchange in Atlanta, and the widening of I-20 in Atlanta and I-85 in North Carolina just to name a few.", "We will see significantly increasing public infrastructure demand in the coming years. The trend is clear and the laws are written. All of this further enhances the great value of our franchise.", "Now, let me touch specifically on California, given the importance of the changes that have occurred there. We've seen market conditions improve dramatically. Private demand in California continues to strengthen, driven by both housing and non-residential construction. And, of course, the outlook for public construction in California improved substantially with the passage of SB 1. Near term, this legislation removes recent uncertainty about public road funding and allows Caltrans to move ahead with planned work this year. In the intermediate and longer term, we should benefit from a much higher level of public construction activity. This is in a state where Vulcan is the largest supplier of aggregates and asphalt.", "Just as we've seen in Georgia, the improved visibility to future demand in California will also reinforce a pricing climate that is already much improved. California looks in many ways like Texas did four years ago. Overall, construction activity and materials consumption are still well below long-term trends. The private economy is growing, residential construction is rebounding, there's new legislation supporting strong public road construction and maintenance, and the conditions are in place to support significant price and margin improvements for years to come. We're excited about our prospects in California and we expect to continue investing there accordingly.", "This brings me to my third point, our acquisitions and growth investments reflect our confidence in overall market conditions. They also reflect our confidence in our local leadership and execution. Just in third quarter of 2016, we closed on six bolt-on acquisitions. These add to our strong positions in California, Tennessee, and New Mexico. Now, putting this together with the 14 other acquisitions and swaps we completed since 2013, these acquisitions expand our ability to serve our customers, bring important operational and commercial synergies, and strengthen our platform for sustained growth. We're excited to welcome these new operations to Vulcan.", "We will continue to pursue assets and operations that fit our strategy and our portfolio, and we will remain disciplined in our pursuit of the right acquisitions. Putting it all together, the quarter represented another good step forward toward our longer-term goals.", "With that, I'll hand it off to John, who will share a few more details regarding the quarter and outlook. Then I'll follow with some closing remarks. John?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As you heard Tom note, first quarter results and market trends were very much in line with our beginning-of-year plans and we are reaffirming our full-year outlook for adjusted EBITDA of between $1.125 billion and $1.225 billion.", "I'll now comment on a few specific drivers in our core aggregates business. With respect to aggregate shipment volumes, we continue to see a sustained recovery in progress, with rising public demand gradually complementing private activity that has driven this recovery so far.", "The outlook for continued growth and shipments across our core southeastern markets remains positive and encouraging. And California shipments appear to be catching up on volumes lost due to weather early in the year.", "As you know, quarterly comparisons get easier as the year moves on. Ultimate shipment levels and growth rates for the balance of the year will depend in good part on the timing of deliveries to anticipated large projects, particularly large public transportation projects. Again, the question here is one of timing, not trend.", "Moving now to aggregates pricing. Again, we came out of Q1 with pricing in line with our full-year plans. Nearly all states realized price increases, with Georgia and California experiencing double-digit gains. Our reported average selling price for the full year may be pressured a bit, as it was in the first quarter, by product mix, but we currently expect the underlying like-for-like improvement to be in line with our beginning-of-year expectations. The overall pricing climate for aggregates clearly remains positive.", "Turning to Aggregates segment's profitability, I'll note that nothing has changed regarding our full-year outlook or for that matter, our longer-term goals for Aggregates segment unit margin improvement or flow-through rates. Most of the $14 million in costs incurred in Q1 that Tom mentioned were anticipated in our full-year plans.", "Looking ahead, we expect the lull in volume growth that we've experienced over the last 12 months to be behind us soon. And we think it's worth noting that both our business and the markets we serve have taken important steps forward during this time. I'll briefly run through a few examples starting with our core profitability.", "Average aggregate selling prices are $0.71 per ton or 6% ahead of where they were at this time last year. Our cash margin per ton in aggregates on a trailing 12-month basis reached a record for the first quarter despite the cost headwinds mentioned earlier. And our downstream asphalt and concrete operations generated $23 million more in trailing 12-month gross profit than they did a year ago.", "In addition to improving our core profitability, we've made important additions to our asset base. Since the third quarter of last year, we've invested approximately $230 million in six strategic bolt-on acquisitions and we expect the run rate EBITDA contribution from these operations post full integration to exceed $35 million.", "Our financial position is also stronger. We've returned to full investment grade ratings, we've begun to extend the duration of our debt portfolio while reducing our weighted average interest rate and we've maintained the flexibility to fund smart growth investments.", "And of course, our markets have moved forward also. California's transportation funding uncertainty has been resolved. Tennessee and South Carolina are joining other Southeastern states in matching a continuing private recovery with significantly higher levels of public investment.", "FAST Act funding and projects have moved that much closer to impacting our daily material shipments, and visibility and confidence have further improved especially when compared to the overhang of last year's election cycle.", "So to recap, we've seen significant steps forward in our core profitability, our asset base, our financial flexibility, our visibility to public construction demand and in the growth outlook for our California operations. For all these reasons, we feel good about reaffirming our expectations for 2017, about the continued recovery in materials demand beyond this year and develop Vulcan Materials' unique positioning for sustained long-term growth.", "Tom, back over to you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks, John. I think it's pretty clear that we're excited about what we see ahead of us, and I can tell you we're ready for it. The clear trends we see in growing public and private demand align well with our unmatched strategic locations in our key states and with our recent acquisitions.", "I want to point out that we have been busy growing our company. We are stronger and better positioned now than we were a year ago. We have the best employees in the industry and our teams are just getting stronger. We are investing in them as they gear up to meet growing demand.", "We are set up extremely well for continued strong profitability, earnings growth and free cash flow. We are at a point where we should see meaningful period-over-period growth rates, particularly in the second half of this year. We are especially encouraged given the great and growing strength of our core Southeast franchise and the return to growth in California.", "As I travel around the country and met with our customers and local leadership teams over the last quarter, I found them more confident and upbeat than I've seen them in a long time. And I share their enthusiasm and their energy.", "As always, we remain focused on creating value for our customers and are running our operations with a relentless focus on safety and continuous improvement. We are also focused on creating superior shareholder value now and for the long term. That's our commitment. That's what we do.", "With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go first to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Marshall Mentz - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, guys. This is actually Marshall Mentz on for Bob. Congrats on a strong quarter.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks.", "Marshall Mentz - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "So, clarifying question on your guidance. Given the California public spending tailwind and the $198 million of acquisition spend year-to-date, were either of those benefits included in your original guidance? You obviously had some headwinds in California that you needed to overcome, but how should we think about that range in the context of those two tailwinds then? You had a comment about $35 million of contribution from spend over the last several quarters for the acquisitions.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Right. This is John. I'll take it to start. Of course, we're reaffirming full-year guidance. But within that, on California, we expect we'll be able to catch up on the shortfalls we've had earlier in the year.", "California, as a business, is performing well. The shipments are beginning to recover quite quickly and we think we can make up for some of those cost impacts elsewhere in the business throughout the year.", "On the M&A front, the new acquisitions we've talked about today for the current year, for the 2017 year, probably have a fairly marginal impact on the order of $10 million to $15 million above what we've already included in our guidance. The $35 million number I mentioned would really be at full integration, full run rate. You might think of that as more of an 2018 number. We'll obviously talk about that more as we hit closer to 2018.", "So not a big adjustment from either of those factors to our current guidance. Certainly in the context of our total EBITDA expectations for the year.", "Marshall Mentz - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And then, if I could give one more in. Just on California, you guys have obviously spent a lot of time on it. I know it's an important market for you in spite of the historical funding situation. How much does the state currently contribute to your top line and how high do you think that contribution level could move given the spending tailwind? And any bolt-ons that you may \u2013 you added one this year, it sounds like, and maybe that increases the emphasis on bolt-ons in that state.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I'll start again, and Tom will probably chime in. California, as I think many on the call know, has always been one of our most important states. I think it's running about 16% of our revenue.", "One thing that Tom mentioned that worth emphasizing, of course, is we're the state's largest aggregates producer as well as the state's largest asphalt producer. And so, a good bit of our asphalt segment is focused in California also.", "So the changes that we've seen in state funding in California, very important to us long term. In the short term, we hope they'll free up Caltrans to release some work, both new construction and maintenance, that's been held up a bit due to funding uncertainty over the past 18-plus months.", "But it's really a positive story as we look to 2018, 2019, 2020 and beyond.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I think on the short term on the private side, we've seen the non-res pick up. We predicted that the second half of last year and it's coming true. As you travel in California, you can see the confidence in both the contractors' eyes and in the ready-mix producers on the \u2013 so \u2013 and the res has been healthy.", "On the private side, I think last year was a matter of timing and location of jobs. We're seeing those jobs kick off this year and more jobs in our footprint. So, both of those will play well for us in 2017.", "And as John said, I think Caltrans was just frozen because of funding issues and that's been broken and they'll be freed up to let jobs. So despite the rain in California, when the sun came out in March, shipments picked up immediately. Actually, the flooding \u2013 well, it postponed demand, it didn't do away with it, but also really created some demand.", "There are some washouts in some roads and still some road maintenance that's got to be fixed from the flooding, which will help both aggregates and asphalt.", "Marshall Mentz - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Very helpful. Congrats on the excellent quarter and good luck.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Morning, Kathryn.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Morning. Thank you for taking my questions today.", "First is more asphalt-related, you picked up the LoJac assets in Tennessee, an asphalt construction firm. How does Vulcan think about asphalt acquisitions as part of its longer term strategy? And following along with that, knowing that California and Tennessee \u2013 you have the largest asphalt and aggregate positions in those state, what is the breakout of highway construction as a percentage of your total sales in each of those states if you are willing to share that today? Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. The first part of your question, I think whether it's asphalt or concrete in an acquisition, it's really not about vertical integration; it's about how do we look at the strategic position in an individual market and also how does it fit with our aggregates business.", "So, both of those, it's really an extension of our aggregates business in a market where it fits us. So we have the leading position in aggregates in Middle Tennessee. We have done business with this asphalt customer for 20-plus years. We knew them well, they knew us well, and it was a very good strategic fit for us.", "So, again, it's about the individual markets and the strategy in those markets and how does it fit our aggregates-focused strategy, which is \u2013 as always, our business is grounded in aggregates.", "As far as the second part of your question, that is a significant increase in Tennessee. Tennessee's roads are asphalt-driven and in places like Nashville, the biggest city in Tennessee, we all have the most strategic positions and the largest positions. So we're looking forward to paving more roads in Tennessee.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Would it be fair to say that the highway construction post acquisition in Tennessee and in particular Southern California is 50% to 60% of your total mix in those respective markets?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "That's probably a little bit on the high side.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "High for current. But it could grow to that, Kathryn, conceivably.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay. It could grow. Yeah.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think what we'd say is that \u2013 because, obviously, we're set to preserve the full market. But the acquisitions we've made \u2013 it's not accidental that we've made these acquisitions to end markets that have had significant step-ups in public funding. And as you well know, some of the asphalt post-aggregate positions, in particular, match very well with public road construction, whereas sometimes concrete can be a bit more private construction-driven. So, we think it's a really good fit and it's a really attractive deployment of capital for us when you're starting with a really attractive strong aggregates position.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay. Helpful. Tom, you had mentioned California looks like Texas four years ago. You've also mentioned in prior calls primarily last year that Texas is the only state where volumes are back to normalized levels. Where do you think California is compared to normalized level given that SB 1 and how long will it take to get back to normal levels based on your prior experience in that state?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Right now, California is probably 20% below normalized levels. As I said earlier, the private side is \u2013 continues to pick up steam. We're really pleased with the non-res.", "SB 1, it's phased in over \u2013 about a four-year timeframe, but it takes that road spending from $3.75 billion to average of about $9 billion, so over a doubling effect. And it will much accelerate the road to normalized demand, but it also will probably up the average aggregate consumption in California over time because it's such a big deal and such a big impact.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Right. Thank you very much.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Rohit Seth with SunTrust.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just to build on that California highway bill impact. So, you said the doubling of highway and road spend. So, is it fair to assume that your business could double over there?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Well, it would double. It would go on long ways to double the public side of it. Now, the private side continues to be grower and we think it, too, is still well below normalized demand. But the highway piece of the public side, it very well may double that.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Got you. Okay. And then, on the...", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Now, you've also got to remember where that money will be spent is in the very high population areas of California. And Vulcan, both in aggregates and in asphalt, has the most strategic positions in the big cities like San Francisco or LA or San Diego.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Got you. Okay. And then on Texas, last year, is pretty weak. You're expecting growth in 2017. Can you just provide us some update on what you're seeing so far in the year?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Sure. I think North Texas continues to be healthy both \u2013 in all sectors and you still got population growth in Texas. Now, we did say it's the one state that's probably a little at or above normalized demand, but you've also got population coming into Texas.", "So, North Texas is very healthy. South Texas, we're seeing good growth in all sectors, particularly in San Antonio in asphalt, concrete and in aggregates. Houston and coastal Texas really had a tough time in 2016. We think we'd hit bottom and/or coming up out of that. So we expect to see some growth in coastal Texas.", "Summing it up, I think Texas is \u2013 continues to chug along and be healthy.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Rohit, just to add one thing just because it's topical. San Antonio just passed, I think, its largest ever bond offering for public infrastructure investment this last week, I want to say, $800 million worth. And that's just another good example of the kind of very local funding activity that's also happening. It doesn't get the same attention, but it's very important to the kind of local operations that aggregates players and asphalt players like us tend to have.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yeah.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "So very good news. And the visibility that you've seen in Texas over time, you saw pricing there, we think the visibility that we now have in California should over time help reinforce the pricing climate there also.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Fantastic. And just another topical question. Atlanta market, the I-85 bridge collapse resulted in a freeze in non-emergency-related construction. Georgia has obviously been a good grower for you guys. How do you think about the second quarter in that regard? Construction is frozen and could be unfrozen by June. And is that enough time to make up for \u2013 within the current April and May...", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I don't think we're worried about the freezing of funds. You had the highway falls in and you had the buckling of I-20 also in Atlanta.", "Now, the Georgia DOT is in really good shape. We've got six jobs that will kick off this year or have kicked off already. The total tonnage on those jobs is probably over 5 million tons over a two- or three-year period. So, Georgia and Atlanta, the public side is very healthy, a lot of jobs is kicking off and you're just now sort of starting to see both the FAST Act and the increase in Georgia DOT funds turning to aggregate shipments.", "So, we're not worried about that. It's a short-term issue. This is a long-term game with the Georgia DOT and the private side continues to be very healthy. Our position in Atlanta is second to none; in fact, by far the best. And so, we're really looking forward to good things in Georgia.", "Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks. Thanks, that's all I have.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go to our next question from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. Thanks and congratulations on the quarter. Had a question just on your comments around mix in pricing and some of the headwind experienced in the first quarter and perhaps to temper expectations for the full year. Can you provide some color as to what the mix impact was? Was it more product or was it more geographic?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. The mix that I think really stood out was more product. It was more fines. It was more fines in the Southeast with new construction. Which we always say we'll take every day of the week. It's volume that in the past, when the downturn hit, we wouldn't have had. It serves our product mix and production mix out of our plants and just adds to our profitability. So, while it may appear to be headwinds on price from a profitability standpoint, we'll take it every time.", "John?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I'd just say, Garik, I think it's marginal. It's just \u2013 and I don't know that we'd want to temper expectations and certainly don't want to unintentionally communicate that the pricing climate is anything but positive. But as we see more new construction, more new large construction in the mix, it could, just from a product mix point of view, have a little bit of a negative impact on total reported average selling price.", "Now, as we've discussed many times, on a profitability perspective, it should be quite positive. So, more a heads-up than anything where we're trying temper expectations too much.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And would there be any mix impact from geography as California accelerates in the second half of this year? And as it sounds like coastal Texas is trying to come back against relatively easy comparisons, recognizing that these are two high price markets.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Well, I'd tell you. I think that when you look at that, maybe a little bit, I'm not sure it will have a big impact. I think one of things we've seen in California, which we're very pleased with, and we said this, we saw marked price movement last year in California. And the demand improving on both the public side and the private side will only continue to move prices in California both in hot mix and in aggregates.", "So, we're pleased with the pricing environment in California. Same thing with Texas. It continues to have a healthy environment. But as far as mix is concerned, maybe a little bit. I would more look at margin and I think we will continue to grow our margins in both of those states.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And, Garik, in California on a price and margin basis action, this is part of why it's kind of parallel to Texas from three, four, five years ago is that's a set of markets where margins have some room to grow. It is not one of our highest margin markets at the moment and it really, for a lot of reasons, ought to be one of the higher ones. So, we think there's some room to go over time in that and the visibility on the public side will help.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. Which I would tell you four or five years ago, Texas had a long way to go.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Got it. Wonder, just to switch to the $14 million in higher costs in the first quarter, recognizing that this was according to plan, but should we think about it as a pull forward of costs from the rest of the year and what would this mean for the implied incremental margin performance as we get into peak construction season?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I'll start and maybe Tom will chime in. The first thing I would say is that, again, full-year guidance unchanged. And what I'd emphasize on that, Garik, is that the implied gross margin percent improvement from our guidance, both in the Aggregate segment and as a total company, we still expect. We still see that in our internal projections. So again, nothing's changed and we'd expect on a full-year basis to have gross margin as a percent of price-adjusted sales increase in the Aggregate segment and increase on the total company basis.", "The cost items are the ones we mentioned and called out. They're real costs, not things that we would adjust out of EBITDA. But the impact is transitory. And particularly the impact on reported unit margin or reported margin as a percent sales. So the timing of those costs relative to the timing of associated revenue is what gives you kind of obviously a decline in first quarter margins when what we still very much expect is on a full-year basis and increase in margins.", "So, a little bit of a pull forward, but mostly what you're seeing is the timing of those costs somewhat distorting the view on our margin trajectory, which on a full-year basis we still expect to be improving. Again, that includes the Aggregate segment and the total company.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think as important as the cost is what did the things we spent the money on set us up for. We're going to see some big projects with high lumpy demand kick off in 2017 and then you'll follow up in 2018 and 2019 as these FAST Act and state DOT dollars flow through.", "When you do that, you got to be ready. I think that our folks, both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, have worked really hard to get our plants in good shape. We got the people on board. I think that they're ready. We are also, I think, working hard on the efficiencies in the plants to things that really drive cost, things like throughput through a plant or downtime or scheduling.", "So, I feel really good about the position we are and the firepower we have and our plants being ready both in aggregates and in asphalt and ready-mix to handle some big work that's going to come out of FAST. And this is also real high-spec work so you got to be not only have the firepower, you got to be accurate. But I think our folks have done a really good job over the winter to get us ready to come out of the gate strong.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And, Garik, if I can, just one more comment on diesel in particular because it's a significant drag in the quarter. But our average diesel cost in the quarter was roughly in line with what we expected. I think it was about $1.79. We expect it to go up in terms of our projections a little bit more in the balance of the year. I think we're expecting a full-year cost for diesel of around $2, let's say.", "But in terms of being a drag, that would be kind of weighted to first quarter. Last year, diesel price in the first quarter was really at its low point. So we took, if you will, more of that hit in Q1 that we'd expect to take in the balance of the year.", "But on diesel, as we've said before, higher diesel prices generally support higher aggregates prices, albeit with a bit of a lag. And they tend to widen, Garik, because you know the kind of natural economic moat around individual quarries just because the transportation cost goes up. So, with the \u2013 even in intermediate term view, we don't see that as a threat to our business and one could argue it's actually an advantage to our business.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Makes sense. Thanks again.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.", "Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks, Adam.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.", "On aggregates pricing, your pricing guidance for the year, are you contemplating any mid-year price increases and are there any markets where that could be possible?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. So we saw the 5% in Q1. We've had price increases that, as I said, kicked in January. We'll have some more \u2013 we had some more that kicked in April 1 and probably a little more this year that kicked in April than we had last year. And then on bid work, we'll bid projects throughout the year and you'll see those prices continue to rise as the year goes along.", "As always, pricing momentum is a function of visibility and confidence. As I said in my comments, as I travel around, people are excited. People are confident and you can see it. They talk a lot about the jobs that are coming.", "Let me give you a little bit of geographic flavor on that. If you've started on east with the Mid-Atlantic, last year, Virginia was pretty flat particularly on the private side. We've seen the private work in the fourth quarter pick up dramatically. You saw it. You heard it in my comments and saw it in our numbers on our ready-mix business up there, which is really a good sign going forward that the non-res and res is kicking in. And we just had that election lull in the Mid-Atlantic and we've got the good highway work up there.", "Virginia, those dollars that they passed a few ago were kicking in. We've got big widenings up on I-95. The Southeast is really humming right now. We see the private construction work continue to gain momentum, particularly in the Carolinas and Georgia border, and Tennessee. And now, we're seeing the big highway work kick in.", "We talked a lot about the Georgia work, the Carolinas. We see big work and again, this is the FAST Act coming through and this is the states increases and funding start to flow in the shipments of stones. So, our private work in the Southeast is really ramping up. Now, you're seeing the public dollars flow through. And this is really good for us because, remember, we are the largest producer in the Southeast and we have the most strategic positions in those growth quarters.", "We talked about Texas, it's healthy. The coastal piece we think has bottomed out. Now, as I said earlier, California looks like Texas did four years ago. You've got the private work ramping up. The non-res we saw lull last year and it is coming back, and we saw it come back in March. And now, you've got the Caltrans dollars coming. Now, they won't flow through for a little while, but you've got pickup in Caltrans' fundamental work this year and then that really helps our asphalt business.", "So, if you look at all of that growth and all of that visibility, it leads to a really helping pricing climate not just for 2017, but for the foreseeable \u2013 actually for the long term 2018, 2019, 2020. Our customers and the general construction market, knowing that that work is coming, allows everybody to take a little risk and just raise the pricing across the segment.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's great. I appreciate that comment. Then just lastly on the outlook for acquisitions going forward, there's chatter of potential large deals out there. I'm just curious whether now is the right time to look more seriously at a large deal.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "The M&A pipeline continues to be very active. As we always say, this is about discipline of the projects that we completed fourth quarter last year, first quarter this year. We've been working hard for a long time, but we're going to be disciplined about the markets we look at.", "They have to be \u2013 growth markets will be very disciplined about what synergies are unique to us and everything does not fit us. We'll be disciplined in what we invest. If it's too expensive, we're going to walk away and we'll be disciplined. It's really important in the capacity and the speed to integrate these things.", "I think that our growth team is quietly doing a excellent job at this. I'm very proud of them. They're not going to stop now and they're working really hard at it.", "The acquisitions we got, you see it fit us well. We're integrating them I think effectively and quickly. They are in markets where you see substantial growth in public funding with the private side being healthy. They also \u2013 some really talented people we got with those and we will welcome them to the Vulcan family.", "So, we look at a lot of acquisitions. We look at a lot both very large and very small. But again, we're going to be picky about it because it has to fit us on all kinds of ways and we have to be good about integrating. So, like I said, pipeline is healthy. We'll continue to plug at it. And whether large or small, we're going to look at them and we're going to analyze them.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.", "Thanks again, Tom.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think a lot of people don't realize, but we're always working on this. And we've done 20 acquisitions since the recovery began. So this isn't really new news for us. It's just always working at it, always being disciplined and it's just \u2013 we've got great organic growth, great organic margin expansion. It's just a really important strategic complement and something our teams that drive this have done a great job of for a while, but it's not really new news.", "Again, we've done 20 external transactions since the recovery began. And on top of that, we have, we think, a pretty exciting set of internal growth investment opportunities, internally developed new railyard positions, new reserve positions or reserve expansions. They were also excited about, and that is a deployment of capital have again attractive returns. So, I'd say expect us to keep doing what we've been doing. And as Tom said, keep the discipline.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, John. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens, Incorporated.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Morning, Trey.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Just a few quick questions. I guess on the California weather, a lot of focus on that obviously, but how should we be thinking about the timing of that coming through? Could we see it? It's mostly being achieved in 2Q. It sounds like activity definitely picked up there once the weather has started to cooperate. And I know that work's just kind of pushed to the right. So, just trying to figure out how quickly that could come back and any way to think about the magnitude of tons there.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "It came. It started coming back in March as soon as it dried out and that's a testimony to the work being there and people ready to go. So, I don't \u2013 I would tell you that it'll flow through fairly naturally. I mean, maybe a little bit back-half loaded just because you've got \u2013 you're running the bottlenecks with people and equipment out there on the road and now ready-mix folks can get out or lay down machines.", "But I would tell you that it will flow through. A lot of that work, depending on weather, is going to happen this year. I don't think \u2013 depending on what happened, normal weather cycles in California will be fine, but it's probably a little back-half loaded.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. And you gave us an impact, I think, to the cash gross profit from that rainfall on page 5 of the presentation. Any idea or maybe you could translate that for us into tonnage just so it can help us with our modeling?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Well, first of all, that's really not the impact of volume; that's the impact of the flooding on our operations and the cost to handle that flooding and the damage of that flooding.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Got it.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "So that was not an impact of business delay. It was an impact of pits creeks running into pits and primary has been flooded and things like that. As we said, volumes were down 20% in January, February.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Right.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "March started to return. So from an earnings perspective and volumes perspective, I think we're going to be fine in California.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. And then...", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And probably just to \u2013 again, just to be clear, that little bit of cost we put in there, as Tom said, that's just direct operating cost impact pumping flooded quarries, processing wet material. It's not the cost of, call it, lower fixed cost absorption, did lower volumes and it's not the cost of just the loss margin on absolutely lower volumes.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. That is helpful.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "We just want to give you what we could fairly directly see and measure.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Understood. Got it. And then, on the \u2013 Tom, you mentioned projects with high \u2013 I think you called it high and lumpy demand that will kick off in 2017. I know that you guys have kind of been tracking all of this stuff for a little while and those things can move around. Can you give us any more color on those projects specifically? I think you talked about some big projects in Georgia and Carolinas.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. Let me just kind of run out kind of big projects by state off the top of my head.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "That'd be helpful.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "You got the I-85 widening in Virginia, which is about 1 million-ton job. We'll probably, and this is an estimate, do 400,000, 450,000 tons of that. North Carolina, you got I-85 widening, again that's 1.2 million job, which a third of it will go this year. South Carolina, you got I-85, I-385 interchange.", "I mentioned the six projects in Atlanta \u2013 or in Georgia, rather. That's some 5 million tons and probably be 20%, 30% of that this year. These are all \u2013 this is work that's been booked and we're shipping. It'll start this year.", "Texas, you've got a number of jobs. The biggest one is probably right now. You got \u2013 two biggest ones will be US 281 widening in San Antonio, which is 1.3 million tons. It'll start in the third quarter. We'll start shipping on that job in the third quarter. Job that has not been awarded yet is the Grand Parkway in Houston, which is \u2013 that's 1.5 million-, 2-million-ton job.", "You've got Arizona Loop 202. That's over 2 million-ton job which we'll start shipping this year. And in California, you've got the Fresno, the Highway 180, which is bidding right now and it's a 1.5 million-ton job, so just to give you a little flavor. And those will \u2013 it's always with big work like that.", "You'll have times where we will get real hot and then times where we will have a lull, depending on what was going on on the roads specifically on that job at the time. When I say lumpy, that's what I mean. They'll call you up and say you'll be shipping fast and furious for a month and then you'll slow down for two weeks.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got it. All right. Well, thanks for the color. Super helpful.", "And then, I guess a little bit bigger picture, taking a step back and looking a little bit maybe longer term. With the pickup that we're seeing in a lot of your markets and the pickup we're expected to see over the next 12-plus months \u2013 12, 24-plus months, do you guys see any bottlenecks or capacity constraints either at the mine or even maybe downstream, which could limit or cap the activity in any of your markets, just as we look at the recovery and kind of the cadence of getting back to something close to normal for you?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I'll start with our capabilities. I think that as far as big jobs go, we've worked real hard to get our plants and our people in shape. We're ready to go.", "Now, they're maybe in spot markets with certain clean stone sizes, you will see shortages of certain sizes. It's not a worry though. We have the firepower, we're not close to capacity and we'll be able to supply whatever comes at us, both whether that's aggregates or ready-mix or hot mix. And we've worked real hard with this over the last year to get ready because we saw this coming.", "Now, when you move to the roadway, you are going to see some bottlenecks. You will see some labor bottlenecks out there with paving crews and ready-mix trucks and ready-mix drivers. And I think in a lot of markets, we will see that. And, at times, that will create bottlenecks they'll overcome on.", "But again, you will have \u2013 we talk to a lot of customers and a lot of them are working really hard to get people on board right now and trained. I mean, new people because experienced people are tough to find out there. And a lot of our customers have really invested in their training programs to have folks ready to be able to pave these roads. It'll come and go with some shortages.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "All right. Thanks for that, Tom, and thanks for sneaking me in here at the end of the call. I appreciate it and good luck with the rest of the quarter.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go to Scott Schrier with Citi.", "Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "(56:26-56:29) taking my questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more on California and I could appreciate the fact that there's not going to be much impact from SB 1 in 2017, but how much of that was embedded in your thought process given that it's still by \u2013 was by no means a shoo-in to past. It's been around for a while and barely past this time.", "And then, alternatively on California, I was wondering if you could talk about the state and local measures. And what's the opportunity set in timing of things like measure and \u2013 which is the biggest maybe some of the other local ballot measures there?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. So, as far as our confidence in SB 1, we said over the last two years, it wasn't if, it was when and the need was just that big in California. This is a parallel theme across many, many states and we've seen it many, many times. And actually, this is a parallel theme for the country.", "There is a lot of public support for infrastructure spending and now there's starting to be a lot of political support for infrastructure spending. These are big plays in California, Tennessee and what's going to happen in South Carolina, they're almost ready to pass their bill. This will continue to happen across other Vulcan states and other states throughout the country, but it's also going to happen at some point in time on a national level.", "Back to your question on Measure M, Measure M and which is in Los Angeles, is about $860 million per year. Measure B, which is Santa Clara County, is $210 million per year. And then the BART Bond is about $200 million. Total that up, that's $1.2 billion a year in just local funding on top of the $9 billion that moved from $3.75 billion to $9 billion in the state.", "And the point is California's infrastructure system is broken right now, and we are very pleased that the public and the elected officials have had the wisdom and the foresight to do something about it because it will really affect their economy if they didn't. So, I'm not sure our crystal ball told us when it was going to happen, but we knew it had to happen.", "Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "I want to ask the cash gross profit question a different way. It looks like based on your commentary not accounting for fixed cost absorption, if I add that $14 million back, it looks we're at about 5% cash gross profit growth, 60% incremental margin.", "To me, that sounds like it's really setting a floor for what the year could be. Is that an accurate way to look it at or are we going to have any more cost related to, say, the ships or stripping or that $0.28 you called out for labor and repair? Or should that really be not part of the equation going forward?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I'll start and I want to start again probably the most important point, which is to point you to full-year guidance because you can get twisted around in our business if you're trying to extrapolate just from Q1 unit margin numbers, given how low it is in volume and how low it is in total gross profit. And by the way, I would say the same thing if we had a blowout high number on one of these metrics in the first quarter. So just extrapolating from Q1 is just a little bit faulty to start with.", "But to answer your question a different way, has anything changed about our view of 60% flow-throughs over time? No. Has anything changed in our full-year expectations for improvement in unit margins, whether gross profit per ton or cash gross profit per ton? No. Are we still on track with the kind of cash gross per ton improvements that tie back to our $2 billion goal at normal demand? Yes, we absolutely are.", "Those things haven't changed. The conditions are in place. The pricing environment is positive. Our long-term cost control has been actually exceptionally good. And so, even though during the balance of the year and these were incorporated into our beginning-of-year plans, we will have higher stripping costs this year than we did last year. We do expect to have higher diesel cost this year than we did last year. It's not a surprise that we're transitioning in our ships and that'll have some cost, but those things we should be able to overcome in this environment.", "And really, that continuous compounding improvement you've heard us talk about and the quality of execution that you heard Tom talk about, which is reflected in our safety metrics also, those are all things that give us confidence that if you were to look at it from our chair, if you look at the operating metrics the way we're able to look at them at a plant level, plant-by-plant, you'd basically see that we're on track with our plans. And those plans have margin improvement for the full year.", "Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. If I can sneak one last one in there, you called out the 10% pricing in Georgia. I'm curious of how that compares to maybe some of those surrounding states in the Southeast, if you can talk about the magnitude of the pricing you're getting in those states.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I'll start. Tom may want to add. We try to call out a few sometimes to give you flavor, but we don't like to walk through pricing in an individual market, individual state basis too much probably for some obvious reasons.", "One of the reasons we called out Georgia and California in addition to just having high pricing is really they're places where you have very good visibility. So, you've had the kind of public funding passed, you've got better visibility to forward demand, and you see that kind of growth.", "I would say that price increases are widespread. They're widespread across the Southeast. I would say that they vary by degree, but that is much about a moment in time as the long-term trend. And the margin improvement across the Southeast, when Tom was talking about our core Southeastern franchise kind of humming, it's not just on the top line. It's really throughout the P&L. We like what we see. Those are very profitable well-run positions for us and we're excited about what we see.", "Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "To add to that, places like South Carolina and Tennessee who have always had good pricing momentum for a number of years now, the visibility of those highway bills will only help that.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "What's really nice about that is those are long-term demand drivers.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And this isn't really a comment on pricing, but just to be complete, just make sure we're also calling out some of the slower places, if you will. Alabama, still a little bit slower in terms of demand. Mississippi, still a little bit slower. Louisiana for a cycle had a lot of large projects, so I don't know exactly what I'd read on that. We like the outlook next year there.", "Tennessee has really started to improve quite a bit. We talked about that. Kentucky, still slow. Illinois, we talked a lot about, structurally a little bit slower, but I'll tell you our team there has done a great job driving profitability improvement in a market that doesn't have a ton of growth.", "So, those are some of the places. If you wanted places that from an overall demand picture are a little bit slower, that we'd call out.", "Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thank you. Congrats on the progress and good luck.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll now take a question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yes. Hi, good morning. Good afternoon.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Hey, Jerry.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "At your Analyst Day, you folks spoke about just the cadence of new construction starts driving weakness in the business in the back half of last year. And I'm wondering, based on your updated assessment of what you're seeing on the ground, have we turned the corner? In other words, how broad based is the visibility improvement that you folks are seeing now compared to six to nine months ago? Can you just flesh that out for us?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. As John said, I think for the full year, we're very confident in our guidance, maybe for timing of jobs and even the stuff we talked about California, maybe a little back-half loaded. We're off to a good start. And I think we're off to a good start not only on demand but also the prep work we've done to get ourselves ready.", "Our markets are looking healthy. The private non-res side, which we talked about in Investor Day, that was coming is starting to flow through. We talked about that in California and the jobs \u2013 the big highway work, which is the FAST Act and state funding just beginning to flow through are starting. So, I think what we're seeing is what we predicted in Investor Day.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Jerry, the only big color I would add I think on the start data and kind of what we see on the ground is \u2013 and then I'll try and compare and contrast the year-ago.", "A year ago, we were beginning to see some start activity weaken and it continued to weaken, let's call it, through July at least. What we're seeing now hopefully is the benefits of its strengthening since that time. And in Vulcan markets, as opposed to the country overall, obviously residential start activity I think is well-covered. People see that.", "Private non-res start activity continuing to improve in Vulcan markets. I think it's down in non-Vulcan markets, but it's improving in our markets. We want to see that continuing.", "Public transportation starts improving in Vulcan markets. So the trajectory is good. We want to see it continue, Jerry. But the trajectory is much more positive, if you will, than it would have been this time a year ago.", "The one thing I'd say and you know this well I think, we will have a lot better visibility to that in our call about the second quarter. It's just will be that much further into construction season DOTs will be kicking off their new year. We'll actually see which projects are really moving at what schedule. So, I know it's awkward, but we just really do have better underground visibility when we next talk than we do right now. All the signals are clear.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And what...", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "They will know more as we get little further into construction season.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And lastly, you spoke about the run rate for $35 million on the acquisitions that you've made year-to-date. Can you just talk about what proportion of that is synergies versus the underlying business? And then, the acquisitions that you're valuating from here, can you just give us a rough label for how much is that in new markets versus existing Vulcan markets?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I'll start and maybe Tom will chime in. And just for the sake of clarity, so when I refer to the $35 million of run rate, that's against the six bolt-ons we've done for roughly $230 million since the third quarter of last year.", "A portion of that was in our beginning-of-year guidance and plan as we discussed in our previous call. I'd say there's probably $10 million to $15 million of additional EBITDA for the 2017 year that wasn't in our prior communications from these acquisitions. A lot of that will depend on pace of integration. But again in the context of our overall plan, it's not a major shift. But at kind of full integration \u2013 not yet full synergy probably, but full integration \u2013 we see contribution of about $35 million from those assets. That's an EBITDA number. And of course, we'd expect long-term growth beyond that initial run rate.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "As far as where they are, all of these are either in or adjacent to existing markets or there is, in the case of asphalt and concrete, extensions of our aggregates business. And so, they do a number of things when we get the right ones. They expand our franchise, they protect the franchise and they expand profitability. So we're very pleased with what we got.", "Operator", "I do apologize, his line is having an issue. I will go next to Brent Thielman with D. A. Davidson.", "Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thank you. Just a quick question, Tom. The comment about the California 20% below normalized levels at pretty big states, when you look at it kind of where you play specifically, are there even wider margins in that? Because I think about the Bay Area, which might be a little later in the cycle, and maybe Southern California isn't.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. The Bay Area is probably a little further in the cycle, but not a lot. And I'd say, as I said earlier, the marked improvement in how we're funding, which is more than a doubling over time, will raise the per capita average in that state just because it's such a big jump.", "I think that as we look at it, again, California has all the pieces that Texas did four, five years ago. The private side continues to be very healthy. It would seem the non-res really started to kick in this year. Residential is healthy.", "So, I think as we move forward, it will be a steady pace in California. It's not going to be a big jump and a part of that is also because these highway funds phase in, in about like $0.25 billion and then they work up over full-year timeframe. Actually over time, these continue to grow.", "So, I think you'll see really healthy steady growth over time, which also creates a good environment for pricing and for improved margins.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And to a question that was asked earlier, we and the overall, call it, construction sector like the very long-term nature of this. You've heard us talk about a preference for long-term solutions in the federal side. The long-term nature of this helps our customers make those investments in additional capacity, whether that's staff or equipment, and it's a much better environment for us than I'm going to call out a one- or two-year stimulus type approach. We really like the long-term nature of this in California. And the funding sources are very predictable and it's just a very good resolution for the state and for suppliers like us.", "Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. In terms of the growth in business development, kind of the way you guys are thinking longer term in nature, is California a market where there's a lot more room to grow in terms of acquiring quality assets and finding the right markets? I mean, it's kind of the big kahuna there already.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. Well, California \u2013 and we work all the time hard on California, we made a number of acquisitions in California over the last four years, both in asphalt and in the aggregates business. If you remember, we also got out of the ready-mix concrete business and swapped it for asphalt assets in California, Arizona, which was a very good move for us strategically.", "I think there are plenty of opportunities in California. You also got to remember with a big growing demand in California, there is a marked shortage of resources in these big growth markets. We've worked hard over the last decade plus to make sure that we permitted and grew our reserve base and have reserves for generations, not just for the short term. And with this big highway fund, that will put pressure over time on reserves from some of other folks in California and I think we have a very good position in these big growth quarters with long-term reserves.", "Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. Thank you. Best of luck.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you. Listen, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan. As you can tell, John and I and the team are very excited about what we see ahead of us, both on the public side and the private side, and we see those opportunities now stretching from California to the Sun Belt, to our core Southeast businesses, up to Mid-Atlantic.", "So, we've got a great start to the year. We look forward to talking to you on the next call and update you on our progress on growing Vulcan Materials Company. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's call.

My name is Elaine and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.", "And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.", "Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website, vulcanmaterials.com. You can access this presentation from the Investor Relations homepage of the website.", "Please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. As you saw in our earnings release, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a major impact on Vulcan's operations and results and this occurred across a significant portion of our more profitable markets. Absent these hurricanes, our results would have been in line with the expectations set forth in our second quarter call.", "Adjusting for the extreme and prolonged bad weather, our daily shipments rates in our Aggregates segment, for example, were up at least 7% in August and September over August and September of last year. Looking ahead to 2018, we see the conditions in place for a continued gradual recovery in materials demand, for solid organic growth in our shipments and for return to the incremental flow-throughs and compounding unit margin improvements that have characterized our business for quite some time.", "I'll now share a bit more insight into the quarter and underlying trends and then John will touch on some preliminary perspectives as we look ahead to 2018. The quarter's extreme weather impacted our shipments and margins significantly, disrupting operations from Texas across the Southeast. This included shipments from our Calica quarry in Mexico.", "We estimate that the aggregates shipments were lower by at least 1.5 million tons during the quarter. In addition to the immediate impact of shipping days lost due to evacuations, storms and extended power outages, we and our customers have been working through the lingering effects of labor market disruptions, haul truck shortages and other logistical challenges. This has been in addition to the necessity of prioritizing debris removal and other recovery work.", "The storms also impacted our reporting pricing and margins, particularly in our Aggregates segment. Part of the effect can be attributed to geographic mix as we lost volume in several of our more profitable markets and operations. But we also experienced higher energy costs and lower labor and production efficiencies. And we experienced lower utilization rates of our ships and other distribution assets along with a series of storm-related repair costs.", "In certain cases, the impacts of the storms on our margins were exacerbated by the operating decisions we had made in anticipation of strong shipment growth. For example, we had recently added to our staffing levels at a number of facilities which then experienced significant shutdowns or drops in production versus plan. The storm's impacts have been far reaching. After Harvey, for example, our business in Phoenix experienced pressure on sales volumes due to a shortage of haul trucks. Drivers almost immediately had shifted to Houston to service FEMA's debris removal work.", "Although our plant operations did not suffer any lasting damage from the hurricanes, these were major events. And it will take some time for our business in coastal Texas and other Gulf Coast states, including all of Florida, to return to normal. Now we're back serving our customers across these markets, but we're shipping a different mix of material and generally a lower price/mix of material to different sorts of jobs than prior to the storms.", "In addition, we and our customers in these markets continue to face tight labor and logistical constraints. It is certainly possible that the recovery work associated with these storms will generate incremental demand for our materials over time. For example, a number of key legislative leaders in Texas are pressing for significant investment in flood control infrastructure. But for the balance of 2017, we don't expect to fully recover shipments lost in the third quarter.", "Certain markets, including coastal Texas, the Gulf Coast and Florida, continued to experience a drag on growth and unit profitability into the fourth quarter. As a result, we now expect full year aggregates shipments of 181 million tons and full year EBITDA of $1 billion. But the underlying trends and the very attractive fundamentals of our business remain unchanged. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, our daily shipment rates in August and September, adjusting for hurricane impacts, were consistent with the 5% to 10% balance of the year expectation discussed in our second quarter call.", "Public construction activity has disappointed in 2017 as state DOTs and contractors have struggled for a wide range of reasons to meet schedules. But given the shift to higher levels of legislated and dedicated transportation infrastructure funding, this would appear to be a temporary decline before an extended period of growth. From today's levels, demand has much further to recover and our shipments have much further to grow.", "The pricing climate also remains constructive, with pricing improvements consistent and widespread across the business. Trailing 12-month average selling prices have improved in 15 of our 19 general manager areas. Adjusted for mix and acquisition impacts, freight-adjusted average selling prices year-to-date have increased approximately 5% over the prior year. In terms of core profitability, on a same-store basis, while third quarter gross profit per ton was essentially flat, our cash gross profit per ton in our key legacy Aggregates segments was a third quarter record of $6.45 and that's despite the headwinds I've mentioned.", "In short, we remain well set up to convert incremental materials demand into incremental earnings and cash flow growth. And last but hardly least, as another indicator of the quality of our local performance, our safety results for the third quarter represented a new record for the company. Our 2017 MSHA/OSHA reportable injuries have dropped by a third compared to last year. Our MSHA incident rate is approximately half that of the industry rate. That's a world class achievement and a credit to our people who are focused on superior safety performance just as they are focused on superior operating performance every day.", "Now, I'll hand it over to John to cover some of our preliminary thinking about our positioning heading into 2018.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks, Tom. Before commenting on 2018, we'd like to clarify that our planning process for next year remains in its initial stages. Right now, we're frankly focused on finishing the current year strong. So we'll give guidance for 2018 during our next earnings call and not today. But we thought it would be helpful to share some early thoughts regarding how we currently see the stage being set for next year.", "Starting with the demand environment, we currently see mid-single-digit growth in 2018 over 2017. The recovery in private construction activity remains strong across the vast majority of our portfolio. And public construction demand appears to be firming up with most markets poised for low single-digit growth in 2018, a clear and positive contrast with the relative weakness experienced in 2016 and 2017.", "With respect to public construction, a key will remain the pace at which state DOTs and contractors can start and complete planned work and work deferred from 2017. Our backlogs and our order flows relative to public construction work, particularly highways, continue to build, suggesting some upside to the current outlook if delays experienced in 2017 don't repeat in 2018.", "And, certainly, we'd hope for some normalization of weather in 2018 leading to an effective gain in the number of available construction and materials shipment days. Breaking it down geographically, 2018 may be a year of haves and have-nots. The have-nots would include Illinois, Kentucky and Alabama. These states combined may see modest declines in demand due primarily to weak public spending. Opportunities for price gains in these states may also be limited.", "Our other states, the haves, would appear poised to see growth in both private and public demand, with private being the larger driver of 2018 shipment growth. Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida and California should all see demand continue to recover toward longer-term norms. And although further along in its recovery, we anticipate continued growth in Texas, driven by ongoing growth in private demand, along with several large highway projects recently booked.", "We expect the pricing climate to remain positive across these states also, although some may see a more moderate rate of expansion as individual markets adjust after multiple years of steady increases. Georgia, in particular, should benefit from a strong combination of public and private demand growth in 2018. California demand also looks poised to continue its recovery, with 2018 driven mostly by private work, with the benefits of new public funding coming late in the year and into 2019 and beyond. Given this visibility, California pricing for heavy materials should continue to improve at a healthy pace.", "From a cost and profitability perspective, certain of the headwinds experienced in 2017 should not repeat in 2018. Examples would include costs related to transitioning to our new ships, costs related to California floods and wildfires and, of course, the costs Tom referred to relating to the recent hurricanes. So, as Tom mentioned, the business should be well-positioned to convert even mid-single digit demand growth into solid organic growth in earnings and cash flows. And the business should also benefit moving forward from the capital allocation decisions we've made over the past few years.", "During 2017, we expect to reinvest approximately $300 million into core operating CapEx, consistent with our prior guidance. During 2016, we reinvested approximately $250 million. These investments improve the longer-term efficiency, capacity and flexibility of our production and support strong customer service. Having made these investments over the past few years, we expect the level of reinvestment per ton of production to moderate moving forward.", "Core operating CapEx in 2018 may be lower than in 2017. Our growth capital investments have also performed well. For example, acquisitions closed since the beginning of 2016 with a total consideration of approximately $245 million should contribute approximately $35 million to our EBITDA in 2018. To clarify, these figures do not include any impact from our announced transaction with Aggregates USA.", "With the close of the Aggregates USA transaction, we will have invested over $1.5 billion in long-term growth since 2013, while further strengthening our portfolio through divestitures and swaps. And while making these investments, we've maintained an investment grade credit position consistent with our stated goals, while extending the weighted average duration of our debt, lowering the weighted average interest rate and retaining excellent liquidity. We retain the flexibility to fund smart growth investments, internal and external, as we move forward.", "Tom, back over to you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks, John. Let me continue briefly on the topic of capital allocation and specifically growth investments. As we all know, our industry has seen a good bit of M&A activity recently. The long-term growth prospects for heavy materials in the U.S. attract capital from around the world.", "At Vulcan, we continue to evaluate a number of M&A opportunities and we're also pursuing a target set of greenfield core investments and expansions to our distribution network. But, as you heard me say before, we're going to remain disciplined. We're going to stay focused on those assets for which we are the best owner. We're going to remain patient and disciplined when it comes to valuation and we're going to create and capture the synergies.", "Our planned acquisition of Aggregates USA fits our criteria for investment. The DOJ review continues to move forward as expected. As we noted when the transaction was announced, we anticipate divesting the Tennessee assets. We're hopeful that the transaction will close during the fourth quarter and we look forward to discussing this transaction in more detail once it is closed. Now, I'd like to close our prepared remarks with a quick look again at the fundamentals.", "After a quarter so disrupted by hurricanes, it may be helpful to step back and consider the dynamics of the business we're in and where we stand currently. In the trailing 12 months, we've shipped 180 million tons. Now prior to The Great Recession, you have to go back nearly 20 years to 1998 to find a year when our shipments were so low a level. And in the meantime, we've seen nearly 20 years of economic and population growth in our markets, where we've continued to grow strategically with an eye on the long game. So, obviously, we see big upside as demand returns to levels that are defined normal consumption patterns over multiple decades.", "And not only do we have the benefit of our 2017 asset base, we also have the benefit of our 2017 margin structure. Our gross profit per ton today is $4.78 versus $2.11 in 1998. That's about a 4.4% compounded annual improvement in unit profitability over that nearly 20-year period. These are strong fundamentals of our basic but essential construction aggregates franchise and they haven't changed. If anything they've strengthened, thus, our focus on organic growth and discipline and local execution and our focus on continuous compounding improvements to our customer service and our unit profitability.", "All of the fundamentals for strengthening demand are in place. Private construction in our markets remains strong. And while public construction has been a disappointment in 2017, the need and the demand is there. And the legislation and funding is in place and growing in many of our best markets. As we head into 2018, we have more visibility regarding that demand.", "And now, we'll be happy to answer any of your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our first question today from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. Thank you. First question is just on the preliminary outlook for 2018 actually, just wondering on the cost side. Is it possible to quantify the costs that you believe will not repeat in 2018 and what that potential benefit might be?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Garik, it's John. I'll start, but I think right now, it's not \u2013 I think it's a little bit early to do that. We'll try to be maybe a little more clear when we gave official guidance in February. What I would say is we clearly did not see any reason that with a return to even moderate shipment growth we won't return to the 60% flow-throughs and continuous compounding improvement in unit margin that really characterize our aggregates franchise. So \u2013 and certainly there should be some opportunity for improvement. I think that goes without saying. But I think it'd be inappropriate a little bit early to try and quantify right now.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. That's fair. Just wanted to -", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "To give total color on that. I think what we won't see is, as we said in the statements the impact of the ships \u2013 obviously we're not going to see the impact of the storms, which were very disruptive for us.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah, exactly. And my question I think was trying to address, if there was a dollar amount attached to the ships and the storms and the fires in California, but understand if it's a little bit early to provide specifics around that. I guess, secondly, is on the price/mix headwinds that you called out in the third quarter. Can you help us understand a little bit more how to think about that into the fourth quarter and then maybe even to 2018? How long you would anticipate some of those headwinds to persist on the pricing side?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I think in a short period of time, any number of things could affect pricing. That could be product mix, geographic mix, timing of jobs and even the impact of two big storms. I think the key fact when it comes to pricing is that the fundamentals of pricing of aggregates hasn't changed and it's probably better now. You've got to remember as we always say that pricing is an ultra-local business and that local pricing is a campaign that compounds over time. If you look at the slides that we had for this call we've seen price increases every month for the past five years. On a trailing 12-month basis the price has gone up. And that's just a great example of that campaign. But to put a little color on it for you, let me contrast some markets. If you look at Georgia, which is one of our strongest markets both in the public side and the private side, even though volumes have been out a little bit, we saw \u2013 due to timing of jobs and the weather impact, we've seen pricing up double-digit in 2016 and double-digit in 2017.", "And you contrast that to coastal Texas, where we're further along in the cycle. In fact, we saw \u2013 a number of reasons over the last 18 months we saw business probably dip some there. We've seen high single-digit pricing every year for five years till 2017, saw it tail off a little bit in 2017, but believe that it will pick right back up in 2018. And then you contrast that to California, which is in the relatively early stages of recovery with the private side healthy, the public side has not come on, but coming on, we've seen \u2013 over the last two years, we've seen high single-digit range to low double-digit pricing. And we'll see very good pricing there in 2018. So, as we always say, remember that pricing is a \u2013 it's ultra-local. It's a campaign over time. And the proof of that is that slide where you see very month pricing improvement over five years. So I think, from our perspective, we're very confident that the fundamentals of pricing improvement are sound.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And then my last question is just you called out California and Georgia both in the prepared remarks and just now as being strong markets. You also talked about labor constraints as impacting the level of volume growth in 2017. Just wondering if there is any risk that you could see with respect to labor in those two states as impacting demand into the next year. Or from that standpoint or from a timing standpoint, do you see relatively less risk in those states despite the growth outlook?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Garik, I'll start. On Georgia, we'll be coming off a year that had \u2013 it was very disappointing in Georgia on the public side and much of that work deferred into next year. So, assuming that some of the same extraneous events don't happen in 2018 that happened in 2017, storms, major interchange, burning down, those kind of things, I think, by the time we work it through off the lower base, we should be okay. The challenge I think in Georgia as we look at it \u2013 and I think the same is probably true for California at these levels \u2013 is less labor constraint, per se, and more about normalization of weather, a number of available days, and a little bit more just about the success the DOT and large contractors are going to have in getting scheduled work started and done.", "And labor is a part of that, but so is permitting, so is a variety of other things. And so that's what we'll be really keeping a close eye on in those two markets and the many others as we move between now and giving official guidance is what can we see on the public side that relates to work not just being funded, not just being scheduled, not just being slated, but actually moving dirt and taking shipments from us. And that's what we'll be keeping a close eye on.", "Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. We take our next question from Trey Grooms of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning, Trey.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "I guess my first one is on obviously the impact of the storms in the third quarter. And then you noted or I guess in the press release you noted that it's a lingering effect that you're seeing. I mean it's not surprising that that's impacting 4Q, but what's the expectation as far as how long that can kind of go on, this lingering effect that you call out? I mean you think most of it will be behind us in the 4Q or could that kind of inch its way into next year as well?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I think let me talk a little about those effects for a minute. They're pretty hard to quantify, but I'll try to give you some color on it. We're still seeing some impact on shipments of product splits across a number of our markets and to give \u2013 really in the residential sector. So, we're just not shipping \u2013 or our customers, our ready-mix customers, aren't shipping like they were before the storm really to residential, some non-res, mainly residential. And I'm sure that's a mix of where the labor is and just getting back to normal.", "So some volume and some price impact there. Cost continues to be impacted. For example, we have the light load or split ships in the Houston, Beaumont today. We're waiting to dredge those two facilities from the storm. That dredging cost is going to be $2 million plus and we don't know when we're going to get them dredged just because there's that much pressure and demand to get everything dredged from the Gulf Coast. So while it's hard to quantify, we're still being impacted. I believe this will work out. I don't think it will drag much impact into 2018. I think it will be worked out in the next 60 days.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Trey, as I'm sure you and many others well know, while we are back shipping in many of these affected markets, we are not shipping the same product mix to do the same type of jobs. And so it will take a while. We think it will be mostly worked through in Q4. So we're back and operational but it's not like life is back to normal for the people who are displaced out of their homes in Houston, for example.", "The only thing I would say, Trey, just on guidance for the balance of the year. Those lingering effects are certainly one of the reasons that we reduced guidance. Obviously, third quarter results contributed. Q4 will be impacted. At least early October is impacted by Tropical Storm Nate. So, you take the lingering effects, you take Nate, you take the normal uncertainty around fourth quarter weather and those were all the things that kind of contributed to our lowering our guidance to the place we did.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Got it. And just \u2013 I don't know if you can give any color around this, but the guidance for volume that's implied in the 4Q kind of, I guess, low single-digit type volume. Can you take a stab at what might that have looked like excluding these things in the 4Q or the impact of these things in the 4Q? I mean you were able to kind of strip it out a little bit for August and September. Didn't know if there was any color you could give us on your -", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I think it would be back toward the guidance we gave you in the second quarter and what we saw in the first couple weeks of August. And we were excited about that, saw some of the big jobs have been waiting on start-up. So, I think we'd have been within that second quarter guidance.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Which was -", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "So, Trey, that's for 5% to 10% up over the prior year. That's kind of what we see is the underlying momentum in those periods of time when you can get a clean look at it.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Yeah. Got it. Okay. And then lastly for me, on the 2018 kind of outlook for the demand environment I just want to be sure. I understand mid-single-digit demand growth for aggregates. That's in your market specifically, if I understand right. Is that kind of the view there?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yes.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yes.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "And then with you guys and the M&A that you've done \u2013 not talking about Aggregates USA, but the other M&A that you've already closed presumably you guys would \u2013 if for no other reason simply from the M&A standpoint you should outperform the overall end market at minimum because of that, right?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yes.", "Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.", "Great. That's it for me. I'll pass it on. Thanks a lot guys and good-bye.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We take our next question from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning, Jerry.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Hey, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "I'm wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing on the highway side. I guess overall it's our perception that activity levels in terms of capital actually getting spent this year was generally light despite very strong DOT budgets. And I'm just wondering what's your assessment on what's driving the delay in terms of appropriations translating into a meaningful pick-up in highway activity for your business. What do you expect that to look like in 2018?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. As you know, that's been a frustration for us in 2017 and one that we thought would have shift or would have flowed through the FAST Act some of the DOT funding would have flowed through earlier in 2017. Our miss in 2017 was the public work. The private side of the business was very strong, very good. It's up and will be up in 2018. If you look at the public side today, I think, our visibility is a lot better than it was a year ago. Our public backlogs are up considerably and our order flows are up and improving on public work. And we began shipping on a number of the large jobs that we had anticipated shipping much earlier in the year. So I believe and I know our visibility to public work for 2018 is much improved.", "I could give you a list of 10 major projects around the country, which we thought would have shipped second quarter, at least beginning of third quarter, but are now shipping. Three examples I'll give you would be I-85 widening in Charlotte, which is over 1 million tons. The much talked about 285/400 interchange in Atlanta is now shipping. That's a multi-million \u2013 that's 2 million ton job. And then we've also in the past talked about I-16 and 75 widening in Macon got delayed due to right-of-way issues and also some permitting issues. That's a 0.5 million ton done, which we now began shipping. So, with shipping all these jobs, our timing, our insight, our visibility of timing and the pace of shipping is much clearer than maybe what was six to 12 months ago.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "And I'm wondering if you folks can comment on California specifically where we've heard some optimism that the SB 1 bill could translate into spending sooner than initially anticipated based on how tax revenue collection is going and the urgency to put capital in the ground. Based on what you're seeing when do you think you start to see the benefit of SB 1 in your business?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I think California really is exciting place for us and, again, the private side is strong, been strong. Both non-res and res are very healthy there. And now we've got SB 1. Back in the summer, Caltrans announced $1 billion of accelerated funding. And then, in October, they announced the 90 fix-it-first transportation, or $3.4 billion of accelerated spending. And that second announcement includes 1,200 lane miles of pavement, replacing or repairing 66 bridges, and a number of like 300 culvert and drainage repairs or replacements. Most of that will come \u2013 you'll see a little bit of that probably in 2018, most will come 2019 and 2020. Obviously overlays will go faster but I think with all of this remember it takes normally two years to flow through. We've seen it in a number of bills. Now they'll get some of that accelerated and start shipping because there's a lot of public pressure to fix the roads in California.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "So, Jerry, just to help you with the math on that a little bit and others. As we look toward 2018, California shipment growth is still driven almost entirely by private growth in our current outlook. The efforts at Caltrans to pull projects forward are very good news, but pulling them forward doesn't mean we're shipping on them in early 2018. It means they're starting the work on the project. And so should benefit us maybe some late in the year. But it's not something that we have baked in for 2018, if you will.", "Back on California, stepping back just a little bit, we continue to think California looks a lot like Texas did four or five years ago. And as you heard Tom say and you heard me say, that's reflected in what should be a pretty darn constructive pricing climate, not only for our products, but for all heavy materials in California as we look toward next year. And it's really at that different stage of the cycle, so we're excited about it. But 2018 will still be largely private-oriented. Maybe with a little bit of upside if the public comes a little bit sooner but we think that's more 2019, 2020 and for many years beyond.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Phil Ng of Jefferies has our next question. Please go ahead.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC", "You called out project delays and logistical issues at the DOT last quarter. Have you seen any improvement on that front and any lift from FAST? It doesn't sound like there's much. And, separately, you're calling for a low single-digit growth in public spending next year. Is that generally in line with what you expected coming into the year? Thanks.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I'll kind of play back the story on expectations because again, I think, the theme is that in 2017 public has been the disappointment. At the beginning of 2017, we and others would have expected mid-single digit growth in public demand. What we have seen in 2017 and probably will have seen by the end of the year is mid-single digit decline in demand. So, as Tom said, that's where the miss is.", "The important thing is as we look to 2018 we actually see firming up and a return to growth in public spending and public demand across really all of our footprint, with the exceptions that I noted of Alabama, Kentucky, and Illinois.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC", "Got you.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And that's very good for the overall health of our business. We don't have in that mid-single digit growth outlook for next year, which again preliminary. We'll revise it between now and when we give official guidance. As you noted, that's not predicated on a huge jump in public spending. That's predicated on stabilized, low-mid, low-single-digit growth in public spending. So if people are able to get projects out the door more quickly, when that begins to accelerate, there could be a little bit of upside to that. But we don't see it happening certainly in the first half of 2018 yet. Something we'll keep a close eye on.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I think back to our earlier comments is the visibility of the jobs that we've got started and that we know we're going to ship. And the ones that we haven't, we don't know yet. We just don't know the timing of them.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC", "Got you. And then I guess just one last one. I mean coming into the year, there's certainly a lot of euphoria with this administration pushing through an infrastructure bill. But just given some of the delays in \u2013 whether it's healthcare, tax reform, has that lack of clarity in D.C. led to any delays in projects and funding getting pushed out? Thanks.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "No, it hasn't. And as we said before, this is something this country needs, and it's not a matter of if, but when. But in the meantime, we've got very good business. The private side has been growing, will continue to grow. We're starting to see the highway work flow through finally, and we're starting to see the FAST Act funding flow through. So when that comes, we'll welcome it with open arms, but in the meantime, I think, demand on both the private and the public side is helping.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group has our next question. Please go ahead.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. I just want to first focus on gross margins. Could you walk through the puts and takes on the quarters? Really trying to get a better sense of what more is one-time versus the ongoing managed cost, particularly as related to storms. And I know you talked about it in the prepared commentary, but if you could put it around \u2013 some metrics that we can better understand for modeling purposes. Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think just some color on that. Those storms were really disruptive. We've talked about it. From an operating perspective, you've got to remember. We had \u2013 operations were shut down days, even weeks. For example, the West Coast of Florida, our operations over there were shut down two or three weeks. Some of Georgia operations were shut down a week. And when you're down for that long, the costs don't go away. I mean we paid our folks during the evacuation just because it was the right thing to do. But those costs kept building up. So, anything specific we talk about is going to be conservative. I think that we're slowly getting back to normal on that. We'll work that through over the next couple of months, but that's really hard to quantify. John?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Kathryn, I'll try and give a little bit more quantification and color, but let me first say to everybody it's just inherently very difficult to quantify precisely because the nature of the impacts were so widespread and on so many aspects of the operations. But to try and give you a rough feel the way we look at it. You saw us note that we think we lost at least 1.5 million tons of production deferred, of shipments deferred. Just on the increment given where those are coming from, the nature of it, we think that's probably a $15 million to $20 million hit to EBITDA in the quarter.", "But then let me go to the profitability of our Aggregates segments and to your point about margins. We think the hit there was probably of a equal and maybe larger size than just the straight volume loss. And this is a function of changes in product mix, changes in production efficiency, again in some cases having fully staff facilities where we kept everybody on the payroll that had no production for a couple weeks, which is very much the right thing to do, freight and logistics costs, unique spikes in diesel, unique spikes in freight costs, which in some cases we ate because we chose not to pass through to customers in the middle of a crisis, repair costs, lower fixed cost absorption, the spike in diesel and its usage in our facilities that you've seen, et cetera, et cetera.", "So, on the cost side, we'd estimate that's another $15 million to $20 million. But that's an estimate in the quarter. When I say cost, I really mean profitability. Absent that effect, we probably would have grown unit margins, unit gross profit in our Ag segment another 5% to 8% quarter-over-quarter. Then if we go to our non-ag segments, probably about a $7 million to $8 million impact, particularly in our asphalt segment, particularly in San Antonio, which was hit hard economically. So that, I hope, gives you a feel, Kathryn. I just would underscore that it's more difficult than the average one or two items to quantify just because of the very nature of how disruptive this was.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Absolutely understand and I think you've seen us write about that too.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "The other thing \u2013 and it's extremely helpful in terms of that quantification. In terms of the optics for pricing in the quarter and once again this may be difficult to quantify, but when you look at your 3% pricing, what \u2013 any impact to that? Did the storms have effect to the optics of pricing understanding that you're shipping more base and fines versus clean stone into the affected markets?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. I think that it was definitely impacted. We just called out mix being about 1%, but that's \u2013 on the surface there was for price, other impacts with the storm that aren't seen there. And, again, we were very careful with our pricing, just because it was the wrong time to raise prices during when people are hurt and in trouble. So that probably had some drag on us also.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay. Perfect.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Kathryn, we can cover this offline if you wanted. But if you looked at our non-freight adjusted pricing, just total revenue per unit in ags, it was up probably 5% or 6%", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Yeah. Saw that -", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Relative to our freight adjusted pricing up 3%. And, again, a lot of that was in a lot of these disruptive markets where we had kind of a spike in freight related cost, like an immediate spike that wasn't passed through the way it normally would be. So, there's also a little bit of cost and price impact there in some of these markets that's transitory. I think we'd probably say the overall pricing climate and trend \u2013 and, again, you know very well how variable it is by market. It's incredibly variable by market, but total, total across the portfolio tracking between 4% and 5%.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Perfect. Yeah. No, definitely understand that, and just really wanted to get a better understanding of that mix impact from the storm, so -", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Helpful. And then finally -", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And that mix impact \u2013 a question was asked earlier, that mix impact is not over. We'll still see some of that in Q4.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay. And final question and I promise to get off the storm train. Just when you look at your recovery in Texas and Florida, we've gotten mixed feedbacks from a wide variety of different construction value-chain participants, be it ready-mix truck drivers to building project distributor in terms of the pace of recovery in each of the respective markets. But maybe could you frame a little bit more \u2013 are you seeing a fast recovery or a slow recovery you thought in Florida and in Texas, because that will help us? We think that the lingering effect could go beyond Q4 and so this is kind of what we were trying to get some comfort around. Thank you very much.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think it's actually \u2013 I would tell you pretty slow, and it's dragging. I think that every day we get a little better with this. Labor markets get a little more normalized, debris gets picked up, and you start to have trucks available. Homebuilders and the thing that concerns us is probably the res side and when we start \u2013 when our ready \u2013 when our customers in the ready-mix business start shipping to residential. And I'm sure that there's no question there's labor constraints there with repairs and rebuilds to homes as well as new construction. So we're hoping that we get past this in 60 days, but you may be right there. We don't know. And I think like I said the biggest concern is what happens to shipments to res and the timing of that.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And in some markets -", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Thank you very much.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Like Florida, asphalt paving is not really picked back up either. So, Kath, I think, it's fair to say that just to underscore that that there's certainly a degree of uncertainty. I'm not sure anybody knows. It's just a little bit the nature of what these communities are working out of. It's not about our quarry operations, but it can sometimes be about our customers operations.", "Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Thanks very much.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I swear to God I'm not going to ask a single question about the hurricane, okay. Enough of hurricane. Let's move into 2018, all right.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "All right.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "So, a lot of detail, forward-looking. I'm kind of feeling like we're 180 million shipment tons for this year and last year. I'm kind of understanding if there's pent-up demand and you're talking like mid-single-digit volume growth next year, that kind of gets me to 190 million tons. You've got some nice M&A that closes I guess end of 4Q, first quarter of 2018, maybe a couple million tons, maybe 5 million tons. Just for thinking and I'm not asking for an estimate or a crystal ball, is like 190 million to 200 million tons like a good conceptual starting point for 2018 given all of the issues we had this year with weather and hurricanes and all that stuff? And some of the comments you made about kind of widespread recovery except John's point there's three states which are kind of struggling. Is that the right way from a bookend perspective, big picture?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think, first of all, we're still working through that and we're still working on the plan. Some of that, as John said earlier, will depend on what happens with the public sector, how fast it goes, do some of those bottlenecks get cleared up? I think as far as the mid-single digit, we're very comfortable with that based on the projects we've seen start and the ones that we know and the timing of the ones that we know are going to go. A lot better than we were a year ago. But I think we're still working through that and trying to get out of the hurricane and into normal business.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got you.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And, Bob, we don't want to slide in to giving a number or giving guidance before we give guidance too much. I think I'll come back to private demand climate. It's still quite strong in Vulcan markets. By the way, if somebody wants to ask that includes non-res and non-res backlogs in our markets, certainly through 2018, res very strong across the entire footprint, public transportation, public highway work, strong across \u2013 well, not strong \u2013 strengthening after a period of lull and what we think is the beginning of a long wave of growth on the public transportation side.", "The public \u2013 what we call public other infrastructure, water, sewer, some other things \u2013 not as strong and conspicuously weak throughout this entire recovery. But that's now 10% of our business, when it would normally be 15%. So it's not the big thing. So we absolutely see return to at least moderate growth with some upside. And I'd underscore that we haven't seen anything change in our view regarding our ability to convert that growth into good growth in operating earnings and cash flows.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah. I mean you guys have had a couple years where you've been growing volumes 15 million or 20 million tons. So I mean there is no question about your ability to leverage yourself when the demand returns. Maybe we could talk for a second about gross profit per ton. And obviously this year has had some disruption, which has weighed on that and impacted incremental margin performance. How do you feel what's \u2013 like, where can you take this, Tom, in terms if we get normalized demand patterns, what kind of gross margin per ton can we start looking for on a dollar basis?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "You'll hear us talk about the flow-throughs of 60% and that's what we'd tell you over time. Nothing has changed with that. We have confidence in that. I think we won't see some of the cost headwinds that we saw this year. John talked about those with the ships, some of the fuel spikes and obviously the cost of the storms and the destruction of the storms. So I think back to our normal flow-through.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "So you feel good about continued improvement in profitability. Final question and pass it on. Am I right to detect a subtle shift in your capital allocation strategy? Because you guys spoke more and focused more on it during your prepared remarks. Is there any kind of tilt to how you're putting money back to work? And how should we be thinking about that for next year, 2018? Thanks and good luck.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good question, Bob. John. I don't think there is any change in strategy. In fact, it's very consistent with what we've been on for a long time. We did just want to note that on \u2013 we're still very focused on a free cash flow generation, and we think we should have accelerating free cash flow generation over time. As you hear Tom say all the time, we're going to stay disciplined on our deployment of capital back into M&A and other growth with an underscore of discipline.", "But we do think that we've caught up on some amount of our, I'm going to call it, core maintenance and operating CapEx investments. We've made some very good investments there. And we'll talk about this more when we give guidance next year, but we'd expect our core maintenance operating CapEx number to maybe even next year be down a little bit despite production being up a little bit. We think that number will kind of moderate, but no change to our long-term outlook or certainly no change to the capital allocation disciplines we've been following for some time.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "So you're saying EBITDA grows potentially but CapEx goes lower, so free cash flow strengthens, correct?", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yes.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's awesome. Good luck. Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis has our next question. Please go ahead.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Good morning.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.", "I wanted to ask first \u2013 you said mid-single digit volume growth expected for next year. Could pricing also be up mid-single digits or those three states you mentioned, does that drag down the average a bit?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "I think as you look at it, we're not there. We actually couldn't give you guidance, because we're still doing the work. But what I would repeat is that the environment for price increases is very healthy. We've got population growth. We've got employment growth. Our customers are growing their pricing and everybody recognizes that our business \u2013 we need to add to the profitability of it. So the environment is good. People see work out ahead of them. The visibility is very good, so they can take a risk on price all the way through the construction business, not just aggregates. So, while we won't put a number on that at this point, I'd tell you that the environment is good for price increases.", "Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for that, Tom. And as a follow up I'm just curious. What's your view on the M&A landscape in 2018? Do you see a moderation of the large deals and maybe just a few comments on your priorities for M&A?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Those deals will come and go, and you never can predict them. I mean we're working on a number of M&A opportunities as we speak, and they'll be all shapes and sizes, and you just can't predict that. When someone gets ready to sell, they're available. As always, I think, we're focused on the discipline about what markets we want to be in, what synergies do we have and are unique to us, and how we put them to work.", "Obviously, you've got to be disciplined on what you're willing to pay for an acquisition. And then as important as anything, once you get it, you have to be disciplined about integrating it and making it profitable as fast as you can and make it a part of the Vulcan franchise and part of the Vulcan family as fast as you can. So, we're busy with that. There is deals working right now, but to predict size and number for 2018, really tough to do. I can tell you right now that the M&A part of our business is very busy.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Scott Schrier of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. I wanted to talk specifically about Virginia a little bit. You continue to have a lot of strength and the right mix and I just want to see what you're seeing in the state both on the public and private side, whether you think that's going to continue and how you look at the pricing environment there? And I guess as a follow-up to the last question, how you'd view the M&A environment in the state of Virginia?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah. Virginia is strong. I think if we talk to you \u2013 in 2016, our weakness in Virginia was non-res. We predicted it coming back. It has come back. That has really added to our growth in ready-mix in Virginia. Res continues to be healthy and the public side is healthy. So really good market both from demand perspective and also from a pricing environment, both in all the way through the construction materials mix. I think aggregates prices have gone up for Virginia and will go up healthy in 2018 and we continue to see ready-mix prices and unit profitability grow in Virginia. It's a good market for us. And I think our folks are doing a really good job there.", "Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. And I wanted to touch real quick on the SAG expense. It looks pretty low. Just wanted to see if there is anything there and how you're looking at progress in SAG as we head into 2018.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Say, if I'll start on SAG, I don't know that we'd say it's low. We're never \u2013 we're always looking at it. It's an area of continued focus for us, both in leveraging at the sales going forward as we've talked about a good bit but also in terms of making sure SAG dollars are deployed against those things that better serve our customers, better serve our people and just drive productivity and performance over time. So, it's something we are intensively focused on here. We'd read it as good discipline, good focus in line, but I wouldn't say that our job in SAG is anywhere near done. We're going to continue to focus on it. We're making investments on the sales side, the S part of SAG, particularly to serve our customers better and to grow with the small private work we see and to make sure we participate in that part of the growth in the market fully and to do so at a full value for our products. And we're continuing to be very efficient on all of, what I'll call, the support function aspects of SAG. So, good result in the quarter, but an ongoing area of focus.", "Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question today comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good morning, guys. Thank you for fitting me in. Before I ask question, one just on clarification, so far as the Ag USA deal expecting to close kind of fourth quarter. I apologize if you have said it, but the level of divestiture that you were contemplating or discussing, all of that is kind of within that framework, meaning, just increasing the likelihood of getting that closed by year-end.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "We can't say a lot about Ag USA. The DOJ process continues to move forward as expected. We believe we'll close it in the \u2013 we believe we'll close Ag USA in the fourth quarter. Divestitures will be a part of that. We're also working really hard \u2013 and this is most important to us, pre-closing integration and what we can do to make sure we execute on the integration of that business. It is a very good business. We're excited about it. It's great assets in really good markets with really good market positions. They have really talented people and we're ready to get them on board with Vulcan.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "And, Stan, just given the way you asked the question. We said when we announced that we didn't expect to be able to keep all the assets in Tennessee and we still don't expect to be able to keep all the assets in Tennessee. So no change really.", "Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "No. It sounds like it's moving according to plan.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Yeah.", "Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And I guess lastly you talked a little bit about some of the internal investments and then some of the new site developments. Is it easier to greenfield a quarry or to kind of work within on an organic basis in that regard? Has anything changed on that or is it just kind of more opportunistic kind of something you guys have been doing for a while?", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thanks for the question. We are doing greenfields and M&A. Greenfields are very important part of our business. It is part of our strategic planning, something where we execute on and have been executing on over the last couple years. We have a number of greenfields working \u2013 quarries working right now and a even bigger number of distribution greenfield sites that we're working on or are finished. We don't talk a lot about those because of the strategy and the confidentiality of that but it is absolutely part of our business and a very important part of our strategy.", "John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Stan, I think it's fair to say that it's harder not easier. And when we talk about things that are coming to fruition, almost without exception, they've been in the works for a decade. So, just keep that in mind if we're making announcement in 2018 about greenfield development that they've been in the works for a very long time. It is very hard to do.", "Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great, guys. Thanks and best of luck.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you.", "J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.", "Thank you for your time this morning. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.

A question-and-answer session will follow the company\u2019s prepared remarks.", "And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to your host, Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Please go ahead.", "Mark Warren", "Good morning to everyone. Thank you for your participation in our earnings call. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website, vulcanmaterials.com. You can access this presentation from the Investor Relations homepage.", "Please be reminded that comments regarding the company\u2019s results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company\u2019s SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you, Mark. And thank all of you for joining us for our call today. We have several important topics to cover. The Aggregates USA acquisition, the impact of tax reform, points on improving demand and pricing fundamentals, and of course, our overall financial expectations for 2018. I'll begin with a recap of the fourth quarter and the year.", "The pattern of shipments in the quarter was encouraging. November, December aggregates shipments posted double-digit gains over the prior year. And this was following slight declines in October's daily shipments due to lingering storm impacts. When the weather was good, shipments were strong. This was consistent with underlying demand improvement and the need to catch up on delayed work.", "Aggregates freight adjusted pricing in the quarter improved 2% over the prior year, and 4% for the full year. This is adjusted for geographic and product mix. High single-digit full-year pricing growth in California and Georgia reflected good visibility to continue demand recovery in those key states.", "In contrast, pricing in Texas declined 4% in the quarter. This was largely due to Hurricane Harvey's continued impact on job mix in the coastal region, and on freight distribution costs that couldn't be passed through immediately.", "Now these were temporary challenges, and our longer-term pricing strategy and expectations remain unchanged. We didn't perform as well in the quarter converting solid revenue growth into incremental gross profit. Several margin headwinds negatively impacted gross profit in aggregates by approximately $20 million. In addition to the price mix headwinds, we experienced a 23% rise in the unit cost of diesel fuel.", "There were additional costs related to the transition to two new more efficient Panamax class ships and for storm-related ship loading and barge movement. We also absorbed certain expenses related to operations that we acquired during the year. We view these as temporary headwinds.", "We expect a return this year to the longer-term flow through rates and compounding unit margin improvements that we typically have delivered throughout the recovery. I'm very pleased that we ended the year with the best safe performance in our company's 60-year history.", "Our accident rate in 2017 was less than one incident for every 200,000 employee hours worked. Now our goal is zero and approximately 70% of our facilities are there already having experienced zero injuries in the past several years. I give great credit to our local leaders and the commitment of our workforce.", "Now, stepping back a bit and setting aside for a moment the achievement of our world-class safe performance, I will say bluntly that 2017 was in other important ways a frustrating year. Yes, there were extreme weather events, they were very challenging, they disrupted our operations and our customers businesses in major ways and for prolonged periods.", "The pace of public construction activity in 2017 was also frustrating. DOTs continue to adjust to new and higher levels of funding, resulting in a more complex mix of larger projects creating delays. A number of large jobs experienced significant start delays. In some cases, further compounded by bad weather.", "Going into 2017 our customers and we, expected highway and infrastructure shipments to increase by about 3%, instead they declined by 7%. Last but hardly least, in some instances, I was less than satisfied with our own operating performance. It became quite clear that operating conditions were going to be unusually difficult throughout much of the year, with material shipment delays and other cost pressures.", "Some of our teams adjusted very well, others not well enough in my view. Taken as a whole, we have room to improve and we\u2019re doing so. While there were from frustration in 2017 we also had some real wins. The fundamentals that underpin our long-term strategy continue to strengthen, the core drivers of demand for our materials improved.", "Pricing dynamics and our operating capabilities continue to get better. And our asset portfolio grew and is now stronger. Our tax position and cash flows and our balance sheet all have continued to improve over the past year.", "Regarding recovery in demand for our materials we continue to see a long runway with private demand strong across most markets. On the private side, 2017 saw continued growth in household formation, [permitting] [ph] activity, contractor backlogs and notably related construction employment.", "All of this points towards a sustained recovery in demand. Customer confidence strengthened throughout the year and we've entered 2018 encouraged by what we're seeing with ABI, the Dodge Momentum Index, long-term project pipelines and other leading indicators. These and other factors suggest private demand in Vulcan-served markets should continue to grow faster across the nation as a whole.", "The long-term fundamentals for public demand also strengthened over the past year. Public demand is finally beginning to turn into what looks like an extended period of growth. With actions taken by California, Tennessee and South Carolina in 2017, nine of the states we serve representing more than 75% of our revenues have now meaningfully raised long-term road construction funding.", "Our order backlogs related to public infrastructure work have continued to build. And importantly, we have recently seen public construction start activity return to year-over-year growth signaling a better conversion of these backlogs into shipments.", "Now, it is certainly going to take multiple years for public construction activity to ramp up fully to these new higher levels of funding. But for many of our markets, 2018 should represent an inflection point at the front end of several years of sustained growth. Improved visibility reinforces a positive pricing plan.", "This climate is further supported by customer confidence, expanding contractor margins, higher cement prices, rising diesel, and other distribution costs, and in certain markets such as California, a growing imbalance between long-term mature demand and available supply.", "I'll remind you that higher diesel and distribution costs will ultimately help expand the economic moat around our quarries. In any given period, our reported average sales price will be impacted by mix and other timing factors and there will be periods of relatively faster and slower growth. But the fundamental trend for Aggregates pricing remains clear.", "Our asset portfolio has strengthened meaningfully over the past year further supporting our long-term growth. A prime example of this, we welcome Aggregates USA, the Aggregates USA team to Vulcan at the end of December. We are really pleased with this organization that is now part of the Vulcan family.", "The acquired quarries and rail yards fit our network nicely. And our new colleagues have already brought new ideas to the table. We expect to realize significant synergies in plant production, rail car utilization, product offerings and growing customer relationships in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. We expect these operations to contribute approximately [$50] [ph] million to EBITDA in 2018 and growth beyond that.", "As markets continue to recover as Georgia DOT projects ramp up and as longer-term synergies are captured. This was the largest acquisition of the year, but it certainly wasn't the only important addition in 2017. We completed another seven transactions during the year at a combined value of $226 million.", "In particular, I would note our acquisition of Shamrock, a leading ready-mixed concrete producer and material distributor in the Bay Area. And of LoJac a major asphalt producer in Nashville. Over the past three years we've invested over $1.2 billion in M&A and internal growth projects to complement our long-term growth.", "Yet during this time our balance sheet has strengthened. Our total debt has increased by $875 million, but our cash interest expense has declined by $10 million. In 2017, we recovered investment grade credit ratings, which we intend to retain.", "The recently enacted Tax Reform law also improves our current and long-term earnings and cash flow trajectory. We expect our total effective tax rate to drop from 28% to 20%. Our company grew stronger and more valuable in 2017. We are looking toward \u2013 we are looking forward to continuing top line growth and earnings improvement in 2018.", "Now, I'd like to hand it off to John to recap our 2018 guidance and investment plan. John?", "John McPherson", "Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. First, let me point out that appendix 3 in the press release financials bridges reported to adjusted EPS for the quarter. We have followed our common practice for example in excluding the impacts of one-time tax items and debt refinancing costs.", "The $20 million of margin headwinds in the Aggregates segment that Tom mentioned was not adjusted out. Well, of course be happy to answer any questions you have regarding these items or the tax provision off line.", "As you saw in our release our 2018 guidance, calls for earnings per share of between $4 and $4.65, for growth of approximately 40% over 2017\u2019s adjusted EPS. We expect adjusted EBITDA and including the impact of Aggregates USA operations of between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion.", "For our Aggregates segment we expect same store of volume growth between 4% and 6%, generally consistent with the outlook we shared in our most recent call. Continued expansion of private construction activity drives most of the expected year-over-year growth.", "Although the intermediate to longer term leading indicators for public construction continue to strengthen and certain markets will experience very solid growth in the current year. Our current overall expectation is for shipments to public end users to be up only at the low single digits compared to 2017.", "Inclusive of Aggregates USA, we expect Aggregates shipments for the year to total in the range of 200 million tons. Although weather patterns and the timing of large projects can be difficult to predict, the first quarter should present the more difficult volume comparisons given the trends of the past three years.", "For example, first quarter shipments in 2017 were approximately 30% higher than in 2014. As Tom noted, we expect same-store Aggregates average selling prices to be up 3% to 5%. The pricing climate remains constructive across most markets, and we expect price levels to build throughout the year as higher diesel costs flow through to pricing.", "There has been no change to Vulcan's fundamental pricing strategies or our expectation for compounding price improvements over the longer term. We expect unit gross profits in Aggregates to expand by double digits consistent with the results seen earlier in the recovery cycle and consistent with certain cost headwinds not repeating in 2018.", "We project gross profit in our asphalt and concrete segments to grow in the mid-single digits combined. These higher volumes are partially offset by modest margin pressure. Our earnings and EBITDA guidance assume SAG growth modestly to approximately $335 million, and to decline as a percent of revenues. We will continue to streamline certain administrative activities while investing in talent development and customer service capabilities.", "Our current management -- other current management expectations, include interest expense of a $125 million, excluding refinance charges, operating and maintenance CapEx of $250 million, and as Tom noted an effective book tax rate of approximately 20%.", "Our current or cash tax rate further benefits from the ability to immediately expense qualified capital investments. For 2018, we currently project cash taxes of $80 million, excluding the benefits of credits and refunds related to prior tax years. This projection for cash taxes would have been approximately $100 million higher under the prior tax law.", "As you can see, we expect to generate solid free cash flow in 2018 and beyond, as the change in tax law further improves the already strong cash generation profile of our aggregate centric business. That said, our overall capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.", "We will continue to appropriately reinvest in the maintenance and productive capacity of our physical plant. And we intend to maintain solid financial flexibility and an investment-grade credit profile.", "There's 2015, we've funded meaningful growth while simultaneously improving our overall credit standing. During this period, our weighted average interest rate has declined from 7.5% to 4.3%, while the weighted average duration of our debt has increased from 8 years to 16 years.", "We expect to maintain the progressive and sustained dividend. As you may have seen, the Board recently raised the dividend 12% to $0.28 a quarter. We will continue to invest in long-term growth, both internally and through M&A activities.", "For 2018, we expect to invest $350 million in internal growth projects, including new strategic quarries and reserve positions in Texas and California. And we will continuously evaluate the use of opportunistic share repurchases as a means to return excess cash to shareholders.", "Although, we will continue our disciplined pursuit of bolt-on acquisitions during 2018, our primary focus will remain on building Aggregates\u2019 units margins, well executing internal growth projects, and fully capturing the synergies from recent acquisitions.", "Tom, back to you.", "Tom Hill", "Thanks, John. As we move into 2018, we're very pleased with our portfolio. Now, we're always evaluating strategic investments, divestments and swaps in order to strengthen this portfolio. Our current footprint aligns very well with profitable growth this year and ramping into 2019.", "For example, we like what we're seeing with the growing demand in our southeastern market. It is supported by new highway funding, port and intermodal transport development, superior employment growth, and favorable demographics, both population and household formation. Acquisitions such as LoJac and Aggregates USA will play an important role here.", "Arizona, California and Texas are also strong on these same fronts and recent results in California are particularly exciting for us. We like a long-term position there. California will benefit significantly from increased public spending, and our reserve base holds tremendous value.", "We are where the growth is, from San Diego to the Bay Area. In L.A. for example, we've added additional high-quality reserves in a huge market where reserves are lacking. In the Central Valley, we have permitted a major new quarry North of Fresno that will serve a reason of state that is expected to see the fastest growth over the next decade.", "In the Bay Area and Napa where private construction is strong and public construction is on the uptick we've not only added reserves, we\u2019ve also increased our footprint and our product offerings through Shamrock. We are also the large supplier of asphalt in the state. You can see why we're excited about our future in California.", "Our Texas operations after a tough year should benefit from improved DLT lettings and more normalized weather patterns in Houston and other coastal areas. We're continuing to invest in our Texas market positions, including a major investment in a strategic rail serve quarry, which will serve Houston and other markets destined grow for years to come. The recently announced federal budget deal should benefit our Virginia and Mid-Atlantic business with this exposure to defense and overall federal government spending.", "Summing up, even with the challenge of 2017 many things happened during the year that bodes well for our future. Our world-class state performance leads the way for world-class operational in sales performance. Backlogs of work continue to build as the demand environment keeps improving. Public infrastructure began to kick in on top of the healthy private growth we were already seeing in key markets.", "California, Tennessee and South Carolina passed major new highway bills. We completed strategic large acquisitions and bolt-ons, permitted new greenfield sites and began construction on new operations to better serve our customers.", "Altogether, these give us even more strength and reach in strategic markets across our footprint. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and well-positioned to reap the benefits of all the good things accomplished in 2017. We are looking at an exciting future of volume growth, pricing strength operational excellence and margin expansion. Our people are eager to make the most of the promising year ahead of us.", "And now I'll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take your first question from Rohit Seth from SunTrust.", "Rohit Seth", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Curious if you can help me reconcile your public volume growth expectation with the strength in contract awards, and then just on the cost angle on your guidance, there\u2019s\u2026", "Tom Hill", "\u2026highways, we would expect mid-single digit\u2026", "Rohit Seth", "I am sorry?", "Tom Hill", "On highways, I think we expect mid-single-digit, we feel really comfortable with that and really because we\u2019ve seen I\u2019d say nine or ten large projects around the country kickoff that we thought were going to kick off in '17.", "In that -- that would just be the beginning of a ramp up and how we're spending as all these states mature, their DOTs to be able to facilitate that spending in the jobs, and as new money comes onboard.", "On the other infrastructure I think we call it flat to low single-digit. There's a lot of funding there, but the capital projects just haven't really kicked in yet.", "Rohit Seth", "Got you. And then just on the cost angle, where there's a number of one-time costs that were identified in 2017. Just curious how much of that you anticipate to be non-recurring in 2018 in the guidance?", "Tom Hill", "John, why don\u2019t you answer kind of what happened with the cost in 2017 and then I'll talk about plans.", "John McPherson", "I'll start. A quarter of the $20 million or so, Rohit, that we called out just to give you a feel for it, negative kind of product margin and pricing mix was about $5 million of that 20 that's largely related to patterns of shipments and mix of work around Houston and coastal areas in the southern Gulf Coast, a lot of that\u2019s storm related, but don't expect that to repeat in the same way.", "Diesel was about a $4 million headwind in the quarter. Diesel cost may continue to rise, but that will really get passed through in price over time and ultimately is a good thing for our business long term. So, don't see the margin impact repeating in the same way, it\u2019s really a timing issue.", "Some certain expenses tied to acquisitions we made in the year where we need to put some money in those operations. Again, don\u2019t see that repeating, and that was about $3 million and then we had a number of transportation distribution related expenses that again don\u2019t necessarily see repeating in the same way, that was about $8 million in total.", "Some of that is new ship transition, they're working through this year, some of that is barge inefficiencies that we should be able to work through. There were storm related, and then finally there was about $5 million of increased liability accruals related to some of our truck transportation activities, and again wouldn't see those recurring in the same way.", "So, to your question on guidance, for our Aggregates segment next year, our guidance would imply and I think we called this out double digit growth in unit margins in our Aggregates segment. Some of that is cost recovery. But I tell you it's really in line with stuff we've done before, we\u2019ve done earlier in the recovery. If you were to look at the incrementals and kind of takeout Agg USA which distorts the incremental incrementals a little bit you'd see they're higher than the 60%. That reflects on a same-store basis, that reflects some cost recovery. But I think it's fair to say, our guidance and certainly the midpoint of our guidance doesn't reflect complete cost recovery of all the items we faced in 2017.", "Tom Hill", "Yeah, I would add to that the diesel cost and the distribution cost while they\u2019re out there -- they're a strategic advantage to us and that we\u2019ll get them back in time with price but it widens our economic moat around our facilities.", "The other cost that John mentioned, they're real. I mean we experienced some that we had a tough time with weather and storms and things like that but those are unusual and timing issues are not trend issues, and our ability to convert incremental revenues to incremental gross profit hadn\u2019t changed.", "But I do think that it did give us an opportunity internally to take those special cost and say, hey, look we got to be tough. We got comp over them any way and we've got our folks really focused on improving the operating efficiencies in spite of the one-time cost we saw and I would tell you they've done a nice job with that over the last few months in three ways.", "I think they really roll up their sleeves and addressed some problem plants that we have. I think we put the right talent in some of the most challenged areas. And I think our entire team has been acutely focused on improving throughput and downtime.", "Now, look, our people will deliver on this. I have confidence in that. They\u2019ll always do and they will also execute on our, the discipline of continuous improvement of margins that you've seen us do year-after-year. So, going into 2018, I think from an operating perspective, got a good plan and we're executing.", "Rohit Seth", "Fantastic. The distribution cost you mentioned, is that internal distribution cost between your plants, your quarries and your yards or is that they are [both] [ph]?", "Tom Hill", "Yeah. I think, it's a big chunk of that is, well, first of all, it's both. I would call out that the storm impact on the coast in Houston, specifically wouldn't allow us to fully load our ships to deliver, which is very expensive. There were a lot of problems on the Mississippi that were very expensive to us. So again, the one-time cost will get passed and the cost of diesel in that is a strategic advantage.", "Rohit Seth", "Got you. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. Just a follow-up on the guidance and pulling the string a little bit more. Implied in your EBITDA guidance for the year it is helpful outlining Aggregates USA, but could you also outline what was implied in terms of bolt-on acquisition contribution, and also certain storm related costs that would not be recurring assuming you have a normal year?", "Tom Hill", "I\u2019ll start, Kathryn, on bolt-on it's a little bit difficult to separate out perfectly some of those bolt-ons from the rest of the core business because they are kind of integrated within that, whether that's in the Bay Area or Nashville that you're very really familiar with.", "But to give you a rough number, I price a $20 million to $30 million, but take that as a rough number Kathryn because again it's a little bit hard to separate out from the rest of the core operation given that there's a pretty tightly integrated and the way we run those markets.", "I would say we're excited about those acquisitions and have great returns, they're performing well and show that we can deploy capital in some markets and downstream businesses in a smart way.", "On storm related costs, we wouldn't expect to repeat. Again, if you look at the quarter for example this $8 million of distribution related costs we really would not expect to repeat. We've got some work to do, our ships will be delivered in the second quarter or third quarter, that will drag on a little bit. We'll have some costs, we're still working through in the first quarter maybe a little bit into the second.", "And then when you look at diesel we see it trending up a little bit further in 2018, but again that's a timing issue, we expect to pass that through in pricing; it does happen with a lag as you know. But all this is you know very well it expands the economic mode around quarries and is actually net a positive thing for pricing and margins. Just a question of timing.", "So, I hope that answers your question a little bit, Kathryn. Again, I think it's fair to say that while our guidance and our outlook and our internal plans imply a return to the kind of flow-throughs and improved unit margins you've seen us deliver before, they don't necessarily imply full catch up on every headwind we faced in 2017.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Yeah. And just as an estimate once again knowing that this is a little bit, it's art and science past combined, would it be fair to say that the storm-related cost would be closer to a range perhaps similar to the bolt-on acquisitions? So maybe may be something in the \u2013 even in the 30-ish \u2013 $30 million type number that was a real impact to your 2017-only result results?", "Tom Hill", "Yeah. Again recognizing, let's call it, there's some art in that, right, as you said. From my point of view, I don't think that's necessarily way off. And let me call it margin not just cost because the storms that impacted our Gulf Coast business so much and Kathryn you know this, it really impacted some of the most profitable aspects of our business. Particularly given the advantages that we have and shipping for Mexico and our service to that broad region.", "So, we really saw at a little bit at sales and in pricing and in sales mix and in distribution cost and in operating cost throughout a very profitable portion of our business. So, I don't think you're far off but I think it's a little easier to think of as margin impact as opposed to only cost impact because it hits \u2013 hit the business in a pretty broad way.", "John McPherson", "Yeah, I would add to that that, that if you look at our plan, you see us returning to that double-digit margin growth that John mentioned and much higher flow through. So, while diesel is going to be a headwind for a little while, so will distribution, actually that will end up being advantage to us as we catch up with that. So, I think feel very good about plan.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Okay. And just a clean-up question on the \u2013 on kind of the cost side is with the two big shifts that you're transitioning, you recognized the cost of those ships last year, but now you're transitioning now. Where do we currently stand in terms of when they will be fully operational, is it roughly coming online excluding weather impact?", "Tom Hill", "We would expect one in the second quarter and one in the third quarter at this point.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Okay. And moving over to California, we had a chance to spend some time in Southern California market earlier this year. And we certainly can appreciate the tightness and supply of Aggregates in that market, but perhaps could you explore a little bit more about the rail advantage in the Southern California market and your view of the private construction market since you spent a bit of time on the public side? Thank you.", "Tom Hill", "Yeah. I would just -- I\u2019ll give you a couple of comments on California, first of all, the California is really healthy going into 2018, it's a market that we're really excited about for not just 2018, but 2019, 2020 and beyond. The private market continues to grow \u2013 residential is very healthy both in North and Southern California, non-res is solid, highways were actually coming off a low in 2017.", "And I think the state's going to regain its footing in 2018. We see big growth as you know and highways going into really into 2019, but really in to 2020. Our backlogs are improving on the highway side and actually, the infrastructure we're starting to see a little bit of growth on that how we have structured.", "It is a very, very constructive pricing environment in California. And that's really through our products, our customers\u2019 products and the construction side of it. Demand for asphalt is growing and now we'll have to raise prices fairly quickly to get over a rapidly rising liquid costs, I think, and with all this, we're very happy with our acquisition in Northern California with Shamrock, and we're starting up a new quarry in Fresno, which is a big, big demand market for us, and these some we've been working on for 10 years. So, you can see why we're excited about California.", "Kathryn Thompson", "And given that the rail network is somewhat limited in Southern California, how much do you think that is an advantage for you or is that not necessarily \u2013 maybe help us frame that?", "Tom Hill", "No. I'm sorry, I missed up part of the question. Rail movements in California are very difficult. Our position, we have the best reserve position in the largest markets for truck and as people run out of reserves in the truck market of L.A. and San Francisco, and San Diego, we're going to have to move out rail in. It will give us a marked advantage over the next few years.", "Kathryn Thompson", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will move next to Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.", "Garik Shmois", "Hi. Thank you. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more context around the synergies from Aggregates, let\u2019s say, how much of the $50 million of EBITDA contribution 2018 does include synergies and how should we think about the ramp, the amounts and the timing over the next 12 months to 24 months?", "John McPherson", "Hey, Garik I'll start to suggest about synergies discussion and Tom could comment. The $50 million for this year has relatively little what we call synergy in it. There\u2019s some overhead synergy will capture, little bit of cost synergy will capture, but a lot of this synergy we would say is yet to come.", "So, I think of that $50 million as a number we'd expect to be meaningfully higher in 2018 I'm sorry in 2019. And we're very pleased with the acquisition. You can tell just looking at a map that it fits very well with their business and this is one that's got a very broad set of synergies, they range from things that are operational to things that are logistically oriented reaching rail car utilization to things that are very commercially oriented, reaching new customers with a different level of service with a full mix of products, and as such they're very attractive synergies.", "I would say, a pretty good number over time. But it\u2019ll take 18 to 24 months to fully capture them. So, to answer your question that $50 million is didn\u2019t have a lot of synergy in it.", "Tom Hill", "Yeah, I would add to that, that this acquisition as you know really expands our footprint and \u2013 and \u2013 and South and East Georgia a little bit in South Carolina, it really expands our service offering into Florida, given it\u2019s granted for asphalt in Florida, it provides optionality of how we service our legacy rail yards and how we service the Agg USA railyards for both our existing quarries and once that requires a lot of optionality, that both in product quality how we optimize production and sale splits.", "So, this as John said, we\u2019ll recognize those synergies really over the next 12 to 24 months. I think we\u2019re very pleased with how the integration has gone. Well run businesses which this was -- have really talented people and we -- they\u2019ve come on board, Vulcan making an positive impact immediately.", "And so that\u2019s all going well as you know we talk a lot about the assets, but these are some really talented folks that we \u2013 that we came with this, so we\u2019re pleased to welcome in our family. All of this complements our existing footprint and the new Ag USA markets, and you've got to remember this is -- this is of two of our fastest growing markets of Georgia and Florida. So far, it's going really well.", "Garik Shmois", "Okay, thank you. I wanted to shift over to just the comments on Illinois, Houston, they've been you know, softer markets for you in 2017 for two different reasons; that how you expect those two markets to play out in 2018? It sounds like Houston you\u2019re poised for recovery, but any more granularity will be appreciated?", "Tom Hill", "Yeah, I would call those very different. I think that Illinois is going to continue to struggle. I think the team in Illinois, well, in the face of really tough circumstances from the abandoned market, had been a really good job of executing to the best of their ability and their disciplines both on operations and their efforts on sales, and getting all, they can at what \u2013 what they've been offered. So tough -- just tough duty in Illinois with -- really with public spending.", "Houston I would tell you we're I think we've \u2013 we've made the turn it is you know been a tough place on top of tough economics just as we \u2013 we\u2019re starting to come out of the sink in Houston we got slammed with hurricanes and storms, and just hurt everybody down there. But all-in-all, I think Houston is going to be fine.", "The highway demand in overall in Texas is very good, Houston including, res is starting from a really low base in Houston, but starting to pick up. Non-res in Houston we see is picking up also.", "From a pricing perspective all of Texas has held the climate. We had tough times with that \u2013 with Houston because as we talked a lot about the storm impact but I would tell you that I would expect to see price increases in Houston than actually in most of Texas in April. So, where it's- one, Illinois is going to continue to be tough, I think Houston has made the turn and will see a much better 2018.", "Garik Shmois", "Okay. Thank you. And then just last question just on the step-up in growth CapEx for the year assuming the Fresno project is included in that $350 million increase. Just wondering, John if you could provide some context around the payback and when we should start to see some of the volumes or when these projects should ramp up and start to be accretive to earnings?", "And I guess I'm wondering if this step-up in growth CapEx while we\u2019re not talking about 2019 just yet should we expect to see maybe an elevated run rate in growth CapEx for the foreseeable future?", "John McPherson", "Yeah. I'll put it in the context of free cash flow for a second, Garik, that's okay, just to think about it in total. So, I just \u2013 I'd point out that our operating and maintenance CapEx is actually going to take a step down from about $300 million this year a little bit less than $300 million to about $250 million next year.", "That's not because of the growth side, it's just because we've been investing pretty heavily in our physical plant for the last two or three years. And so that's just our need, $250 million. So, our need for cooperating maintenance is CapEx is a bit lower in 2018 than it was in 2017. So that's one.", "Two, I would think of the growth capital as you know if it was M&A, we wouldn't be talking about it until it's finished, if we were just buying these quarries, instead of building these quarries.", "So, I would think a good chunk of that $350 million as if it were a transaction we were closing at the end of 2018. And some of that result you really won't see until 2019 because we're really building out some new quarries and that takes time.", "Now, I would underscore what Tom said as these new quarry developments have been some cases 10 plus years in the making. They're just coming to fruition now to your point of return, it's a very good time to do these things. The timing made sense for us when we look at our hand in Texas, look at our hand in California, and there are some other developments, new distribution points in places like Charleston. The market is such and the margins are such that the returns are attractive, and now is the right time to fully develop.", "So, excited about it, we're confident in it. In today's world those returns compare favorably to your average run-of-the-mill M&A returns. I don't expect that you will see necessarily the same level of elevated internal growth at CapEx moving forward Garik.", "Again, to a degree this is the timing of when these particular new quarry developments were coming to fruition. So, maybe elevated a little bit in 2019, I'm not saying over the $350 million there is more to do, but not elevated in any permanent sense.", "Garik Shmois", "Okay. Thank you. And best of luck.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Phil Ng from Jefferies.", "Phil Ng", "Hey, guys. The mid-single-digit price increase you guys have guided to. Is that the spice to offset inflation you're seeing? And when do you expect to kind of catch up on the diesel side and just given the backdrop where demand is, is there an opening to get a little more upside on the pricing side of things?", "Tom Hill", "If you go into 2018 from what we see, we actually see the pricing climate improving. And one thing I do know is our philosophy on pricing that we've executed over the last five years has not changed, put some color on 2018 for you, we would expect pricing to build throughout the year for the two normal reasons that we talk about we want different markets, we\u2019ll have different timing for fixed plant price increases, we'll see some \u2013 and we've seen some in January, we\u2019ll actually see some and in February, we'll see some in April and you'll see some in mid-year.", "And then the second reason is remember bid work which we are doing everyday all day is a long steady campaign and will build throughout the year. I would tell you that the pricing discussions that we've had with customers in the fourth quarter in January have been very good.", "Their confidence in the market is as good as not better than ours, they see its improving. They can see visibility, the continued visibility on the private side, what you\u2019re going to really see is its reinforced now by the public side in the DOTs.", "If I were to highlight a few areas, it would be \u2013 then you would be surprised whether it\u2019d be down the coast Virginia through the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia will be strong, Tennessee will be good, as I talked about earlier, I think we'll think that Texas in April will start kicking in and California would be really high on our list. So, our pricing discipline continue to be successful.", "If you look back five years, our prices have gone up 25% and from \u2013 with the public side kicking in the environments only stronger and I have confidence we\u2019ll execute on our pricing plans in the different markets.", "Phil Ng", "Okay.", "Tom Hill", "And I think you mentioned inflation, you mentioned inflation, there is a couple of quick comments, I'd encourage you to just kind of keep in mind that our Aggregates centric business doesn't have the same kind of inflationary exposure that people might be worried about with other industrials.", "Keeping my way on our main input the quarries, the rock think about the long-term pricing history of the industry, think about pricing climate that's actually improving, and where things like diesel cost rise has actually improved the pricing climate and the competitive dynamics at a local level because they expand the economic motor under quarry. Yes, there's a set of timing issues around that but we don't \u2013 as I say, inflation is not a big concern to us right now. Let's put it that way.", "Phil Ng", "Okay. That's helpful. And I think that, John you might have teased this in your prepared remarks about appreciating the cadence of 1Q just because seasonally it's been one the last two years. How should we think about the EBITDA contribution over the quarters throughout the year and then some of the incremental dynamics as well just because you had some one-offs last year that should reverse in the back half?", "John McPherson", "Yeah. Yeah, I think this is an important point. We just want to remind people, it's not a surprise but there's nothing new here just a reminder that Q1 has been stronger on the volume side for the last two or three years in total. And there\u2019s been a higher proportion of annual volumes and that would typically be if you look at longer term seasonality patterns.", "So certainly, the comps, if you will, are harder in Q1 and should get easier in Q2 and Q3 and Q4. Those from a volume side and from a cost side, and as Tom said, we'd expect some pricing to be building throughout the year just given the normal cadence and in the way, it works in the Aggregates business.", "I don't want to give you kind of a spread of the EBITDA throughout the year because it's very difficult and particularly in Q1 a lot of it comes down to a couple weeks in March. I almost just think it could be misleading, but I do think it's worth calling out Q1 to more difficult comp just given the patterns over the last few years and then certainly, the comps got a bit easier through the rest of the year.", "Phil Ng", "Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And just one last one for me. Just based on some of the timing of these state level initiatives which is obviously, quite positive and as stats kicks in, is this low single-digit growth on public spending a good way to think about the growth trajectory in 1920 or could we see some acceleration? Thanks.", "Tom Hill", "I think, first of all, I would call that mid-single digit growth in highways be on \u2013 they will build and we talk a lot about this. There will be a layering effect both within states as they bring work on and as the DOTs mature to be able handle work. They're not just going wait to finish one job where they start another one and then, on top of with interstate, you'll see state-on-state bills.", "So, places like Texas or Florida or North Carolina where the money is already mature and they're spinning it and then they are shipping it, you're going to see Georgia layer on top of that. After two years, they're starting their jobs and then, you'll follow up with California -- in a couple of years you'll follow up with California, Tennessee, and South Carolina which will also start to ramp up and layer on top of it. So, while it's \u2013 highway is mid-single-digit this year, I would expect it to ramp up in 2019, 2020, 2021 roughly for the next five years.", "Phil Ng", "Okay. Very helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll move next to Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis.", "Tom Hill", "Good morning.", "Adam Thalhimer", "Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. On the Shamrock acquisition, can you talk a little about your experience with that asset thus far and then, also kind of specifically your outlook for the Bay Area?", "Tom Hill", "Yeah, so, well, first of all I would tell you must like my comments about Ag USA, that was a very well \u2013 very well-run business. And the management team that we got with Shamrock is very talented, and it's been a really good marriage with our folks and how much and how they've integrated so quickly not just the business, but also the management teams. So, we're thrilled that they're on board with us.", "That acquisition has performed both the aggregate distribution and Ramus Concrete have performed superior to our original plan. It is integrated very, very well. We see good growth in that area on the private side as we talked about both res and non-res, highways not so much probably for another couple of years, but it's -- so the market has performed very well.", "We expect it to continue to perform very well and actually kick in even more in a couple of years when the public side starts up. But you know I'm very proud of the team in California and in the Shamrock team.", "Adam Thalhimer", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then lastly, what are your high-level thoughts on industry M&A this year? Do you think it could be as active as it was last year?", "Tom Hill", "It is active, and we've got M&A going on. You know, we\u2019re always working on those things. You know I go back to for all this it's about discipline and we say this all the time, but it's about what are you going to buy and what market you\u2019re going to buy it in. Does it fit us?", "So what synergies are unique to us, and how we \u2013 and then what are you going to pay for it, and you know don't overpay. And then once you get it, you really got to work hard to integrate it and get it tucked in as fast as possible.", "John McPherson", "One thing we point out that we talked about internally, it's possible that tax reform having passed and is being done and behind this is, you\u2019re not going to shake some things loose, if you will, in terms of opportunities set. But at the same time, it really raises our need for discipline, because if you're not really careful the benefits of lower taxes just get very competed away in the M&A market.", "So, you've got to really, really be extra disciplined. You know we talk here about lower taxes can make a really good deal, a great deal, but they don't make a bad deal or good deal. So, we think a lot about that.", "I would say it's a little bit different on taxes in our core business and some might ask about inflation, so I just want to mention this, but you know our after-tax cash flow in 2018 we think is about a $100 million higher than it would have been under the previous tax regime.", "And given the nature of Aggregates focused business and the pricing dynamics over time and the focus on the returns on capital, difficulty of new entry we\u2019d actually don\u2019t expect that to get completed way in our industry, you know not at all.", "So, internally but lot more excess cash we have and the M&A environment we need to be if anything disciplined.", "Adam Thalhimer", "Okay. Great color. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.", "Tom Hill", "Good morning, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich", "Hi. Good morning, guys. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about on the organic quarry development, how much reserves are you adding or how much of your reserve position will become effectively addressable as a result of the investments?", "And can you talk about over what timeframe do you expect capacity utilization in the new facilities to ramp up towards the levels in the new facilities to ramp up towards the levels you see across your existing footprint.", "Tom Hill", "Kind of combined because I won't call out individuals. I'd tell you it's over 300 million tons. And I would expect those projects to take 18, 24 months before we're operating them. Now, remember these are markets that we\u2019re already in, it\u2019s to build out our hand. And but it's going to take some time not only to start and remember these are both serving big, big growth markets.", "And there too \u2013 the design of this is to make \u2013 is to grow into that demand and to capture that demand which other folks would, can't capture. It's just not, the capacity is not there.", "So as John mentioned, both of these projects the one in Texas and California have taken over a decade and it just takes that much time I think our folks have done a great job working with the local communities to make sure we got those permits and have permission to operate. And we'll build them out and tuck them in like we would an acquisition, integrate them into the rest of our network.", "Jerry Revich", "Okay. That's helpful. And then on Aggregates USA on prior transactions that you folks have targeted, synergies equivalent to 25% to 50% of standalone, EBITDA I'm wondering if you can comment on how you see Aggregates USA is stacking up relative to that historical target you folks have had?", "John McPherson", "Jerry, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll repeat things we've already said about Aggregates USA. I think \u2013 but I\u2019m not going to give you a specific number just because I don't want to confuse guidance which is the $50 million this year.", "Very broad range of synergies, and what we kept probably toward the higher end of synergy mix of deals we've done. But because of the breadth of this synergies and the nature of those synergies being not just overhead, not just operational costs improvement, not just logistics, not just commercial opportunities, but all of those. I think it will take a little bit longer to capture. But certainly, very exciting and as you can imagine, we're happy with that deployment of capital.", "Tom Hill", "Yeah, I would add if you just look at the slide, the map that shows the overlay of our existing operations and new rail network in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and then what we overlay with them it is this is \u2013 this one that has rich with synergies just because you can mix and match so easily, both what quarries we shift from in to their railyards and vice versa, and how you match all that up, how you marry those markets because we had some gaps and they filled in the gaps for us, and the new product offering into Florida.", "So, as John said, this is one that is particularly rich with synergies and that, that will take some time to mature, and our \u2013 but our folks are all over it and working on it. And as I said earlier, the team we got is not stagnant. They understand how to put all that together and so it's been \u2013 it's been a fun integration to watch them succeed and that it will be fun to watch over the next year or 18 months.", "John McPherson", "Jerry we may also you've looked at this I know as have others but it's also just really well positioned against some of the specific things like the Georgia DLT plans to do, which will be happening over a period of years, where that\u2019s intermodal project developments have rose out of making et cetera, et cetera.", "So, it's really good positioning. And that's not an 2018 issue or even a 2019 issue, but it's a really attractive aspect of the transaction and not \u2013 I'd say not accidental.", "Jerry Revich", "Okay. And then lastly slide 6 is a helpful layout. So obviously the past two years have been pretty tough for everybody. When you folks say that first quarter faces tough comps, are you trying to condition the market to year-over-year volume decline in the first quarter, and I guess the reason behind the question is it feels like the backlog on the highway side has been building for about a year-and-a-half. And so, if the first quarter is indeed down for the industry I guess how do we get conviction that it to reaccelerate in the construction season?", "Tom Hill", "Let me be clear, the demand is there. As you saw in the fourth quarter, where our volumes were down a little bit in October, the sun came out, it was dry and November-December and we had double-digit volume growth. So, the demand is there. That is a combination of core demand on the private side, it is the new DOT work kicking in. There's some delayed work there. So, it's a combination.", "So, as you look at the first quarter let's be real clear about this, the demand is there. This is about being \u2013 this is about days to ship in the first quarter which is always dicey. If you look back at 2016 and particularly 2016 and then again not quite as good in 2017, we had a very good first quarter weather.", "So, when we talk about comps as we always say the first quarter is always dicey because you don't know if it's going to be 60 degrees or 22 degrees. Is it going to be snowing or is it going to be sunshine and so? But the underlying demand is there and I think November and December is really good evidence of that.", "John McPherson", "Just to pick up and that will be clear we're not trying to suggest specifically that volume in the first quarter will be lower than the prior year. We're simply trying to remind everyone that it is a tougher comp, but it would be inappropriate for us to try and even give any kind of specific Q1 guidance just because it's so dependent on whether in March, anyway. So, it's both a tough \u2013 tougher comp and more uncertain. I take Tom's points as the key things which is the work is there to be done.", "Jerry Revich", "I appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Tom Hill", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll hear next from Stanley Elliott from Stifel.", "Tom Hill", "Good morning.", "Stanley Elliott", "Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Quick question with all the moving parts and as we\u2019re thinking about double digit unit margin growth for the year.", "Is it fair to assume that the incrementals in the first half of the year are going to be maybe a little bit softer and we're looking at a big ramp in the second half of the year in terms of allowing price to catch up allowing some of the easier comparisons? I hate to kind of get to that level of granularity, but it's just kind of a different set up than we've had in the past?", "Tom Hill", "I'll start and I'm sure John will have some to add this, but as we said and we talked about pricing that it would it would accelerate through the year for the normal reasons of timing of pricing in different markets and then the pricing as a campaign particularly with bid work. So, we would expect normally for price to go build the year.", "Again, the comps in the first quarter are going to be tougher, they get a little easier with what we saw in wet weather in the second and third. I think that when it comes to operations and discipline, I think we're \u2013 we're kicking in and that will also improve obviously that improves with weather also. I mean it\u2019s easier to operate in in June and July and August than it is in January and February particularly if you're in some place like Illinois or Virginia.", "So, for those reasons and I don't think anything is out of the ordinary there. And we've mentioned what \u2013 the first quarter stuff, that's how we would see the year shaping up. I don't have a whole lot to add to that other than to just keep in mind we're \u2013 as an industry coming out of a period of sluggish shimmer growth into -- into a sustained period of returning to growth.", "And with that shift, I think you're going to see some normal tick up of pricing and kind of build throughout the year. You\u2019re going to see a little bit better operating leverage throughout the year. So, I think it's really kind of as you'd expect probably.", "Stanley Elliott", "Yeah. That\u2019s fair. And then with the change in the tax code and kind of the \u2013 the new improved free cash flow for you all, does it change how you think about debt levels near-term for -- should an acquisition pop up or anything along those lines, just given this kind of a more of a structural change to the -- to the operations.", "Tom Hill", "I think the short answer is, no. And that we are sustaining commitment to investment grade. We need the way the agencies work, we need to keep an eye on debt to total EBITDA, but I also then would say that from an overall financial value and flexibility point of view it does give us more flexibility and it just gives us more of our own operating cash flow from which to fund investments.", "Adding a $100 million of cash flow is not an insignificant thing. And in the 2018 year, we're going to get another $170 million of cash from tax refunds and tax rebates that are also tied to tax reform. It's a one-time thing, but it's \u2013 it\u2019s more than a $1 a share, it\u2019s not an insignificant amount of money.", "So, it certainly gives us more flexibility. It certainly makes us more valuable It certainly makes the transactions like Aggregates USA that we did under the assumption of a higher tax rate much more valuable. But it does not change our core priorities or our position on the balance sheet or our view that what we want to do is maintain flexibility through all parts of the cycle. So, it really doesn't change our priorities or our policies. It just gives us much stronger free cash flow profile.", "Stanley Elliott", "Yep. Yeah. Understood. Thanks, guys and best of luck.", "Tom Hill", "Thank you.", "Operator", "That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Hill for any additional or concluding remarks.", "Tom Hill", "Well, thank you all of you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.
