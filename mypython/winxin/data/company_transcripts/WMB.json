This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, Mr. Travis Campbell, head of investor relations, will speak. Go ahead, Sir.", "Travis Campbell", "Thank you very much. Good morning everybody. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call and thanks for your interest in our company. As usual today you\u2019ll hear from Steve Malcolm, our Chairman and Don Chappel our CFO. Also, Ralph Hill, who heads up the E&P group and Alan Armstrong who heads the Midstream business will say a few words.", "Other leaders, including Bill Hobbs and Phil Wright are here and available for questions after the prepared remarks. Before I turn it over to Steve, please note that all of the slides, both those used in the presentation and the appendix are available on our website at www.williams.com in a PDF format.", "The press release and accompanying schedules are also available on the website. For slides two and three, titled Forward Looking Statements, Detailed Risk Factors and Uncertainties Related to our Business, please review those and the information on those slides.", "Also, slide number four, titled Oil and Gas Reserves Disclaimers, are also very important and you need to read that as well. Also, included in the presentation today are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles.", "Those schedules follow the presentation and are integral to the presentation. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.", "Steve Malcolm", "Thanks Travis. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. For those of you who appreciate concise, snappy, earnings calls, I think you\u2019ll like today\u2019s call, because we\u2019ll be able to move through our only thirty-three slides pretty quickly this morning.", "Turning to slide six please. The headlines from the first quarter summarize a solid start to what I expect will be a great year for Williams. We produced a double-digit increase, 12% in our recurring income from continuing operations after mark to market adjustments.", "Our E&P development efforts yielded larger double-digit increases in our natural gas production. We produced 28% more natural gas in the first quarter this year than last. And in the Piceance phase growth rate is still higher, as we discussed in the past. The Piceance is an extraordinary growth engine for Williams, and we\u2019ve significantly accelerated the pace of our development there.", "In the first quarter this year, our Piceance production was 37% higher than the first quarter of \u201906, an outstanding accomplishment. Our increased activity and continued success also means that we are continuing to grow our reserves.", "Ralph will provide an update on our 3P reserves, speaking here about proved, probably and possible, which increased even as we produced 300 BCF last year. And Ralph will also share an update on the very significant growth in our total resources potential.", "In our Midstream business, we continue to enjoy the benefit of a very strong NGL margins. But more importantly, our entry into the Piceance basin, with the new Willow Creek plant, will provide a new, exciting large-scale growth platform for our Midstream business.", "Through gas pipes, in the first quarter, we benefitted from increased rates on our Northwest and Transco systems. Northwest rates went into effect on January 1, 2007 and Transco subject to refund on March 1, 2007.", "Also in this business segment, Williams has been recognized as the top major pipeline in an annual industry-wide customer survey conducted by (inaudible). As well, our Northwest and Transco systems both received individual recognition for customer service in the survey.", "Clearly this is a point of pride but it\u2019s also meaningful from a business expansion standpoint. In this business segment, expansions are driven by demand from what the survey tells us is a base of customers who think very high of our service.", "And we also continue to grow our dividend. The latest increase is our fourth in less than three years. Turning to slide seven, during last quarter\u2019s call, I said that our management team was sharply focused on the crisp execution associated with several catalysts of value creation during 2007.", "And as you will hear this morning, we\u2019ve already made strong progress. You\u2019ll note the checkmark next to the growing segment profit. Recurring consolidated segment profit for the first quarter is up 10% over year ago levels.", "Checkmark next to growing natural gas reserves and production, as I mentioned, we grew those reserves at the same time we increased our US production by 28%. Checkmark, we did put into effect, new higher rates on our Northwest and Transco pipelines.", "Checkmark next to capturing more Midstream projects, in the Midstream business we announced will enter the Piceance basin with a $450 million a day processing plant. And that plant will connect NGL\u2019s to market through the Overland Pass pipeline, a project in which we have an interest.", "This all adds up to an exciting term for Williams. And now let me turn it over to Don Chappell.", "Don Chappel", "Good morning. Please turn to slide number nine, Financial Results. As you can see our reported net income per share was $0.22 flat with the prior year. However, non-recurring earnings and more importantly, mark to market effects, distorted the true economic results.", "The last line in the schedule, you can see our key earnings measure. Recurring income after mark to market adjustment was $0.29 per share, up from $0.26 the prior year or about 12%.", "Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our first quarter results and they\u2019re stronger than planned and up 12% from first quarter \u201906. Importantly, our E&P production is up sharply, they\u2019re providing a new higher base of production as we enter the second quarter and the balance of the year.", "Our Midstream business continued its very strong performance and gas pipes are now benefiting from those new higher rates and (inaudible).", "Turn next please to slide number 10, Recurring Income from Continuing Operations. This slide details the non-recurring items included in the quarter. The relatively few are detailed on this schedule. I\u2019ll say no more on that point.", "The next schedule, number 11 please, Recurring Income from Continuing Ops after Mark to Market Adjustments. I\u2019ll just walk quickly through the reconciliation from recurring to recurring after mark to market.", "Again, we start with recurring income of $128 million or $0.21. We make some mark to market adjustments related to our power business. First we reverse forward unrealized mark to market losses that occurred during the quarter, which we view as non-economic.", "And we add-back realized gains from mark to market previously recognized for total mark to market adjustments pre-tax of $79 million as compared to $34 million in the prior year.", "Tax affects that and after tax adjustment $48 million positive this year as compared to a $21 million positive adjustment in the prior year. A $27 million change. Again, the after mark to market earnings is $0.29 verses $0.26 for the previous year.", "The next slide please, number 12, first quarter segment profit. We display this both on a report and a recurring basis, so I\u2019ll limit my comments to the recurring side of the schedule. Note the bolded line near the bottom of the page, segment profit after mark to market adjustments, $482 million, up $44 million, or about 10% from the former year.", "And you can see the detail by each business and again what powered the bottom of the page, after eliminating the mark to market effects. Take a look at each of the business units which are detailed in the Appendix, as well as full detail in the 10Q.", "E&P increased its domestic production volumes by 28% and total production by 25%. That realized prices, $5.32 were 13% higher. DDA was up $41 million with $26 million related to increased volume and $14 million related to increased unit costs.", "Operating expenses were up $14 million with $9 million related to increased volumes and $5 million related to increased unit costs. SGA was up $15 million, however $5 million of that increase were related to extra expenses recorded in the quarter that were related to the prior periods.", "Looking at Midstream\u2019s results, Midstream once again delivered very strong results that were somewhat above planned levels and were comparable to the strong first quarter of 2006. Midstream continues to enjoy strong NGL margins as well as higher volumes in the West.", "Overall, NGL liquid margins increased $30 million over the first quarter of 2006. Deepwater volumes declined somewhat from higher than normal levels last year and expenses were somewhat higher. Gas pipeline recurring segment profit was up $150 million was up $17 million or 13% from the prior year.", "New higher rates related to our rate cases contributed $33 million of the increase which was partially offset by higher costs principally rated to insurance and DD&A. Note that Northwest Pipes' new rates went into effect on January 1. Transco's rates went into effect March 1, thereby we didn't have a full quarter effect, and Transco's rate cases remain open.", "Next slide please, number 13. I guess that I'll turn it over to Ralph.", "Ralph Hill", "Thank you Don. I'll share our strong first quarter results for you today. I'll talk about some basin highlights and also a little bit deeper into our performance versus industry in the areas of finding development costs, organic drill bit growth, and discuss our 3P and potential reserve as Steve mentioned.", "Slide 14. First quarter '07 total production was up 25% compared to first quarter '06. Our segment profit was up also 27% compared to first quarter of 2006. We continued to upgrade our rig fleet in the Piceance Basin in particular and our neighbors' rigs are shipping out this month in May, the first of four new what we call \u201cSuper Sundown,\u201d our rigs will be coming into the field later this month.", "We've had successful winter drilling at the Highlands in Trail Ridge area which is one of the areas we were doing to see if we could do that on an operational aspect and so far it's been successful. And we've had significant major road infrastructure to the Highlands have been completed. We just had some final touches in a few areas there so all of those things should set the stage for better growth and more rapid growth in the Highlands in the future.", "Don talked on it briefly but looking just on the investor relations sheet, the LOE for first quarter 2007 was $0.574 versus first half quarter of 2006, $0.505, that's up about 14%. Several factors affecting this were the new basin impact of our Fort Worth activity. It's a higher area to operate in, although it's doing very well for us.", "We had numerous facilities expansions I've told you about in the Piceance in the past that we're building now to be ready for this rapid production growth we continue to have. And if you compare it on an apple to apples basis, the second quarter of '06 actually had some cost in its numbers which should have been in the first quarter of '06. If you look at that, our actual first quarter '07 numbers for LOE on a (inaudible) basis are slightly down from the first quarter '06, so good performance by the team there.", "And Don mentioned the ST&A side of the world. If you adjust out the prior year first quarter SG&A, $0.071 has hit us this quarter. We actually have about $0.05 on our SG&A which is exactly in line with what we thought would happen with the increased staffing we had. So on our cost basis we believe we're right on line with where we thought we'd be and where we should be.", "Now turning to slide 15. Basin highlights very quickly. Steve talked about the total Piceance is up 37%, this divides it into two areas in the Piceance with the valley itself up 34%. Our net production is $453 million per day in the valley. Twenty-two rigs are operating and our simultaneous operations, which we talked about before, where we frag, perforate, drill, and produce on the same pad, continued to do very well and improve our cycle times.", "In the Highlands we have three rigs operating. Our production is up over 100% from last year at $25 million a day and our well performance is meeting expectations and as I mentioned we are doing significant work on infrastructure in that area and most of the major work is nearing or at completion.", "Powder River continues to do very good for us. The Big George is driving its production. Big George is up almost 90% year-over-year. The little graph to the right of the Powder River shows how the Big George is becoming an ever increasing part of this basin's production. Overall our production in the Powder is up 29% and we have 12 rigs operating in the Powder River.", "Slide 16. San Juan, the mature basin team continued to do well. It's up 7% over a year ago. All of our optimization efforts that led to the oil and gas Investor Field Rejuvenation Award last year continued to pay dividends this year as you can see from our performance. And our newest basin, the Fort Worth basin, we\u2019re up almost threefold from a year ago. We're very pleased with this year's drilling program, as you can see in our expectation and our many, many deals out there. The smaller, what we'd call the more Volton sized deals that are out there and also we have increasing well digging that getting to hopefully impact our growth to the positive side.", "Slide 17. Looking at the three-year F&D for the industry, this chart reflects evaluate energies, top 20 US gas producers. It's a three year F&D average. Williams' $1.47 average is definitely in the top quartile as you can see here and as this chart will show is possible the industry leader if not the industry leader.", "So on a comparison basis we are much lower, our $1.47 on a three year basis, than the 520 producer's average of $2.77 per Mcfe. We believe that's the right way to look at it, on a three year basis, because it smoothes out potentially high exploitation and development costs or acquisitions that could happen in any one year, so you smooth that out in a three year look.", "But if you do look at it on a one-year basis, we do have some numbers on that aspect that's not on the slide. If you look at Harold's 2006 US Industry one-year F&D company average for the top 75 companies, that average was $5.18 per Mcfe on the F&D.", "If you take Evaluate Energy's one-year average based on the companies on this chart and just look at one year instead of three years, that one year average was $3.50 per Mcfe on an F&D and our one year average, as you recall from last call, was $2.14 per Mcfe.", "So looking at a one-year basis or three-year basis, we are at least a buck better than our competition and we're making our reserves more productive, so our PDPs are increasing each year as a percentage while we're also growing these reserves rapidly and with lower costs.", "Turning to slide 18. Again according to Evaluate Energy these statistics. Williams was the 13th largest gas producer in the nation last year and is the sixth fastest grower of growing and production of the 20 largest gas producers in the country. And many of those that grew above us on the chart as you can see on the right hand side, many of those companies had significant acquisitions in 2006 which obviously impacted their growth rates, and we did not.", "Slide 19. Looking at the leader in grower and reserves organically is something we talk about quite a bit. This chart shows us faring very well on reserve additions. We are ranked number seven out of the top 20. And as this table shows, most of the leading reserve replacement numbers of the people ahead of us were driven by acquisitions. As you can see there is a far right column that talks about acquisitions percentage and then additions. Some of the companies were significant in that percentage and ours were not. Ours were organic.", "Only two companies exceeded our reserve replacement rate via the drill bit. And as to the previous slide six displayed, neither of those companies could match our production growth rate. And as you recall from slide five, we achieved this high level performance while maintaining the lowest three-year F&D costs of any of the Top 20 domestic gas producers, so we feel very good about our performance in 2006.", "Slide 20. As we mentioned last call our pre reserves are up 8% over the previous year. Our 3P reserves are now 10.8 Tcfe and our resource potential which we talked about previously last year in the 12-15 Tcfe range on our potential now has a reserve potential of up to 22 Tcfe. Looking at our 3P reserves we have reaffirmed and increased our 3P level to 10.8 Cfes even after we produced approximately 300 Bcfe production last year, obviously more than replacing that production that we have.", "Our current 3P reserves exclude the new areas of exploration such as Marcus Creek, and other areas. We have land positions and they also exclude significant unrisked potential reserves in our existing basins, such as Piceance.", "These areas include where we are utilizing new technology for advancement in the Piceance we're using longer lateral reaches. We have cut off our 3P reserves to lateral reaches about 2,000 feet lateral reaches. That's where our 3P reserves estimate cuts off. However at this time, we've already exceeded the 2,000 lateral reaches in a number of areas in the Piceance, we just have not yet moved those reserves into the 3P category.", "Slide 21. In addition to moving the 1.6 Tcfe approved last year. I'd like to continue to stress that our (inaudible) develop producing percentage of the total pre reserves is increasing as this slide shows. Our PDP percent is now 53%, that's up from 43% in 2003. That means our assets are generating more productive capacity also while they're in the industry leading side of the costs for the industry.", "And finally I'm very proud of our team. They continue to do very great strength and production growth, cost efficiencies, reserve replacement through the drill bits. Our strategy remains to rapid development of this industry, we have a long term inventory as you all know. High drilling success, low finding costs, so we continue to do everything we can to increase its productive capacity in a safe and efficient manner.", "So looking forward to this year and exciting new opportunities at the bottom, we have some other areas we\u2019re drilling as you know about. Barton\u2019s Creek, Paradise Basin, Fort Worth, and others, so we look forward to sharing those results later this year and early next year with some of those new areas. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", " Alan Armstrong ", "Thanks Ralph. I\u2019m just going to highlight some of the growth within midstream that we\u2019ve got looking forward as Steve mentioned, we have started into our Willow Creek project and gives a little more detail on that. So we are moving forward to the best (inaudible), possibly $350 million over the next two years, to install 450 million (inaudible) in gas processing in a CO2 treating facility, along with a lot of pipeline investments in the area that will gather and collect the residue gas into this interstate grid into the area.", "We\u2019re extremely excited about establish this platform out here that is so well supported by our E&P reserves and their efforts in the area.", "Piceance is one of the top three midstream plays in the US, and this investment will also provide further value to the resources that E&P is doing such a fine job of monetizing as Ralph just got through describing. Recognizing the growth potential in the area, Williams Northwest pipeline unit is completing the construction of a 30 inch gas pipeline from the Parachute plant up to the emerging Greasewood hub, and our Willow Creek plant will add even more utilization for this infrastructure. So this really is a great example of Williams\u2019 integrated model, and the way we\u2019re really bringing all the skills and all the expertise that we\u2019ve got in the company to bear, and really to monetize the streams in this area. So, some tremendous opportunity here, and again, we\u2019re just starting this first train.", "We do expect operations at Willow Creek to begin in the mid-2009. Initially we\u2019re covering an additional 20,000 barrels per days of natural gas liquids from Williams Gas Production, and we expect peak productions from this first train to reach nearly 30,000 barrels per day. The recovery of these high value liquids and transportation to new markets will maximize the value of Williams E&P and our future customers\u2019 natural gas production that today really goes un-recovered in the area. If you look back at 2004, 2005, 2006, there\u2019s been a lot of value left to be captured here, so we\u2019re really excited about making this investment to be able to capture that.", "The Overland Pass pipeline which is a joint venture between Williams and One Oak has recently announced plans to construct and operate 150 mile lateral down from the (inaudible) area into the Piceance and into Willow Creek. And this is going to provide both for our own liquids and for our customers ready access to some of the strong markets in both Conway and Bellevue.", "Probably a note that needs to be made here as well, is very key, this is also going to provide an outlet an additional 180,000 dekatherms per day of production that would otherwise require natural gas transmission capacity to get out of the area, so helping relieve some of the basis pressure from this growing basin and eliminating some of the gas on gas competition. So, not only does it allow us to monetize these streams, it also provides us initial takeaway out of the area.", "We\u2019ve built a combination of these assets provided a true industry solution to maximize these values and efficiently reaching markets that are not accessible today, and doing it in a manner that best serves the industry and the environment. Truly, if it wasn\u2019t for Overland Pass line and our E&P\u2019s such strong reserves in the areas, this project would not be on the drawing board today. This focus on the development operation of this large scale plan is what allows us to the make necessary investment in people and assets for safe and reliable services in the area, and it is our belief that these efforts are being recognized more and more by our customers. So, we\u2019re very excited about some of the discussions we\u2019ve got going on out here with parties outside of our own Williams\u2019 business, but certainly that provides the platform and support for the business.", "So, we see this as a great platform and great example of our strategy coming into play here. On the next slide here, these are pie charts that we\u2019ve shown before, and the bottom line is that we\u2019ve continued to have success with moving projects to the right in this graph. And the way this works is starting there on the left are projects when they are in the development and proposal stage, then in the middle you see the under-negotiations so as we become more certain about the chances of a project they move into that bucket, and then finally, if we\u2019ve contracted or it\u2019s been approved by our boards, we move it over into guidance there, and so as projects mature, they move to the right.", "And the good news is, is that we\u2019re continuing to move projects over into the right there. You\u2019ll note that in our capital guidance that that\u2019s come up significantly, primarily driven by the Willow Creek project, and partially driven by some changes in capital timing in particular, in the Perdido Norte project. So any additional capital in that project is moving in terms of timing into \u201908 and \u201909.", "In looking to the middle pie chart for under-negotiations, we did move Willow Creek into guidance and we included in the under-negotiations some exciting new opportunities that we are closing in on in the deep water Gulf of Mexico. So we\u2019re hoping to be able to announce that next call.", "In our business, we\u2019ve got capacity for expansion in the strategic Canadian Oil Sands area that we\u2019ve got in here in the development and proposal stages as well. As we noted in the last call, the Canadian Oil Sands is another area that provides tremendous growth potential via the processing oil sands off gas. We\u2019re extremely well positioned with our assets there today, and in fact, we\u2019re the only processors of off-gas in the area, and we also have the only splitter that can take and make valuable product out of the liquids that are extracted out of the sands there.", "A range of capital spending for these under-negotiations projects remains unchanged even though we have some things coming in and some things going out. The pie label of in development and proposal reflects some changes in our real development pipeline as projects become more concrete or shift to the right. Examples in this include removing a potential deep water project from this category and adding in a new gas processing capacity in the western US. Certainly we are hoping that the first train that we\u2019re putting in Willow Creek will not be the last, and we certainly don\u2019t expect it to be. So, we see a lot of potential coming down the road in the western US as this reflects. And with that, I will turn it over.", " Don Chappel ", "Thanks Alan. Next slide, number 27 please; 2007 forecast guidance. Let\u2019s focus on the bottom line. Our key earnings measure is diluted EPS. Using a recurring basis after mark to market adjustments, we\u2019ve increased the guidance somewhat from our February call to a range of a $1.15 to $1.50 up from a $1.10 to $1.50. As Midstream raised the lower end of its segment profit guidance by $50 million, note that the wide range is principally the result of factoring in a wide range of energy commodity price possibilities into our forecast. These assumptions are summarized on slide number 75. Additionally, natural gas hedges are in place and are summarized on slide number 52.", "Let\u2019s turn to the next slide, number 28, please, 2007-08 segment profit. Just walk down to the slide. E&P, you can see strong increases with very strong production. Midstream and gas pipelines are up somewhat as well, and at the bottom of the slide, you can see power after factoring out mark to market adjustments is also up somewhat and expected to produce cash in the range of $50-125 million in 2007 and then $50-200 million in 2008. Total recurring segment profit after mark to market adjustments could you just take the midpoint there of $2.175 billion in 2007 and $2.550 billion in 2008 is up about 17% year over year.", "The next slide please, number 29. Capital spending. Midstream has raised its guidance as Alan mentioned to include now the Willow Creek project in the Piceance basin. And that was the only change in our consolidated guidance. I would also note again, that we expect CapEx to increase in future quarters as we continue to seize attractive opportunities that deliver strong returns and increases in EVA. Each of our business leaders has highlighted either during this call or in past calls many of these opportunities.", "The next slide please, number 30. We continue to forecast cash flow from operations in the $2-2.3 billion range this year and $2.4-2.8 billion in 2008. Again, CapEx has increased and we expect it to increase even further as we move through the year.", "Operating free cash flow is expected to be negative. It is currently forecast to be positive next year, but again the caveat was increase capital spending. And note the operating free cash flow is before minority interest dividends, debt retirements, and other working capital changes.", "The operating cash flow deficit in 2007 will be funded with the excess cash that\u2019s currently on hand. Also note that additional dropdowns of assets to the NLP WPZ which are not included in our guidance but are part of our strategy will continue to provide a low cost source of equity capital to fund growth.", "Next slide please, number 31. Again, just a refresher, again our strategy is to drive and enable sustained growth and EPA and shareholder value. The NLP continues to provide some terrific benefits like low cost equity capital as a source for growth and we also are beginning to see more and more value in our GP value.", "Just a couple of comments on that. With our recent increase in our GP distribution to $0.50 a quarter or $2 annually, we\u2019re just below the high split level that requires a distribution of $52.5 per quarter or $2.10 annually and above that level we will move from a 25% sharing to a 50% sharing level on further increases above that $2.10 level. Also, just a reminder that companies that have public GPs are trading at a range of 20-27 times EBITDA on that GP valuation. So again, we think, a great source of low cost equity capital and also growing GP value will continue to maintain and improve our credit ratings and ratios which are important to us as we continue to raise capital including the capital we\u2019ve raised at the WPZ level. We continue to reduce risk in the power segment and we continue to be very opportunity rich and we are very much focused on seizing these additional opportunities.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it to Steve.", "Steve Malcolm", "Thank you Don. Concluding with slide 33, we will continue obviously to focus on these catalysts. As Ralph Hill has described, the outlook is very bright for Williams to continue to grow natural gas production. Of course we have already settled the Northwest pipeline case and we\u2019re working towards finalizing the Transco case.", "Alan Armstrong described an exciting list of potential projects that we\u2019re pursuing.", "In our power business we remain focused on continuing to make meaningful progress towards contracting more of our megawatts beyond 2010 and Williams continues to have more potential for drop-downs as Williams\u2019 partners.", "So clearly, we have the assets, the talent, and the growth opportunities to create significant shareholder value in the future. So with that, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, the question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question you may do so by pressing the Star key followed by the digit One on your touch tone telephone. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure the mute function is turned off. We\u2019ll take as many questions as time permits, once again its Star One if you have a question.", "We\u2019ll take our first question with Shneur Gershuni with UBS.", " Shneur Gershuni - UBS ", "Hi good morning guys. Just two quick questions here, I was hoping that we could clarify Ralph\u2019s comment earlier about full time acquisitions. Are we talking about $100 million or $200 million type acquisitions or are we talking something in a different neighborhood?", "Ralph Hill", "Well, I was just talking primarily at that point, and basically what we see there is more like the $25-75 million type range.", " Shneur Gershuni - UBS ", "Oh, OK, thank you for that clarification.", "My other question is just with respect to power and so forth. Kind of wanted to get your thoughts on contracting beyond the 2010, 2011 timeframe. There have been a lot of challenges with generation in the past couple months including the environmental issues and so forth, and would you clarify, the markets looking a lot brighter than it has in the last couple of years.", " Bill Hobbs", "Yeah, this is Bill. We\u2019re certainly seeing more interest in contracting longer term, especially in TJM and West Coast. The big continent markets are not as far out but we\u2019re seeing markets develop into the 2010 range, but I have to characterize it as we are optimistic that by the end of the year we will be announcing additional transactions, probably both in the Northeast and on the West coast.", " Shneur Gershuni - UBS ", "OK, and just one last final question. Towards the end of the call you spent a lot of time talking about the value of the general partners that would potentially be doing an IPO on the general partner as a sort of new source of cheap plastic capital that we will see in the near future?", " Bill Hobbs", "That\u2019s always a possibility. Certainly we have no plans in the near term to take such action. We have a very substantial pace of assets that are MLP qualifying and are able to be dropped down and raise capital and drive the GP value even high, that option will always be open to us, so its one that we\u2019ll keep an eye on but right now we think that the drop-down strategy would be first in our minds.", " Shneur Gershuni - UBS ", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll hear from Craig Cheer with (inaudible) Capital", "Craig Cheer \u2013 (inaudible) Capital ", "Hi, couple questions. Don, how are the rating agencies viewing the capacity markets relative to your power book and credit? And as a part of this first question, Bill, do you have any views on California (inaudible) market?", "Bill Hobbs ", "Maybe I\u2019ll just kick off Craig, I think the ratings agencies have certainly become more positive in terms of our power business in the markets more generally for power. I think the deals that we\u2019ve been able to contract and particularly the latest large transactions with SCE is certainly something that got their attention and I think was one for them to have even more confidence in our ability to continue the contract forward at attractive prices. So, substantially improved but we still believe its lagging somewhat.", "Don Chappel ", "And Craig, as far as developing vast markets in California, it\u2019s tending to plod along ultimately I think it will get there, probably 2008 at the earliest. Our contracting strategy has been more to bundle the capacity and the energy and market that as a bundled product like we did with the SCE deal. But we are seeing some of the financial players looking to capacity only deals beyond 2010. But as far as functioning capacity market in developing California, it\u2019s certainly moving slower than PGIM.", "Craig Cheer \u2013 (inaudible) Capital", "All right, and the second question, Steve or Don, how are you all thinking about the deployment of free cash flow including MLP drop-down. Don, you noted the likely increases in creative account back over time. Do you keep your powder dry for more creative accounts back opportunities or are you considering share buybacks?", "Steve Malcolm", "I would say right now we have some very attractive cat backs opportunities on the horizon, but to the extent that we do have excess cash, we will certainly look at all the possibilities including share re-purchase as a possibility.", "Craig Cheer \u2013 (inaudible) Capital", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll here from Sam Brothwell from Wachovia Securities.", "Sam Brothwell \u2013 Wachovia Securities", "Hi, good morning. I have a question for Ralph and a question for Alan. Ralph, with your growth in resource potential can you maybe give us a little more color on how you, what drives your decisions as you update your 2P-3P and Alan, the first quarter mid-stream seemed a little bit like, compared to what some of us were thinking, maybe we were being a little bit too optimistic, but I see you nudged the lower end of your guidance for the year. Can you maybe give us more on what\u2019s driving that? Is it timing issues?", "Ralph Hill", "This is Ralph. On 3P what we do is basically the (inaudible) and are usually the way it\u2019s looked at. One location away from a PUD is the way we look at that. So I think it\u2019s a good look at what we have currently. We do not go out and aggressively say, even though we are doing for example, longer (inaudible), we do not book additional or add additional reserves from that year.", "We expect that the classification into the 3P category this year. We want to make sure that we continue to be successful in those lateral reaches as we have been so far, and expect will be. But there's just no reason to do that at this time.", "And as we look for other resource potential, we just have new areas that we're in now that we weren't in last year that could ultimately bear some fruit for us, we would think. But we don't know that, so that's when you get into areas such as Barcus Creek and Paradox, Uinta and just other land areas, areas where we have land that we're just starting to either continue to accumulate land or begin some exploratory drilling out in those areas.", "So that basically, on the resource potential, it says the definition we have, I think, on slide four. So it just shows that it's out there, it's a potential, but again, a lot has to happen for that to bear fruit.", "We're very consistent with the way we did it last year on the 3P side, and the 4P side, the same way as we did last year. So we have some new areas that we could add to that 4P.", " Steve Malcolm ", "OK, great. Sam, on your question, first of all, first quarter, we did in general (inaudible) in the NGO margin we had a soft January for the frac-spread, it was getting down to almost $50, and gas prices did not move with that. So January was pretty soft for us in terms of NGO on a frac-spread basis. We had some other things that helped us drive that, including volume coming out of the Opal TXP-V plant.", "Looking into the second quarter, the NGO margins for April and May, and it's looking like June, are extremely strong, just in terms of looking at the broad markets and looking at the basis differential out West. So we have a lot of confidence, if you will, in the current NGO margin.", "In addition to that, in the first quarter, as we usually see, we had quite a bit of volume shut-in out West from a lot of weather issues both in the San Juan and Wyoming area, and we've got a tremendous well-connect program going on as we speak that is really going to be adding to our volumes for the balance of the year. So those two things give us quite a bit of confidence about the remaining year.", " ???Unidentified Analyst ", "OK, thanks. That's very helpful.", " Operator ", "Faisel Khan with Citigroup has our next question.", " Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup ", "Good morning. One comment to the power book for a second. I know you always talk about the power book, the power business, as kind-of managing the risk of that business over the long run, but I guess given the type of opportunities that we see on the power side and on the gas-marketing side, when do you think you could make a decision on actually moving away from managing risks to actually investing capital in that business?", " Steve Malcolm ", "Good question. As you know, our strategy with regard to power continues to be focused on reducing risks and creating more cash-flow certainty. And in the near term Faisel, I think that's where we're headed. We're not looking to expand our footprint in any way.", " Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup ", "OK. In terms of, because we're looking at the Big George, or Ralph, when does the Big George kind of turn into the Wyodak? You can see that growth continuing for the long run, or is there a point in time when that growth becomes mature?", " Steve Malcolm ", "Clearly there will a point in time when that becomes mature, but it's much better than a Wyodak. If you look at the first five years of growth in the Big George, versus the first five years of growth in the Wyodak coming on, the Big George is probably three to four times more production than the Wyodak had. So it's really exploding for us, i.e. we have approximately 7,000-8,000 locations left that we have, between us and our partners, drilled. So that's obviously long-term inventory.", "The key in the Powder continues to be water management, and we have many different ways we manage that, and we're happy to have our new partner has a water pipeline, which could help up do some great things there with water removal. But the Big George is, and I don't have a slide with me today, but I have a slide that shows the Big George growth is far superior to Wyodak, and I think it's got a very bright future ahead for it.", " Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup ", "OK. Then, on the gathering side, I just wanted to ask the question on the volumes. If I look at the first quarter of '07 versus the fourth quarter of '06, gathering volumes were actually down. Is there any reason that would be the case?", " Steve Malcolm ", "Well, a couple of things. Again, as I mentioned, we had quite a bit of shut-in production in the first quarter in the San Juan basin, where roads were impassable for pretty long periods of time. Producers were not able to get to their facilities and unload their water and resume production, so that hit us pretty hard, in the first quarter as well as we had some freeze-offs. So overall, things are looking pretty good, and we did see some decline from the deep water, particularly the areas around east breaks, and that's just a matter of production coming back on as, now Anadarko gets back into some of the wells out there.", "So, some pretty promising volumes out there, but we did see some decline in the east breaks area in the deep water that also caused some decline in volumes.", " Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup ", "Steve, one more question on the power side. Are you saying that if the opportunity were to present itself to invest in a project that would give you positive EVA, you still wouldn't look at that sort of deal?", " Steve Malcolm ", "I would say that we have such extraordinary opportunities in our other asset-based businesses, that that's where we want to focus our capital.", " Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup ", "Alright, thanks.", " Operator ", "Now we'll hear from Gordon Howald with Calyon.", " Gordon Howald \u2013 Calyon ", "Thanks. A question for Ralph, if you could. You touched on this with Sam's question, but being just a humble pipeline guy, could you give me a little more color on your comments about possibly increasing the 3P reserve based on your longer lateral reaches. You know, when could be this be reflective of 3P reserves, why hasn't it been already, what potential that represents to that 22 Tcfe number that you through out there.", " Ralph Hill ", "Well, I won't be able to give you the potential, just because we don't do that, but when a lot of this will be firmed up this year on the lateral reaches. As I mentioned, we are already doing it for a number of wells, but we always believe that we should just make sure it's working with all wells. We've had it work with every well we've done, and we just feel like we haven't done enough.", "But clearly we have the technology with the H&P rigs and with these new neighbor rigs that will be coming on here later this month, so we believe we have the ability to reach out farther. So I think at lot on the lateral reaches will be firmed up this year. And then if that's true, which I think it will be, then that would be reflected for next year in our 3P.", "And the other areas, the exploratory areas, things like that, they'll take a little longer. But Barcus Creek, for example, where we're drilling right now, which is just to the north of Ryan Gulch, that could add to the 3P and actually, some (inaudible) reserves next year because we're actively drilling in that area.", " Gordon Howald \u2013 Calyon ", "Gotcha. If I could add one other question, maybe for Alan. Venezuela, this filled in a lot of continued uncertainty there in some actions taken recently in Venezuela. Could you talk about your perception of the risk you have for your midstream business in Venezuela, just given recent circumstances?", " Alan Armstrong ", "Sure. Well, first of all, so we're clear on what we do there, we are a service provider there and provide gas compression and some gas processing there to re-inject into the oil fields there. So we're not in a position of taking any of the oil or any of the commodities. We're not a producer in any way, and so don't take any rights or title to the product there. And so far, the efforts today of the government has been clearly focused on getting control of oil supplies.", "So we do not, right now, have any discussion or pressure being applied there. We continue to be a very reliable service provider there. And we think that (inaudible) very much values that. They've got some consumer facilities in the area, and so they understand the difficulties and the performance that we're providing to them. So we're pretty well positioned in that regard.", " Gordon Howald \u2013 Calyon ", "I ask this question all the time, and there are no changes, essentially, since the last time we spoke last quarter or the quarter before.", " Alan Armstrong ", "That is correct.", " Gordon Howald \u2013 Calyon ", "Thanks, guys.", " Operator ", "The next question comes from Brian Olson with Luminous Management.", " Brian Olson - Luminous Management ", "Good morning, guys. I just have some follow-ups on power questions that were asked earlier. Just wondering, how do you guys plan on capitalizing on the strength of the capacity of markets for your eastern assets? And then also, with regards to not expanding the footprint, but having the ability to invest capital in the business, is there any opportunity to reinvest in some of your existing assets?", " Bill Hobbs ", "This is Bill Hobbs. I'll answer the capacity question and Steve can deal with the second part of the question. With the regional pricing model, RPM option that came out, we are very pleased with the capacity prices that originated from that. I think it sends a strong signal that the Northeast, especially the Eastern PJM is getting very tight on capacity quickly.", "So we certainly are talking to counter parties, to those located in PJM, utilities about longer term sales capacity, as well as the transmission expansions as I\u2019ve mentioned in the previous calls that\u2019s going to take Power into the Long Island, New York markets, there\u2019s interest in contracting long term.", "Certainly in discussions, and I\u2019m hopeful before the end of the year we\u2019ll be making some announcements around those deals. Again, if I\u2019ve got your question right, we\u2019re not seeking to expand in the power space, it\u2019s very much a continuing strategy around reducing risk and maximizing cash and creating more certainty around cash flow certainty and selling end of the market beyond 2010. That is a clear focus in the Power space.", " Brian Olson - Luminous Management ", "Would there be an opportunity to actually extract cash from the Power book? For someone else that would see an opportunity in some of your assets to capitalize on an opportunity and invest a little cash now? Is there a way to cap some of that out then?", " Steve Malcolm ", "As we\u2019ve also continued to say, we are very open minded about how we proceed in the Power space.", " Brian Olson - Luminous Management ", "Thank you", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll hear from Peter Monaco from Tudor Investment Corporation.", "Peter Monaco - Tudor Investment Corporation", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for your time. As you\u2019ll look at a couple of years, clearly this is an incredibly cash flow generative company even after the purchases. Can you talk about, Don, if you would the right capital structure for the company down the road?", "Separately, not the beat a dead horse, but with respect to the Power Book, if it\u2019s clearly non-core, and in light of the incredible interest in Power generating assets, especially those that represent something of a call option on Power prices and (inaudible) down the road, will you divest it? Thanks.", " Don Chappel ", "Peter, on the capital structure, I will restate our prior guidance. We believe returning to an investment grade rating is the right strategy for Williams at this point and time. Our high grade adventures restrict us from some of the actions that some investment grade companies have. So we don\u2019t have the flexibility that some of the investment grade companies have.", "I think that we would be effective, more efficient as an investment grade company. So we\u2019ve been focused on returning to an investment grade but doing it at such a pace that continues to allow us to seize the opportunities rather than reduce that or take some other action.", "In terms of the Power Book, I just restate Steve\u2019s comment that we are certainly open minded but our strategy in the nearer term has been focused on gross production.", "Peter Monaco - Tudor Investment Corporation", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Carl Kirst with Credit Suisse.", "Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse", "Good morning, everybody. I\u2019d like to go back to the non-proof reserves for a second. You mentioned that we were previous to this we were at 12-15 Tcfe of resource potential. I think the Delta over the 3T was primarily around 3 Tcfe in the Highlands.", "I was wondering if you could confirm whether or not this is still the case or as, say for instance, if the production in the Highlands has doubled in the last year you can actual see greater resource potential in the Highlands. And perhaps between that 12-15 and 22 as we look at that Delta areas, and you mentioned a number of areas, is there one area more material than the other that is representative of that resource potential?", " Steve Malcolm ", "I think the resource potential in the Highlands is in the same area we talked about. We like what we see obviously and we continue to have more and more success.", "I think through last year we were about 75 wells drilled in the various areas we call the Highlands and each one of those have continued to delineate areas of the field we like, areas of the field that we may not like as much, but they give us good ability to say our resource potential is very strong in those areas.", "But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gone up significantly. What we\u2019re looking at for the difference to go above the 15 and up to the 22Ts, a lot of it is in the new areas. I would say that as we continue to evaluate our (inaudible) in core areas such as the Valley and the Highlands, that does add some to our opportunities to make our income potential higher.", "So some of it is up in that area. But the other areas its up is just new areas we\u2019ve been quietly accumulating acreage in and continue to and that\u2019s (inaudible), doing new deals such as those things. And we\u2019ve actually increased, not near on the scale as the total 22, but we\u2019ve increased our presence in the new basins, in the Fort Worth basin which obviously adds to this too.", "It\u2019s kind of a combination. We haven\u2019t really increased the income potential in the Highlands significantly though it\u2019s probably up some. And a lot of the other resource potential is just because we\u2019re spending in new areas.", "Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse", "Are any of the other areas as material as the Highlands?", " Steve Malcolm ", "They could be.", "Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse", "Could you break out on the 2P, 3P or at least the probably of impossibles, how much of that is coming from the Piceance?", " Steve Malcolm ", "I think I said last year and I would say probably 60-70% of that is coming from the Piceance. We still have a big 3P piece in the Powder, don\u2019t forget. Powder is a big piece, also, but mostly from the Piceance then followed by the Powder.", "Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. Don\u2019t know if Phil or Don are on the phone. If not, looking at the pipeline guidance, could you help us out with what you think is the largest Delta in the guidance, with a pipeline obviously, it\u2019s not going to be commodity prices like everything else. Clearly insurance costs are higher this quarter than what we were expected. So I was just trying to get a sense, are we seeing rising cost pressures above and beyond the rates cases? Insurance costs, something like that, moderates going forward. I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of the dynamic.", "Phil Wright", "On the top line side, I would say that revenue wise the short term firm out on Northwest and the interruptible on Gulf Stream can\u2019t be a variable. We\u2019d like for that to vary obviously to the up side. But we have our marketers working those markets and attempting to capture those revenues fulltime. So that is a source of potential variance.", "On the cost side of the equation, while we have a pretty good fix on maintenance capital, that is an area that does vary somewhat based on our findings with respect to our internal inspections.", "Some of that will fall into capital, depending on how many dig outs and that sort of thing, you have to do following inspections and the like, will fall in the zone of a maintenance expense. So there\u2019s some variance there along with the miscellaneous types that are probably too extensive to mention in the course of the call.", "Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse", "So, no one single variable if you will?", "Phil Wright", "No.", "Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse", "Lastly, Bill. On the Power side, looking at the profit range for this year, as we\u2019ve had a strengthening in the market, on the volumes that are non-contracted, would you say that thee is with what can you see there\u2019s upside potential of that Guidance range, or would we just kind of be at the higher end of that range perhaps as the market continues to strengthen?", "Bill Hobbs", "We\u2019ll largely, we\u2019ve hedged a significant part of our portfolio for 2007 we\u2019ll stick within that Guidance range.", "Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Gary Stromberg from Lehman Brothers has our next question.", "Gary Stromberg \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Ralph, not to be a dead horse, but the 3p number, is 3p sensitive to natural gas prices? How sensitive is it because we know gas prices were pretty strong at the end of 2005 versus 2006.", " Ralph Hill", "No, we are slightly sensitive to it but really we are in the resource potential type place, those are actually known quantities of gas and the probable location is one location away from a CUD and then the possible is probably a one more location away from CUD. So there is really not, although there was a significant decrease in prices year in 2006 versus year in 2005, we have never felt like our reserves even in the 3p area or since that.", "Really what we are looking at it, is continuing to make sure that the technology we need to get to these areas is there and we believe that is happening and its just we didn\u2019t quite book it at this stage yet. We understand that the hurdles that we need to go over, reach the topographical situation, landowners those kinds of things, we\u2019re just being very diligent in booking those reserves and establishing in our 3p area. It really wasn\u2019t both in our approved side and our 3p side wasn\u2019t really affected on a very small amount on our different in price.", "Gary Stromberg \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Cash flow from the operations in the quarter was a little bit lighter than we were looking for, any unusual items there? And guidance to $2.2-2.3 billion versus 300 in the first quarter? Is there going to be some backhand catch up?", " Ralph Hill", "I think seasonally the first quarter has been relatively light the last couple of years. I don\u2019t think there is anything unusual so we expect to catch up.", "Gary Stromberg \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "OK thank you.", " Operator ", "Our next question will come from Ray Deacon with BMO Capital Markets.", " Raymond Deacon - BMO Capital Markets ", "I have a question for Ralph. I was just curious what\u2019s the status of the run plateau and is that an area where you could see yourself expanding given the growth you\u2019ve had in the last four five years in the Piceance?", " Ralph Hill", "I\u2019m not sure, I know there has been a draft. I mean let\u2019s not call it a draft but lots of comments on the EAS. They had five different potentials and I think the one that they were leaning towards was one where like 80% of the validity and surroundings areas has to be developed first before you go up there which I think is very inefficient. So I think it\u2019s on a warm stand by. I would say with our work that we\u2019ve done and the Highlands area and particularly Highlands point area and the infrastructure we have built that on an infrastructure basis, we probably have a great leg up on that area and obviously we feel that anything that goes on with Piceance we have a very good knowledge of that so we also think we have a good technical and operational advantage.", "But at this point, I\u2019m not even sure and I haven\u2019t checked for a while what the status is if they are going to come up with a final word that talks about the (inaudible) developed first. They also talked about only one operator up there which might be an advantage to us obviously if we would be in that area but that also I think would be inefficient because it\u2019s a big area and it\u2019s a lot that could happen up there.", "Just a strange initial draft that came out or comments, but I would say if you just look at the Roman plateau and look where we are drilling and look at the Allen Point area in particular. We have a good if not better than everybody else operational and infrastructure advantage.", " Raymond Deacon - BMO Capital Markets ", "Right, thanks a lot.", " Operator ", "Our next question will come from Brooke Mullin with JP Morgan.", " Brooke Mullin - JP Morgan ", "My question has been asked, thank you.", " Operator ", "At this time we have no more questions. Mr. Steve Malcolm for the additional closing remarks.", " Steve Malcolm ", "Yes, as always thank you for your interest. We were pleased with the first quarter results. We have strengthened our growth platform and are excited about our prospects for 2007 and beyond. So we look forward to talking to you next time.", " Operator ", "Thank you that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Today's call is beingrecorded.", "At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I wouldlike to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations.Please go ahead, sir.", "Travis Campbell", "Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our third quarterearnings call. As always, thank you for the interest in the company. I knowmany of you have a lot of calls to monitor this morning, so we\u2019ll get right toit. Steve Malcolm, our CEO, will lead it off, followed by Don Chappel, the CFO.Ralph Hill, Alan Armstrong and Phil Wright will also make some brief remarks.", "Before I turn it over to Steve, please note that all theslides are available on our website, williams.com in a PDF format. The pressrelease and the company's schedules are also available on the website, and thismorning we also filed our third quarter 10-Q.", "Slides 2 and 3 entitled, \"Forward-LookingStatements,\" detail risk factors and uncertainties associated with futureoutcomes.

Those schedules follow the presentation and are integralto the presentation.", "With that, I will turn it over to Steve.", "Steve Malcolm", "", "Thanks, Travis. Good morning and welcome to our thirdquarter earnings call. We certainly appreciate your interest in our company. Wehad another outstanding quarter, and our core natural gas businesses deliveredvery strong performances across the board.", "Starting with slide 6. I am sure you saw the numbers for thethird quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 44% to $0.39 from ayear ago. Our 2007 picture is getting even brighter as we are bumping up thefull year earnings per share guidance by 18%.", "We expect 2008 earnings to show strength even in a lessextraordinary pricing environment. Clearly, we are and have been in a robustcommodity pricing environment for much of this year. The fact is that for '07we have been short gas in the Rockies, and have takenadvantage of the very low prices in that region. However, we would expect thatthe situation to change somewhat when the RockiesExpress Project goes into service. ", "We look for approximately 15% natural gas production growthin 2008, and Ralph Hill will provide more detail on our outlook here in a fewminutes. And we expect to commit more capital to develop our opportunity richportfolio.", "A key theme for Williams, and one that I have stressed often,is that our businesses provide an abundance of organic growth opportunities.That\u2019s important to this business, where you see many companies looking toacquisitions to find the growth that will fuel their futures. For Williams,much of that growth is well within our reach.", "We are continuing to make progress with respect to othersteps being taken to deliver value to our shareholders. I am sure that younoticed that Williams Pipeline Partners filed an amended S1 on Monday thisweek, and among other things, the latest filing includes the expected IPO priceof $19 to $21 per unit.", "As you recall, the pipeline MLP consists of a 25% interestin our Northwest Pipeline, and at this stage in the process, there is reallyvery little more that we can share about our MLP beyond what you can obtain foryourself in our public filings with the SEC.", "And we continue to execute on our strategy to drop-downassets into our Midstream MLP. We announced this morning that we had signed anonbinding letter of intent for Williams Partners to acquire an ownershipinterest in the limited liability company that owns the Wamsutter system fromWilliams for $750 million.

We have received substantially all consents, and we now expectto close the Power sale to Bear during November, and possibly as early as nextweek.", "And finally, with respect to the share repurchase, we areoff to a strong start, more than 7 million shares during the third quarter atan average purchase price of $31.40, which certainly feels even better todaythan it did at the time. We are committed to continue execution of the $1billion program the Board authorized.", "Turning to slide 7 which addresses our third quarterstrength; I think, the quarter was driven obviously by strong NGL margins. Weobviously took advantage of the Rockies basis anomaly, which createdextraordinary processing profits for Midstream, and our transportation andhedging strategy insulated E&P from the challenges that many Rockiesproducers suffered and continue to suffer as a result of the basis blowout.", "This highlights the fact that we have stressed many timesthat we are a Rockies producer, not a Rockies price-taker with just 7% ofproduction exposed to Rockies prices. Our E&P production outpaced year agothird quarter by 17%, and our new rates on Northwest and Transco continue todrive an increase in Gas Pipeline results.", "A couple of points on slide 8, which shows actual segmentprofit in 2005 and 2006, and forecasted full year segment profit for \u201807 and\u201808. The expected uplift from the extraordinary pricing environment that we areexperiencing this year is the orange striped block at the top of the 2007 baron this chart. But even if you would normalize prices for 2007, we would stillend up with very impressive 15% growth compared to 2006 levels.", "Then we show the guidance range that we are forecasting in2008, and I would encourage you to please take a look in the appendix at asummary of our commodity price expectations that are reflected in this 2008guidance. Compared to our 2007 assumptions, we are expecting 2008 to havestronger natural gas prices in the Rockies andelsewhere, higher crude oil prices, but a lower crude to natural gas ratio,which of course drives our processing margins.", "With that, I will turn it over to Don.", "Don Chappel", "", "Thanks, Steve. Good morning. Let's turn to slide number 10,Financial Results, and I will run through all of these very quickly. Focusingon the bottom line. Our key earnings measure, the recurring income from continuingops after mark-to-market adjustments on a per share basis, you can see theincrease there of $0.12 over the prior year, or 44%, and the same rate ofincrease, 44% on a year-to-year basis.", "Next slide please, number 11. This is on both a reported andrecurring basis. The non-recurring items are detailed on a slide in theappendix, as is the mark-to-market adjustment. Overall, segment profit aftermark-to-market adjustment is up $129 million, or 27%. E&P is up about 17%,consistent with our production increase.

Let's turn to slide 14. Ouraccomplishments: production and profit are both up 17% compared to thirdquarter \u201806. Also reflected in these numbers were some pipeline maintenance andcurtailments that happened in the Rockies, whichdecreased our production by about 25 million a day.", "Without those maintenance and curtailments, production wouldhave been up about 20% year-over-year and about 5% sequentially, and that justsimply reflects the very tight Rockies pipeline network that's out there, whichis expected to improve in \u201808. Steve has already talked about that insulatingour transportation portfolio insulates our E&P volumes from the basisblowout.", "Turning to slide 15. This slide reflects our strongportfolio, and our ability to grow organically. As you can see on this slide,each of our larger investment areas have had very robust production growth. Inparticular looking at the Highlands growth, it does haveseasonal swings. So, although we're very pleased with the 25 million a day andup 98%, the growth is actually greater than that. And as we get into moreyear-round drilling, we will have more steady growth. But our currentproduction in the Highlands is up close to 40 million aday from this 25 million just reported for the third quarter.", "Slide 16, this again reflects our dual strength of prolificRockies reserves and production growth, which we can combine with our abilityto sell our gas away from the Rockies. The key on this slide is 7% is priced inthe Rockies, as Steve mentioned, which is in the middle of this slide.", "Our average net realized price after fuel use,transportation and hedge gain was $4.59. And that compares to the RockiesIndexes, as you see there on the bottom of the slide, of 2.90 and 2.90 forNorthwest and CIG. And those do not include fuel and shrink, so actually youcan see how much better we are doing because we are able to transport our gasaway from the Rockies to other areas.", "Slide 17, a guidance update. The difference in 2007 on theprofit side is purely prices. They are down from our last call, as you haveseen nationwide. Note our continued strong production growth offsets some ofthis pricing decrease. Our speed of development strategy is allowing us todrill more than planned, which is reflected in our capital increase in 2007,and also reflects a greater production growth. ", "For 2008, we are raising guidance in each of our categories.Our profit is up by 5%, capital is up by 17%, and production is up by 6%. Thisagain reflects our ability to turn capital investments rapidly into productionand profit.", "With that, I will thank our employees -- slide 18. I wouldlike to thank our employees for a great quarter and everything they do for us.And I will now turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan Armstrong", "", "Thanks, Ralph. Starting here on slide 20. Our recurringsegment profit of $300 million for the second quarter of 2007 beat the previousquarterly record of 248 million reported in second quarter of '07.

", "Additional profit [assessing] investments we have madecertainly paid off and have allowed us to maximize profitability. The key toour success in this area has been solid project management execution. Our teamstarted up our 350 million a day train at Opal on schedule, and within 10% ofbudget in February of '07. Having this project start up smoothly and on-timehas allowed us to realize these great margins. And it provided our customerswith the reliable service they bargained for to keep their Jonah and Pinedalevolumes flowing as promised. ", "We also have successfully integrated BASF's interest in theGeismar plant, which contributed nicely to our segment profit in this quarteras well, and progress has been made in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. ThePerdido Norte agreements were executed in the third quarter finally with theproducer. A lot of very complex issues to deal with there, and we are happy tohave that behind us.

And in the light blue bar the amount of liquids we are producingfor our own account, excluding our Discovery and [Oxable] investments.", "An interesting data-point here is also the five-year averagemargin of $0.22. As you can see, we saw margins of almost three times theprevious 20 quarters in the third quarter. The environment that drove recordmargins during the third quarter is certainly alive and well in the fourthquarter; however, we are not planning on these in 2008 and beyond.", "Several factors have worked together to create thisextraordinary environment. First, the low gas prices in the Rockiescaused by infrastructure constraints and very successful drilling programs inthe Piceance, Uinta and Jonah, Pinedale basins. With the addition of new gastransportation capacity out of the Rockies in the near future, we do expect gasprices in Wyoming and Coloradoto return to historical norms. ", "Crude to gas ratio plays an important role as well. Sinceolefins producers have consistently chosen ethane over heavier feedstock, suchas naphtha, it is putting tremendous upward price pressure on ethane, propaneand some butanes. We anticipate some of this intense demand to be met by newprocessing plants in the Rockies and Barnett Shale thatare announced to come on in service in 2008. ", "Moving on to slide 22. Given the year-to-date results, coupledwith the strong margin environment outlook for the fourth quarter, we are proudto announce we have increased our 2007 segment profit from 700 to 850 million,to 950 to 1.125 -- I think, I like saying billions better there. So, we arereally excited about seeing this kind of increase. Similarly, we increased oursegment profit guidance for 2008, but moderately by 25 million at the midpoint.", "Capital spending for '07 remains unchanged at 650 to 700million; however, our 2008 capital guidance has been raised from 525 to 575 nowto 650 to 700 million. The increase is due primarily to an expansion of ourPerdido Norte project, new developments in our Canadian Oil Sandsopportunities, and several new expansion opportunities that are emerging in thedynamic Western region. The big driver in our 2007 to 2008 decline from ourprevious guidance forecast is a planned 350 million drop in NGL margins, drivenby higher natural gas prices.", "Also near 2007 in propane heavier prices are contemplatedhere, but we expect ethane prices to lower by approximately 20% during thisperiod. However, if we saw a repeat of 2007 in terms of NGL margins, we wouldexpect an approximate 5% increase in profits next year, due to growth projectlike Bass Lite and our investment in BASF's interest in Geismar. And these willbe partially offset by higher depreciation and O&M costs.", "Moving on to slide 23. Here we are providing areconciliation of the current guidance versus earlier guidance for 2007 and2008. First, I will explain the segment profit guidance changes. Of course, amajor factor increasing our segment profit guidance in both periods is NGLmargins. Our outlook for NGL margins increased from approximately $0.40 pergallon to $0.54 per gallon for full year 2007.", "In 2008, we have increased our margins by roughly $0.06 pergallon, reflecting the higher assumed commodity prices. Total year margin in2008 is forecast to be approximately $460 million or $0.32 per gallon. This isabout a dime per gallon above five-year average of $0.22 shown on the previousslide. ", "Also increasing segment profit guidance is higher margins inour olefins segment for both '07 and '08. This increase is driven primarily byhigher margins forecast at our Canadian facilities, driven by higher propaneand butylene mix margins. Propylene and ethylene are fairly flat in our olefinsbusiness. And the price forecast that we have in our olefins business is basedon the August 30th CMAI price forecast, if you track that.", "Increased costs in 2008 reflect higher operating expenseattributable primarily to additional overhauls being planned next year. Wecertainly have tried to limit any downtime on equipment this year with the highmargins that we have had, but we will be having to take equipment down in '08for overhauls. As well, we expect higher G&A costs required to handle thetremendous amount of new growth in the Canadian Oil Sands and Western regionthat is new to us now. ", "Lower volumes assumptions reflect the lower volume in theFour Corners where volumes were reduced by about 40 million per day, due to aless aggressive assumption about well connects. Now we are not saying that ourvolumes are actually lower year-to-year by 40 million, we are simply sayingthat from our previous guidance forecast it is lower. Some of the difficultiesout there that have caused us to back off a more aggressive forecast is someland issues on the Hickory Apache Nation, and an inability to get on some ofour producers to get on to some of the Forest Service lands. We also are projectingsome lower volumes in the Gulf Coast.Permian/Anadarko's, Boomvang and Nansen projects, which flow into our EastBreak system.", "On the capital guidance side, we also increased our GAAPcapital guidance a bit from our second quarter, primarily this was driven bythe Perdido Norte project. There we have got most of the increase, 40 million,the vast majority of that is covered, by rate adjusters that we have with ourcustomers out there, and we are set in place to cover things like increase inship construction costs and steel costs.", "We also have some new opportunities out in the Westernregion, and there are quite a few small projects that I won't list here.", "Moving on to the pie chart here, slide 24, this kind ofshows the backlog, if you will, the investment opportunities we have. LargeDeepwater projects and Rockies opportunities, especiallythe Willow Creek project, dominate the expansion capital and guidance for 2007and 2008. These new opportunities, along with an expanded time horizon, havecontributed to a $200 million increase in the in guidance pie. Specifically,the expenditures represented are for all projects started in 2007 through 2012,and include all projected expenditures for projects started during that timeline. So we have expanded the time horizon quite a bit here.", "The under negotiation pie range has remained steady. Themain differences involve the area in which the expenditures occur. Basically wehave got volumes -- sorry, some of the projects moving from the Deepwater andinto the TXP-IV expansion at Echo Springs, and our Canadian Oil Sands.", "The pie labeled in development and proposal reflects thetremendous amount of opportunities that we recently identified during ourfive-year long range planning process. Examples include adding a couple ofpotential Deepwater projects to this category, and adding several new CanadianOil Sands off-gas recovery projects.", "Capital range has changed from 700 million to 1.1 billion inthe second quarter call to now a range of 3 to 4 billion in this call. Andagain, one of the major impacts in this is the change, or the expanded timehorizon that we are looking at.", "You can see listed below there some of the significantprojects that are in guidance, and that we are currently working on. And youalso can see there a listing of the operating profit that we would expect toadd in the first full year of operations for those assets.", "To recap, we have increased our segment profit guidance for2007 and 2008, reflecting higher NGL and olefin margins and the addition of newopportunities. We, of course, are excited about reaching the $1 billion markfor segment profit this year. And I would remind you, we have not raised ourguidance in response to the most recent spike in crude oil prices.", "Third quarter 2007 has been another record quarter inseveral ways, including overall margins and Rockiesmargins in September and also recurring segment profit. Our team's execution ongetting Opal expanded and quickly started up this year has produced tremendousshareholder value. Our disciplined approach to capital investments has usproducing tremendous returns on capital invested that are unmatched by any ofour competitors.", "Again, it is important to note that market forces have cometogether in an unprecedented way to create the opportunity that we have seenhere in the third quarter, and we expect here in the fourth quarter as well. Inour numbers, we are not planning on a repeat of these conditions in 2008.", "We are very excited about our growth opportunities in severalof our key areas, as we have mentioned, and these projects will lay a strongfoundation for the future.

Is that what youwere asking?", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Yes, exactly.", "Ralph Hill", "", "No, not necessarily. What we have said before is that thoselocations, particularly in the Valley, were cut off on a lateral reach, if youwill, of about 2,000 feet.We have proven that we can go out near 3,000 feet on our reach, as ourdirectional reach is now, so ultimately, as we continue to do that and get morecomfortable at that, we would add locations to our portfolio.", "And then as for the Highlands, atthis point that's the same kind of technology going on up there, and we havenot been able to expand out as much. But again we have only drilled in -- Ithink we have 100 wells we have drilled in the Highlandsso far. We are drilling about another 80 or 90 this year. Expect to be over 100or so next year.

I think, the inventory is still veryprolific and large. It's just that we have a number of locations to get to, asyou all know, and what we have been trying to do all along is to continue to dothat faster, and in an efficient manner and a safe manner.

But clearly the capacity out is tied until REX is done. And anykind of maintenance or even small disruption will back gas up into the Rockies.", "So it's kind of an ongoing thing. It has been going reallymost of the year, second and third and fourth quarter. We just thought we wouldtalk about it a little bit in the third quarter because even though ourproduction growth was great at 17% production growth, it would have beenslightly higher, but we were curtailed. So obviously, we are anxiously waitingfor the Rockies Express to kick in.", "Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse", "Was it a similar amount in the second quarter then?", "Ralph Hill", "", "No, not as much, I don't recall what it was, but there wassome in the second quarter also.", "Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse", "Okay. Fair enough. Don, Alan, looking at the Midstream, andspecifically with respect to risk management, I know you have got the oil pricerange out there for your 2008 guidance, but at the same time we are looking at[Calloway stripped] at around $88. And there are some concern maybe the firsthalf of '08 we might see some weaker oil prices.", "Is there any attraction, I guess, towards actually doingsome dirty hedges with respect to oil or if liquid enough going out moreaggressively locking in liquids prices?", "Alan Armstrong", "", "I will speak to the liquids price issue. I will let Don takeon the dirty hedge question there. How is that? On the NGL prices there aresome very attractive prices offered, as you probably know if you follow that.", "There are very steep discounts, particularly if you get intothe long dated. Get beyond about six months, and you really start to see thespread or the relationships between crude and those NGLs to fall offdramatically.", "I will tell you that we did a small hedge last year; we havea small hedge on now, and we have continued to lose somewhere about 10% belowmarket on those hedges, even though we thought those were really great priceswhen we put them on.", "So the good news is on the gas side we have got thatcovered. I think, it's a great question for us on crude oil, especially giventhe recent spike. And I will tell you that we are following the NGL priceofferings very closely and have been looking at a lot of bids coming in onthat, particularly in the first six months of next year. I will turn the crudequestion over to Don.", "Don Chappel", "", "Carl, a good question. It is one that we look at regularly.Some of the consideration, well, one is if we had hedged we would have missed alot of the upside. Two, it is a dirty hedge, and certainly there is somepotential of lack of economic alignment there that could cause a loss, as wellas potentially lock in a profit. There are liquidity issues. Certainly hedginga substantial amount of oil would require a lot of liquidity to support that,and then you get to the accounting issues.", "So to date, we have chosen not to. It's something wecontinue to look at. But I can't give you any guidance as to whether or not wewill find it to be attractive in the future. To date, we have chosen not to doit.", "Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse", "Fair enough. And then, lastly and I will get back into queueafter this. Don, with respect to Gas Marketing, I guess, I'm looking for alittle more color on, absent the mark-to-market or excluding the mark-to-marketlosses, what predominately was causing that cash marketing loss? I mean is thatstill part of the legacy position? And kind of as a corollary, are the reasonwhy you are going to kind of a neutral position in '08 going back to a priorcomment you said because hopefully we are going to manage this exposure down inthe first quarter, I mean is that what gives us confidence to getting to a neutralor positive in '08?", "Don Chappel", "", "First I will answer. I just mentioned that the accountingrules didn't allow us to put all of the positions that were associated with theformer Power segment into discontinued operations, despite the fact that theyreally weren't positions that we would expect to continue.", "So, we have something that feels like discontinuedoperations up in the Gas Marketing segment. So some of the positions, we wouldexpect to exit at a gain or loss and that we're taking steps to exit some ofthose positions, which would take out some of the -- both the drag on earningsas well as the cash impact.", "Beyond that, I think, if we really think about the businessgoing forward, again it's principally in support of E&P and Midstream,providing a service, marketing, transportation and storage and over the longhaul we would expect that to be breakeven or better.", "We do take storage positions from time to time where we willput gas in storage, and in many cases sell it forward, lock in a profit. Buteven in that case, the lower of cost or market accounting rules, if there is adecline in the market value, it requires to mark it down. And if the pricescome back, we can't mark it back up. So we are dealing with that. But again Ithink longer-term we expect this to be a business that's breakeven or better.", "Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse", "And the other aspect of the question, as you guys look tomanage or sell down some of these legacy positions, as you are looking at ittoday or post the most recent mark-to-market. On a net-net basis are thosepositions meaningful, material or is it something that's below $50 million thatjust needs to be gone?", "Don Chappel", "", "I would say it could be above $50 million, but certainly Iwouldn't expect it to be all that significant. And again, I think, when wetalked about the overall gain or loss associated with exiting the Power segmentbusiness, we indicated that the overall gain and loss was not expected to besignificant.", "We still view these positions that -- our legacy positionsto be part of that overall exiting of the Power segment. So we are required toaccount for it in separate buckets, but we view it much, much the same.", "Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse", "Great, Very helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from [Ken Snyder] from Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "It's actually Faisel Khan from Citi. Good morning. On theMidstream volumes, can you just remind us again what the breakdown is ofkeep-whole POP and POL grouped together in fee-based volumes?", "Don Chappel", "", "Faisel, are you wanting to know that on a volumetric basis?", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "On a volumetric basis.", "Don Chappel", "", "Volumetric basis. I don't have that detail right here infront of me. I can give you a rough breakdown of it. The majority of ourkeep-whole exposure is in the Rockies. In fact, probably looking at our gasvolumes, our shrink volume is the best way to look at that.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay.", "Don Chappel", "", "And we have about total MMbtu consumption on the Midstreamside is about 400 million a day roughly. That includes Discovery and ourolefins business as well.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay.", "Don Chappel", "", "And about 65% of that fuel and shrink is in the Rockies\u2026", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Got it.", "Don Chappel", "", "-- with the vast majority of that being at our Opalfacility. Opal is very heavily weighted to keep-whole, Wamsutter is morebalanced to fee-based. And in the San Juan Basin about 15% of our fuel andshrink is consumed in that area.", "And in the San Juan Basin that mix is about 71% of ourcontract mix is either processing fee or gathering fee, and the balance iskeep-whole, and split about 50-50 between keep-whole and percent-of-liquids.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay.", "Don Chappel", "", "And then the balance of our fuel and shrink is in the GulfCoast region, and about 40% of our business in the Gulf Coast is fee-based, andthe balance being split between percent-of-liquids and keep-whole.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay. And then in terms of your new facilities coming onlineand new contracts you are signing with customers, what is the breakdown of thetype of contracts you are signing in terms of fee-based versus commodityexposed contracts?", "Don Chappel", "", "We continue to shift contracts to fee-based. For instance,our Cameron Meadows facility is now 100% fee-based. And we continue to do that,as producers see the value in the upgrade, and are willing to pay us a lothigher fee-based contract.", "So, in this kind of environment, we are generally shiftingto fee-based contracts, just because they are perceived as valuable by ourcustomers.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay. And in terms of your NGL customers, are you seeing anyslowdown in consumption of your liquids volumes to those customers that arechemical or refining customers?", "Don Chappel", "", "No, and in fact, if you look at what data is available as toNGL storage, [light in] storage, that has been getting drawn on pretty hard.Ethylene cracking capacity is way up. Of course, we have a good bird's eye viewof that from running our ethylene cracker there in the olefins business atGeismar, so we understand the demands on that side.", "And there are very strong pulls in the ethylene andpropylene markets right now. And of course with crude oil being where it is,the heavier products like naphtha that might be cracked are just way tooexpensive, and so ethane and propane are the desired feedstocks, and there isreally a strong pull on that.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Got you. On your E&P activities, is there any update onany of your exploration activities in the Paradox or anywhere else?", "Ralph Hill", "", "Several updates I could give you. First in the Barcus Creekarea, which is the northern part of the Highlands, we are drilling our fifthwell. And as soon as that well reaches TD, we will have earned the 11,000additional net acres.", "In the Paradox, three vertical wells have been drilled todate, with our fourth well is currently going to spud by the end of the year.And we are still evaluating the wells and the results, and so we are workingthrough that new area, but also drilling ahead.", "In the Piceance, we also have added a second well to what weare calling a deep well test. And this is to test what\u2019s called the Cozzette,Corcoran and Mancos test. And we are in our second well there. We believe thatthat could have a deeper pool of reserves below the Williams Fork, so we aredrilling our second well there.", "And In Uinta, we are drilling our first well there, and weare drilling ahead -- just started about a week or so ago. So quite a bitactivity there, and that\u2019s part of the reason why you saw the update in capitalexpenditures for exploration. We are moving ahead on all of our projects that Ihave been talking about for the last couple of calls.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "The Uinta Basin, is that a new acreage position that youguys picked up or is that a legacy position?", "Ralph Hill", "", "It is a new acreage position we have been picking up overthe last year and a half, a couple of years, and we have established a prettysolid block of acreage there. And it\u2019s still way too early to tell, but it wastime to start testing it, and we are drilling our first well there.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "How many acres do you guys have there?", "Ralph Hill", "", "About 74,000, 75,000 net acres.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Ralph Hill", "", "It's similar to our position in the Piceance Valley\u2026", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Right.", "Ralph Hill", "", "-- in total net acreage.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay. And on the Barnett, I think you guys, probably saidyou tripled production year-over-year, is that correct?", "Ralph Hill", "", "That is correct.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "What is the potential of the position you guys have there, Imean, what -- is it fair to say we could continue to see a sort of growth givenyour inventory or\u2026?", "Ralph Hill", "", "Well, obviously, the base volume will continue to go up. Butour inventory is well over a 100 locations as we speak now, and that couldincrease substantially with some, if you will, down spacing that\u2019s going on inthe basin.", "We have actually five rigs operating now. We intend to beoperating in the four to five -- probably more like the four rig level. And wehave more locations that we are trying to secure as we speak on. There's a lotof deal flow from the -- smaller deal flow in that area. So I think, we couldcontinue to see good growth in the Barnett.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay. And then on your -- in terms of picking up morepipeline capacity out of the Rockies, I think, I saw that you picked up maybe-- is it 100 million cubic feet a day to SoCal, is that new or is that old?", "Ralph Hill", "", "Well, that is a current position that it's been usedsomewhat in the Power side of the business, so we have picked up. And that isnew in the sense that we are now moving gas to Southern Californiaon Kern, and that will be part of our portfolio. And obviously, it\u2019s a verygood pricing point for us.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "So you were able to bring over the Kern Rivercapacity that was at the marketing business into your lease capacity?", "Ralph Hill", "", "Yes, we were.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Was there anything else that came out of that portfolio thatyou guys are deciding to keep?", "Ralph Hill", "", "On the transportation side, we had already workedproactively with Bill's Power Group, so the rest of that was already in our, ifyou will, in the Williams family, and we were already utilizing it.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay. Thanks. And on the pipeline side, the higher thanexpected earnings for the year in pipelines versus what you had in lastquarter, is that a result of the stipulation agreement you guys entered into onthe pipeline side, or is there something else that I am missing?", "Steve Malcolm", "", "I'm sorry, stipulation agreement?", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "I think you guys talked about a stipulation with yourcustomers that you entered into on Transco.", "Steve Malcolm", "", "Rate case. Largely up on the rate case and also someeffective cost control measures.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay. Do you have any sort of CapEx or potential projectcost for these open seasons that you have outstanding?", "Don Chappel", "", "We have detailed the ones that we can detail in theexhibits, Faisel.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay. And then on the accounting and finance side. Your cashtax rate, I think, next year goes up to 35%. Is that a function of your NOL,you have kind of used up all your NOLs?", "Don Chappel", "", "In terms of the cash tax rate, I think, it was more afunction of some of the nondeductible items that went through income in thepast. So again, the permanent differences that we have are relatively few.", "So, it\u2019s really more about the statutory rate adjusted forany nondeductible in terms of the provision, in terms of the actual cash taxes,yes, the absence of the NOL, or the fact that the NOL has been used up wouldcause that to rise sharply.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Do you guys have a number in terms of how many shares yourepurchased in October, I saw the September and August numbers, but\u2026?", "Don Chappel", "", "They were no additional shares repurchased during the monthof October.", "Faisel Khan -Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you for the time, gentlemen, I appreciate it.", "Operator", "", "And we will hear next from Sam Brothwell from Wachovia.", "Sam Brothwell -Wachovia", "Hi. Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me?", "Don Chappel", "", "Yes.", "Sam Brothwell -Wachovia", "I\u2019m sorry. Ralph, you mentioned something about you pickedup some acreage in the Uinta, is that in Colorado or Utah?", "Ralph Hill", "", "That\u2019s actually in Utah.", "Sam Brothwell -Wachovia", "It\u2019s in Utah. And you are targeting Mancos?", "Ralph Hill", "", "Well, actually we are targeting -- no, in that area we arebasically targeting what would be equivalent of what we drill for in thePiceance, which is the Williams Fork Formation.", "Sam Brothwell -Wachovia", "Okay. But I heard you say something about Mancos in there, Imust have gotten?", "Ralph Hill", "", "That was in the Piceance. We are drilling deeper in the Piceance Valley\u2026", "Sam Brothwell -Wachovia", "Got you.", "Ralph Hill", "", "-- targeting a couple -- we are on our second well, which isevaluating the potential that we may or may not have, and it goes from theWilliams Fork Formation, also known as the Mesaverde formation, down into theCozzette, Corcoran and then Mancos.", "Sam Brothwell -Wachovia", "Got it. Okay. And then as you look at going forward, I havebeen hearing a lot about there is a need for additional clearly takeaway, takecapacity from the Rockies. Do you see the greater opportunity going westbound,or still eastbound, or both, can you comment on that?", "And Phil, to the extent that there is a need for another bigpipe East out of the Rockies, would you guys look atdoing something major in that regard?", "Ralph Hill", "", "This is Ralph. I think there is need for additionalcapacity, as you have probably seen from all the other producers talking aboutthat and others. So, I think that possibly an opportunity to go to the West isa good idea.", "And then to continue to expand, as we have all seen theability to go to the East, whichever way that actually -- Northeast or and theSoutheast is also a good opportunity. So, I think the good idea is or neat ideais that several pipelines are talking about those kind of things. And we lookforward to hopefully a couple of those actually happening.", "Phil Wright", "", "Sam, this is Phil. Clearly to the extent that some of thosemake economic sense for us, we are going to be out there aggressively pursuingthem.", "Sam Brothwell -Wachovia", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "", "And next we\u2019ll hear from Robert  Lane from SMH Capital.", "Robert Lane - SMH Capital", "Good morning, guys. I know you have already touched on this,but I just want to dig a little deeper into the Rockies Connector Pipelineversus Kinder Morgan's proposed pipeline. I know you all said you had beenvastly oversubscribed on the deal. But their announcement had come pretty muchwhen your open season was over.", "Is this the type of deal, if you take a look at your'scapacity and their's capacity, when you add them together it's pretty much wellover capacity for what is going to be coming through on that pipeline. Is thisthe kind of deal where you all might downsize a bit, or is it also the kind ofdeal where you would partner with Kinder Morgan and try to bring that gas East?", "Phil Wright", "", "This is Phil again. I don't know that I would use the wordvastly oversubscribed, but we were oversubscribed. I think, we have the rightsize pipe. I think, we have, for the timeframe in which the market wants to seethat capacity there.", "We think that the shippers have sort of spoken as a marketas to when they would like to see the capacity and in what quantity. Andthere\u2019s your observation that with both pipes there might be an overcapacitysituation in that quarter if both of them got built, is an accurate one.", "And whether or not we would do something with Kinder Morganis just a question out there. I personally would think we are going to proceedwith our project -- as we go to precedent agreements we would probably justproceed.", "Robert Lane - SMH Capital", "Okay. Do you also have a time -- and I think you all mighthave mentioned this, and I apologize because I had to jump off the call at onepoint. Do you have sort of a timing at when you are looking to lock down abinding open season?", "Phil Wright", "", "Well as I said, we are working on it as we speak, and wehope to have those concluded by the end of the year.", "Robert Lane - SMH Capital", "Okay. Thanks so much. ", "Operator", "", "And next we\u2019ll go to [Gabriel Bradar from KStreet Capital].And Mr. [Bradar], your line is open.", "Gabriel Bradar -KStreet Capital", "Hello. Can you hear me?", "Don Chappel", "", "Yes. ", "Phil Wright", "", "Yes. ", "Gabriel Bradar -KStreet Capital", "Okay. Just a quick question on the '08 guidance, can youjust talk to the jump in corporate and other costs? I think, it's going up bylike 80 or 90 million?", "Don Chappel", "", "That includes minority interest associated with drop-downtransactions. So you saw we announced the Wamsutter drop-down, it will beassociated with that.", "Gabriel Bradar -KStreet Capital", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Next we\u2019ll go to [Mark Arbarsebi] from PIMCO.", "Mark Arbarsebi -PIMCO", "Hello. Can you hear me?", "Don Chappel", "", "Yes.", "Mark Arbarsebi -PIMCO", "Hey, there. Thanks. Just a quick question here on yourguidance. It looks like CapEx obviously up. Free cash flow is going to be downa bit from prior guidance. And it looks like negative free cash flow for theyear for '08 guidance. Is that right?", "Don Chappel", "", "That's correct and that\u2019s by design. I think in our priorguidance, we included only the capital projects that we had a high level ofconfidence on. And always we had disclosed that it was our goal to drill evenfaster, as well as to capture the many projects that both Midstream and GasPipelines have in front of them. So, you should have and should continue toexpect capital spending to increase somewhat as we capture those additional value-addingopportunities. So, yes.", "Mark Arbarsebi -PIMCO", "Just a quick question here then on the credit profile.Obviously, you guys have done a great job and everything. I am just wonderingwhen the Power book is sold, when you close the Power deal this month, are yougoing to be making a stronger push to get to investment grade with theagencies, maybe going back and meeting with them, talking about Power bookbeing gone, or is there something maybe you are going to push out, given what Iam looking at here on free cash flow and so on?", "Don Chappel", "", "We meet with the agencies every quarter. We will meet withthem again following this call. And we are constantly keeping them posted onour activities and our plans. And, yes, we would be hopeful of ratings action,but it's up to the agencies.", "Mark Arbarsebi -PIMCO", "Are you thinking it's a definite goal of the company and theBoard to at some point be investment grade, or is it not really an explicitgoal you guys have in mind, I guess, given that you have opportunities outthere?", "Don Chappel", "", "Well, the number one goal is to drive equity value up on asustainable basis faster than our peers. So that's the overarching goal. Wethink that having stronger credit would help us achieve that goal, in thatavailability of capital is more reliable, the cost of that capital is somewhatlower.", "And we can be more opportunistic to seize the opportunitiesahead. So we think a stronger credit rating, investment-grade rating isworthwhile, but the overarching goal is to drive sustainable and superiorequity value.", "Mark Arbarsebi -PIMCO", "Okay. And that would be great. That's helpful. Hey, thanksagain. Thanks for your time. ", "Don Chappel", "", "Thanks you.", "Operator", "", "We will now take a follow-up question from Carl Kirst from CreditSuisse.", "Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse", "Sorry, guys, just two quick follow-ups, and I appreciate thetime. The first is on the other Wamsutter transaction, the WPZ, it was notedthat we were looking around $41 million of EBITDA for the first half of theyear. Can that be broken out between how much is fee-based versus how much iscommodity sensitive?", "Don Chappel", "", "Well first, I will remind you that first and second quarterswere not all that -- that's not where we saw the anomaly, if you will, inmargins.", "Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse", "Correct.", "Don Chappel", "", "But we will be providing some detail on that as we gothrough the process. I hate to get ahead of ourselves in providing some detailthat somebody might rely on or take out of context. I think, we will wait untilwe have put that detail in writing. ", "Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse", "Okay. But it is fair to say that given that it has aprocessing facility, it's not 100% fee-based? ", "Don Chappel", "", "That is correct. It is not 100% fee-based.", "Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Fair enough. And then just last question, Ralph. Inthe appendix, you guys have sort of annotated your cash costs around roughlythe 2.05 million mark LOE, etcetera, etcetera. Can you actually break that outon a component basis, if possible?", "Ralph Hill", "", "Yes, I can.", "Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse", "And if you don't have it, we can follow up offline.", "Ralph Hill", "", "I've got it, I think. Real quick, let me just check onething. Roughly LOE was in the approximately $0.69 range; gathering, 57;operating taxes about 44, 45; and then G&A in the $0.36 range or so. Thatmight not quite add to 2.05, but it would be close.", "Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Ralph Hill", "", "Okay.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll take our last question today from Rick Gross fromLehman Brothers.", "Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers", "Hi. Good morning. A couple of quick questions on theE&P; one of the areas that plateaued or has plateaued for a while is the Powder River. I know, we have had the Medicine Bow lateral, and it's goingto create some more outlets.", "Obviously, it gets you to a restricted point until RockiesExpress takes off. You've had some water handling problems. But is it basicallythat kind of mechanical issue, not so much drilling inventory that hasflattened that production profile out there?", "Ralph Hill", "", "Well, our production profile -- we were up 11%, but I thinkI see what you are saying.", "Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers", "I am looking at the last three quarter at plus or minus 165million a day.", "Ralph Hill", "", "Right, I think what you see in there is our production hasthe capability, and currently it is much higher than that. And what is going onis there was an expansion by Fort Union Gas Gathering that needed to occur thatis finally in place here in the first part of October or was in place in thefirst part of October. And that has allowed the -- really the constraint was inthe gathering system for our volumes to take off, and improve quite a bit overthat. ", "Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers", "Okay.", "Ralph Hill", "", "So it has not been a \u2013 it's clearly not the wellperformance, nor the number of locations, it has been the ability to get it outof the gathering and FUGG as they call it, Fort Union Gas Gathering, has takenoff, and completed their expansion.", "Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers", "Okay. And you mentioned -- you didn't give a quantity in theSan Juan. That also has been an area where you have come off the peak. And Iwas just curious as to what the volume was there, because you said it had comeoff because of some maintenance and some other things going on once again inthe gathering systems there.", "Ralph Hill", "", "We had volumes that are still in the 150 million a dayrange, so they have remained relatively flat. They have gone as high a fewtimes in the 155, 160 range, but still in the 150 or so range as we speak inthe fourth quarter.", "Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers", "Okay. A different subject. Don indicated that you arerunning through the NOLs and your cash tax rates are going up. How are you guyshandling your IDCs for tax purposes? I am curious as the budget goes up why youwouldn't be sheltering more of your cash taxes?", "Don Chappel", "", "I would say we are sheltering all that is available to us.Rick, and we can provide some additional comments offline on that.", "Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers", "Okay.", "Don Chappel", "", "That\u2019s it. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "That does conclude the question-and-answer session fortoday. At this time, I will turn it back over to our speakers for anyadditional or closing remarks.", "Steve Malcolm", "", "Yeah. I appreciate your questions today.

By almost any measure or metric, we recorded another outstanding quarter.", "Recurring adjusted earnings per share was up 84%, and consolidated segment profit was up 93%. Our integrated business model is hitting on all of its cylinders with E&P\u2019s domestic production higher by 20%, over a year ago. Production now exceeds a Bcf a day. Production in our two largest basins, Piceance and Powder, were up 27% versus first quarter last year, and our resource potential continues to grow. As well, Midstream continued to capture strong margins and recorded segment profit, which was 69% higher than first quarter in 2007.", "And Gas Pipes with higher rates on Transco and Northwest pipeline, and revenues from two expansion projects, was able to improve segment profit by 20%. Our operating performance continues to drive impressive financial results, and the future looks bright, as we\u2019ve continued our disciplined investment around our best of class assets, and have increased our financial outlook for 2008 and 2009. And finally, we continue to pull incremental value levers, with the creation of Williams Pipeline Partners in January, and the continued repurchase of our shares.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to, Don Chappel.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Steve, good morning. Turn to slide number 8 please. Just a summary of our top level financial results. Net income of $500 million compared quite favorably to net income a year ago, up almost fourfold. Perhaps more importantly, our key earnings measure, recurring income from continuing operations after mark-to-market adjustments, was at $0.57 compared to $0.31 a year ago, an increase of 84%.", "Let\u2019s turn the page please, to slide number 9. Just to show some of the detail, I will focus my comments on recurring. The only significant item between recurring and reported this quarter is the gain recorded in E&P on the Peru asset sale. But, in terms of continuing operations, E&P reported $312 million of recurring segment profit, up 66% on the strength of 20% production increase, higher average realized prices, offset somewhat, by higher costs related to higher volumes, as well as higher costs and higher prices.", "Midstream also had a terrific quarter, reporting $261 million in segment profit, up 79% from a year ago. Midstream\u2019s results are up sharply, as a result of much higher NGL prices and margins. Solid production was offset somewhat, by $25 million of production that went into line pack inventory versus sales in this quarter, some lingering effects of the Ignacio fire, and some difficult weather in the West during the quarter.", "Gas pipeline at $180 million was up 20% year-over-year as result of the full quarter effect of the Transco rate cases. Just looking down to the bottom line segment profit, after mark-to-market adjustment in total up $280 million or up 57%.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it to Ralph.", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "Thank you, Don. I\u2019m pleased to share our very positive first quarter results with you today, and I want to thank all of our dedicated employees for their excellent work to make these results happen.", "Let\u2019s turn to slide 11. Our first quarter \u201808 production was up 19% compared to first quarter 2007. Our operating profit this quarter was a record at $312 million, it was up 66% from the first quarter \u201807, and that does not include the $118 million non-recurring gain that we had on sales from international assets.", "Looking at slide 12, as our major basins. Our Piceance Valley was up 25% over a year ago, we currently have 22 rigs operating in the valley. The Highlands team, volumes were up 72% over a year ago at 43 million a day and we have four rigs operating in the Highlands. Powder River volumes continued to explode. They are up 27% from over a year ago at 209 million cubic feet a day. And the Fort Worth volumes were up over 2 times from a year ago at 38 million a day and we have four rigs operating. Very solid results in each of our core basins.", "Looking at some of our cost metrics, turning to slide 13. Production costs, which is defined basically on our investor relations sheet as lease and other operating expenses and operating taxes. As you can see, we continue to be one of the leaders in the industry. We were $1.08 per Mcf in our production costs. The industry average listed on this, which is the top 20 producers that we see, was approximately $1.59. So, we continue to have a significant cost advantage in our production cost.", "Looking at slide 14, finding and development costs. Our three-year F&D ending the year in 2007 was $1.77 per Mcf. The group average, as you can see on this chart, was $2.89. On the one-year basis our F&D was approximately $1.93, and the industry\u2019s average was about $3.09. We prefer to look at it on a three-year basis, and again we have a significant cost advantage in our F&D costs.", "Slide 15, production growth. We are now the 12 largest producer overall and number four in production growth, as you can see on this chart. The left side of the chart shows the overall position and the right side of the chart shows that, we were up little over 21%, and this is based on the year end 2007 data for the year 2007. And recall a number of the producers listed in this top 20 with us, do have a number of acquisitions in their portfolio, and almost all of our growth is what we call organic growth through the drillbit.", "Slide 16, growth in reserves. Again, we had a 232% reserve replacement for last year. You can see the top reserve replacements. The far right side of this column shows what it is without any acquisitions percentage. So we would move up several spots on this without acquisitions, which we virtually had no acquisitions for reserves. So again, very impressive work by the team in growing our reserves.", "Slide 17, to update you on our, as we always do in this call, our 3P reserves and resource potential. We\u2019ve increased our 3P reserves from last year by over 600 Bcf, and this is after producing 334 Bcf last year, as you\u2019ll recall. Overall, our total 3P reserves now are approximately 11.4 Tcf. And if you look at our resource potential, we continue to be in that range about 22 Tcf. So impressive year for our 3P growth, and the 3P reserves exclude the majority of our new areas, such as the majority of Barcus Creek, and all of the paradox you went to in areas like that, that we are currently doing some exploratory drilling in, those are excluded from our 3P reserves.", "Slide 18, is a new slide for us to show the geographically where our reserves are both on a proved and probable basis in the current production. I won\u2019t go into this slide in detail, but it does show that, obviously as we continue to be, a majority of our reserves are in the Piceance, followed up by, on a potential basis, and our probable basis, in the Powder River with our San Juan and Mid-Continent group, bringing up the rest of our proved reserves.", "And finally, slide 19. We continue to have significant value creation for Williams. Record set quarter for segment profit and production, 3P reserves 11.4 Tcf. Our strategy continues to be rapid development in a very safe manner for the premier drilling inventory. The rest of leader in production costs, successes, cost efficiencies, those all continue. So, I again thank our experienced and talented workforce for that. And we also look forward to continue to pursue and evaluate our new resource opportunities as this year continues on.", "With that, I will now turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering and Processing", "Thanks, Ralph. Well, we did have another great quarter in Midstream as well, and our record first quarter segment profit of $261 million, beat the first quarter of 2007 recurring segment profit by 78%, and again, that\u2019s on a recurring basis. We accomplished this in spite of a $25 million NGL inventory build as about 59 million gallons of NGLs went to build linepack during March. Roughly half of this will come back to us when Overland Pass Pipeline comes online as the required linepack and that NGL pipeline is about half of the MAPL system that we\u2019re currently producing into.", "Our first quarter \u201808 equity NGL production increased approximately 10% over first quarter \u201807, when you normalize for these changes in inventory. Our expansion into the Piceance Basin of Colorado is progressing as well. We\u2019re moving ahead rapidly with the construction of our Willow Creek processing plant, the transfer of the Parachute pipeline from Gas Pipes to Midstream, and the conversion and completion of the PGX NGL pipeline that carries NGL production out of E&P\u2019s Parachute processing complex today.", "The benefits of William\u2019s integrated strategy with E&P and Gas Pipes in the Piceance are abundantly clear, as we work to optimize this valuable resource play with all segments of our Company. In 2008, we continue to succeed at growing our deepwater volumes in the Gulf of Mexico, as evidenced by our executing new contracts which dedicated five new blocks to our discovery system. And we received the first deliveries of Bass Lite gas in first quarter \u201808, and are awaiting the startup of the Blind Faith spar in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. As we discussed last quarter, we have executed an NGL forward sales strategy that mitigates a portion of the risk related to our NGL sales price in 2008.", "Moving to the next side, this graph shows the tracking of margins over the last five years. It also shows growth in our total domestic NGL production. And in the light blue bar, the amount of liquids we sold for our account, excluding discovery and oxable investments. To reiterate, our equity NGL production only shows the volumes we sold as opposed to that produced for our own account, and therefore excluded a swing of about 71 million gallons, which was sales from inventory of about 12 during the first quarter of \u201807 and, again, a delivery in the inventory of about 59. So that total swing was a total of 71 million gallons.", "Volumes were also affected by about 20 days of downtime in January, at the Ignacio fire that happened in 2007 as our system of Four Corners recovered from that. Volumes are returning back up to normal as we enter into the second quarter now. The environment that drove record margins during the fourth quarter was certainly alive and well in January of \u201808. However, since then with increasing gas prices, NGL margins have come down somewhat. Several factors worked together to create the extraordinary environment we saw in 2008. As we mentioned before, the low gas prices in the Rockies was a major contributor.", "As you can see there, that peak in the third and fourth quarter of \u201808, a big chunk of that was driven by very low gas prices there at the end of \u201807. The new gas transportation capacity out of the Rockies to relieve these constraints and current margins are being driven solely by high crude oil prices in a weak dollar, which has allowed for exports from North American polyethylene producers. If you would, please take note of the appendix slide, it details how we have forward sold the portion of our NGLs for 2008, and as you can see the forward sales represent about 28% of our 2007 equity volumes.", "Moving to the next side, this slide provides insight in the investment opportunities on the horizon for Midstream. Large deepwater projects such as Perdido Norte, Blind Faith, Bass Lite and our Rockies expansions, especially the Willow Creek project, dominate the expansion capital in the in guidance portion of this slide for both 2008 and 2009. You\u2019ll notice that this was lowered slightly by $50 million, and that is just because we remove the \u201807 assets that have already gone into service. We have several opportunities going to our Board for approval in the next couple of months, and therefore we expect this in guidance capital pie to grow dramatically this year.", "The under negotiation pie has remained steady. The main change from last quarter is addition of a propylene distribution project that we\u2019re working on in Louisiana. The pie labeled, In Development and Proposal, reflects a tremendous amount of opportunities available to us in the next five years. The capital range remained steady as these projects are in very early stages of their development. In an addition, you can see how the mix of spending by area is unchanged as well, but shows that we have a nice portfolio across a variety of our regions.", "Some of the more significant growth projects that are in guidance, of course, you can see they\u2019re listed below and you can see the first full year of OP from those assets. And then in addition, some of the projects that are not included in our guidance right now, but in the under negotiations pie, of about a little over $400 million worth of projects, including an expansion at Echo Springs and Canadian oil sands projects that we\u2019ve spoken to previously that we hope to be moving into the in guidance, as I mentioned earlier.", "Moving on to the next slide, summarize. To recap, in the first quarter of \u201808 we enjoyed strong operating profit growth driven by favorable commodity prices across most Midstream assets. Margin growth occurred in both NGLs and our olefin segment, and in both Canada, and the U.S. First quarter \u201808 put us off to a great start for 2008, as it set the record for our highest first quarter segment profit ever in this business.", "Our recurring segment profit increased by 78%, continuing a trend that has been driven by higher than forecasted NGL margins, we are raising segment profit guidance again. The incredible year that was 2007 resulted in an industry leading pretax return on average assets for Midstream of over 27%. In fact, we posted the highest segment profit of any of our peers that we track, and these results were driven by record margins, especially in the Rockies and by our teams\u2019 execution of several projects that needed to come on time with the Opal expansion being a good example of that.", "We are very excited about our growth opportunities in several key areas, including Canadian oil sands, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Rockies. These projects will lay a strong foundation for the future beyond our guidance period. With new deepwater volumes coming on in 2008, we hope to hold this lead position as we stay very focused on investing our capital in a very disciplined manner, and being the most reliable service provider in the midstream space for our customers.", "And with that, I will turn it over to, Phil Wright.", "Phillip D. Wright - President, Gas Pipeline", "Thank you, Alan. I am pleased to report that if we could go to the next slide please, 26, that Gas Pipes is off to a very strong start in 2008.", "Following the successful IPO of Williams Pipeline Partners LP, we and our partners at TransCanada announced that we\u2019ve joined forces on a major project to bring Rockies gas to the West and Northwest. The Sunstone pipeline from the Opal, Wyoming hub to Stanfield is designed to offer Western markets access to abundant new Rockies supply, combined with the excellent optionality of the Northwest and GTN pipeline networks.", "Also at West, we had a successful open season on our Sundance Trails pipeline project, which we\u2019ve now included in our guidance.", "And importantly, we received FERC approval for the Transco rate case, adding fuel to our profit improvement and strong return to free cash flow generation. This is also a testament to the excellent customer relations and skills of our commercial teams and our teams throughout the pipeline. We are well underway on our construction of Phases 3 and 4 of our Gulfstream expansions, which will enable us to serve the rapidly growing markets near Tampa Bay and the West County Energy Center on the east coast of Florida. And, as you know, we delivered a 21.3% improvement in segment profit.", "Slide 27, please. Looking ahead to 2008 and 2009, we expect our maintenance capital levels to be lower than required in 2007. And as always, we\u2019ve shown detail on the major growth projects included in our guidance, illustrating when we expect the project to be in service, a capital expenditure forecast, and the expected addition to segment profit in the first full year of each project. And I\u2019m not going to go through each and every one of these. You can catch that as you please.", "Next slide please 28. As you can see in this slide, there are many promising growth projects across our pipeline networks. In all my 32 years in the energy business, I have not seen the level of activity we\u2019re experiencing now in the interstate gas transmission space. With the massive shifts we\u2019re seeing in supply sources, the industry is in a manner of speaking, repiping America, and I can assure you, we at Williams are capturing our share. One quick note about this slide, the projects shaded in blue are not included in guidance.", "Now there are a few projects that I want to highlight in a little greater detail. And if you compare this slide, this map, to the map I showed in our last quarter, you will note that we\u2019ve included four new projects in our guidance. Our Mobile Bay South project will expand the Transco line from Station 85 in Choctaw County, Alabama to interconnect with Gulfstream near Transco Station 82 in Mobile County, Alabama. We plan to place this expansion into service by May of 2010.", "The 85 North project will expand Transco\u2019s main line from station 85 to markets in the Carolinas, with the in-service date of May 2011. We are still finalizing the capital range for the project, but it will be one of the largest expansions in the history of Transco. The Sundance Trail project is an expansion project on Northwest Pipeline connecting the Piceance Basin to the Opal Hub in Wyoming. The project will add 150,000 decatherms a day of capacity and the in-service date is planned for November of 2010.", "Lastly, the Pascagoula expansion is 15-mile, 26-inch lateral, connecting the Gulf LNG Clean Energy Import Terminal to the Mobile Bay Lateral with a total capacity of 810,000 decatherms a day. Transco and the Florida Gas Transmission Pipeline will share undivided interests of 57.7% and 42.3%, respectively. Cost of this project is estimated at about $31 million with an in-service date of October 2011.", "Last slide, please for me number 29. Summarizing the key takeaways, the establishment of our pipeline MLP positions us nicely to bring a low cost source of capital to capturing the many growth opportunities in front of us. We have general rate cases on both of our major business units, Northwest and Transco behind us. Organic growth opportunities abound and are bearing fruit for us, and all of this enhances our ability to deliver strong earnings and stable cash flow.", "With that, I will turn it over.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Phil. Let\u2019s turn to slide number 31, please. 2008 forecast guidance.", "Segment profit is up as a result of some improvements in results in the business units, which I will touch on in just a moment. Jumping to the bottom line, diluted EPS on a recurring basis after eliminating mark-to-market effects is up about $0.10 to $1.70 to $2.10 from our prior guidance. Note that we\u2019ve raised our assumption regarding energy prices somewhat from our prior guidance. However, I think you\u2019ll find that our guidance still reflects very conservative assumptions as compared to current markets and really reflects more of a long-term point of view as to energy prices.", "Turning the page to slide number 32 please, again focusing on the bottom line. We\u2019re up about $0.10 to $1.80 to $2.30, again with similar price forecasts. Note also that, our results include the effects of certain legacy hedges, which are detailed on slide number 57. Some of those legacy hedges are at very low prices and are tending to hold back some of E&P\u2019s earnings.", "Next slide, please, number 33. This slide graphically depicts our enterprise position on natural gas. The red line is our enterprise net position, which is comprised of our net E&P production, less the financial hedges which are depicted in gold. The blue would represent the unhedged E&P volume, and the purplish color at the bottom would be the unhedged Midstream short position. The net of all that is, where the red line is at about $300 million unchanged per day in both 2008 and 2009.", "Turning the page now to slide number 34 please some modest changes in our forecasted results by business segment. In 2008, Midstream is up about $75 million principally on strong margins. Gas Pipeline is reducing their guidance just slightly as a result of some investments we are making in a number of these capital projects that Phil spoke to, where we are expensing the development costs until the point that those projects are determined to be probable. The net of that raises our segment profit guidance about $100 million in 2008. In 2009, E&P is raising its guidance somewhat as a result of again, good strong production and somewhat higher price. And again, bottom line in 2009, up about $100 million.", "Turning to slide number 35 please, capital spending, very little change from a quarter ago. However, I would note that Williams continues to be opportunity-rich, as each of our business unit leaders described. And we will continue to pursue value-adding opportunities and as such CapEx will continue to rise throughout the future quarters.", "Turning next to slide number 36, please. This is cash forecast I like to walk through this together with you to give you some sense of how we\u2019re thinking about this once again. We have unrestricted cash in the U.S. of $1.234 billion, add to that our forecast CFFO of $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion; back off the CapEx at $2.6 billion to $2.950 billion, and again, we expect that number to grow. We add in our asset sales, the net proceeds from the WMZ IPO, subtract the dividend, minority interest payments, and the balance of the share repurchase program, assuming that we execute on that, and some other items, and we bring down a cash balance of $600 million to $700 million, with a number of things that are yet to be determined.", "I will just focus a couple of comments there. Again, we\u2019re opportunity rich. We are out pursuing additional investment opportunities that will in fact add value, those will likely cause CapEx to grow and cash to deplete. Additionally, we will consider to the extent that we have additional cash that\u2019s available and not earmarked for additional investment. We will look at share repurchase or debt repurchase, but again, no commitment on that at this point. And then additional dropdowns, we are committed to the growth of our two MLPs. We do expect to continue to grow those MLPs, but we\u2019re not providing any guidance in that respect here today. I won\u2019t walk through the same detail for 2009, but the thinking is much the same.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to, Steve.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Don, and looking at my last slide. Slide 38, I believe it is. Let me conclude with a few key takeaways from our meeting this morning. Obviously, our first quarter results represent a wonderful start to 2008. Secondly, the attractive commodity price environment is expected to continue, and will certainly benefit our results going forward. Thirdly, we have increased our earnings outlook for the next two years. And lastly, we continue to be very, very opportunity rich with respect to the organic opportunities to grow our businesses, and create long-term shareholder value.", "So with that, we would be happy to take your questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "And our first question will come from Rebecca Followill with Tudor Pickering.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering", "Good morning, couple of questions for you, Ralph. This year, this winter, you went through your first drilling in the Highlands. Can you talk about how that went and implications for going forward?", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "Yes. It was actually a very severe winter, and we made it through just fine, very safely, operated a rig both in Trail Ridge through the severe winter, and also at Allen Point. It was the second year for Trail Ridge and the first time ever at Allen Point. And we\u2019re pleased with our results, we\u2019ve learned quite a bit. But it does confirm to us that, we believe we can operate in those two areas year round.", "So hopefully, as we digest what we learn this year, we will look to begin to add to the more than one rig in those areas for the winters coming up. But it went really well. And I guess if you wanted to get tested, this was a great year to get tested. It was a very severe winter up there, but it went well.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering", "Thanks. And then also on your 3P reserve report, can you remind us again what is not in there? And how long of a lateral did you assume in the Highlands, I think in your last 3P report you were assuming a 2000-foot lateral?", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "Right.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering", "What did you assume in this report?", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "And that lateral was more in the valley. But it was 2000 last time, the lateral this time is 3000-foot. But what\u2019s not in there is the majority of the acreage, we just earned at the end of the year in the Barcus Creek area, which is just north of Ryan Gulch. And then none of our exploratory areas are in there, such as the Uinta or the Paradox or the Caney or any of those areas are in the 3P number.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering", "Okay. And then last question for you on Paradox; any updates for us on where you stand on exploration there?", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "With our partner, we\u2019re beginning to drill our first horizontal well there. We\u2019ve done several vertical wells there. We do believe there is a gas presence, which is good, its shale. The key is being able to produce that. So we\u2019re doing our first horizontal well to test the difference between the horizontal drilling and the vertical drilling there.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering", "And what are you targeting, what formation?", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "It\u2019s called a Gothic Shale.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering", "Okay, perfect. Thank you.", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go to our next caller, Faisel Khan from Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Good morning. I am wondering if you could just walk me through in a little bit more detail in terms of how the NGL equity volumes ramped down from the fourth quarter of \u201807 to the first quarter of this year. I know you said some of the linepack issues on the Overland Pass Pipeline in the Ignacio plant fire. But can you just quantify it a little bit in terms of what went on?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. If you are looking at that slide, you would see that the equity sales on that went from first quarter of \u201807 of 345 to 308. And in the first quarter of \u201807, we were actually reducing our linepack on MAPL because we were selling some of our product to BP at the outlet of those plants, because they had a lower tariff on MAPL than we did. So that net production, if you will, actual equity production was 333, if you included what was actually produced for our account.", "And then, we put 59 million gallons, looking at that 308 number for first quarter of \u201808 we actually put 59 million gallons in the inventory as we built linepack on MAPL because that sell went to BP ended at the end of February of \u201808. And so that net swing is 71 million gallons from period-to-period, which gives you about a 33 million gallon build net-net. And so it\u2019s about a 10% improvement in equity production for liquids that were produced for our own account.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And so going forward though, we should see those volumes come back?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The volumes, when Overland Pass starts up about half of that linepack will come back to us because the Overland Pass system doesn\u2019t currently requires about half the linepack of Enterprise requires on their MAPL and seminal systems.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Then just on the NGL margin, if you could also just walk me through a little bit in terms of how the margins actually contracted from the fourth quarter of \u201807 to the first quarter of \u201808? Was it that the rapid price in natural gas relative to oil in the first quarter? Or was it that ethane and propane prices weren\u2019t keeping up with the historical correlation?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, well, certainly, at the end of the quarter, we saw correlations between ethane and crude begin to slip some. So even though the crude to gas ratio has been pretty high, we\u2019ve been noticing the ethane correlation to crude slipping somewhat. But probably the main driver, if you were looking to Williams NGL margins, the main driver has been the increasing gas prices in the Rockies, particularly at Opal.", "And we had very, very low prices in the third and fourth quarter of last year relative to -- and crude was coming up, crude has stayed up and increased a little bit. Actually NGL prices have stayed relatively flat if you look at it in aggregate between ethane and the heavies. But our feedstock cost gas has gone up almost threefold.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And any change in the demand from your customers on the liquids side? Do you still see demand as fairly stable compared to the fourth quarter of last year?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. We\u2019ve seen pools pretty hard. And the thing that I think has helped us a lot that hasn\u2019t been real apparent is that, the U.S. dollar has been so weak that it\u2019s allowed for a lot of polyethylene export from the U.S. into Europe. And so that\u2019s actually kept demand on the light end producers here in the U.S. pretty heavy; because the producers in Europe are usually heavy in oil-based product, is what they crack to produce ethylene over there. So our ethylene here in the U.S. right now is lower cost than some of those European-based crackers.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thanks. And on the E&P side of the equation, in the Sand one Basin, looks like you had about 134 million cubic feet a day in the first quarter I think last year you were doing closer to 150. Was the processing plant fire one of the reasons why the production volumes little bit down?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, you\u2019re right on there. Several things, the fire clearly affected our volumes beginning in late last year, in January and February. We also had some imbalance makeup that we did at that time with another producer. And then the weather was poor in the sense of very muddy. So it\u2019s something to wait. We\u2019ll shut there with the water -- when you deepwater, you do with water trucks and some other trucks couldn\u2019t get to the well side. Thus we had to shut the wells in, so a combination of all three things hitting in the first quarter.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And how much do you think that impacted production volumes?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We should have been just about flat to slightly up. So we were down by to the first quarter of last year, so.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It was about the entire effect you said between the 134 million and 150 million.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "I got you. And on the Powder River, the large production increase over last year is that just, Big George Coal\u2019s overtaken the Wyodak Coal\u2019s or is it because there is lumpiness in terms of how the drilling occurs in the Powder River Basin?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It\u2019s just that Big George Coal\u2019s are kicking in more and more. There has been a number of wells that we drilled and our partner drilled over the last couple of years, and they take anywhere from 12 months to slightly longer to deepwater. And the Coal\u2019s are doing better than we thought, and the deep watering happening. And our partner also paid a lot of attention to hooking their wells up, and getting the water fall into, they could get the production on. So all those things together made the volumes just really pick up, but the Big George Coal\u2019s are performing very well.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And then on the, is your share repurchase program did you purchased any share in the first quarter?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we did, Faisel. The total share repurchase program is worth $652 million program today, with $126 million in the first quarter.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, great. And what did you say are you price sensitive at all to your share repurchase program or would you say that, you have the cash available, that\u2019s something that you think about using on a regular basis?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are price sensitive. So we continue to look at alternate use as a capital. And again, we have substantial reinvestment opportunity which, we believe will drive very attractive long-term value. And then we also have the share repurchase as an option.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Great. Thanks for the time, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Sunil Jagwani with Catapult.", "Sunil Jagwani - Catapult", "Yeah, hi. Good morning and congratulations. I wanted to ask about the E&P business in particular. I mean your growth rate in volumes grows at 30% is significantly higher than plenty of other companies in the market standalone E&P, and on the hybrids and your resource potential is again not any less.", "Yet, I think it\u2019s pretty obviously that the implied value of the E&P business a fraction of what some of the other companies seem to get. Can you refresh our memory as to what you might consider in terms of potential split of the E&P business?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. We\u2019ve continued to like our integrated model created great long-term shareholder value over the last few years. I have done quite a bit of an analysis on the potential impact of some kind of split or spin. I\u2019ve talked about that with you in the past. So we have evaluated that option with our Board with our advisors.", "And to date still prefer the integrated model is the way to create long-term shareholder value. We\u2019re growing the business fairly dramatically. And the opportunity is for us to continue do so persist. We will continue to evaluate the pros and cons, of a split of a spin, and I believe that we will always do the right thing for the shareholders.", "Sunil Jagwani - Catapult", "I mean it almost seems frankly insane to me that, being quite the I get an implied value of five or six times that is just a cash from the E&P business. And your peers are getting sixteen to seventeen times, which is three times as much and their GAAP is wider than it\u2019s ever been and that\u2019s why I asked the question. But I appreciate your answer, thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "And to the final question currently in queue Rick Gross with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers", "My question was actually answered earlier. Thank you.", "Operator", "As there are no further questions currently in queue, I will conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. For any additional or concluding remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to, Travis Campbell.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, this is Steve Malcolm. Delighted with our first quarter, we are very excited about the future, very much opportunity rich, and look forward to continuing to grow shareholder value. So we look forward to talking with you again. Thanks.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Hill - Sr. VP, Exploration and Production", "Analysts", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets", "Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers", "Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Stacy and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Williams Second Quarter 2008 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.", "And I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of IR. You may begin your conference, sir.", "Travis Campbell - Investor Relations", "Thank you very much and thanks to everybody and good morning. Welcome to Williams second quarter 2008 earnings call. As always, thanks for your interest in the company. As you probably already figured out, we will not be reviewing a ton of slides this morning, even though it feels like just last week we had a chance to do a much deeper dive into our businesses on June 25th in New York. So today, our plan is to have a pretty crisp call.", "After my comments, Steve Malcolm, our CEO will go through some thoughts, and then have our CFO, Don Chappel briefly talk about the great second quarter results, and then he updates the guidance since the New York meetings in June. Even though they don't have any prepared remarks this morning, all of business unit heads; Phil Wright, Ralph Hill and Alan Armstrong are here and available to respond to your questions.", "Before I turn it over to Steve, please note that on our website, williams.com, you'll find the few slides we'll talk from this morning. Additionally, there is another deck labeled Supplemental Material that contains all the data we typically provide each quarter.", "The second quarter press release and all the coming schedules and the second quarter 10-Q are also available.", "Slide number two and three titled forward-looking statements disclose various risk factors and uncertainties related to the future operations and expectations. Actual results of course will vary from those expectations due to the factors disclosed. Please review that information as well as the information on slide number four, Oil and Gas Reserves Disclaimer.", "Also included in the materials are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those schedules are available and are integral to this presentation.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Travis. And as always, thanks to those of you on the call for your interest in our company. We're very pleased to have the opportunity to discuss Williams' very strong performance in the second quarter and year-to-date and as well our bright outlook for continuing value creation.", "Obviously, our businesses are hitting on all cylinders, and a great evidence of that is the fact that consolidated second quarter segment profit is up 60%. Our E&P business generated record recurring EBITDA of about $650 million in the quarter.", "We added 1.5 trillion cubic feet to our 3P reserves through two bolt-on acquisitions; one in the Piceance and the other in the Barnett Shale. Our finding costs continue to be well below the industry average, and we successfully complete nearly a 100% of the wells that we drilled.", "In our Midstream business, we benefited again from margins that were very strong, but as well from higher fee-based revenues as well. Our Midstream business is generating robust cash flows. We have a high degree of optimism around the many opportunities that we're pursuing, particularly those in Canada where we see opportunities that fit very well with our current operations and fit with the expertise that we have there around the oil sands.", "In our Gas Pipeline business, we continue to see opportunities for customer-supported and demand-driven expansions, and of course this business plays an important role as a consistent generator of cash that helps fund our higher return projects. So again, we couldn't feel any better about our performance in our businesses.", "Having spent an entire day telling our story in New York on June 25th, I only have one slide that I would quickly like to review this, this morning and the essence of that slide is I believe that we have the right strategy. We certainly created a prime position for ourselves from which to execute that strategy and we have a strong track record of crisply executing around our strategy.", "Our operations span the natural gas value chain. I think it's a good time to be focused on natural gas. The outlook for natural gas is continuing to get better and better, it's a obvious growing role for this clean burning domestically fuelled produced fuel, so it's a good time to be in natural gas.", "Scales is a key element of our strategy, so you see Williams in basins and markets where we can be at or near the top of the market participants. I think our strategy has legs, has longevity when it comes to value creation. Williams is and has been turning in performance at a level that drives value. And clearly our strategy is designed to deliver sustained value creation in the future.", "We have created that prime strategic position from which to successfully execute our strategy. We have an abundant expanding slate of opportunities within our reach. And that slate of opportunities continues to grow almost each day.", "Our portfolio creates value and opportunities and I believe it mitigates risks. And our businesses fit very well together.", "Over the past six years, we've been all about crisp executions. And so, you see us continuing to deliver earnings growth with a very strong outlook for the future. We're performing well in a variety of commodity markets. We're growing production; we have low finding costs and near 100% drilling success. And it's not just a Piceance story, as well with Powder River production up 41% in the second quarter and as well with the contributions from the Barnett Shale, a very diverse story there in terms of our productions.", "We're completing our projects on time and on budget, as we make disciplined investments in production and processing and in key infrastructure. I believe that we're successfully managing the basis differentials, as we've said many times we're a Rockies producer, but we're not a Rockies price taker. An 83% of our domestic production gets better than Rockies prices. And as we have done in the past, we're willing to pull other value creation levers. A great example of that is the fact that we just recently completed our $1 billion share repurchase program.", "So with that quick review, I'll turn it over to Don.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Steve. Before I dive into the detailed slides here, I'll just note that net income was $437 million for the quarter, or $0.37 a share. More importantly, our adjusted earnings after eliminating non-recurring items and mark-to-market effects were $406 million or $0.68 a share, up 58% on a per share basis. And for year-to-date purpose... period, $747 million or $1.25 a share, up 69%, very strong quarter, very strong first half and we are very enthusiastic about the balance of 2008, 2009 and beyond.", "Let's dive into the next slide here, and this is slide number six. This is second quarter segment profit. First, I'd just point at the total near the bottom, the segment profit after mark-to-market adjustments that's highlighted in blue. You can see $902 million on a recurring basis, $624 million a year ago, an improvement of $278 million or 45%. The reconciliation between reported and recurring as well as mark-to-market is included in the supplemental deck.", "Just to go up to top there, E&P posted $471 million of recurring segment profit. That was even higher with the gain on the Peru asset sale, but on the recurring basis that's up 262 million or 125%. We are quite delighted by that. We saw 24% increase in domestic production and related sales, which delivered about $105 million of additional segment profit. We had higher average realized gas prices, about 806 versus 539 a year ago. That totaled about $273 million of contribution.", "Along with these higher volumes and prices were higher costs, which partially offset these benefits. DD&A was up $51 million, operating taxes $33 million and LOE up $12 million. But again very strong earnings posted by E&P and perhaps even more importantly, a very, very strong production increase at 24%.", "The hedges that affected E&P's results are included in page 14 of the appendix, both for the quarter as forward periods.", "Taking a look next at Midstream results, Midstream results were also very, very strong. Higher olefin margins contributed $26 million, higher NGL margins $18 million for the quarter, higher fee-based revenues $23 million and these were offset somewhat by higher O&M costs.", "Again, Midstream's results of $233 million were up $42 million or 17% from the same quarter a year ago, which was also a very strong period. Midstream is very well positioned to continue to outperform its peers and deliver very strong earnings and value.", "Gas pipeline results were also up, up $13 million or 8% for the quarter, a very steady and improving results.", "Gas Marketing results were off somewhat and let me remind you we've been working through exiting positions that we considered legacy after the sale of our Power business and the shrinking of the scope of the gas marketing business. And we've largely exited those legacy positions.", "As well during the quarter we had... gas was injected in the storage, sold forward to lock in prices and a profit. However, interim decline in gas prices caused that to be written down to lower cost to market, that's a timing issue that will come back next year. As well, we had some inventory gains that were eliminated. Again E&P sells gas to gas marketing, but the profit on that gas is eliminated in the Gas Marketing segment. So, those were couple of the items that contributed to the loss for the current quarter. I think most importantly, we now expect Gas Marketing to be about breakeven for the balance of 2008, as well as 2009.", "Turning next to slide number seven, year-to-date results. Again, focus on the total for segment profit after mark-to-market adjustment, $1.674 billion, up $558 million or 50% from the prior year. And then looking at each of our business units, E&P is up 97%, Midstream up 40% and Pipes up 14%, so again very strong earnings and then finally, Gas marketing on the year-to-date basis posting a loss of $13 million relatively and significant.", "Let's now turn to slide number eight. I'd like to just touch on our updated guidance. We've made a modest adjustment to raise the lower end of our guidance for 2008 from a range of 230 to 280, up to 235 to 280. Let me remind you that we've not changed our price assumptions for the year, so this is centered around a range of $100 to $120 WTI crude and $9 to $10.50 NYMEX gas and the details including the basin level details are on slide 41 as well as included in the press release. But again at $100 oil for the year, which again, we're well through the year, and $9 NYMEX gas we're comfortable with the bottom end of the range and certainly if we average $120 and 10.50 on the gas then the higher end of the range is within our reach.", "Just turning the page to 2009 and again, we've not any changes in our price assumptions since June 25th. However, some increase in E&P production as it relates to those acquisitions boosted our segment profit and our EPS range somewhat, so we're now at a range of 210 to 295 versus the range we had just six weeks ago.", "And again, the price stack that we are using in 2009 is a range of 80 to 120 on WTI crude and NYMEX on $8 to 10.50. So again with $80 oil and $8 NYMEX gas, we think that $2.10 is within reach. And certainly, if we see $120 crude and 10.50 gas again, then we're closer to $3.", "Let's just turn the page to slide number 10 and some of detail. Again, some very minor adjustments from June 25th in terms of our segment profit guidance. But, I think importantly you can see here, despite the fact that we have assumed lower prices in 2009, we improved somewhat our profitability despite those lower prices and lower margins. So, if we enjoy higher prices or constant prices between the two years, I think you'd see very strong gains in 2009.", "Just turning the page to slide number 11, again some modest adjustments there, really changed only to reflect the acquisition of the assets in the Barnett Shale of our E&P business.", "The next slide; number 12, cash flow. We've updated that again to reflect the changes in both our segment profit guidance and our CapEx. And again, this lays it out as we're thinking about it today and certainly we have a number of options and levers that we can pull.", "I would just note that we completed our share repurchase that the Board authorized a year ago. In July2007, the Board authorized $1 billion share repurchase. We've now completed that. We bought back nearly 29 million shares at an average price of 34.74, which up until a few weeks ago looked to be very attractive. Today, it doesn't look as attractive and I'm sure that we'll look back upon this in the future and be quite delighted with the share buyback program.", "Let's turn the page to slide number 13. Certainly, we've had some questions and ongoing concern about Rockies prices and I just like to layout for you, kind of where we're at graphically. So, on the left is our consolidated position. Our long position in E&P, our short position in Midstream as well as the effect of our hedges, and then to the right will be Rockies.", "So just to walk you through it again, the green, the about 1 billion cubic feet a day is our gross position net of fuel and shrink and production taxes on E&P. That green areas is financially hedged, principally with collars so there is some variation within that. But, you'll see those collars in our materials and most of the prices are still quite attractive, at the bottom into the collar with very attractive ceilings on those collars. I'd also note that we do have some what we consider to be legacy hedges, about 70 million day at a price of about $4. That's included in 2008.", "The yellow would be the un-hedged E&P volume. The bluish color below line is the short Midstream position, so you see although we produce over a Bcf a day, our length is more in a 100 billion cubic feet a day range, and that's for 2008 and 2009.", "If you move over to Rockies, you can see that after we transport our gas out of the Rockies and so with another basin, the amount that's actually sold in the Rockies is substantial reduced. So we are selling in the Rockies, the top of that green bar, so somewhere in the 300 million a range. We financially hedge the piece of that. The yellow again is the open position; the blue is the Midstream short position, so you can see we're basically flat in 2008 in terms of Rockies basis.", "By 2009, we are slightly long, but not very long at all in terms of Rockies basis. So again, Rockies basis when it widens is detrimental to our E&P business but helpful to our Midstream business and it's pretty much a wash at the Williams level. So I thought that was an important point to point out to you.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Steve for some comments and questions.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Don. So, all three of our businesses generated excellent second quarter results, we continue to be confident in our ability to continue to post strong numbers. Our business unit leaders are here and we are looking forward to your questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction's]. Your next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets", "Good morning, everybody and nice execution on the quarter. Two questions, if I could. The first, an operational question, just meant to ask from the June meeting. But Ralph, with respect to all of the clamor that's going on around the Roan Plateau, the environmental issues. Do you see that moving from a disruptive standpoint from the lease sale to potentially activity? I mean is that anything that you guys are worried about?", "Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production", "Well, I believe the sale, the lease sales is scheduled to go off August 14th. Obviously, we have a position all around the Roan. We are evaluating that closely. There are... I think if the record decision has some very owners' term in it, so I am not sure how fast the pace of play development would be on the Roan and that's one of the considerations we're taking into as we look at the upcoming lease sale. Does that help what you asked?", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets", "Yeah no, it does. I guess, it's the upshot I think it's still probably too preliminary to know what type of impact we might have. But certainly that you're seeing that could immediately be detrimental to your guys production views, say for perhaps in 2009.", "Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production", "No, we don't see that detrimental or anything we have in the existing valley or in existing what we call the highlands areas, we don't see that. That's a separate EIS, separate record decisions, separates rules nothing that goes on in the Roan will affect anything else we have in our other areas. So, and as you know, since the Roan is an open outcry bidding thing, who know who will win what and when that happens, but all the numbers you see for us going forward are based on the highlands and the valley only. And we don't think it's going to effect us.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, fair enough. The second question and sort of an open one to Steve. Obviously, one of the things that has changed over the past five weeks has been sort of the valuations in the E&P world you guys included, and not under the guise of what have you done for you lately, but here we've just now closed a share buyback program at $35 stock. Is it 31 and may be I can ask it in a kind of a generic sense that with some of the shifts in valuation, does it increase appetite for acquisitions, sort of including your own stock, maybe I'll just ask it that way?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Carl for the question. We are in the midst here of a strange and challenging market. And it certainly had an impact on valuations. I don't think that we want to change our strategy and our focus, just because of the last five weeks as you mentioned. We're going to continue to be investing in these wonderful projects and I can't emphasize enough how the slate and the visibility around those projects continues to grow. However, we have pulled the levers periodically to create incremental value. And we'll continue to look at that and evaluate it as we consider additional investment in projects that will create long-term value for our shareholders.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay fair enough. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Gross with Lehman brothers.", "Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers", "Good morning. I'll ask a question on the Powder River. The volumes there have been very, very strong and I am just curious what the driver is there? Obviously, the well current was up in '07 and you probably got some dewatering and debottlenecking of the pipeline grid, but what's going on there in either any new answers about wells that you brought on that are dewatering the bottleneck that you alleviated, are you getting close to filling up and creating more of a bottleneck that you're going to need more outlet capacity? How do we interpret 41% increase in the Powder River?", "Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production", "I'd interpret... this is Ralph. I would interpret it very good. We feel very positive about the Powder as I mentioned for a couple of years, we are waiting on several things to happen and with the Big George as you know, is a much more prolific coal, thicker, more charged, greater gas content and it is coming on much better than the Wyodak coal. That combined with the Fort Union gas gathering debottlenecking, which we did, we think allowed for the Big George to really kick in, and in the slide we showed on June 25th, the Big George compared to the Wyodak at this stage of its growth is immensely better than the Wyodak's growth and Wyodak was obviously a good coal.", "So, we don't... and we've been very proactive in signing up for transportation capacity away from the Powder. We're working on new capacity away, so we don't see that as a bottleneck for us at least going forward. And we do hope that we can keep this pace of drilling up. We believe our partner wants to do the same thing.", "Again, there is always a little dewatering time, but the areas we're in look to be very prolific, so we're very happy with it. It probably won't be 41% every quarter, but we do expect the Big George to continue to be a great coal for us and see our volumes grow very strongly.", "Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers", "Are the wells coming in better than what you had modeled?", "Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production", "They're really coming in at about that 0.5 Bcf we talked about. So, no, they're not really coming in much better, just that... it's just they are making the impact of debottleneck in that gathering system what that did to help us on pressures and also just the dewatering of a lot of the coals at the same time.", "Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Do we think we'll get more rigs into the field either in the Piceance where you're a little bit higher than your 25 and whether you'll get more into the Barnett now that you've got a little bit more acreage?", "Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production", "Yeah, we're working on that right now. We, as we mentioned when we did the Samrich [ph] acquisition, we believe we would add at least two into the Highlands and we mentioned two more rigs in the Barnett at least and we're working on an additional rig. So, I could see this more like maybe up to even seven rigs in the Barnett and 28 or so in the total Piceance. So we're looking to add that and that's part of our analysis as we're go through as working through on 2009 plus plans.", "Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thank you. And just one last and I will follow up and maybe ask it directly. You finished the share buyback, are you going to authorize a new one? You still got about 2 billion in cash. By our estimation, you still generates some pretty good cash flows and the stock is lower than your average purchase price. What's the... are you going to go to Board for another authorization?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We will continue to evaluate that, Rick as we look and consider and evaluate some of these wonderful capital projects that we've talked about in the past.", "Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Brothwell with Wachovia.", "Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities", "Question for Alan. I know that you kept your outlook for the rest of the year in Midstream where it was. Just wondering if you could speak a little bit to how you see the near term outlook there and particularly what you see going on in ethane?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Ethane as you know, has been very, very volatile. In fact in the last two days, it's come off about almost $0.18 per gallon in the last two days. And that has been caused by some of the heavy crackers that in the second quarter were out buying ethylene because the heavy feedstocks were too, were upside down in terms of margins. So, they were actually buying ethylene. Today they're back buying butanes and propanes and who knows, up pretty quickly and now are selling ethylene into that market. And so, don't know how long that will last before the butanes' and propanes' price pressure on those turns around.", "But, overall the answer to your question on ethane, we did... we certainly are continuing to enjoy continued exports in the ethylene derivatives. And don't see that necessarily turning around. And so, I expect things to stabilize, basically ethane's correction in last two days has just put it back in the money relative to butanes and propanes. So, I would expect the demand to remain there.", "Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities", "But...", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That is the soft spot and probably the only reason that we wouldn't be raising guidance any further right now, it's just concern over the NGLs as it relates to crude oil.", "Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities", "Okay and looking a little bit longer term, I know you're adding quite a bit of processing capacity including ethane cut in the Rockies. Has your longer term view changed at all relative to that?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We continue to study that very closely, as you know. But we haven't changed our perspective on that.", "Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities", "Okay, thanks very much", "Operator", "The next question comes from the lines of Faisel Khan with Citigroup", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "On the Piceance, I just want to get a clarification. In terms of how many wells do you guys expect this year in the Highlands in '08 and then '09?", "Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production", "Is the Highlands?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Yeah.", "Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production", "We were currently scheduled to be in the 120 range or so in '08, 100 to 120 in next year, we're still working on that we but hope to have that more in the 175, 150 to175 range.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production", "Possibly more, we are just not quite done with all of our rig contract in and we are still in some of areas delineating the fields and we are moving much more to pad drilling up there, but there is still some areas that we need to understand first before we can fully commit how many we will have there. But as I mentioned we are working to that. We should have that... definitely have that by the next call and we hope to at least be in that range.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And just on the Midstream side, the equation, the large ramp back up in NGL equity sales to I think 266 million gallon, seems to be churning a little bit higher than what you guys were doing last year? Can you just comment on what's going on there? I know you had some planned outages in the first quarter, but I just want to figure out what's causing the larger than expected ramp back up in production in the second quarter?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Just second quarter to second quarter comparison?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Yeah.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Mostly its just that all the plants have been up and running full bore, we did have some maintenance outages in the second quarter of last year. So we are really... did pretty well full stride this year probably though the one major difference beyond that is we instigated the new takeaway at our Wamsutter facility, we've got a takeaway over to a CIG lowlands plant there. So we're taking about 80 million a day over in processing at that plant. And so, that's incremental capacity in effect that we're leasing out in effect from the lowlands plant.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Is there any update on your negotiations on the kind of Canadian... on the Canadian project side? I mean are you still looking at keep whole sort of contract or fee-based contract. Any sort of update there?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, the business that we've been pursuing up there at the model that we have up there would be fee-based to balance out the current keep whole business that we have up there. And things are progressing very well in those negotiations and hope to report something in the not too distant future on that.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Good morning. Most of my questions actually just got asked. Just a couple of clarifications. Don, you mentioned about the Gas marketing business. So effectively this quarter, you injected gas in and the value of inventory declined, but you basically have that margin locked in and that should obviously be realized in the first quarter of '09?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes that's a factor in the current quarter as well as I mentioned gas sold and still in the inventory, gas sold from E&P to Gas Marketing for future sale including that which is in storage gets reduced back to cost, so its gives mark down the cost and then that profit is recognized by Gas Marketing when it's sold.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Okay. And then second question just with respect to NGL, sorry everybody keeps asking this one here. But I mean are you guys experiencing a delinking with respect to oil and is there any specific reason why your operations would have a different margin than some of the major indexes like mount LVO [ph] and so forth with respect to margin?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, sure. I'll take that. First of all, I mentioned the lowering that we had on ethane here recently. But what I failed to mention was the run up we had just prior to that. We saw ethane go up to almost 45% of crude oil, which was above historical norms in the June timeframe and then we've seen it come back down. It's probably around 40 to 41% now, which is slightly below that to about the same degree. And as I said I think we'll see that normalize, now that it's back at the lower cost feedstock for the crackers. So I don't... even though it's been volatile, I expect that to level out somewhat.", "In terms of why our margins are different sometimes than a lot of our peers, first of all, most of our businesses keep whole, we don't... in terms of the commodity-based contracts that we have most of the people and so for those commodity-based contracts you'll see competitor's margins being percent of liquids where they're just taking the actual margin on the liquid they sold versus ours are the spread between the gas and the liquids. And so that's a major difference.", "As to difference between ours and other keep whole competitors, the main difference that we enjoy is the base of spread in the Rockies is a much better component of our production than most parties. And so, we see our margins generally be pretty high on the keep whole side relative to other keep whole margins because of the Rockies basis differential. And you'll see that actually improve even more that spread even widen as the Overland Pass line comes off, which will kick up our NGL margins by about $0.085 per gallon from those Rockies base production.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "And so I guess that is why you're performance could differ from same mount LVM [ph] and so forth, when if you'd just use those index prices?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's exactly right. So, you'd have to take a Rockies gas price into a pretty big chuck of our volumes there.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Okay. And then just one final question with respect to cash flow. I am not sure if I understood the Steve's response before. But the buyback is done, you've shown that you had cash flow and you said that you're potentially evaluating other projects. But it appears to be that there is cash flow beyond the projects that you're evaluating based on the slides that you put out today. I mean, would that be something that the Board would consider very encouraging with respect to extending the share buyback program?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Shneur, this is Don Chappel, I will just comment again of our cash balance is about $500 million, it's international, some of which is required to support the international operations. Some is excess and that's been earmarked for those Canadian opportunities then we bring it back to the really domestic cash balance, it's closer to $1 billion not $2 billion, and I think most of that is been earmarked for projects, so as attractive as the buy back is, we've had some tough choices. So we'll continue to consider all the options that we have and we'll try to pull those that we believe will create the greatest long-term value.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "So just to clarify, basically your consolidated balance sheet cash flow is not necessarily completely available as it would appear.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think if you'll look at one of our slides in the back you'll see that we do back out some customer deposits as well as the international cash, which is again earmarked for either supporting and this is on slide number 38 in the supplement.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Okay.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "There is 557. That's either MLP cash or international cash, it's largely international cash and then there is $119 million of customer margin deposits, so that's almost $700 million reduction in the cash balance you see in the balance sheet. And then our capital spending exceeds our cash flows, so that continues to work that balance down.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Okay. That makes perfect sense. Thank you very much.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You welcome", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay thank you. We are very pleased with the second quarter results, we are excited about the future, committed to continued crisp execution around our strategy and we will continue to evaluate the various levers that we might pull to create incremental value for our shareholders. So thank you for your interest.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Mr. Campbell, you may begin your conference.", "Travis Campbell - Investor Relations", "Thank you, Brandy, and good morning every body and welcome to the Williams third quarter 2008 earnings call. As always, we thank you for your interest in the company. After my brief comments, Steve Malcolm, the CEO will go through some thoughts, and then we'll have our CFO, Don Chappel briefly talk about our solid third quarter results. Ralph Hill will speak to E&P results and guidance and then Alan Armstrong will review Midstream business. Phil Wright is here with us today to take any questions about the pipeline business. After Alan's remarks, Don will review our thoughts on commodity prices and how they affect our guidance.

Please note that on our website, williams.com, you'll find the slides from this morning. Additionally, there is the appendix that contains all the data we typically provide. The third quarter earnings press release and all the coming schedules and the third quarter 10-Q are also available on the website. This morning we also announced that we're evaluating a variety of structural changes to enhance shareholder value. That press release is also available on the website.", "Slide two and three, titled forward-looking statements disclose various risk factors and uncertainties related to the future operations and expectations. Actual results of course will vary from current expectorations due to the factors disclosed. Please review that information.", "Slide four, Oil and Gas Reserves Disclaimer is also important and we urge you to read that slide as well. Also included in the material are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those schedules are available and are integral to the presentation.", "So, with that, I will turn it over to Steve.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call and thank you for your participation in the call and interest in our company. Let's start by looking at slide six and some of the highlights. Williams achieved another quarter of strong earnings growth. Net income is up from a $198 million in third quarter of '07 to $366 million in third quarter '08. Year-to-date net income is up from $765 million in '07 to $1.3 billion in '08. As well, recurring adjusted income per share climbs 46% for the quarter from $0.39 to $0.57 and 60% year-to-date from $1.14 to $1.82.", "Natural gas production increases 18% third quarter '07 versus third quarter '08 from 974 a day to 1146 a day and that production growth was really led by spectacular 37% growth that we saw on the Powder River. Encouraging initial results in the Paradox basin and Ralph Hill will describe that in more detail in a few minutes. And then the last point, the effect of two Hurricanes and other one-time unusual items certainly impacted our third quarter results.", "Looking at slide seven, obviously a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity is critically important in today's market and I think this slide summarizes our position. Total liquidity of more than $3.5 billion as of October 31st, we have over $1 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, we currently have in placed credit facilities of over $2.6 billion of which two-four is available.", "Our primary facility doesn't expire until 2012. The total liquidity number does not include the marginal facility that we can use for E&P hedges. And we also have excess capacity in the form of synthetic letters of credit that will expire in 2009 and 2010. Now please recall that these were put in place when we have the power business and are not needed in a current structure.", "We will not have significant debt retirements until 2011. And so unquestionably we have a very strong liquidity position from which to fund our growth and in addition to liquidity. I have just described in some detail, we continued generate robust cash flow from operations.", "We have as well substantial flexibility in our E&P program which allows us to reduce near term capital spending by about $1 business in '09 and '10. So, I think we are very well placed to react appropriately depending on where commodity prices head. We can ramp up quickly take advantage if the prices move up and we think they are going to stay there or we can cut another significant amount of capital if commodity prices fall lower than our forecast.", "Nevertheless, on slide eight, in recognition of the market, we are scaling back our capital spending forecast that may not be obvious. Since, our mid-point remains at $2.9 billion. But, we have in fact sidelined about $350 million of projects that we had previously talked about as potential growth opportunities.", "You'll see the E&P is projected '09 spending is about $700 million below '08 levels. And yet we're maintaining prior guidance on production growth of somewhere in the 8% to 10% range. Those numbers are driven on assumptions around lower rig utilization partially offset by higher costs and we expect the sharp cost increases that we experienced in '08 to diminish somewhat in '09.", "In Midstream and Gas pipes, we're maintaining spending on committed progress and differing some others. Then, so the outlook, now looking at slide nine, the outlook for the remainder of '08 and full year '09 obviously reflects the environment that we're faced with. The financial crisis, the recession have driven energy prices lower and the obvious effect is reduced projections for cash flow and earnings.", "The commodity prices, you look at '08 versus '09 the midpoint for crude '08 is about $105 a barrel and '09 midpoint is $30 lower at about $75 a barrel. And as well we're essentially bringing down Henry Hub natural gas by $2 an Mcf. And, so you can see how those commodity prices change our expected recurring adjusted earnings per share in the mid-points are shown on this slide and Don will go through that in more detail.", "Looking at the next slide, we have announced today that our management Board are valuating a variety structural changes in the company, as a means to further enhance shareholder value and among those potential changes is separation of one or more of our business units. I think you've seen Williams on many occasions during our long history successfully reshape and reinvent the company, in ways that create the most value. And in the last few years, we pulled a variety of levers to accelerate value creation and I'm speaking here about the formation of two publicly traded MLP's expanding one of those WPZ, through the contribution of additional high quality assets.", "We divested our power business and completed $1 billion stock repurchase program. We've also taken actions to strengthen the company's credit profile and as a result we've earned an investment grade credit rating. Our capital position is sound and our growth opportunities are abundant.", "As you well know, we have embraced the integrated model and I think that we performed very well in three years ending 2007. We delivered a 128% total shareholder return. We've talked to you about the merits of that integrated model. We've talked about the fact that stable and steady cash flows from gas pipes formed the foundation of our credit.", "Gas pipes close of cash for investment in higher returned projects. We've talked about midstream and as being a wonderful internal hedge to our E&P operations. And we've talked how the integrated model creates real and significant growth opportunities. And you'll hear about another of host today. And so, we entered 2008 with great optimism, we had just sold Power, and moved into a very strong commodity price environment and began to under perform many of pure plays.", "A lot of people who kept saying, what's the catalyst around Williams and of course I was thought that our continued strong performance... strong financial performance should be enough, then we moved into a down commodity market as we've seen here most recently, I thought that there would perhaps be some gravitation towards safety and safety that Williams offer by virtue of its integrated model, we have seen that occur. And so, we believe that we can do more to deliver value to our shareholders in the future and the evaluation that we are announcing today is the next step in on our ongoing strategic process.", "With any changes in company's structure, we intend to maintain our strong credit profile. I can't stress that enough, while we worked hard to earn this profile, because it has the advantage of reducing risks, increasing our flexibility to successfully compete and seize value creating opportunities and I think it's critical given today's challenging market conditions. As part of this evaluation, we will consider macro economic environment, the credit markets, energy prices among other things.", "But we believe that it is prudent to begin the evaluation now because these factors can be much different by next year. And so we want to be ready to act when markets improve. So, as we are in the evaluation stage, it would be premature to get into further details at this point. But we do expect to announce a specific direction in the first quarter of next year and look forward to updating you then.", "And I know that you're going to have questions and we will try to be as responsive as we can. But I hope you understand that we probably can't be more specific than what it is in the release. And so most of our answers to your questions will likely be, I don't know or I don't want to speculate or it's too early to say.", "So with that, I will turn it over to Don.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Steve. Let's turn to slide number 12 please. Financial results, I think Steve had the highlights here. Again, recurring income from continuing ops after mark-to-market adjustments of $0.57, up from $0.39 or a 46% increase and on a year-to-date basis, $1.82, up 60%.", "Now let's turn to slide 13, there's a 50,000 for view and Ralph here will talk about E&P. Alan Armstrong will talk about Midstream results. And Gas Pipelines are steady, so we won't have Phil speak to those resolves, but as you can see focusing on the recurring column, E&P's results are up sharply at $379 million versus $169 million in the prior year, that's an increase of 124%. Midstream is off somewhat, on lower NGO volumes and sales volumes and Alan will speak to that. And as I mentioned Gas Pipelines is steady. If we go down to the last line in the schedule, you see our gas marketing services, which provides services to E&P and Midstream as well as manage our legacy positions in our transportation and storage. We have a $45 million after mark-to-market loss there.", "And factors in that are lower cost of market adjustment, and our gas storage inventory totaling $24 million and you can see that in the foot note, as well as our legacy loss related to some legacy positions totaling $10 million. So, again, that was largely related to lower cost of market adjustments on our natural gas inventory. And most of the inventory has been sold forward at a profit. And we'll see that profit on that in the first quarter of 2009. Again, at the bottom of the schedule in the bold type, the total segment profit after mark-to-market effects $743 million, up 23% from the prior year.", "Turning to page number 14, same schedule on a year-to-date basis, I won't spend much time on that other than to focus on the segment profit after mark-to-market total at $2.417 billion, up 40% from the prior year.", "And with that, I'm going to turn it to Ralph.", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "Thank you, Don. I am pleased to be here today and share a great quarter with you for our third quarter, and also demonstrate E&P's ability to participate with Williams in helping our flex our capital spending, maintaining capital discipline. And I think the key to that is, while we do this, we will be able to maintain our long... portfolio's long-term value.", "Looking at slight 16, quarter-to-quarter highlights, third quarter '08, third quarter '07, we had 18% volume growth, our recurring segment profit was up 124%, that was obviously a function of that volume and the third bullet net domestic realized average pricing increase of 52%. Year-to-date, we're at 20% volume growth, 105% increase in recurring segment profit growth and our domestic price is at 42% 42% year-to-date versus last year this time.", "On slide 17, again looking at third quarter '08 by itself or segment properties up 124% as shown graphically here by the bars, productions up 18% and stress once to again then in our portfolio, transportation portfolio and hedging program as this inflated EMP from the revenue, revenues from the Rockies basis blow out.", "Slide 18; look in each of areas Piceance Valley was up 14%, the Highlands was up 44%. As Steve mentioned the Powder continues have an incredible year at 37% production growth Forth Worth as we continue to ramp up at 41% and San Juan continues to actually improve in a very mature basin.", "The volumes reported on this slide show basically about 1% sequential quarter decrease, and that's also in our management discussion analysis. Slightly down from 1159 second quarter to 1146. We estimate, we had at least 49 million a day as to picked by the hatch part of this slide there was shut down due to pipeline curtailments, Hurricane Ike, scheduled non-schedule gathering, maintenance facilities, imbalances, etcetera. So, if you had that back in we actually had a sequential quarter increase of about 3% from what looks like a 1% decline. So none of those... what we have term one time advance happen we really would be up about 3% sequentially. So, I just want to point that out on slide 18.", "On slide 19, as Steve mentioned and as Bill Berry have reported yesterday we've had a encouraging results in the Paradox Basin where we currently hold about 220,000 gross acres and 110,000 net acres. In 2007, we drilled three vertical wells as you all know we did a lot of extensive testing and coring and we had encouraging results there. We have now so for in 2008 drilled two horizontal wells in our initial full rates are really encouraging. The first on four is our test well which we call the Koski, which we have a 45% interest in, obviously, Bill Berry has a 55% interest in.", "As the natural gas discovery in the Gothic Shale, which I talked about a little bit before, it pulled an average of 4.5 million a day for approximately 17 days and yielded a 20 barrels of condensate are during the final 10 days of the 17 day test, sorry about that.", "The final well, actually produced as high as 5.7 million a day. We are currently shut down with sales line. Second one is well is on a where we call the Neely. We could successfully completed in eight stage fracture stimulation line in a matter of about 3,655 feet out. Early in the flow back process it flowed over 3 million a day over the final 3 days of the 7 day test.", "So, we are very encouraged with each of those. We've also drilled another vertical well nine miles north of the Neely, and we're testing that for quarrying to make sure we understand this Shale. And there we have spread our third horizontal is not a well which is offset to the Koski well.", "So, going forward, we're planning was therefore obviously the delay at it is still to begin working with our midstream partner here Williams have with their Armstrong's group to set that up to gather this gas and able ultimately this gas down to San Juan basin. As you see in 2009 we're drilling up to a seven horizontal wells. We obviously continue to plan the conduct extensive production testing and also constructed for small processing plant to begin to get this gas which is pretty rich gas about 1200 Btu content. So, very encouraging results from the Paradox.", "On slide 20, our guidance. We in 2008 briefly, the 2008 profit guidance change is primarily is actually price driven and as we look at the capital spending, it is up from where we were last time, as you mentioned last time and also when I talked to you at our New York conference. We did say we were seeing cost increases as the year began and those cost increases added about a $100 million. So the difference there, our drilling activity as we continue to have additional efficiencies and new acquisitions in the Piceance Island and we'll also say new acquisitions in the Barnett. We added about another $150 million of capital spending there and about $75 million for land and exploration activity that we're in some of the new areas ultimately, we came about to our current range of 2350 to 2450.", "Looking to 2009, again the segment profit and DD&A the change there is oil price driven primarily 90% of that amount is price driven and looking the capital expenditures lets turn to slide 21. Capital analysis where we are not previously '09 guide point on the far left side of this and let me walk you through this slide.", "Our production mid-points was11% growth, we had intended to as we moved into 2009 add a rig in the highlands as you can see at two rigs in the Fort Worth. We have land and other opportunities we are doing well efficiencies just meaning we continue better, our team does on a are spread-to-spread ties between wells, when a number of new explorations opportunities we're looking into and obviously that cost increase that we have seen so far this year we've seen so far this year, we've had into our budget to it more like $2.3 billion.", "Production growth was going to be in about 14% to 17%. As we work through the current financial environment that we are all in, we are in the process of and it doesn't happen immediately, but over the course of the next several months and next year. We will be dropping six rigs in the Piceance as you can see that brings us down by $240 million. Our exploration activity will not be as robust as we planned, Piceance facilities go along with some of the rigs we're dropping, you'll see that drops down.", "So, always to showing our capital discipline, I think I'd like also to stress is that we do preserve all of our value here, even though we are going to have less activity. We believe we will continue to see some cost savings. We've seen some start to head us, and that's in there for $75 million land, Powder River, we'll drill 100 less wells and in the Powder River, we'll drill less wells in the San Juan Basin.", "And we'll drop two rigs in the Fort Worth. So that drops is really to occur in '09 guidance midpoint about $1.7 billion. Our production still should be 8% to 10% range. It could be as high as 10% range, but we are putting a... at the 10% level, we were putting the range up there right now as we continue to work through the overall final impact as we drop some of the rigs and show the capital discipline that we are able to employ.", "Next slide please; which I believe is slide 22. This slide you've seen before, answers the time, I'll just basically stress the third... the second bullet there. All right, 16% of our gas is priced in the Rockies. We also have Midstream consumption that offset the number of that, so you see we do have the natural hedge in there. So obviously, showing 16% is really what we do E&P only, when you add Midstream side, it really puts us very balanced. If not actually, slightly short. And our 2009 Rockies exposure is expected to be very similar to 2008 than that prior, what we've seen so far is 2008 has been 14% to 16%.", "Final slide, I will just take the top bullet at the final slide. Basically most of our portfolio is held by production. So, we can't and we have decreased our activity which provides capital discipline. We also while doing this, we'll preserve the long-term value growth for this portfolio for our future... for our future growth. And we also are very encouraged as our partner was yesterday for some of the new results in the Paradox Basin.", "So, now over to Alan.", "Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing", "Great. Thanks, Ralph. Midstream's recurring profit for third quarter of '08 was $52 million lower than our third quarter of '07. Unique circumstances contributed this result and I'll go through the cause of this. First, as a result of delayed start of Overland Pass Pipeline capacity allocations targeted at Williams barrels on the similar NGL pipeline, forced our western plants in the Overland interjection. This caused about 41% lower Overland's gallons that we had in third quarter of '07. Of course the higher average per unit margins that you see in the quarter were also driven by this lower Overland content in our mix barrel, but of course the Overland is the lower priced portion of that barrel.", "And even largely impact came from hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, which reduced not only Gulf NGL production, but also our NGL sales in the West. With hurricane disruptions at the month value fractionators resulted in a build up of extra inventory from our western plants. This production couldn't be sold in the third quarter of '08 and will show up as incremental revenues in the following quarters as the inventory build up is fractionated and sold.", "If Overland Pass Pipeline, had been operational when expected, we would not face this allocation and the related Overland interjection. So, we certainly saw a tightness in capacities coming on the NGL pipelines out there. And that was certainly what prompted us to initiate the Overland Pass Pipeline project, and unfortunately, that coming in a little bit late certainty impacted our volumes for the quarter. Also contributing to our lower third quarter segment profit as compared to a third quarter last year was about $29 million lower margins in our olefins business unit.", "Our guidance mid-points sustained damaged from Hurricane Gustav which was the first hurricane in early September and this resulted in about there weeks of downtime. And additionally, we built up ethane inventory during the hurricane period that we had to right down at the end of the quarter. As ethane prices declined and we weren't able to consume that and convert it into ethylene.", "Higher operating cost in midstream were a smaller impact and that was driven by $8 million of hurricane related repair cost and $7 million of higher depreciation expenses. It is worth noting in spite of the hurricane disruption our Gulf Coast course fee revenues and primarily our deepwater business were slightly higher in third quarter of 2008 then in third quarter 2007 and I'll remind you the third quarter of 2007 was not impacted by hurricane.", "The stronger fee-base volumes were driven by additional production being tightened to the East breaks deepwater system with some new wells coming on there and earlier in the year and also the new backs light volumes that are flowing into our Devil's Tower infrastructure is not contributing in large ways to our fee-based revenues.", "Overall, our fee-based revenues grew by $16 million from third quarter of '07 to third quarter of '08 and even more impressive $39 million year-to-date in '08 verses '07. So, our goal of continuing to grow more fee-based business continues to produce both even in light of some of the setbacks we saw in this third quarter.", "Moving on to slide 26 here, here we are answer the question, what would the quarter have produced without the delay in Overland Pass and the hurricanes. And, this slide on 26 shows the impact of allocations, hurricanes and hedges. Now, this slide only speaks to the impact associated with our domestic NGL business. So, this is not captured anything we saw in the olefins business here.", "But, first is a depiction of the gallons impacted by these events, so starting on the left side of this graph. You can see that the estimated normal equity NGL gallons that we likely would have sold during the quarter as being the bar on the far left there. And, that would have been roughly 360 million gallons. And, next we subtract the estimated volumes that were lost to the allocations on the similar system and that was about 60 million gallons.", "And then this adjustment is followed by subtracting the hurricane related gallons and first is the inventory build there and of course again this is product that we would have sold in the quarter except for the month though the fractionators is being out of service post the hurricane and so that is sitting as raw make inventory in Mount Bellevue and hopefully we will be getting that fraction sold in the following quarters here.", "And then finally the damage from our Gulf Coast facility, so these are direct Gulf coast related NGL reductions that they you see there so and that's about 60 million gallons for inventory build and is about 50 million gallons from the damages there directly.", "Next moving over to the impact on the NGL margins; two things effectively netting each other out here, first of all as I mentioned earlier a heavier product mix this was because of the lack of Ethane that is in our mix actually we had of course heavier products and those heavier products and more valuable which would have driven our number up.", "And then that was offset though by the hedges that we put in place at the first of 2008 and that drove the number down by about $0.07 and so that collar impact for the quarter was $0.07 against all of our barrels produced but if you took that against just the ones that we had hedged it's about $19 million of impact or flattening that we saw in the quarter and most of that was in July and August, our hedge was pretty close to neutral in September as prices lower.", "So, overall the impact was estimated about $40million in NGL margin and $90million equity gallons for the third quarter of which approximately 16 million gallons should pull back to us.", "Moving on to slide 27, we are pleased that our third quarter segment profit benefited from an increase in fee-based business compared to year-to-date 2007. Our fee-based revenues were up over prior year for the third consecutive quarter despite hurricane impact for our fee-based business.", "And other than the significant negative impact from the two events we've discussed, we had a terrific quarter, and are continuing to build to another great year for Midstream. Overall, we estimate the two hurricanes alone damaged our quarter by just over $50 million and the curtailed that production at West Coast us about $25 million. You can see our estimated impact depicted in the hatch bar there which is roughly 70 low of the $70 million there in that hatch bar, just try to get to something more normal borrowing of the incidents.", "We are pleased to report that our new Western projects, the Willow Creek plant in the Piceance, and the one setter [ph] plant expansion both to continue on schedule, and very excited about the way those projects are coming together and the growth that that will provided us in '09 and '10.", "Now that Overland Pass section from one setter [ph] to bush is up and running. Our western plants will be in the position to avail to move product out of the West, and in the market areas for sale. So, there's allocation problem, and we have... and even the hurricane impact those, issues are mitigated heavily going forward.", "Overland Pass will resolve in significant lower transportation and fractionation expenses for us, and ample capacity for our new production coming out on the Piceance and one warm setter area in 2010. In addition, we should not see the same hurricane effects that we saw as we'll have the capability of fractionating product at Conway and Bush ton in the future.", "This increased reliability for E&P customers as well makes our plants even more attractive in the future. So in short, Overland Pass is a great... is a great addition to our offering of services to our customers. And we're looking forward to the new and fruitful relationship with one and Overland Pass in years to come. There are also good things happen in the deepwater three new tiebacks to floating production systems that fee discovery were recently announced. And these should boost our discovery volumes in the future. In addition, our new deepwater gas and oil pipelines serving Chevron's Blind Faith platform we're commissioned amid some very difficult sea conditions in the third quarter. We are now excited to watch the Chevron's team brings the new Blind Faith filled into production and we are obviously, anxiously waiting for that.", "Moving on to the next slide here talking about our '08, '09 guidance, we are lowering our '08 and '09 recurring some of the profit guidance. This reflects the impact of the allocation issues and the hurricanes we saw in the third quarter and till much lesser degree softening margins in '08. But certainly in '09, we are predicting much lower margins and that is the major impact for our '09 business.", "In response to this, reduced profitability we're cutting back our capital spending by about $100 million over this guidance period we've lowered our 2008 capital spending by $200 million and we've raised our '09 by $100 million this change is in response to timing and spending on some projects that got moved from '08 and to '09 and the cancellation the deferral of some projects in '09. A small portion of the lower 2009 guidance in profit is attributable to these lower CapEx. Also in response to lower core marketing prices, we've reduced our forecast to domestic NGL margin guidance by $100 million in 2008 and $200 million in 2009.", "Our 2008 NGL margin guidance is also affected by the Ethane rejection that incurred in the third quarter due to Overland Pass starting up approximately three weeks later than we had planned. And these reductions in '08 and '09 translate into lower NGL margin guidance mandate on a per gallon basis as well.", "It's important to note that although we're lowering our segment profit guidance to an average $1 billion per year through this period it still represents a tremendous return and free cash flows from this business and that's an approximately $4 billion of net assets.", "Additionally, we remain very excited about the number of large scale projects that will be placed at the service during 2009 and 2010 of course that includes Willow Creek-1, TXP 4 at warm setter [ph] and are very large Preditto North A project in the Western deepwater Gulf in Mexico.", "And with that, I'll turn over to Phil Wright. Sorry, Don. Sorry about that.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Alan. Just turn to slide 30, just this is a summary of our new price assumptions embedded in our forecasts and certainly 2008 is down somewhat as a result of the economic conditions and lower prices. And we've seen big moves in 2009, I would point out that the 2009 assumptions that we're using the midpoints or are somewhat below the current strip prices that were we saw as it close yesterday, yesterday we saw Rockies close at $543 near the top end of our range we saw San Juan in Mid-Continent at 649 again closer to the top end of our range Henry Hub Gas for 2009 its 769 again closer to the top end of our range and crude oil prices WTI crude at 75,47 just above the mid point.", "So, big moves in prices and we provided this comparison to the prior guidance and the ranges for your reference. But again I think the ranges would appear to be inline with 2009 strip prices and the midpoints generally slightly lower than strip.", "Turnings to slide number 31, update on our 2008 forecast guidance November 6th forecast $2.10 to $2.30 down from our August 7th guidance reflecting these lower prices and if you turn the turn the page slide number 32 to 2009 forecast guidance of $1.25 to $2.05 again lowered to reflect sharply lower prices.", "Again, $60 to $90 of crude environment versus $80 to $120 previously and the $6 to $8 Henry Hub natural gas environment versus $8 to $10.50 previously, I would also note that we continue to include in our package here as well as on our website, our profit volatility relative to sensitivities in oil, NGL and gas prices and you'll see that on slide number 69, its there for your reference.", "Turning the page to slide 33, recurring segment profit guidance; and this is a high level of view of each of our business units and I think Ralph and Alan already have updated you. But again, you can see the change there and again that's largely driven by prices.", "Turning to page number 34, graphically depicts our Rockies basis exposure and I think the redline what indicate that we have little to know Rockies basic exposure in 2008 or 2009. Certainly, E&P has some basis exposure that's been mitigated by firm transport financial hedges, Midstream has the opposite exposure, and when you net the two together, we end up flat, or in 2009 slightly short Rockies basis.", "Turning to slide... page please to slide number 35, capital spending guidance, again Ralph and Alan went through there, guidance, Gas Pipeline is relatively steady. And the total potential capital, that you see in the bottom line there, which I would call now more total planned capital is down in 2009 about $350 million at the midpoint, and about $100 million down in 2008, reflecting tightening things up in light of these difficult economic conditions in very tight financial markets. We've deferred many of the additional growth investment opportunities at this time. And we'll move ahead again when conditions improve.", "Please turn to page to slide number 36. This is a look at how we think about cash flow and liquidity. You can see their, 2008; I'll just walk through this. We started the year with $1.234 billion cash. On October 31st, we have $1.1 billion of unrestricted cash and $1.750 billion in total cash and the difference is largely cash, it's international.", "CFFO of 31 to 33 backing of CapEx in the range of 34 to 36, and then a number of other factors including dividends, minority interest payments, our previous share repurchase would leave us with $600 million to $700 million of unrestricted cash at the end of 2008. Add to that, our credit facilities that are available to us, and we get to about a $3 billion number at the end of the year.", "Moving ahead to 2009, again, starting with $600 million to $700 million, CFFO in the range of 24 to 31 and the range is largely dependent on commodity prices. Back off 28 to 31 in capital spending, and then minus our dividends minority interest payments, and then we have a change in debt somewhere between zero and perhaps as much as $200 million of borrowings, brings us down to a cash balance at the end of 2009, somewhere in the range of zero to $300 million add to that credit facilities that are un-drawn of about $2 billion, excuse me... for total liquidity of about $2 billion.", "I would also like to note that in our appendix, we've included a number of slides relative to derivatives and related counterparty exposure. And those are included on slide 70 through 75, we're very comfortable with our derivative counterparty exposure. We think it's well managed and very small. In that all other counterparties are A rated or better with the exception of about less than 10 million of those counterparties. And the total aggregate exposure for those counter parties is $384 million on a net basis after collateral postings.", "And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Don. I have nothing to add at this point. So, let's take your questions.", "Question And Answer", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Brandy, are you there?", "Operator", "[Technical Difficulty].", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It sounds like we are having some technical difficulties. Let's give it a few minutes and see if we can get them solved.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "I knew that you're restricted on what you can say with respect to strategic review that you're that's currently underway. I was wondering if it's fair to say that investors tend to assume that something will actually occur that there will actually be a transaction of some sort of where you will be separating something you are selling something.", "And I was wondering also, if you can frame it, you had mentioned in your press release about how you are looking at a scenario where you like to maintain the strong credit profile, how that would occur if you were to separate the business out, how the credit profile would actually be able to maintain a strong credit profile, given that you'll be separating a strong cash flow assets from some of the assets that are, for example like E&P where, sorry excuse me, where you are potentially running beyond the cash flow and so forth?", "So I was wondering if you could, if you can answer those questions.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks for the question. And the short answer is, no. We can't go into too much detail, I think look at our press release, we said that we were going to embark this evaluation and that, we would hope to be able to make an announcement in the first quarter as to what direction that we're headed.", "We've indicated that obviously the macro economic environment, credit market's energy prices and all kinds of other variables are going to be considered as part of the evaluation. And really have not commented at all as to what the timing of a possible transaction might be. Regarding the credit question again, that's I think its premature for us to try to speculate, I think we made very clear that an investment grade rating a strong credit profile was important to us today. And it's going to continue to be important to us in the future.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Okay. My follow-up question is just with respect to the Midstream business. There has been a lot of announcements by many of the E&P companies about scaling back CapEx and so forth given the current environment. Based on.... I'm sure you guys follow all the announcements and so forth. And I was wondering if you can comment and how you expect that to impact volumes at the Midstream segment and whether you are more or less sensitive to some of the areas that people thought, but looking to pullback some of that CapEx?", "Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing", "Yes, great question. First of all starting with the deepwater, deepwater is probably the least sensitive to price just because it takes such a long-term perspective has somebody has to go into that business with because it takes four to five year even in the best case to develop a project out there.", "So, that's probably the least sensitive and we certainly continuously very robust drilling out there. The at West, if you look at our mix of customers, they are mostly the very a large well hill customers like BP, Conoco Phillips or larger customers out there and they have secured capacity out of that area and as far as we know continue on with a very robust drilling plans in those area.", "So, we're fortunate to have the position we have in the deepwater and our exposure out west is largely in those basins where we have got very large customers and we're fortunate to have that customer mix we have out there. And having said that we certainly from some of those smaller producer and so forth I would certainly wouldn't be surprised to see some of backing off out west but there not just very big make up of our overall customer mix out west.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Okay. And just one follow-up question to get some great clarity with respect to the margins, with the recent decline in oil prices have you seen a return to the traditional correlations between the NGL's how they would typically reacting the given the price where oil isn't given where the price of where natural gas is right now?", "Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing", "Particularly on allied end [ph] products, we have not seen that return as seen in particular has been particularly weak. As there was quite a few plants that were knocked off by the hurricane particularly in the Burma and Orange area they've not returned to service. And so, we continued to see fairly weak demand on the afiame [ph] size as a result of those plants are being down. And so, we've continued to see that percentage to be a little bit low there. So, that's our current perspective on this.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Hi everybody. Steve, recognizing the sensitivity again what you can say, just too sort of clarify with respect to this review process. Is this something where its kind of the full review where all options on the table i.e. seller what have you or it is just really more sort of looking at kind of restructuring tax free spin only I just want to make sure what the scope with the view is?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Carl that's a great question but this one that I'm not going answer. We are very open minded.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Fair enough.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And are going to look at structural changes that may make sense going forward and again very open minded regarding the options that we consider.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Okay. Now, I understand there is only one for now you can say. Ralph can I just ask a question, can you help us, I'm looking at Piceance the rigs coming out I assume that's coming out of the highland. I think typically, we have tended to think of valley, 4 to 4.15 in that bank making your 10% after-tax cost of capital returns. If commodity prices were to fall further, could you help us rank order where you're seeing the best returns if you will.", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "The actual rig... first of all we are dropping some in the valley also. So we're dropping valley and highlands. We have some great momentum in Trail ridge area and the Rangoch [ph] area that we want to keep. So, we'll keep some in the valley... in the highlands. And so, obviously then that would drop in some of the valley. In general, all of our projects still at... even at lower October point of view that we are using the lowest return project we are seeing out there currently more in the 18% range and the highest is in the upper 30% range. So, we actually really kind of... obviously the Highlands is a little lower than Valley, just about the definition of the additional drilling we have to do.", "So, any additional initially that would be from the Highlands. And we have a lot of flexibility in what we pull out of the Valley. We don't have as much flexibility of the Barnett; we have very good returns from the Barnett because a lot of the Barnett leases is one of the few places we have, where we have three year terms and those kind of things.", "So, I would guess additional dropping would, if that's the question would be from the Valley and the Highlands, but, probably Highland's first, but we really like the level of activity we have in the Highlands, which is only in this based on plan we have here, it's basically 4.5 rigs, we have one rig, it's going to work at one point, finish up a few of our obligations there and then that rig will be absorbed into the portfolio overall. So, we only have four in the Highlands working. In general, our portfolio's returns are very strong, still in where some Willow running numbers as low as the $4 and $5 case type return.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "$4 or $5 of netback or $4 of $5 buybacks?", "Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing", "$4 to $5 Rockies.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Rockies, okay. Okay. And then Alan, just with respect to your comments on certainly where Ethane is, and I guess especially where Ethane is in convoy, looking at Rockies NGL margins is a little bit more challenging task with the data streams we have but, what are you seeing right now here in early October as far as spot NGL margins in the Rockies?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, again, we clear, and in either case, in the case of Overland Pass or in our historical Pass Out of the Rockies on the map of Seminole System, we clear our Ethane barrels at Belleview. Our heavy barrels looking forward, our heavy barrels will have the option of clearing at either Convey or Belleview. So, but to get to your question in terms of spot, it's no different, our pricing is no different than what you see as the Belleview posted prices for Ethane. We do clear some propane and heavies out of the Rockies, at our local fractionators and that typically works out to be anywhere from $0.05 to $0.10 higher than Belleview pricing.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Okay, great. And then just last question. More E&P again, Ralph, with respect to I know that the pie chart you have for the third quarter production roughly 22% was being sold into the Mid-Continent market. Can you refresh our memory where specifically in the Mid-Continent were you guys subject to any of the very low extreme spot prices we've been seeing over the last couple of weeks around center point?", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "Most of ours is ultimately it's priced into the Pan Handle market, so not as bad.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Steve, I know you again you restricted that. Let me see if I can attack question from a couple of different angles. My understanding would be that each of your three businesses have very low tax basis so a sale to anyone of those three businesses would produce a fairly large tax date, correct?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Johong,I don't think we are going to comment on that today again in terms of the specific form of the transaction, tax basis and any other details. I appreciate the question.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. I will also assume that E&P on a standalone basis and Midstream on a standalone basis would have more volatility and if you combine the two, correct?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I think that's clearly the case you can the portfolio affect within our portfolio today.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "And I would guess at the pipeline business is much more stable and so therefore on a relative basis can sustain more debt on the balance sheet than either one of those two other businesses?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's a logical assumption.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Couple of questions, does the hurricane impact add up to about $77million?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hurricane affects 50 to 65.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The 50 to 65 was just Midstream impact.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "I think there was 25 from one and 52 from the other.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "The comment I was making on the again those numbers I was quoting that was just impacting our NGL volumes as I said that 50 number that I quoted that was leaving out the olefins impact.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Oh I see.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So that's the difference in the way that was broken out.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "And net overall CapEx reduction for next year is how much?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "CapEx reduction from our prior guidance about $350 million at the mid-point.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And what is your new sensitivity commodity price changes for '09?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Lasan, that's detailed on slide number 69.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "I'm sorry, I'm out of the office, now.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It is fairly complicated, so I don't think it's something we can go through, if you want to take a look at that and call Investor Relations.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Don, on the slide there as you detailed the cash flow liquidity $1.2 billion. I take at the difference between that and what you have reported in your press release and $1.8 billion in cash is the difference that you've been overseas or un-patriated or un-repatriated is that correct?", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's the internet, principally international cash and then it's also some MLP cash and then call it cash itself. We're holding that belongs to our counterparties.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, understood.", "Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's detailed on slide number 83.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, fair I think that far. On the... going to the pipeline business or I should say, thinking about getting access of pipeline capacity out of the Rockies, as the rest being delayed a little bit, my first is, how does that effect your guys planning process at E&P Ralph. And I guess the second question related to pipeline capacities is what needs to get done to get free up some of these issues in the Rockies. This will be a necessity or just some other pipe out there that makes more sense?", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "This is Ralph. Let me take first part of that. It's factored into our Rockies exposure that we say for 2009, which is going to be similar to what we saw in 2008, which is about 14% to 16%. We have factored the delay of Ruby into that. So, if Ruby, obviously we'd come on and we're assuming Ruby is very late... I am sorry, late not Ruby, pardon me. We've factored Rex coming on to fourth quarter versus earlier I think it must be like more mid-year. So, to the extent it comes a lot of earlier than that, then that number obviously would decrease. So, our exposure is factored into a decline or a delay in the Rex, I am trying to get R is correct.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Sure.", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "In the Rex pipeline. We also have added on to our portfolio opportunity on basin but for part two, let me let Phil take part two, of that right.", "Phillip D. Wright - President, Gas Pipeline", "Faisel, this is Phil Wright. Clearly there is enough gas out in the Rockies to justify construction of a large dam or our pipe to the west. The market is indicative to us they prefer route to stand field and in particular, due to market growth our market area customers who have signed PAs to support that convection if you will. We and our partners are continuing to work to fully subscribe Sunstone. We believe there is enough producer support will be to see a project get build in the originally forecast timeframe, but it's also possible that a smaller scale project built later can be attractive to customers as well. So, our strategy is to work with customers to right size and route a project that we think best meets their needs.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. So what you are saying is that there is the... the first necessity is to move gas western to an east, is that kind of how you are thinking about it?", "Phillip D. Wright - President, Gas Pipeline", "Well, that would be our assessment.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, got you. And then sticking with the E&P, I guess, what's the plan now with the results that you have in the Barnett shale, where do we go from here?", "Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production", "Well, we obviously need to hook the wells up, and build a smaller processing faculty up there initially over the plant which we will do next year, get the wells on extending productions testing. We're drilling our third horizontal well, which is an offset to the Koski [ph] and we intend to... with our partners drilling at probably seven additional horizontal wells next year. So, really just continue to test it, see what we have for the wells that we have on, and that we're drilling now one extended production testing begin some preliminary facilities. That gas would flow to Seminole Basin, which we think is a good area to do that too. Can probably be a North West pipe down there. So, the plan is just to continue to confirm what we have and move from there.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, got you. On the Midstream side equation, I guess the NGLs that are coming out of storage in the fourth quarter, how are those being priced, are those being priced related to your hedges you have in place or maybe in priced up market?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, there is, since there is incremental barrels, over and above our hedge in effect that you could say it's one of the other, but at the end of the day, the net impact will be at market on those barrels.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, they went in, they would have gone in order to cost of good sold is what they would have gone in into inventory pricing at. So, basically that fuel and shrinking transport price.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And it will come out at and whatever the market is that time.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Got it. And then you did... I think you addressed the question on the deepwater projects that you guys are looking at. You're saying that those projects are fairly inelastic to the price, or because there was a long-term, the long-term project people contemplated for a while?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. And also the combination of the fact that, you have to take out very long-term contracts generally around those drilling rigs, those big deepwater drilling rigs and so people walk themselves in a quite a bit of that capital out there. So, there's still plenty of competition for both pipeline capacity and drilling rigs as we speak.", "I'd say the risks long-term to that, the risk long-term would be the re-up of that business if cash flows from the E&P company started to wane and they didn't have the capitalization to go forward with that. But, we're not seeing any reaction to the current spot pricing that's happening right now.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "The projects that you guys talked about in I guess in June, July where and the potential projects that the potential TLPs you guys have talked about, there is opportunity still remain out there?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. What about in Canada? I mean, you see a number of announcements that some of these up graders are kind of delayed the push back, how does that affected your business out there?", "Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. In Canada, much of the business that we were pursuing up there is already existing up graders. There was a large project we were pursuing that has been delayed, there was an up grader project, it has been delayed up there. And so, it will impact to some, but quite frankly there is probably more opportunity up there than we have the resources to pursue. So, we're not to terribly disappointed by that at this point in time so, but we certainly have.... certainly it will take some of the up side, but again, we have been pretty conservative in assuming what proportion of business we could capture up there.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys for the time. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. Mr. Campbell, do you have any closing remarks?", "Steven J.

I'll, just Steve, I would just say that... and I think that Williams has a very good reputation in terms of doing what we say we're going to do and coming forward with a plan executing on that plan. And so, regarding the announcement that we've made about exploring changes, structural changes, I think that you can expect that we will announce a specific direction in the first quarter.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.", "Travis Campbell", "Thank you and good morning everybody. Welcome to our first quarter call. As always, thank you for your interest and support of the Company. As you have no doubt noticed there are significantly fewer slides in the presentation this morning. Steve Malcolm will be going through those slides in just a minute. Be aware though that all of our business Heads are here and available for questions. Also beginning this quarter, we have put together a data book that includes most of the data using included in our slides and in the appendix. ", "So available this morning on our website, www.williams.com are four things, first the slides for the call, second the data book, third the press release and all the accompanying schedules detailing the results of the quarter, and fourth the first quarter 10-Q which was also filed this morning. ", "Also there are couple of other press releases you should be aware of and are available; one is the announcement that went out yesterday, talking about the impairment of our Venezuelan operations and the other which went out this morning, announces our plans to build an NGL pipeline in Canada. Steve will talk a bit about that last one this morning. ", "I also want to remind you that we have planned our analyst day for May 12 in New York. On that day each of the business leaders and their teams will spend some time reviewing their businesses strategies and drivers. At the beginning of the slide deck this morning are the forward looking statements and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves. Those are important and it will go through our remarks, so please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and the presentation. ", "So, with that, I will turn it over to Steve, our CEO. ", "Steve Malcolm", "Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our first quarter 2009 earnings call. We always appreciate your participation in our calls and interest in our company. As Travis mentioned, given the fact that we are conducting an investor day in New York on May 12, we are offering this morning a somewhat streamlined earnings call. I will be the only presenter for the slides but our entire team is present to answer any questions. ", "Starting with slide four please, certainly the recession and related lower commodity prices impacted our first quarter profitability. The $0.22 adjusted earnings per share is 61% below year-ago level. The average net realized price per US production was 36% lower and per unit NGL margins dropped 69% from a year-ago. The good news is that we continue to record stable, steady earnings in cash flows from gas pipelines. ", "Looking a little more closely at the numbers on side five, first quarter financial results, for our reported results the story is obviously lower energy prices and significant non-recurring items. Those non-recurring items include first non-cash impairments of 241 million related to our Venezuelan operations and details were in a press release that we issued yesterday. Also we didn\u2019t enjoy the benefit in this year's first quarter of a $118 million gain on the sale of our Peruvian interests which we recorded first quarter '08. ", "The other significant non-recurring item was $34 million in penalties related to early termination of rig contracts and this is clearly in line with our reduced CapEx program in our E&P segment. So our adjusted first quarter earnings per share of $0.22 is off 33% from fourth quarter '08 and down 61% from first quarter '08 when we enjoyed a very robust energy commodity price environment. ", "Turning to slide six, shown is reported and recurring segment profit, first quarter '08 versus first quarter '09. I have already talked about the major nonrecurring items. But in E&P, the decline in segment profit was due to much lower net realized average prices for natural gas and higher expenses; I'm referring here to depletion, depreciation and amortization; somewhat offset by higher production volumes. The average daily US production in first quarter '09 was 21% greater than first quarter '08 and 6% higher than fourth quarter '08. ", "In midstream, the decline on a recurring basis was primarily due to significantly lower NGL margins as well as Venezuela profits not recognized; in the gas pipe area, again steady, stable and predictable. ", "Slide seven, although the economic environment created quite a challenge and you can see at the bottom of this slide the energy commodity price comparison versus last year, we are pleased that we are making significant progress with respect to executing on our strategy and some of the highlights are shown. The fact that we entered into the Marcellus Shale, announced plans to expand our Canadian operations with the new NGL pipeline demonstrated increased liquidity with our $600 million debt issue. Additional support for Williams Partners produced 4% more gas in the US versus the last quarter; received approval to expand our Northwest pipeline system to transport additional Piceance gas and continued progress toward bringing strategic infrastructure projects into service. ", "On slide eight, we are delighted with our entry into the Marcellus Shale. Please note the key bullet points on the left side of this slide. But generally speaking, this transaction provides Williams with the gathering systems and a very large acreage dedication in the heart of the Marcellus that gives us a couple of year head start in the development of a large scale, highly-reliable system which provides needed midstream services to both Atlas Energy and other producers in the region. ", "Both our partner and our anchor customer are aligned with our growth expectations and the gathering service inquiries and expressed demand by other area producers is meeting our expectations. ", "As shown on slide nine, we are excited about our plans to construct a new NGL pipeline in Canada. Again, please review some of the key points on the left side of the slide, but this new investment in critical infrastructure will help enable sustainable development of the Canadian oil sands. Our investment is low risk as it is anchored by the existing tariffs being paid to Suncor currently, yet positions us to increase our volumes by almost 10 fold and provides existing upgraders the opportunity to dramatically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Clearly the transaction supports our strategy of providing highly reliable, large-scale services in key growth basins. ", "Importantly, note the third bullet there, the $283 million of capital will be funded from our international cash reserves. Slide 10 reflects summarized guidance information. The first column shows revised guidance based on our current assumptions. The second column shows guidance on February 19, the date of our fourth quarter call, and the third column shows 2008 actuals and is a reminder of our strong earnings power in a better price environment. ", "So as shown, for the full year we're expecting slight improvement in crude prices, continued downward pressure on nat gas prices and looking for some improvement in NGL margins. ", "CapEx is up about $100 million because of the Marcellus deal. The dip in segment profit is largely within E&P. So our current earnings per share guidance range is $0.55 to $0.95, the drivers of change being lower nat gas prices, Venezuela, additional support for WPZ and higher debt costs associated with the $600 million debt offering. ", "Slide 11 discusses progress on our top 2009 priorities. I'm not going to spend much time here because we have already highlighted some of these points earlier. But just a reminder that maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity, exercising cost discipline, bringing key infrastructure projects online, and I'm talking about projects like Willow Creek, Paradox, Perdido Norte, Sentinel, Colorado Hub, right-sizing capital spending and seizing opportunities as we have done with the Marcellus transaction. These priorities are critical to our success in 2009. ", "Slide 12 describes the key points that we have been making to investors as we have been on the road over the past 60 days. We think that Williams offers strength and stability with our strong financial position, the $3 billion of liquidity, the investment-grade credit rating, the fact that we have no significant debt maturities until 2011 and that primary credit facilities don't expire until 12' and 13'. We've demonstrated great flexibility to adjust capital spending in response to market conditions and I think we offer a stable foundation of cash flows. I think the key bullet point, being the fourth one, which shows that we are expecting $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of cash flows in 2009 from price risk insulated businesses, and I'm speaking here obviously about gas pipes and our fee-based midstream revenues and as well the fact that 62% of E&P production revenue is hedged in 2009. ", "So concluding with the key takeaways on slide 13, we believe we are well positioned to weather the economic storm because of our strong financial position, because of our stable foundation of cash flows, our ability to adjust spending and our belief that the integrated model is best suited for success in the current environment. We offer substantial upside to our current valuation. Significant expansion projects are coming online, substantial probable and potential low-risk reserves. We expect expansion of valuation multiples as the markets improve and all of the above I think translate into a very attractive risk reward balance.", "So with that, we have gone through the slides, the team is assembled here to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.", "Carl Kirst - Bmo Capital", "If I could start with the Marcellus and not necessarily to steal any thunder in front of May 12, but Steve can you give us any sense of what you are thinking? We know you're only going to go into an area if you can get big. You mentioned being large scale. Do you have a sense of the capital investment dollars you are thinking in this region over the next three years? Two, with respect to looking at it as far as how should we think of returns in the current environment, only noting that I saw in the midstream section that you guys had converted some of the keep-whole volumes to fee-based. I don't know how material that was but I didn't know as you were looking into the Marcellus if you're thinking about this more in kind of a fee structure or if it's just kind of the same model in the Rockies sort of placed on top of the Marcellus.", "Steve Malcolm", "I will offer a few comments and then turn it over to Alan, but you're right. You have been listening to me that we have talked about the fact that an important part of our midstream strategy is creating these large-scale positions where we can exercise some market power and that has certainly been the case with all of the basins that we have moved into. That is our game plan with Marcellus. Many producers have said that the midstream challenges are daunting. We have had several calls already from producers asking for help. So we are very excited and expect to be able to create the same kind of system that we've created in other growth basins. Alan, any other thoughts?", "Alan Armstrong", "Carl, I would just add that the majority of the business there, there's really not very much that we are counting on anyway in terms of processing revenues there, I think the majority of our business will be fee-based business there and somewhat exposed to gas price there which is a nice upset to our midstream business obviously. ", "So I think there will be a mix of that kind of business. I would just add to Steve's comment about the infrastructure and the need for it up there. As we see it, there's a lot of pipelines crisscrossing the Marcellus area today. But the degree of volumes that we think are going to build very rapidly out of that area are going to cause need for a system that can get producers the very best price rather than being dedicated to one particular pipe in an area that may be overloaded. So, we think there is a good opportunity for some large-scale infrastructure up that set some supply hubs in the Marcellus and we are excited to be talking to a lot of interested producers. As soon as we made that announcement, we saw a lot of interest in that kind of project.", "Carl Kirst - Bmo Capital", "Sure, but no sense or at least that you can kind of indicate at this point as far as potential investment dollars we're talking about over the next few years?", "Alan Armstrong", "I would say this. We have a pretty good idea of what it will take to keep up with the Atlas production but I would just say that that is certainly not the limit of our desire and appetite up there. We didn't go up there just to do that. It's a very important customer and we want to make sure we get that business right. But our desires are beyond that. So I would hate to quote a number because the rest of that investment is fairly speculative at this point.", "Carl Kirst - Bmo Capital", "Okay, fair enough. And just shifting really quickly to the Canadian NGL pipeline and just to make sure I understand this correctly, certainly understand the volumes that are going to be coming over the next 10 years. Sort of as we sit here today should we be thinking about as far as what is contracted, if you will, basically just the Suncor volumes? That looks to be about 15,000 a day over a 43 initial capacity. So that's only about 35% contracted and that you're going to kind of ramp that up as we move to in-service date or how should we think about that?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, very interesting project because we were shipping on OSPL which is the oilsands pipeline with Suncor and we were shipping those NGLs and as a result of that, we were taking up space in that crude oil pipeline. They needed us out of that space to make room for their expanded upgraders up there. So part of the negotiation was them basically buying us out of that position to move barrels and we were paying a very high tariff on that pipeline. So the minimum volume, if you will, as Steve mentioned, the project is very low risk because we get to a low but reasonable return with just that base volume of business that we have up there today. So anything above that is upside to us.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Faisal Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Just a quick question. I just want to clarify this. What is your production growth target for this year? And I guess how do you foresee that kind of (inaudible)", "Ralph Hill", "This is Ralph. What we said before and continue to say, we think overall our production guidance range has been a growth of about 2% to 4% for the year. So you can see that our rapid growth quarter-over-quarter, first quarter '09 versus first quarter '08 will taper off as the year progresses.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Then given your guys' focus on EVA metrics, you obviously chose to make an acquisition in the Appalachian Basin, but how are you looking at the allocation of capital as we get into the summer here in this low gas price environment. I guess your assumptions have changed for gas and commodity prices in this quarter versus last quarter. So how is your allocation of capital changing within the different segments?", "Don Chappel", "Again, we look at our costs and our expectations of future profit. We certainly have a point of view on commodity prices in the future. We also have financial markets as an indicator and we take all of that into consideration as well as risks and make decisions. I think in the case of the Atlas investment, we saw a very substantial opportunity relative to the risk profile and expect very attractive returns in that basin over time. So I would say a typical way that we always look at things is just that the variables perhaps are more variable than they have been in the past.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "If I'm looking at your overall kind of cost structure in the midstream business, also in the E&P business, what sort of efforts are you guys making to reduce that cost structure over time? Because over the last three years, the midstream cost structure has kind of moved up along with your expansion opportunities. So, I was trying to figure out if there's room for that cost structure to move down over time.", "Alan Armstrong", "I will speak to the midstream piece there. In this quarter actually we did see our unit cost move down a little bit on the O&M side. So we are seeing some backing off of cost on both the O&M side and the capital side as a matter of fact. So we are being able to put some pressure on those costs. Albeit minor in the first quarter, but we certainly have seen that inflection point.", "Ralph Hill", "This is Ralph. Our cost structure, as you know, is usually in the top three or four in the country. So we continue to drive those efficiencies. On May 12, you'll see some slides from some independent analysis that shows we remain in the top two or three. So we don't have any major cost efforts underway except what we always do everyday and every year.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Last question; on Venezuela, is this an issue where their credit is constrained and they can't pay you or is this an issue where you have to walk away from the assets because you don't think there's going to be any recovery there?", "Alan Armstrong", "I would just say that evidently it's hard for us to have an internal read obviously into Petrowayu's finances. But it certainly makes sense for them to be paying us and continuing to service there. And for whatever reasons, they haven't been able to make those payments and so we have rights under our contracts and we intend to exercise those rights.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Rebecca Followill with Tudor Pickering Holt.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt", "On the E&P side, commodity prices particularly natural gas prices continue to decline, low three handle on them right now. Do you at some point say prices are just too low or just going to shut it down? How do you think about commodities right now?", "Don Chappel", "We continue to look at that. We have a very low cash breakeven price, as you know. It's $1 or less in some areas and less than $2 in other areas. So we just monitor that and the question will be if the prices get very low this summer, some of that will shut in, but obviously if that cash flows [somewhat]. So we will just have to look at that and continue to balance it.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt", "But is there a strip or a price level where you say, we just don't want to do it or is it sub $2, sub $3, any kind of feel? ", "Don Chappel", "You'll see May 12 what you think our returns are based on current strip and I think you'll be impressed with those.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Xin Liu from JPMorgan.", "Xin Liu - JPMorgan", "My question is regarding the IDRs you gave up and the [G&E] credit that you gave for the WPZ. Do you get anything in return?", "Don Chappel", "This is Don Chappel. I think what we get in return is the value of our LP units goes up. We think in time, the value of our GP will go up as well. We also have currency, an MLP currency that's more useful at very high yields that WPZ was at as a result of investor concerns about distribution maintenance. The currency was not very useful to us. So as that yield comes down, we have again an alternate source of equity capital that we can tap for some of these very attractive projects. So, that is what we get in return. So I view it as strategic. ", "Xin Liu - JPMorgan", "Okay and another question regarding the drilling program at the Piceance. How many rigs do you have over there and what have you seen in terms of production in the Rockies in general?", "Alan Armstrong", "We have seven rigs in the valley and one in the highlands. So that's a total of eight, down from 28 fourth quarter of last year. We have seen prices continue to come down for all services. We also believe that Rockies production has probably peaked in the region, not peaked permanently but peaked for this year. If it hasn't already, it will very quickly. And thus we feel that as we move on down the road that with the infrastructure in place, it is already in place, an infrastructure that will be built in the next couple of years; the Rockies could possibly turn into an advantage transportation outlet versus some of the other areas of the country.", "Operator", "(technical difficulty) ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just a couple of quick follow-ups. On Venezuela, is there any way to get upside down there? If you guys are continuing to operate but Petrowayu is not paying its bills, is there a risk that we are not just putting the profit in kind of the nonrecurring box that we could actually go negative?", "Don Chappel", "No, we have a set date for the way the agreements work that we would discontinue operations and that's in the very near future.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and then just lastly, Ralph, you had mentioned of the production growth of 2% to 4% this year. Are we still kind of targeting an exit rate for the year of roughly a 5% decline or has that been pushed up? ", "Ralph Hill", "We still think a 5% decline although first quarter production as you saw was higher than we what we thought it would be. We still see a decline for the year and then flattening out next year.", "Operator", "We have no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Steve Malcolm for closing remarks.", "Steve Malcolm", "Great. Here we are. It looks like we're getting through this call in less than 30 minutes. We look forward to seeing you on May 12 and see you then. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead sir.", "Travis Campbell", "Thank you Karen, good morning everybody and welcome to our second quarter call. As always, we thank you for your interest in our company. We just have a few slides to go over in the presentation this morning. Steve Malcolm will be going through those in just a minute. Be aware though, that all of our business unit heads are here and available for questions.

", "Also this morning we issued a press release announcing the completion of the binding open season on Transco northeast supplied project.

Those are important, and integral to the remarks, so please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to general accepted accounting principles, those sketches are available and follow the presentations.", "With that, I will turn it over to Steve Malcolm, the CEO. ", "Steve Malcolm", "", "Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call and as always we appreciate your interest in our company. This morning we are offering another stream line to earnings call that seem to go over well last time and I know there are quite a few energy company call this morning. I will be the only presenter, but our entire senior management team is present to answer any of your questions. ", "Starting with slide four please. Lower energy commodity prices certainly impacted our second quarter profitability, the $0.20 adjusted earnings per share is 70% below the year ago level. The average net realized price for US production drop to $3.95 in Mcf, that\u2019s 51% lower than second quarter of 2008. ", "Per unit NGO margins improved versus the first quarter, up 75% from the first quarter, but still 31% from a year ago. The good news, we continue to record stable steady earnings and cash flows from gas pipeline, and we are very optimistic about the future and we are convinced that the market recovery will drive value accretion across all of our assets.", "Looking more closely at the numbers on slide five; for the second quarter and the first of the year, the big story in our recurring adjusted results continues to be the significant disparity between the record high energy commodity prices we saw in 2008 and relatively low prices we\u2019ve seen this year. ", "For the quarter we have recurring adjusted income of $0.20 a share compared with $0.67 in the second quarter of 2008 and for the first six months we had $0.42 of share compared with $1.23 in the first half of 2008.", "In our reported results, the story is again low energy prices and significant nonrecurring items. For the quarter we reported net income of $142 million, compared with $437 million last year and again the key difference in the year-over-year performance for the quarter was dramatically lower energy commodity prices. ", "For the first half of 2009 we reported a loss of $30 million compared with a profit of $937 million year ago. The primary drivers include again, dramatically lower commodity prices, losses associated with our Venezuelan operations and investments, and thirdly I recall that our results in the first of 2008 benefited from a $148 million pretax gain on the sale of our international assets.", "Slide six please. We reported recurring segment profit second quarter \u201808 versus second quarter \u201909, just a few highlights under E&P and recurring. The key factors in the second quarter \u201809 much lower net realized prices for U.S. E&P production, again 51% below second quarter \u201808, as well as second quarter \u201809 we had higher DD&A expense based on higher level of production volumes. The average daily US production in the second quarter \u201809 was 6% greater than second quarter \u201808, 4% lower than first quarter \u201809.", "Under Midstream, reported a recurring the decline in results primarily because of lower NGL and all are from prices, and lower NGL equity sales volumes partially offset by a decreased production costs reflecting lower natural gas prices and significantly lower NGL margins.", "In the gas pipeline space again stable, steady predictable reported results reflect second quarter \u201808 included a benefit of $9 million gain on the sale of excess natural gas inventory. Recurring results down due to higher operating costs primarily from higher depreciation O&M and pension expenses partially offset by increased revenues from the Sentinel expansion which was placed in service in December of 2008.", "Gas marketing, we see improvement because in the second quarter \u201809 includes $7 million improvement in margins from buying and selling gas around transportation contracts as well as margins realized on physical, natural gas purchases. Also second quarter \u201808 included an $8 million inventory valuation adjustment related to natural gas owned in storage.", "Slide seven; reported and recurring segment profit of 2008 year-to-date, versus 2009 year-to-date. I\u2019ve already covered much of this already, but again a few highlights that I haven\u2019t covered in E&P reported results reflect year-to-date \u201809 includes approximately $34 million in expenses associated with early termination of rig contracts as well another point in Midstream, the reported results include a $75 million loss related to the impairment of Midstream\u2019s equity investments in the actual assets in Venezuelan.", "Slide eight; this chart updates our outlook for full year 2009 commodity price assumptions, as well as for earnings and capital expenditures. First column shows actual year-to-date results, second column our expectation for ranges in the second half of the year, third column provide revised full-year guidance. ", "You\u2019ll note that the top end of our capital spending range for the year is down. I\u2019ll cover a few reasons for that here in a minute. I think the salient point though is that we\u2019ve narrow the range for recurring earnings per share from the earlier range of $0.55 to $0.95 narrow that to $0.70 to $0.90, or another way of looking at it we\u2019ve raised the midpoint of full-year earnings per share guidance by a nickel.", "Slide nine please; the slide recaps our 2009 priorities in the progress we are making, we\u2019ve talked about these priorities with investors since the first part of the year. Again few highlights around the second bullet driving down costs, we are seeing savings on capital projects. A few examples, in the midstream area $25 million reduction in the total estimated cost on our Wamsutter TXP IV project, net savings flow through to our guidance. ", "In the EMP space we are seeing significant drilling cost decreases averaging close to 20% lower year-over-year in the Piceance Basin which comprises about two thirds of our total drilling this year. ", "Under the third bullet, having to do with bringing key infrastructure projects online, you\u2019ll see that we are making progress, we\u2019ve got a checkmark next to Blind Faith which is now online and there is a checkmark next to Willow Creek, our processing plant in the Piceance basin where as we speak we\u2019re in the process of bringing net plant into service. ", "Under the last bullet, seizing opportunities of course we added an EMP component to our foot hold in the Marcellus Shale. So we remain on target to achieve the goals and priorities that we will focus in 2009.", "Finally on slide10, we believe that we are well positioned to whether the economic storm because of our strong financial position because of stable foundation of cash flows because of our ability to adjust spending and our believe that the integrated model today is best suited for success. ", "In terms of substantial upside to our current valuation I would want to make a couple points we continue to see tightening at the Rockies basis remember that Williams is perhaps uniquely positioned to capture value in the NGL markets. Our Gas pipeline business continues to have great success with Base hit expansion projects that are driven by demand from the markets we serve. I always want to make the point around our core position the Piceance. It continues to create advantage. ", "We talked about that at our Investor Day in New York City. We enjoy the benefits of low costs of scale, the ability to be opportunistic. I think we\u2019ve demonstrated conclusively how and why the Piceance Basin and the Rockies in general are good place to be, perhaps not for everyone, but absolutely for Williams.", "Certainly the fact that Ruby pipeline, it appears is now more likely to be built with El Paso now having a partner. That\u2019s clearly a good thing for Williams. All of the above I think translates into an attractive risk reward balance for Williams and again we are very excited about the future. ", "With that we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session ", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Xin Liu \u2013 JPMorgan.", "Xin Liu \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Good morning guys. Questions on your Midstream NGL margins for your guidance, it seems like year-to-date your average realized margin is $0.27 and it seems like you took down the lower end of the NGL margin. Can you give us your outlook on the NGL market?", "Alan Armstrong", "First of all of course we saw a large improvement from first quarter to second quarter. We saw very nice increase in margins, mostly on the backs of ethylene margins which has improved dramatically. Recalling the first quarter we were in rejection in many locations. Here in the second quarter and into the current period we were into very improved margins on ethane. ", "That is largely driven by the large spread between crude oil and gas prices, and ethane right now is the only component that is in the money for ethylene crackers right now for in a cash margin basis. So we are seeing a lot of pull on ethane right now which is driving those ethane margins up and giving us some confidence about where they stand for the balance of the year at this point.", "Xin Liu \u2013 JPMorgan", "Another question for Ruby, how much do you have spent so far and factoring the equity contribution from your partner, how much you need to put out for financing the project during construction and what capital structure are to take after the completion?", "Alan Armstrong", "I am sorry let me clarify, we are not a financial partner in the Ruby project. My comment about Ruby earlier was simply the fact that El Paso now has a financial partner. There seems to be greater likelihood that the pipeline will be build creating more take away capacity out of the Rockies which is a good thing for Williams, since we have a lot of our production in the Rockies.", "Xin Liu \u2013 JPMorgan", "I\u2019m sorry. I messed up with you said El Paso. Can you comment on your outlook on the Rockies basis?", "Ralph Hill", "This is Ralph Hill, the basis is done what we have thought would happens since May, we think with the severe decline in drilling in the Rockies and also the extra transportation capacity that has been built already, and we will be build with Bison, the Bison project and with the Ruby project. ", "What we see is the basis has gone down to about $0.85 from where it was over $1 at that time. The next three years or so all in that $0.80 to $0.85 rate, so what we thought would happen is happening, there is excess capacity coming out, the basis is shirking and our ability to move our gas or the Rockies is coming true just like we thought it would be.", "Xin Liu \u2013 JPMorgan", "Did you expect the basis to widen, if gas prices go up?", "Ralph Hill", "Well we don\u2019t think it was, not likely to have sometime historically. We think that the Rockies is a preferred place to be for transportation opportunities because the infrastructure is mature and since its build out already, it\u2019s been added to extra capacity. ", "There has been a dramatic drop in the production levels that will be happening in the Rockies due to the number of rigs laid down. So, I do not see that growing out and if you look at the futures market out there it is pretty consistent around $0.80 to $0.85 in the next several years. So it doesn\u2019t look like the market thing is going to go blow out either.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carl Kirst - BMO Capital", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital", "", "Couple of questions, Ralph just to clarify, we\u2019ve kind of long been expecting obviously the sequential decline in production. Are you guys deferring any completions or otherwise have shut in. Are your managing production at all or should we take the number basically purely at the service?", "Ralph Hill", "", "We have deferred some completions and by the end of the year, we\u2019ll be deferring probably in the Piceance 75 or 80 completions. We also are not doing anything heroic to bring volumes on in various series that we traditionally would have done. So we are managing production a little in that aspect, yes.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital", "", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then just following up on the E&P side in the Marcellus and I guess the question is, with sort of the dipping or the turn of the water with the Rex deal in June, do you see more opportunities to do that? Do you feel like you have to wait perhaps to get some Rex Wells down before you\u2019d want to reassess perhaps other bootstrapping opportunities or indeed or even potentially assessing larger moves into the Marcellus?", "Ralph Hill", "Well we can\u2019t predict the future obviously, but we\u2019ve studied the base and for a couple of years. Our technical team was very, very confident in the areas we\u2019d like to be in and we have seen, even before the Rex deal and at the time of the utmost deal with our Midstream group. ", "We\u2019ve seen a lot of deal flow. I think that\u2019s pretty obvious, it\u2019s going out here for a lot people. So we think there is a quite a bit opportunity out there, I can\u2019t predict where it will end up, but those areas we like a lot and we continue to see a lot of deal for, a lot of opportunities as always there is something we could put together that makes sense for Williams and for our partners.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital", "", "With respect to the bootstrapping versus potentially larger acquisitions, I mean is that something you can answer us with respect to bias, I mean obviously you will opportunistic if something great come along, but do you have bias towards one approach to the other?", "Alan Armstrong", "Carl, well just continue to be opportunistic and continue to evaluate the opportunities out there. As Ralph mentioned a lot of deal flow, lot of opportunities for us to look at things, but I think key point to remember is that we\u2019re going to be disciplined and we\u2019re going to live within our means.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital", "Fair enough and then last question if I could maybe for Alan, just turning to the Gulf of Mexico, one of the other natural gas gatherers in the deep water is perhaps hit upon more of a traditional cost of service model. Is that something that you guys think would be replicable as well?", "Alan Armstrong", "", "Well for pieces of the business I think that is the case and it kind of depends on how much of the excess capacity you are willing to grant to the counter party. So in other way in a lot of those deals, the counterparties controlling any excess capacity or have the call on it and takes away quite a bit of the upside. ", "So we have seen some deals like that out there, but it certainly takes with it a lot of the upside that we\u2019ve seen for instance on Devils Tower business where we have the excess capacity, we are able to price that at market. ", "So those deals are available, but as you know there is a lot of risk out there and we think we need a pretty high return to balance any risk on the construction support that we take out there. Yes, I think some of those are available and we probably have better places for that kind of lower return. We probably have better places to put on money than that.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup ", "On the E&P segment, looks like you guys were free cash flow positive in the quarter. I just want to understand the trends kind of going forward, I guess should we expert production in kind of trend down at the same rate we saw the sequential decline in first quarter of this year to the second quarter of this year and how should we expect that CapEx and E&P for the rest of this year? Thanks.", "Ralph Hill", "", "We\u2019ve got guidance out there between 950 and 1.5 billion so we\u2019ll stay in that range for our CapEx for the balance of the year. The way we\u2019ve looked out is fourth quarter \u201808 or fourth quarter \u201809 we think will be down approximately 4% to 5% in production, which means that would be some decline that would give us an overall decline for the year of 45%, we are staying with that. ", "I would say that so far we have surprise to the upside of that, so may not be quite that much decline and we\u2019ve also mentioned that in 2010 although we haven\u2019t given our guidance here we have said that we don\u2019t think that the decline continues. We think we pretty much stay flat based on this kind of level of capital expenditures if we keep the same level of capital expenditures in 2010.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup ", "Just looking at the production tax number, any reason why the production tax rate was so low.", "Ralph Hill", "Well, yes there is two reasons, one obviously lower gas prices is a big part of that, but it was offset by the lower effective tax rates and the way that was lower effective tax rate was because we had some ad valorem tax credits that were provided to us in particular by the State of Texas that we recognized in that quarter.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup ", "Just shifting to the Midstream side equations for a second, the decision in the beginning of the year to shift, I guess some of your key contracts are fee based, was that a decision by your customers or was that decision by you, or was that more of a negotiation?", "Alan Armstrong", "No that was built into an original contract that the customer had the option on and was a large package of Jonah gas that dated back to the original construction of Opel of the third train at Opel. So they had the option of changing the fee based and elected to do so.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup ", "Alan, can you comment a little bit about any tightness in the fractionation capacity in the market today? It seems like we\u2019ve been hearing on some of the Midstream calls at fractionation capacity seems to be a bit tight?", "Alan Armstrong", "", "Yes, it certainly has tightened up considerably and we\u2019re very fortunate to have for a lot of our business range to do with One Oak where the Overland Pass transaction for most of our product and have got the capacity we need, but certainly that is tightened, we\u2019re certainly seeing that with our Conway fractionators. We are seeing a lot of demand for that space in running full out. ", "So I think there is no secret that in the Mont Belvieu and Mid Continent area, the Fractionates capacities are very tight right now.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup ", "On the pipelines sequentially, it looks like operating cost went up pretty substantially, I know you talked about pension costs in your prepared remarks, but is that all with the increases or is there something else there?", "PhillipWright", "", "This is Phil Wright. We had the pension increase which is substantial chunk of that. We also had a depreciation increase as well and then we did have some year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter rather operating expense increases, but the detail on that I think is in your book.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup ", "Last question on your cash balance of about, I think you said $1.8 billion. How should we expect that balance to kind of trend over the course of the year, I think that\u2019s a bit higher than we had expected going to the second quarter?", "Don Chappel", "", "Faisel, this is Don Chappel. If you look at one of the slides in our data book, we have cash flow analysis forecast for the balance of the year. I think it\u2019s on page number 43 of the data book. We continue to expect that the US portion of that balance excluding the MLP\u2019s will be in a range of $700 million to $900 million by the end of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co", "Couple of questions on the E&P side, again I\u2019m still going to numbers I apologize there\u2019s lots of earnings out this morning, so if I missed something I\u2019m sorry. It took like production guidance is up by just a hair. It was 1125 to 1225 and now its 1175 to 1225 is that correct?", "Alan Armstrong", "That is true. Yes.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co", "Did it include previously the deferral at Piceance completions?", "Ralph Hill", "", "Yes. We have not changed that, we\u2019ve always had about 65 or 70 wells are going to be deferred, yes.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co", "Okay and the reason for the increases?", "Ralph Hill", "Well we\u2019ve actually done better year-to-date and we thought we would based on our original plan and because of that, the flow that we thing will keep going during the year is that we\u2019re just doing little better and we thought.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co", "Then when I am looking at the volumes by segment, it looks like the biggest decline sequentially is in part of our basin. Is that the area where we should expect to see the biggest decline just to the rest of this year?", "Ralph Hill", "Potentially what we are seeing is it\u2019s obviously it\u2019s just a function of and there is a number of wells that are dewatering both Horizon are primarily our partners. So, that is again it depends on when they crosses over to the gas flow side, but that is where we potentially can have a decline.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co", "Great and then last thing on the Midstream on the JV and Marcellus any updates there, any changes on where you guys want to spend CapEx or any other thoughts, now that you had it for a while?", "Alan Armstrong", "", "Well, I guess I would just categorize back that we\u2019ve seen a lot of investment opportunity both on relatively small assets in the area that need to be aggregated and to be able to access better markets. So we\u2019ve seen a lot of some relatively small assets the producers were interested in selling and we\u2019ve also seen tremendous amount of new investment opportunity for some of the major step out opportunities amongst producers there that are looking for infrastructure. ", "So, the opportunities probably bigger, its certainly a lot more opportunity than we thought going in and there is just a lot of unknown just you can imagine right now making waiting on various issues around a water disposal and so forth that are leaving people from making big commitments, but they are kind of still hanging in the wings there, but certainly much more opportunity than we expected going in there in terms of both acquisition and grass-roots investment opportunities.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co", "When do you think that you will have a feel that you will be able to get to us on what kind of capital will you ultimately put in to that business, with that area?", "Alan Armstrong", "I think that is going to be evolving for a long period of time. I think that will better be changing for quite sometime.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "There is a lot of discussion around about high storage levels causing pipeline pressures to build, which obviously could lead to full shutting down gas well. So I know you had mentioned that the Rockies capacity, take away capacity is increasing so that probably not going to happen to your Rockies basin, but I just want to double check if you are seeing any of that phenomenon happening in any of your other regions, number one. ", "Number two; what consequences that has for your Midstream businesses, obviously if E&P shuts in, gathering and processing revenues and if that is the case, if there are minimum threshold that E&P companies have to pay you to maintain or keep those contracts open. I know that\u2019s a lot, but as you could start with that it would be great.", "Ralph Hill", "This is Ralph. Let me take the first part. I do think what we\u2019ve seen in the Rockies in the last two months, we monitor is that the storage is not filling up as fast as it was and that is primarily because of the Rex East capacity coming on. ", "So obviously we think storage will get full in the Rockies at some point, but we don\u2019t see where it\u2019s going to be full at such a fast rate as it was going earlier in the year. So we haven\u2019t seen it in any of our areas pressuring of for any of that at this point and we don\u2019t think the Rockies really will do that particularly with our transport capacity out there, and I\u2019ll let Alan take the second part of that question.", "Alan Armstrong", "", "Yes, I think on the Midstream side particularly out west, we certainly haven\u2019t seen any of that yet. We deliver into pipes and they have a norm based on certain design pressure. We are capable delivering into that design pressure on all of our locations. ", "Generally, most of our larger customers and the bulk of our revenues do come from large customers have downstream capacity on the pipelines to server their production needs and so we\u2019re not seeing reduction and production right now and are not forecasting any on our systems due to storage constraint. So not saying that won\u2019t happen, but we\u2019re certainly we are not seeing any rim at so that are any signs of that right now.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Next question is the $0.70, $0.90 guidance range outside of price moment what could help Williams achieve the upper end or above, and what would cause Williams to miss the lower end or below?", "Don Chappel", "This is Don Chappel. I would say that the primary driver of that range is pricing, price and margins. Certainly costs are a factor, but a fairly modest portion of the variable there. ", "So I think we\u2019re confident about our production, I think we are confident about our cost management so I\u2019ve to say the primary driver other than just surprises would be pricing and margins.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. So it\u2019s really all in your control?", "Don Chappel", "Pricing and margins are not within our control?", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Outside of pricing.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Huberfeld \u2013 TomCo ", "Mark Huberfeld \u2013 TomCo", "Just a quick question from the analyst day earlier in the year, you had said indicated may be that would be some insight into cost cuts or OpEx reductions may be around this time of the year. Could you maybe just update us on that?", "Alan Armstrong", "Looking for the AMP side we have achieved what we thought we could do in lot of our areas. Capital side of world down we\u2019re down about 26% so far may be lower in our capital costs, like well basis this year versus last year. ", "I think if you look at our lease operating expense in the second quarter \u201809 is like 13% below what we saw in 2008 and we could see all of that continue to turn down quite a bit. So we are feeling very positive about what we thought could happen and what we\u2019ve seen actually happens so far.", "Mark Huberfeld \u2013 TomCo", "I was thinking maybe more or so on G&A and corporate and other areas of the business where that you\u2019ve grown OpEx in the last several years in the better environment?", "Alan Armstrong", "We continue to look for opportunities to cut costs, we have not yet made any wholesale cuts in our work force because coming into this downturn we were short and so we continue to look for ways to cut cost and taken some steps. I think those are reflected in our guidance and we\u2019ll continue to operator our business in a very disciplined manner.", "Operator", "", "With no further questions, I\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Campbell for any additional or closing remarks.", "Steve Malcolm", "", "This is Steve. I appreciate your time. I know there are a lot of calls today. A solid quarter and we are very excited about the future.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Travis Campbell", "We do have a few slides to go over in our presentation this morning. Steve Malcolm will be going through those in just a minute. Be aware though, that all of our business unit heads are available for any questions. Also as usual, we've put together our data book that includes all the information that we provide each quarter. So, this morning, you should be able to find the slides, data book and press release that were issued earlier today on our website, Williams.com.", "At the beginning of the slide deck of the forward-looking statements and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves. Those are important and integral to our remarks, please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Malcolm.", "Steve Malcolm", "As has been the case with our last few earnings calls, I'll be the only presenter today, but the entire team is here to answer any of your questions. We've got a lot of good feedback on this approach and we'll continue it today. So slide four, please. We enjoyed a strong third quarter. We like the earnings growth trajectory that we're showing on this slide.", "In the third quarter, we grew recurring earnings per share 25% over our second quarter, and we're on track to deliver earnings for the second half of '09 that are 33% higher than the first half of the year. We're raising our guidance today for full-year 2009 to a range of $0.95 to $1.00. We're calling the midpoint of that $0.98, and that's 18% higher than when we last updated guidance, which was when I spoke at Barclays and BofA conferences in September.", "We've noted the key drivers of our strong third quarter and of our higher expectation for the full year in the upper left quadrant of slide four. Commodity prices have improved. Our net realized price for natural gas production was $4.18 in the third quarter; that's up 6% from the second quarter. We are continuing to benefit from lower operating cost and I'll cover that in more detail here in a minute.", "NGL margins are making significant improvements. The progression of $0.20 in the first quarter, $0.35 in the second; $0.45 in the third. That's a nice upward trajectory. We've seen the Rockies basis differential cease to be an issue. Following production levels combined with expanding takeaway capacity have tamed the differential. In fact at times recently, we've seen markets be higher for Rockies gas than at the Henry Hub. These are the key drivers in our ability to build that strong upward trend for earnings growth.", "Slide five, please. As you can see here, we expect earnings growth to continue in very strong fashion. Our earnings growth engine is certainly alive and we're rapidly regaining our ability to create significant value for shareholders. Yes, the improving energy/commodity prices play an important role in that earnings growth through 2011, but as you can see from these arrows, we expect our earnings growth to be significantly greater than the improvement in commodity prices during that period.", "The green arrow shows 91% growth in our adjusted earnings per share from 2009 to 2011. The $1.87, at the midpoint of our guidance range for 2011 would move us close to the record high earnings that we produced in 2008. We're basing that expectation of sharply higher earnings on commodity price assumptions that showed crude prices improving less than 40%, and natural gas moving up just over 50%. We're not relying on $100 oil and $9 gas to get back to where we need to be.", "Slide six, please. Here we take a look at the 2009 to 2011 growth and how it looks from a segment profit standpoint. Overall, we expect to increase total recurring adjusted segment profit by nearly 50% from '09 to '11. A quick overviews of the drivers in E&P. We expect to see better than 80% growth in our E&P segment profit, based largely on higher commodity prices and by 2011, increased production volumes.", "In midstream, we're expecting about a 60% increase in our midstream segment profit. Key drivers are the higher NGL margins and the effect of new fee business projects like Willow Creek in the Piceance; like Blind Faith in the Gulf that have now come online. And we expect our gas pipeline business to continue to deliver strong, steady results as we meet market demand, primarily through expansion projects on our strategically located systems.", "Slide seven. This slide shows maintenance capital and growth capital by business unit from 2009 through 2011. The key takeaway here is, we continue to be opportunity rich. We're investing in excess of $4 billion in growth projects during the period 2009 to 2011. So, we're adding fuel to our earnings engine, we're investing in the rich opportunities that are created by our unique business strategies and our best-of-class assets. We're making these investments with a continuing commitment to live within our means.", "Slide eight, please. We always want to take advantage of any opportunity to talk about the Piceance Basin. And for shareholders of Williams, it's worthwhile to remember the value creating strength that our Piceance Basin strategy delivers. Looking at the left hand side there, this is a world class resource. The drilling economics are shale play strong. Let me offer a few more comments on that point. We're in the Marcellus, we're in the Barnett, to a lesser extent in the Woodford Shale.", "We've evaluated numerous deals in all of the other shales, Fayetteville, Hainesville, Eagleford. However in our view, none of them has exceeded the quality of our core Piceance position. Most people agree with us now that the Rockies basis differential has been tamed by following production, coupled with expanding capacity on Rex, Bison and Ruby. This is clearly represented in the forward markets more favorably than when we presented our typical well comparisons at our May call.", "So with the threat of basis removed, Piceance moves to the very top of the list of US gas plays. And we have thousands of low risk locations left to develop. So continuing down the left side. Our costs are low; we have a track record of high returns; we enjoyed the benefits of scale. This map shows the breadth and depth of our Piceance operations in each of our businesses. We continue to be opportunistic. Willow Creek, full operations announced in late September; the Colorado Hub Connection that will be in service very soon; and the Piceance lateral extension, which is an NGL line to Overland Pass, which should go into operation before the end of the year.", "I'm going to pause here now in terms of my slideshow and do something new today. We talked with investors often and we thought that it might be good to run through some of the most often asked questions and give you a little flavor as to our point of view on some of these key issues.", "We've had a lot of questions about updates on our JVs with Rex Energy and Atlas and Marcellus, so let me give you an update. In June, we announced that we had signed the participation and exploration agreement to develop natural gas wells in the Marcellus shale with Rex Energy.", "I'm not going to go through the essence of the deal. I refer you to our press release on that deal. But since the initial announcement in June, we've established an office in a suburb of Pittsburgh. We've commenced assembling an asset team. We're preparing to assume drilling production and commercial operations on January the 1st.", "We're on track to drill seven wells this year as planned, and more specific information on well performance and plans for 2010 will be announced as we complete more wells, and have the time to analyze the data from our initial production. As you'll recall that on June the 1st, we entered into a midstream joint venture with Atlas Pipeline Partners, refer you to the press release on the essence of that deal. But since we've formed the midstream joint venture in June, we've continued to make progress. We're nearing the end of the planning phase of the new Marcellus gathering system, which would be made up of over 60 miles of pipe designed to have in excess of 300 million a day of capacity. The system would be located near Uniontown, Pennsylvania, with an expectation that portions of the new system would be in service by the end of the second quarter of 2010.", "The new midstream joint venture called Laurel Mountain Midstream is planning on connecting over 150 Marcellus wells to the new system and the legacy system in 2010. Atlas has drilled over 170 vertical wells with two staged fracs, averaging about 2 million a day. In addition, they've drilled 12 horizontal wells, seven of which that have been completed and for 2010, they're planning to drill 30 horizontal wells.", "Another question that we get often, what is we seeing in terms of volume trends for our midstream business? The good news is currently, gathering volume; processing plant inlet natural gas volumes; NGL equity sales and total NGL production for the third quarter of 2009 are all higher than any quarter since at least 2007.", "Looking ahead for 2010 and 2011, there are a variety of trends, while Wyoming drilling may be down in the short-term, we're based loaded with Pinedale and Jonah production at Opal. We're still bypassing gas there and any cuts in natural gas production will likely hurt our competition in the area, but before it impacts volumes at our Opal plant.", "At Wamsutter, we expect volumes to increase due to BP drilling behind the plant. Down in the Four Corners area, we expect slight declines over the next few years, as that huge mature basin continues its normal basin decline. In the Gulf, we expect increases driven by Perdido Norte, Bass Lite, and Blind Faith as producers of oil and associated gas continue to grow production in the Gulf. These new connections will offset other declines from production we are servicing in the area.", "Finally, new capacity at Markham, which serves the Gulf; TXP4 at Echo Springs in Wyoming; and our new Willow Creek plant in Colorado will all increase overall volumes for midstream. Taken as a whole, these translate us to believe that our gathering and NGL production for all of midstream will continue to increase slightly over the guidance period.", "Another question is around the Rockies basis. What do we see? What do we feel? And I'll start here with a few data points. For 2008, the Rockies basis differential averaged (inaudible). In the first quarter of '09, that dropped to $1.51. In the second quarter, it dropped to $1.15. And for the third quarter, it averaged only $0.36.", "In the last month or so, the basis differential has essentially evaporated. The sum daily price is even showing Opal prices greater than Henry Hub prices. Why are we seeing this? What are some of the reasons? Rockies production is down by about 0.5 Bcf since the beginning of the year. Storage levels in the Rockies are at historic norms, not highs, norms. Rockies rig count remains down over 60% from peak 2008 levels. Rex has added 400 million a day of capacity since the first of the year. Bison and Ruby will be adding almost 2 Bcf of capacity over the next two years.", "So we believe and many others believe, that there will be no pipeline constraints out of the Rockies for quite some time. We think that we are clearly in an over piped situation. We've also received questions on cost improvements that we're seeing in our E&P business; drilling efficiencies; lower CapEx per well; reduced number of wells in drilling and completing a well.", "There have been a number of efficiencies and cost reductions from vendors associated with the recent downturn of drilling activity. A few examples, in the Piceance Valley, from third quarter '08 to third quarter '09, we have reduced costs for workovers by 75%, through a combination of doing fewer workovers and accomplishing efficiencies, and realizing cost reductions on those that we do. Efficiencies and vendor cost reductions have reduced lifting costs by about 25% to 30% for chemicals, water handling, plungers and well equipment.", "We've reduced a typical valley well drilling and completion cost by about 25%, from $1.9 million in the third quarter of '08 to about $1.4 million in the third quarter of '09, which includes improvements to these spud to spud time. On average, we've improved by one day, which represents in itself about a 7% to 12% improvement. These reductions were accomplished by a combination of negotiated vendor cost reductions, led by lower casing and fuel costs, lower negotiated fracing costs, and lower costs for completion rigs.", "Let me now continue with the slides, and if we could go to slide 10. We've talked about these priorities throughout the year. And I believe that we have executed crisply around all of these priorities. And so you see checkmarks on all of these. We certainly have maintained our strong balance sheet throughout the year, and liquidity. We've been successful in driving down costs through execution and expense discipline.", "We have brought, and are bringing, key infrastructure projects online in '09 and '10. You see with the checkmarks where we have brought new projects online, and you see Perdido Norte and Echo Springs expected to come on in '10; Sentinel and Colorado Hub, two gas pipeline projects expected to come online in the fourth quarter of '09. We definitely did right-size capital spending and continue to be disciplined. With the opportunities that we have seized in the Marcellus, we haven't just played defense.", "My last slide, slide 11. We do believe that Williams is a winning, long-term investment. We're seeing improving fundamentals with respect to gas and NGLs. We have best-of-class assets, which favorably position us to generate strongly higher earnings. There's substantial upside to our current valuation. We are opportunity rich, which leads to sustained growth ahead, as reflected in our 2010 and 2011 guidance. And we offer a unique and attractive risk reward balance to investors.", "So with that, we will take your questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question from Jonathan Lefebvre, Wells Fargo. ", "Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo", "Just a couple of quick questions on the Marcellus. It looks like you increased some of your acreage. I believe you had 22,000 and at your slide you said 25. Should we expect that the strategy will be kind of grassroots leasing? Also maybe can you comment on where you're seeing lease prices? We've been hearing that the prices have not dropped with commodity prices. ", "Ralph Hill", "", "You'll see a combination. We clearly are doing grassroots leasing, but we're also looking at a number of other opportunities, such as the joint venture we're in right now. So it's kind of a combination going forward. In our lease prices, we have not seen necessary decrease in the price of Marcellus leasing. But I don't really want to get into what the cost of the leases are going for right now.", "Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo", "It looks like you increased the hedges in Appalachia. Is that 100% hedged at this point? What you expect your production to be and then also on terms of the most reason two wells that Rex has drilled, any indication on those two wells?", "Ralph Hill", "We initially hedged what we thought our production would be, so we've tried to pretty full hedging on the initial amount of volume, but as we add volumes, obviously, there will be a portion that will be unhedged. We'll let Rex comment on the wells, but what I would say is the first handful of wells we looked at, we thought of them as science wells. And one of the wells that we've just completed, is much better than any science well we thought would be.", "So, we're doing a lot of work on the wells. We're doing a lot of testing; trying different techniques; trying different methods of where we're going to land the horizontal laterals and those things. And the third well that we've done is actually much better than what I would call a science well. But Rex is going to comment on those wells, since they clearly are still the operator until January 1, I'll let them make the comments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jessica Chipman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "Looking at slide seven on your quarterly data book and production volumes by region, you can see in the third quarter that most volumes are down. I just wanted to see if you could give us some sort of clarity on where you're expecting volume growth, so that next year looks flat to slightly up.", "Steve Malcolm", "The majority of the growth next year, it will be a combination of a couple of things. Several things happened as we've decreased our drilling. We actually had some shutting in the Powder River in September, which took off about a Bcf a day or so. But from that, a lot of our growth next year will be in the Valley, and in the Highlands and in the Barnett. There will be a slight growth in the Powder, but most of the remaining part of our growth will be in the Valley, Highlands and Barnett.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi. ", "Faisel Khan - Citi", "I just wanted to make sure I understood, reconciled your cash position that you had at the end of the third quarter, which I believe is $1.65 billion to your guidance for end-of-the-year liquidity. It looks like your guidance at the end of the year calls for a cash [drop]. It looks like you built cash in the third quarter. Maybe if you could just clarify that for me, that'd be great. ", "Steve Malcolm", "Faisel, our guidance for ending cash is on slide number 20, I believe. And year-end cash balance, unrestricted in the U.S. 675 to 875, that balance you see also includes international cash and some MLP cash. But we do expect a modest cash drawdown in the fourth quarter as a result of some capital project spending; but no material change. ", "Faisel Khan - Citi", "What was the total cash outlay for acquisitions this year?", "Don Chappel", "Steve, the Eastern Piceance deal was 258. ", "Faisel Khan - Citi", "And that was the only acquisition you did this year?", "Steve Malcolm", "Right, the others and the Marcellus, both E&P and Midstream. ", "Operator", "We will move now to Holly Stewart with Howard Weil. ", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "Just quickly, I guess a couple for Ralph. It looks like your CapEx range for next year is still pretty wide. We're hearing a lot of our companies now increasing rig count. Can you just kind of give us your big picture thoughts on next year? What your plans are for rig count and then eventually production? ", "Ralph Hill", "Well, we're still flat in the Piceance with about seven rigs running in the Valley, and then we have one in the Highlands and that will increase to four during the course of the year. The Barnett is back to four rigs just recently and it should stay at four at this point. So everywhere else is basically flat and as you know, we're just waiting to understand our cash flows for next year and commodity prices before we can commit to any more. ", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "And what are you going to run in the Marcellus? ", "Ralph Hill", "Just one at this point, which will be about 12 or so wells next year. ", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "Okay. And then what's your expectation on timing for, I guess, updating the Street on that? ", "Ralph Hill", "On the Marcellus? ", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "No, just in general, rig count across the basins. ", "Steve Malcolm", "We'll update you at our next call. ", "Operator", "Moving on to Harry Mateer from Barclays. ", "Harry Mateer - Barclays", "Conoco mentioned on their call yesterday that they may consider selling their stake in Rockies Express as part of their divestiture program. I was just wondering if that's something that either Williams or one of the MLPs could have interest in. ", "Steve Malcolm", "They could have interest. I wouldn't express for you today a positive or a negative view of that. ", "Harry Mateer - Barclays", "But it's something you could potentially consider? You would be willing to consider a pipeline acquisition? ", "Steve Malcolm", "Well, from the standpoint of more likely an MLP opportunity, I think. ", "Don Chappel", "I'd just say it comes down to capital allocation question as to where we can drive the highest value. ", "Operator", "We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve Malcolm for any additional or closing remarks. ", "Steve Malcolm", "I have nothing in addition. Thank you for your participation today and we're delighted with our results. We're very optimistic about the future and we look forward to the next opportunity that we have to talk with you. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

(NYSE:WMB) Q4 2009 Earnings Call February 19, 2010  9:30 AM ET", "", "Executives", "Travis Campbell - Head, IR", "Steve Malcolm - Chairman, President and CEO", "Ralph Hill - President, E&P", "Don Chappel - SVP, CFO", "Phil Wright - President, Gas Pipeline", "Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing", "Analysts", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Mark Caruso - Millennium Partners", "Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering & Holt", "Yves Siegel - Credit Suisse", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to the Williams Companies fourth quarter year end 2009 earnings release conference call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Travis Campbell", "Thank you and good morning everybody, welcome to our fourth quarter call this morning. As always thanks for your interest in the company. As we've done in the last few quarter, Steve Malcolm will review a few slides. Be aware though, that all of our business unit heads and Don Chappel are available here to take questions which we will do right after Steve's remarks. Also as usual, we've put together our data book that includes the information that we typically provide each quarter. So, this morning, on our website williams.com, you should be able to find the slides, the data book and press releases that were issued earlier today. Those press releases are the release detailing our 2009 results as well as an additional release reporting our 2009 natural gas reserves.", "Last evening, I'm sure you also saw the release announcing the completion of the asset contribution between Williams and Williams' Partners WPZ. I should note that post that transaction WPZ is a significant part of Williams. WPZ will be having their 2009 earnings call this morning at 10 a.m. Eastern. At that time WPZ management will be available to talk more about their results and their future. It might be worthwhile to tune in for that call as well.", "At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements and disclaimer on oil and gas reserves. Those are important and integral to our remarks, so you should review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Malcolm.", "Steve Malcolm", "Thank you Travis. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you for your continuing interest in our company and as Travis said we are going to use the same format that we've used in our last few earnings call. I will be the sole presenter but the entire team is on hand to answer any questions. We continue to get good feedback on that approach and we will continue it today.", "So starting with slide 4, this slide talks a little bit about our 2009 results, recent developments, let me tick through the list here fairly quickly. 2009 recurring adjusted income was $552 million or $0.94 a share for 2009. I think most importantly we completed our asset contribution transaction with WPZ which is clearly designed to drive growth and value creation for our shareholders.", "Our year end 3P US and International reserves are up 14%. We continue the expansion of our Marcellus Shale position with a new long-term agreement with a major producer which will expand our business in the Marcellus, allow us to construct a new 28 mile natural gas gathering pipeline which will move gas into Transco. Construction on that project is expected to begin in the latter part of 2010 and is expected to be placed into service during 2011. We also brought other expansion projects into service on Transco and Northwest. I am speaking here about the Sentinel Expansion Phase II which is a little over 100 million a day of additional capacity which went into service in the fourth quarter of '09.", "The Colorado Hub Project which increases access to the Piceance Basin for our northwest pipeline customers that went into service, fourth quarter 2009. And our Eminence Storage Enhancement Project, which was placed into service in October 2009. As well, we recorded peak day delivery records on all three of our pipelines this winter. It's good to see that our pipes are getting a strong usage during peak days.", "Next slide is slide five. This is a slide that investors have appreciated in the past and so I'll spend a few minutes on this slide. It shows the reconciliation of how our domestic reserves grew during the year. So starting with that first bar there, we ended last year with 4.34 Tcf of proved reserves. We added a 159 Bcf through the Piceance acquisition that we closed in the third quarter. Our wellhead production was 435 Bcf.", "Then we go the next three bars, which show how the new SEC rules for reserves blow through our numbers, and so this year the rules call for using at the 12-month average price for the year rather than the year-end price and this resulted in a base in price of just over $3, which is a 33% drop from the price used for our year end 2008 proved reserved. And so at the lower price, we had 336 Bcf of price related revisions.", "Also the new SEC rules are much more specific about what undeveloped locations can be counted as proved. The rules restrict development time to five years and require for the first time that we consider the conversion ratio of probable to proved locations in our drilling program. This rule requires we reclassify 496 Bcf from proved back to probable. On the plus side of the new SEC rules for the first time allow us to count undrilled locations that are more than 1 offset way from a producing well as proved where we have a reasonable certainty of production.", "This allowed us to add 454 Bcf as shown on the next bar. We also added a net 570 Bcf of proved reserves through the drill bit. making our net proved reserves at the $3 price 4.255 Bcf. This is a very similar result as we've had the previous several years in spite of using a capital budget of about half the level from 2008 which reflects the strength of our overall 2009 drilling program. However since the 2009 price was unusually low and is much lower than current gas price expectations, the next couple of bars show important price sensitivities.", "Our proved reserves are 4.581 Bcf. If we simply add a $1 to the SEC price, hence we get back almost all of our price-sensitive reserves at about $4 in the basin. That's an apples-to-apples comparison; our proved reserves using the same price that we used last year or $4.61 in the Rockies, our proved reserves are 4.632 Bcf. This constitutes 7% reserves growth in the year where we significantly reduced capital spending and 167% domestic reserves replacement. We reduced our three-year finding and development cost to $2.38 per Mcf and our one year drill bit only F&D was $1.53.", "We were very pleased about this reserves performance which continues our multi-year trend of strong proved reserves growth and best quartile F&D costs. Looking at proved probable and possible reserves, the 3P side of the world, the story gets even better. We ended last year with 12.6 Tcf of domestic 3P reserves and have now grown that 14% to 14.4 Tcf of domestic 3P reserves.", "Turning to slide six, I'm not going to spend much time on this slide. This just shows US and international reserves and I think the key takeaway here is that proved, probable and possible, 3P reserves are up 14% year-over-year.", "Slide seven, yesterday we closed our $12 billion strategic transformational restructuring designed to drive growth in shareholder value. Clearly, it significantly accelerated our dropdown strategy and let me quickly run through the key points. This transaction created a large diversified MLP that has investment grade credit rating, much more reliable access to the market. It significantly increases our capital availability, improves I believe the competitiveness of our midstream and gas pipeline operations E&P and our Canadian projects will be funded from their own cash flows and WMB funds and WPZ distributions. ", "Importantly, Williams is able to maintain scale, earnings, cash flows IDRs and control of the assets. This deal enhances our Williams growth profile and I think overall simplifies our corporate structure and creates a public marker in terms of having investors being able to value our company. ", "The next slide I think shows that Williams and WPZ interests are clearly aligned. The moves that we've made result in two well capitalized entities that are better positioned to pursue value adding gross strategies. Certainly growth and projects at PZ lead to more value at Williams. And as you can see on the slide here, the ability of WPZ to fund the capital projects for its midstream and gas pipeline projects means that Williams can focus free cash flow on growth and diversification of our E&P portfolio. ", "On the WPZ side, increased EBITDA and distributable cash flow translate into higher earnings per share for Williams, and as PZ increases its unit distributions, Williams receives more cash.\u00a0And through William's significant ownership position in PZ, Williams will enjoy the value benefit of growth in PZ's unit price. ", "Slide nine please; our guidance is unchanged, but just as a reminder, as you can see here, we expect that earnings growth will continue in a very strong fashion and yes, improving energy commodity prices do play a role in that earnings growth through 2011, but as you can see in these arrows in the lower left hand corner, we expect our earnings growth to be significantly greater than the improvement in commodity prices during that period. The green arrow shows 99% growth in our adjusted earnings per share from 2009 to 2011 and we don't need $100 oil, we don't need $10 gas in order to get there. You can see what assumptions that we're making with respect to crude oil prices and natural gas prices during the period and importantly the midpoint of our guidance range for 2011 moves us close to the record high earnings that we produced in 2008. ", "So, clearly we're investing today in future growth. We have projects coming online this year and in the future that we expect to make significant contributions to our earnings growth. ", "Slide ten, please. Here we take a look at what the 2009, 2011 growth looks like from a segment profit standpoint and overall we're expecting the increase our total recurring adjusted segment profit by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2011. We expect to see a greater than 100% growth in our E&P segment profit based on higher commodity prices and by 2011 increased production volumes, and in the WPZ and other course we're expecting increases there associated with the many growth projects that we're investing in over that time period. ", "Slide 11, this slide shows the maintenance capital and growth capital for WPZ and E&P. This is a good reminder of the clear path that we have to our earnings growth. We're investing in excess of $3 billion in growth projects during 2010 and 2011 and I would remind you we're making investments with a continuing commitment to live within our means.", "Slide 12, I am not going to spend much time on this slide. This type of slide is appreciated by investors as simply shows the specifics on some of the growth projects and growth CapEx that we'll be spending in 2010 and 2011 on WPZ and on E&P projects. You might be surprised when you see a fairly large number that shows up under the other category and I would just remind you that much of that capital is tied to the Canadian NGL pipeline which is a new 12 inch pipeline project that will transport NGLs and olefins from our extraction plant in Fort McMurry to our Redwater processing facility. It's expected that we'll be spending somewhere between $275 and $300 million on that project, constructed using cash previously generated from our Canadian operations or other international projects and the construction is expected to begin in November of 2010 with an anticipated in-service date in the second quarter of 2012.", "Slide 13, the next few slides offer detailed comments on growth projects within all three of our business units, and I'll start with some comments on E&P and certainly in the E&P space most of our capital, most of our growth will be focused in the Piceance space, and so it's always worthwhile to emphasize the value creating strength of our Piceance space and strategy. Clearly, this is a world class resource. The drilling economics are Shale play strong. ", "I've got my next slide talks a little bit about the typical well economics for a Valley well and just to foreshadow for you, the returns that we're looking at after tax returns based on current prices, current costs and the current basis differential. We're looking at after tax returns in the 53% range. So clearly, this is a world class resource that has drilling economics that match those that people are talking about in the various Shale plays as well our cost are low. We have a track record of high returns. We enjoy that benefits of scale. You know that there is extensive infrastructure in place including our own gathering, processing and pipeline assets and compare that please to the extensive investment that's still needed in some of those new Shale plays. ", "So we expect to grow production. Our capital guidance numbers deliver about 12% production growth in 2011, but as the last bullet mentions, we are poised as we check sign posts along the way along the way, as we see what futures prices are doing and as we get through the heating season, we are poised to begin to accelerate our drilling activities by mid year and such an acceleration could if we decide to proceeded with that, could increase our production growth to back to the 20% range by 2011. You know we've been at that rate in the past and I think this demonstrates our ability to ramp up quickly if the commodity prices are attractive. ", "I mentioned earlier next slide 14 is an update of our typical well economics for Piceance Valley well. I think we talked about this during our May call and just to compare the numbers, our net cash to margin back when we talked about this in May was $2.60, our after tax IRRs were 28% and you can see we now are looking at a net cash margin of $3.45, after tax returns north of 50% and it is simply a case of higher prices, lower basis differential translating into higher returns for a typical well in the Piceance Valley.", "Slide 15 please. This just highlights some of the strategic growth projects in the midstream space. Obviously we are very excited about expanding our footprint in the Marcellus. Of course, we did the Laurel Mountain JV in 2009. We have expanded upon that with what we are calling the Springville Project which I described earlier which expands our business in the Marcellus has us building a 28 mile natural gas gathering pipeline from a central delivery point in Susquehanna County Pa to Transco in Luzerne County, Pa, a 20-inch pipeline which is expected be placed into service in 2011. Other major PZ projects, Perdido Norte we are expecting to begin contributing to segment profit in mid 2010. Wamsutter TXP4, we expect to bring in additional 350 million a day of processing capacity onstream at our Echo Springs plant in late 2010, and the Willow Creek will be enjoying a full year of operations at Willow Creek. We achieved full processing operations in September of 2009 and are currently recovering up to 20,000 barrels of NGLs at that facility.", "Slide 16 please, gives a quick overview of all of the projects that we have in the gas pipeline space. We continue to receive long-term customer support to expand our footprint, along Transco, along North West pipeline and along Gulfstream. I would remind you the blue box projects are in guidance, the grey box projects are not in guidance and some of the more significant projects noted here are the 85 North Expansion is a $240 million expansion from Station 85 North to zones four and five adding over $300 million a day of capacity, that will be a two phase project going into service in mid 2010 and mid 2011.", "We have the Rockaway Lateral which is $120 million Lateral into National Grid's Distribution System in New York. The Mid-South project, a $195 million expansion from Station 85 to points North. So a lot of exciting projects and again all of these are backed by a long-term customer support.", "I am going to pause here for a minute in terms of my slides and go through some Q&A we did last time and deemed to play well, but we have been getting some questions from investors and some of the common themes of those questions I might cover right now, there have been a lot of questions on drilling cost on the Piceance side. We had the ability to lock-in any of the costs and as I am sure you are well aware of the cost for drilling and completion came down in 2009 and we have made efforts to try to contain future increases for 2010 and some of the success that we've had, we have locked in day rate costs for all of our rigs through 2010 in the $16,000 to $17000 per day range and I would remind you that about $2000 to $4000 a day lower than the average rates in 2009.", "Pumping service costs for cement and stimulation are also under price agreements through 2010. Other key service costs such as mud, water handling, rentals, construction, these are all looking to stay flat with 2009 based on discussions with many of our vendors, probably the only area where we are seeing some upward price pressure is on steel costs. We have also had a lot of questions about midstream economics with people who have recognized that economics are very strong right now and they have been asking what's outlook for the future and so you are absolutely correct.", "Our realized margin has risen from a three year low of less than $0.20 in the first quarter of 2009 to more than $0.50 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and given the current market and our assumptions about commodity relationships, the 2010 and 2011 margin should easily surpass what was achieved on average for all of 2009 and could even exceed the high point that we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "We also continue to be very pleased and optimistic regarding demand for our NGLs and the resulting NGL margins. Ethane demand in the US pet-chem industry averaged in excess of 900,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2009 and this is a new record high for demand on a quarterly average basis. We continue to expect to see demand stay high as the global oiled gas relationships continue to place the US pet-chem industry in a very competitive position globally as well as the continued conversion to a more light-end feedstock slate. ", "NGL inventories continue to get worked off as the combination of gas plant production and other sources are not able to keep up with demand, and so this inventory work-off will continue to put strength around our NGL pricing complex as has been recently exhibited in the NGL to oil ratio which is now exceeding 60% on a composite basis versus a year ago's quarterly average of about 55%. ", "So let me turn now to our concluding slide I think its slide 17. This shows just the key takeaways around the theme that Williams is a winning long term investment. Certainly as we have gone through the slide deck here, I hope you believe that we have a wealth of value creating growth opportunities which lead to the sustained growth ahead as reflected in our 2010 and 2011 guidance. The transformational transaction will clearly help fuel that growth. The integrated businesses, the integrated model I believe gives us a competitive advantage particularly as we intend to increase our footprint in the Marcellus. I believe that we are able to offer producer, customers a more comprehensive midstream pipeline in gas marketing solution to their service needs. ", "The Piceance basin is a world-class resource continues to performance very positively and I think I would refer you back to the very attractive value returns that are reflective on that slide. ", "We are committed to financial discipline as we grow. We've achieved investment grade ratings, we intend to keep those ratings and I think the final point we expect 2011 earnings per share to be double our 2009 performance. ", "So with that, we will be delighted to take your question. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. ", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "", "Ralph can you talk through what basins were most affected by each of the respective price related and five year SEC development reserve revisions? And Steve can you kind of put more flesh on the bone regarding what kind of price points you're looking at before you start to decide to press harder on the gas pedal for E&P production? ", "Ralph Hill", "This is Ralph, on the price side really it's proportional to the amount of reserves we have in the various areas. So on the 336 Bcf of price revision, first of all, about a 100 or so Bcf of that was just a tail reserves that would come off to become economic based on the lower price way out in the future. We obviously believe those will come back but proportionally most of our reserves are in the Valley and the Highlands so thus on a proportional basis, they came out of the Valley and the Highlands. ", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "Okay and five year development?", "Ralph Hill", "Five year was interesting. Really the way that works is about 80% of that was in the Highlands and the way that truly works is, its very complicated but in the past basically it was in our drilling program, it basically counted as approved and developed and we were able to count that. Not if it's in the drilling program but it might be a probable location because we haven't taken advantage yet of the Highlands and the one-off rule. We were only able to book the [part] side of that world. So most of that was in the Highlands and the interesting thing about the Highlands as we increased our drilling program which were in the process of drilling went from one rig last year, we're going to be at four. In August as Steve mentioned, we may pull the trigger and do some more.", "As we prove out more in that field and actually what we call triangulate some of these areas, the one-off rule could be a very big thing for us in Highlands since we have over five Tcf of problem possible in the area. So we look for that one-off rule to be a tremendous advantage for us in this five year limit to be a one-time disadvantage and we look forward to the opportunity to continue to drill, delineate the rest of that field, triangulate around that areas where we can call more than one offset and really take advantage of over 5 Tcf of problems and possibles. ", "And in terms of the second part of your question, what kind of price points we're looking for. I mean there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty with respect to where prices are headed. We've been delighted by the winter, we have been delighted by the fact that storage inventories have been pulled down, but there remains uncertainty. I think people are trying to figure out the EIA supply data, trying to understand to what extent we have seen deliverability reductions, but I think the short answer would be if we get through the heating season and futures prices continue to be strong, particularly strong to the point where we are still able to capture the kinds of well economics that are shown for a typical Piceance Valley well, I think that under those circumstances we would want to accelerate our drilling activities in the Piceance.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "While your guidance for 2011 assumes 650 still or somewhere around may be a 612 strip right now, if you are given the profitability in the Piceance if you are still north of $6, after the withdrawal season here, would you still feel like it's $6 plus, there is no reason to hold back?", "Steve Malcolm", "", "Yes I think the short answer is yes if we are still looking at that futures price is north of $6 given the kinds of returns that we are seeing in the valley I think that we would want to accelerate our activities.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes form Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "If I could ask a couple of questions, first on the Midstream segment, I noticed that the NGL equity sales volumes were down sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter and it looks like a lot of those volumes were in the Gulf Coast region, could you guys talk about what was going on over there?", "Steve Malcolm", "If you are looking at just the fourth quarter to fourth quarter?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "From third quarter '09 to fourth quarter '09?", "Steve Malcolm", "We had a couple of issues one, we have a contract in the Mobile Bay area there with Exxon and Shell. Shell had a quite bit of work that went on, on one of their plants and Exxon had the right to have monthly right once a year to be able to elect out their liquids and take their liquids and take their liquids and so that's one of the primary drivers on that drop there in the fourth quarter. ", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Should we see those volumes bounce back in the first quarter, is that fair?", "Steve Malcolm", "That's correct.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "I guess in your data book that you guys put out, looks like you have GP distributions from WPZ to the seed corporation of about $140 million, is that a change from what you guys have put out in your January 19 restructuring presentation?", "Don Chappel", "That's consistent with that and that's the cash portion from a net income standpoint, we earn somewhat more, but with the coverage ratios and all those numbers on the slides there are cash numbers, but that's consistent with what we put out before.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "On the E&P side, the higher DD&A expense in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, it looks it's ticking up. Is there something going over there or should we continue to see DD&A kind of go up through the year?", "Steve Malcolm", "If you are talking about the rate, it is just a function of the capital investment over the last couple of years. So, it is going up slightly as we continue on.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "I also want to make sure I understood the last answer of the last question on the revisions related to the five-year limit. So, 80% of that was in the Highlands area and that was because of lower drilling activity last year in the Highlands, is that fair?", "Steve Malcolm", "It's one way to look at it, because of lower drilling activity, we weren't able to really take advantage of what we did in the valley and the one-off rule, so essentially when you look at it, under the new rules, it's your historical conversion rate, I can go on and on but yes, I would say when we get back in the field which we are, and start drilling more and as prices improve which they have, I expect to see very positive results, assuming prices stay where they are and assuming also that we get back in the field which we are already in the process of doing.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "The CapEx guidance for 2011 for E&P is pretty wide, $1.3 billion to $2.1 billion, what does that large bandwidth sort of contemplate?", "Steve Malcolm", "You are talking 2011?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Yes ", "Steve Malcolm", "It's essentially the opportunities that Steve talked about, we already are moving from about 12 rigs in the entire Piceance complex area in 2010, the plan in 2011 is to go to 22 and we have the opportunity to do more so that's why the range is so wide plus there is some of the other new things we are looking at, could possibly play into that, so we are just giving it a wider range to what we hope we have succeed during this year", "Don Chappel", "We have a fairly wide range on commodity price. I think the market is fairly close to our mid-point. So that's I think the best way to think about it, but if prices were very low, we would restrain our drilling activity, if prices were exceptionally high, we might put more capital, even more capital to work in E&P, than we would at something close to current market prices.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Mark Caruso with Millennium Partners ", "Mark Caruso - Millennium Partners", "", "Just a few follow-up questions or a clarification actually. The first question is, could you give the capacity on the new Marcellus pipe. I know you are saying mid 2011, but I didn't hear a capacity on how large that pipe could be.", "Phil Wright", "", "That will be a little over 350 million a day of capacity.", "Mark Caruso - Millennium Partners", "350 a day and is that a 100% contract with Cabot or is there still opportunity for you to equity volumes or more third party volumes?", "Phil Wright", "There is some additional space. We have got the ability to expand that pipeline beyond the Cabot piece there initially.", "Mark Caruso - Millennium Partners", "And then on the guidance side, it looks like if I do the math right midstream fracs on a gallon basis are higher than guidance but you guys didn't increase guidance for 2010. I didn't know if gave a little more color around that. Or there is a range of 27 I guess on midstream?", "Phil Wright", "On midstream, well certainly if you look a the current markets, the current markets are certainly exceeding those guidance numbers that we've got in there as we head in the first part of the year. However if you look in any of the forward market that certainly is not supported above that and so we want to see what happens when we get through the first quarter. Here I will say that the fundamentals as Steve mentioned, the fundamentals are probably better right now than they have been in a long time and give of some optimism just looking at storage volumes in the way we are continue the Q through some of the light end production and storage right now, so we're hopeful that we will be able to do that but a little early to call it at this point.", "Mark Caruso - Millennium Partners", "Okay and then just one last question looking at the 2011 numbers. It looks like E&P went up but overall didn't change. Is that just a matter of when I was looking at the slides getting lost in the consolidation, given the fact that you're now own 80% how it consolidates up?", "Don Chappel", "Yes I think that was just a bit of refining in our guidance, we didn't think the changes were sufficient to warrant any overall change. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jessica Chipman with Tudor, Pickering & Holt.", "Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering & Holt", "I have a question related to Marcellus. I know that you guys are in the beginning stages there. My question is whether I can get a little more color going to 2010? I think that as of last update you had one rig running per year, Rex, JV and the Marcellus. And since then you have also added about 6000 net acres outside of that JV if I understand that correctly. My question is, if you wouldn't mind giving us a little color on where that acreage was added. Is that around in the current footprint? Are you looking at areas outside of those counties and also how you plan on allocating capital in the Marcellus? Do you plan on drilling on that acreage outside of the JV or at least take first via Rex JV?", "Ralph Hill", "Well, the acreage we acquired some of it is in the around the Rex deal and other acreage is up primarily in the North East areas some of the more active counties that you've seen the Susquehanna side of the world and surrounding counties. We actually have a large by- area that we have both starting from the North East side going down to the South West side. So, we're actively prospecting in the really the entire play. ", "We currently have as we've just now taken our operations just the one rig that we will be operating I believe Rex will be operating on another part of rig or two. I think they'll give their update in a couple of days. So, our plan is going forward allocating capital would be, we will continue in the Rex area and we also would like to at some point add another rig into our new acreage and also, we would hope that we have some other successful deals concluded in other parts of the play.", "", "Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering & Holt", "Okay, and if you do a rig outside of that acreage in your JVs, will you press release the results or will you wait an update quarterly for the Marcellus?", "Ralph Hill", "We haven't really thought about that, we'll not want to ever beat the drum on an initial production that comes out of a well but we will probably, after we fill the wells in good shape, then we will probably give updates as needed at least quarterly but we may do it more often.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Yves Siegel with Credit Suisse.", "Yves Siegel - Credit Suisse", "Couple of questions, one, Alan as it relates to processing margins being so good right now, how does that figure in your decision to perhaps hedge or not hedge?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well we certainly feel like the forward market right now on NGLs, if you went out and tried to hedge right now, we think is really over saturated with sellers largely I suspect driven by MLPs that don't have enough fee based business to produce the volatility in the kind of situation where they are having to go in and re-up those hedges and so there is just tremendous pressure on the self side in that forward market. And really the only buyers appear to be in that, appear to be the banks and so we just look at the value to spread between gas to crude going forward versus the gas the NGLs, it's a dramatic decline in fact forward market on crude, the NGLs is declining about 15% when even with crude in Contango, so we really feel like there is not much value right now in that forward-looking hedge. We certainly continue to look for opportunities there, but as it appears right now, it is more of a buyers market than a sellers in that forward market.", "Yves Siegel - Credit Suisse", "", "Philosophically have you laid out any new guidelines in terms of how you want to approach hedging?", "Alan Armstrong", "No we really haven't, we continue to look at that on an opportunistic basis and if we think the market is a fair reflection of the forward value and we need to reduce volatility, then we will certainly act whenever we see those opportunities, but we haven't laid our any new philosophy on that.", "Don Chappel", "I would just add that again we have a very strong balance sheet at WPZ, we have a strong coverage ratio and we think we have strength to weather that volatility. Despite the fact we love to hedge more, but nonetheless I think as Alan points out, we are unwilling to give up a great deal of value because we don't need to, so we will be more opportunistic in terms of taking risk off the table. ", "Yves Siegel - Credit Suisse", "If we just turn back to the Marcellus number one, can you disclose how much of the pipeline will cost? Then number two, could you also talk about how you see gas flows going forward? I am talking about the dry gas that gets into Transco, is that going to be staying up in the east or do you think you might see a backhaul and then thirdly, have you given thought perhaps to the liquids in the Marcellus in terms of perhaps coming up with a solution, either going up to Canada of going down to Mount Bellevue?", "", "Alan Armstrong", "Don't get me started on that third one, that third one has a lot of opportunity around it and certainly an issue in need of a solution right now that we are working hard. On the first matter, no use for competitive reasons we are not releasing that capital investment just for transparency sake on that and secondly on the question of volumes back on, certainly let Phil speak to his perspective on Transco on that I can tell you from our advantage point, that it's pretty early. There is not near as much production as there is talk of production just yet and so certainly I think it has the potential but we are [ways] from that and I let Phil speak what he is seeing. ", "Phil Wright", "This is Phil. I agree totally with Alan, I would say that the opportunities to do backhauls are clearly there and we have customers interested in backhauls and we have been doing it for a long time on Transco for instance. Customers in the southeast region have benefited from taking gas from Cove Point via the Leidy Hub into the Transco system and down for a long, long time. And so to the extent that volumes in the Marcellus ramp up and we have customers throughout the Transco system that through displacement want to do backhauls and like we can accommodate that very nicely.", "Operator", "We will go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets", "Ralph, you were mentioning that we are hopeful we are going to see some things shake loose here. I was wondering if you could comment on, we just had Anadarko which looked like a pretty good price for some of its acreage, are you seeing the land value is kind of continuing to heat up to the point where you know beyond you guys might be working on today, there will be further opportunities from sort of an acquisition side or are we kind of shifting back to more sort of a slower boot strapping approach, again like we saw in this last quarter where we will just kind of see the earnings release and every quarter we might be adding 5000 acres of quarter so to speak?", "Ralph Hill", "I would say that obviously as Steve mentioned we are going to very disciplined in what we do, but we are looking at it really from the grassroots leasing side, the joint venture side and obviously again in a very disciplined manner there are number of big players, small players, medium-sized players up there, so we are also looking at from the A&D side. So I think from an E&P perspective we are going to continue to look at it from all three of those angles and hopefully through a disciplined manner, you see some good growth there.", "I do think that we do bring to the table as Steve mentioned a very strong William story to the Marcellus. If you think about it, obviously E&P expertise that we have, our midstream expertise and the need, a desperate need for some midstream solutions up there. Transco runs right through the heart of the play and then our gas marketing people have been very successful in helping out in some of the ventures we have going and actually taking the producers staff and market it for them.", "So we are looking at it from E&P, from a three-pronged approach, that really Williams is looking at from a four-prong approach, so we think we have a great Marcellus story and we are getting a lot of good feedback on it and a lot of good meetings held, so hopefully we will see some success with those conversations we are having", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets", "Where are we on the latest with respect to the Paradox?", "Ralph Hill", "", "On the Paradox we continue to be encouraged, I know [Baird] has their comps gone a couple of days, so we're encouraged with the thirteen H wells we caught that we've been monitoring for quite a while. I think Joe is actually going to give some decline curves and some tight curves around that. What we're really looking forward to is the ability to repeat that in that area and also in the area of extent of repeating that. So as we continue to work with them we hope to, if we remain encouraged which we are, probably drill at least a couple of wells continuing to delineate and see if there is an opportunity to find that area of extent of the play and see if it works like it is in that [costly] area so we're cautiously optimistic and looking forward to hopefully drill in a couple more wells and give you some more tests in some more areas defined out there.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to Andrew Gundlach with ASB.", "Andrew Gundlach - ASB", "I have a question on the Piceance Highlands and Valley, on the economics that you put in the data book I don't know if this is for Ralph or for Steve but I understand the difference in the drill and complete what I don't fully understand and which leads to a lower but now insignificant IRR is the location difference and differential and transport differences between the two areas and also the working interest. Could you just put a little light on that?", "Ralph Hill", "", "Yes on the working interest, what we have done is we have blended the various areas up there. For example we own on the trail ridge area we basically own all of that and the Ryan Gulch area we own 51% and (inaudible) owns 49% so that blends the working interest and this year we are drilling about two third Ryan Gulch and one third trail ridge out there. On the differential side, location and differentials, it's all in the liquid value basically. It's included between the two and the amount of reserves differentials, essentially the Highlands area has a little deeper formation that we're also tapping into a little thicker columns so a little bit more reserves in the Highlands area.", "Andrew Gundlach - ASB", "I see and what explains geologically or reservoir wise the much higher IP rates in the Highlands?", "Ralph Hill", "Yes, in the Highlands its again it's a thicker column. It's the ability to tap into a little deeper formation also then just the (inaudible). ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jonathan Lefebvre with Wells Fargo.", "Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo", "Thanks guys. Most of my questions have been answered. ", "Operator", "Or if you have any other questions?", "Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo", "I do not. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Okay. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "Two questions, one for Alan following up on Mark's question on the new Marcellus gathering line. Is the 350, is that all for catheter or do you guys have some volumes on that as well?", "Alan Armstrong", "No. it is not all for catheter. We do have some remaining space on that. ", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "Can you break that out for us?", "Alan Armstrong", "No. We're not disclosing that detail.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "Okay and then I guess follow-up for Ralph. 4Q volumes a lot better than our expectations considering kind of the pull back in capital during the year. It looks like you got a bump in the Powder River and the San Juan. Can you provide a little color there for the Q and then thoughts kind of moving into '10?", "Ralph Hill ", "Well, for the quarter basically, the Powder is just always a function of the dewatering side of the world and we had benefits from that. San Juan is just we actually did some additional drilling there that we haven't done before and under format. So just some good surprises, they are not surprises but just good timing of those things coming on. For 2010 essentially the plan and the guidance you've seen so far as it just basically shows like flat production for '10 and then growing to about 11% to 12% in '11 and that goes into what Steve talks about that to the extent we get back in the field earlier. We obviously plan to have a go from 12 to 22 rigs for example in the Piceance from 2010 to 2011 and you see that kind of growth as we come out with good strong prices. One of the goals would be to get into the field quicker than we are right now and since start adding rigs earlier than what the current plan has. So if we do that then we can have stronger production growth.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "Okay, do you have an exit rate for the year you can share?", "Ralph Hill ", "I don't have that in front of me. I think we can share that I'll just need to get that to you and if can give it out, (inaudible). ", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Todd Godfrey with UBS.", "Todd Godfrey - UBS", "Could you just give us pro forma corporate debt and corporate cash position and postal transaction last night? Thank you.", "Don Chappel", "Pro forma corporate debt $2.3 billion cash position was $1.2 billion before closing the transaction, now draw our cash a little bit on a pre-tax basis and that will take the tax deduction and throughout the year and which would get the free tax cash back by the end of the year. So, does that help?", "Operator", "And with no questions remaining I'd like to turn the call over to your speakers for any additional or closing remark.", "Steve Malcolm", "", "Yeah this is Steve. I would just say that the transformational transaction that we completed yesterday really puts us in good shape to capture all of the growth opportunities that we've spoken about today. We also believe that the Marcellus represents a wonderful opportunity for us and the integrated model is really working well for us there. And then the Piceance is a world class asset and it is every bit as good as any of the Shale plays out there.

Good morning everybody. Welcome to our first quarter call and as always thanks for your interest in the company. Steve Malcolm will be doing the presentation then we will review the few slides that we have. Be aware though, that all of our business unit heads are here and available for questions that will take right after Steve's comments. Also as usual, we've put together our data book which includes the normal information we provide each quarter. So, this morning, on the website williams.com, you should be able to find the slides, the data book, the press releases and the 10-Q, which was filed this morning as well. ", "At the beginning of the slide deck is the forward-looking statements on slide number two and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on slide number three. Those are important and integral to our remarks this morning, so please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers which have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation.", "As I suspect the call today should be rather brief because as you know we will be hosting the Analyst day in New York next Tuesday. At that time, all of our senior management will be there to go into a much more robust look at each of our businesses. ", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.", "Steve Malcolm", "Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our first quarter call. Thank you for your interest in our company, and as Travis mentioned our discussion today should be very crisp as we are looking forward to our analyst and investor day next week in New York, and at that we will be talking more about strategies and tactics and the various growth opportunities at that meeting. ", "So, this would be pretty quick, so looking at the first slide, slide four. A few of our first quarter results and accomplishments of course, first quarter recurring adjusted earnings per share is $0.36, which is up 64% over the first quarter of '09 results as well recurring segment profit of $589 million; it's 43% higher than our ' 09, first quarter. ", "We increased our quarterly dividend by 14%. Of course, we completed our transformational transaction, which created a much larger WPZ. We've grown our position to Marcellus by adding another 11,000 acres in Columbia County, Pennsylvania, which brings our total acreage position in the Marcellus to above 45,000 acreage at a weighted average cost of about $2800 per acre. ", "Began startup operations at Perdido Norte in the Western deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and I believe on Monday of this week we brought Transco's Mobile South expansion project into service adding deliverability to Southern markets. ", "Turning to slide five, we are offering guidance for 2012 for the first time, but this shows that we are all about returning to significant value creation. Let me go through the prior guidance here. In 2010, our prior guidance mid-point was $1.35 you see here were to $1.28, and that's driven by obviously changes in our commodity price assumptions. ", "Crude oil from $75 to $80, but Henry Hub nat gas from $575 to $450, and so that creates the change that we're reflecting here. As well, in 2011, $1.83 versus $1.87, driven by an increase in crude oil prices from $80 to $86, but nat gas going from $650 to $550. ", "And then we're showing for the first time again, mid-point guidance for 2012 of $2.38, that all represents about a 36% CAGR with respect to our earnings per share. Slide six, please, shows the higher segment profit growth and shows the relative contributions by WPZ and our E&P business. ", "And overall, you see a 78% increase in total recurring adjusted segment profit over this period of time. Slide seven, we've talked about our many growth opportunities, and as you see here, we're expecting to invest over $5 billion in growth in the 2010, 2012 timeframe. This slide is one that the investors are appreciative of, in that we do break out our capital by business unit and by category -- capital for maintenance of facilities, capital for maintenance of volumes and growth projects. ", "So, obviously, a lot of wonderful, exciting growth opportunities during this three year timeframe. Slide eight just gives you -- reminds you of our premier E&P portfolio, anchored by our position in the Piceance. And we are a proven optimizer of resource plays; year-after-year, a leader in terms of costs. We believe that the Piceance is competitive with the best of the Shale plays. ", "And I think we have a unique portfolio that allows us to ramp-up or ramp-down, depending on the price signals that the market is offering. Slide nine; if you look at all three of our business units, probably there are more growth opportunities in the midstream space. And again, we'll talk more about these in New York next week, but looking at this map, we have the growth opportunities in our traditional basins. ", "Out West, we have Wamsutter TXP4 or Echo Springs TXP4, adding about 350 million a day of processing capacity, which will come on in late 2010. We have the Paradox Basin, where we continue to build toward a large scale midstream solution for producers in this promising basin. And then we're looking forward to a full year benefit of the Willow Creek facility, which is a course of 450 cubic foot per day processing facility. ", "In the Gulf, Perdido Norte went into operation in late first quarter 2010, and so we'll be getting the benefit of that project. Probably the most exciting opportunities are in the Marcellus, and there we -- of course, done the Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC. We've done the Springville project, but we just have a lot more opportunities, as producers seek to focus their resources on their E&P activities and in many cases, they are looking to outsource some of their midstream requirements. ", "Slide 10 just gives you the universe of gas pipeline projects, and there are a lot of base hits here, obviously, and the outlook is excellent for steady, stable cash flows backed by customers with high quality credit. So, this is a business where you won't see us taking big risks, but all of these projects are backed by our customers. Before I conclude, let me cover a couple of questions that we have received from investors over the last couple of weeks. ", "One relates to the Gulf of Mexico situation. Are we faced with any potential exposure to the efforts to clean up the oil slick? Is our production impacted in any way? And the simple answer is no. Our assets have not been affected by loss of production, have not been affected by the spill, have not been affected by any of the cleanup activities, and we have no reason to believe that they will. ", "The BP platform was the drilling platform that was not connected to any infrastructure. We don't anticipate any problems related to the spill. We did limit work on Canyon Station just as a precaution, but again, we don't see any impact to our operations in the Gulf. As well, there have been questions about the WMC Exchange Offer, any updates there on timing? ", "And I would just say, again, that representatives of Williams and WPZ have commenced discussions with representatives of the Conflicts Committee, of the Board of Directors of the WMZ general partner regarding the exchange offer at the ratio that was discussed earlier. And the parties are considering structural alternatives for completion of the exchange in a single transaction, including without limitation, a potential merger transaction. ", "So, we're still moving ahead. We would expect a second quarter kind of close. It could slip into third quarter, but I think it will still be done on the basis that we've essentially described to you in the past. Concluding then on slide 11, we do believe that Williams is a winning value creator, and I think the key points for you to have in mind -- we've never seen as many growth opportunities that we are seeing today. Those will clearly generate value for the Company. ", "And I think the fact that we have gone forward with the structural transformation that we closed earlier in the first quarter will ensure that we're able to capture these many growth opportunities. The integrated business model is working well for us. The Piceance Basin, where our production is over 600 million a day, is a world class resource, as good as any of the Shale plays. We are committed to going forward in a very disciplined manner, and a strong growth outlook, and we expect 2012 recurring adjusted earnings per share to exceed our record 2008 results. ", "So with that, we look forward to seeing you next week and I'll be happy to take any questions that you have this morning.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). First is Steven Maresca of Morgan Stanley.", "Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley ", "First question, you talked about production levels that you think will ramp-up throughout the rest of the year, and the first quarter was about 1.1 in the U.S. Bcf a day. Are you -- can you talk about all where you are right now, and then in the second quarter have you started that ramp-up and are you above that level?", "Ralph Hill", "This is Ralph Hill. Yes, we have started it up. Let me just go through our volumes just for a minute to take advantage of that question. We did drop last year from 28 rigs in the Piceance down to about as low as seven. We're currently at about eight in the Valley and two in the Highlands, and we'll add a few rigs in both those areas during the course of the year. We also deferred about 70 completions in the Valley, and those things are all starting to be completed now. ", "We've got a few more -- a couple more rigs running, so we do expect and we have seen our volumes are starting to turn back to where we'll be essentially for the year, will be flat with 2009 volumes. So, we do see that come out, and so we're right on plan, right where we thought we'd be, and the volumes are starting to turn back around a little bit.", "Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay. As a follow-up to that, you guys obviously added some acreage in the Marcellus. What is your ultimate goal in the area over the next year or two?", "Ralph Hill", "Well, we like the area, as Steve mentioned. We now are about 45,000 acres. We'd like that position to continue to grow. I think a meaningful position would be about double that at some point. Again, we'll be disciplined, but we see good opportunities. We've been able to grow our -- double the position we started out with, which was the 22,000 acres with Rex. And we would like to continue to grow our position and we'll continue to work towards that in a disciplined manner.", "Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay and final quick question. I see that you guys in the NGL to Crude Relationship and your forecast kind of tails off a little bit. Is there a reason you're thinking that we'll see a weakening of that relationship?", "Steve Malcolm", "Really that's just driven by continued strength in crude oil to natural gas, and so we're not predicting that bigger change really in the gas to NGL ratio; so basically, our margins are held fairly flat on a pure gas to NGL relationship. We did have very strong ethane demand going into the first quarter, and that was subsided a little bit as there were some ethylene crackers being out towards the end of the first quarter. So that's tapered demand. We've certainly seen ethane fall off a little bit in terms of how strong ratio was earlier in the first quarter.", "Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay. Thanks a lot and look forward to seeing you next week.", "Operator", "Our next question today comes from Carl Kirst, BMO Capital.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital ", "Actually, if I could, Ralph, just piggyback off the Marcellus. The 11,000 acres that were acquired, are you basically building out separate from your Rex position but near the Rex acreage, or you going off in a different area? Can you give us some color as to where you're looking? 2800?", "Ralph Hill", "We're doing both. We have added what's called bolt-ons, and those clear fields, Westmoreland, and Center Counties, which is where Rex is. We've also picked up some acreage in Columbia County now and got some acreage in Bradford and Susquehanna. So we're kind of -- we're staying in the Northeastern part, from the middle to the Northeastern part at this point, but adding to our position around the Rex Basin, and we're seeing other areas we like and trying to get sizable blocks that we can drill in efficient manners.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital ", "And then this is sort of a combination question for both Ralph and Alan. Just as far as we look at the Shale map and we look at the opportunity, just noting that the Eagle Ford is not on that list and then maybe we will talk more about it next week, maybe but is that something that we should be keeping as perhaps optionality of where you guys might go? What is right now what you're seeing in the Marcellus and the deal flow that you're a part of right now is basically too compelling to look elsewhere. ", "Ralph Hill", "Well, from the E&P perspective we do like the Eagle Ford. We've looked at in a number of opportunities there and continued to do that. So, w will obviously if we can put something there that makes good economic sense. We'd like to be there. ", "Alan Armstrong", "On the midstream side, we've got a real opportunity there right now with our Markham that we just completed the expansion on, and we have frac capacity, transport capacity out of that plant as well. So, pretty rare situation there what we've got available capacity that we basically would just be pushing out some very lean offshore volumes that are coming into Markham today, and that so we would have space available for the Eagle Ford and we're working with other pipeline including Transco to see what other capabilities are there to get that gas transported and accessed through the Eagle Ford. So, the McMullen lateral that Transco has is very well positioned right along there, and so we think we got some great opportunities and some competitive advantage there in that base. ", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital ", "Great and maybe last question if I could really fulfill on the pipeline side. As we look at the range of the EBIT guidance if you will, can you help me better get a sense of what's going to push pipelines to the higher or to the lower end of the range. Is it specific regional bases? Is it interruptible volumes? Is it just simply price of gas on retained fuel?", "Phillip Wright ", "Carl, this is Phill. You kind of put out there on the table the range of some things that are possible, but I would take off the table the variability on like basis differentials and interruptible because on the down side, about the only spot we have that's vulnerable to that is in the production area on Transco under the IT Feed rate. And we've got a pretty healthy decline baked into our forecast on the interruptible in that end, but it's only a modest piece of the total cost of service on Transco. ", "Just for round numbers, in the ballpark of $60 million, $66 million. So it's not a huge part of the cost to service on Transco. On the upside, it will be a successful completion of growth projects, and so we'll have expansions that will bump that up along the way. And then we're always seeking opportunities to achieve better outcomes on our costs. But we'll just have to take a look at that. We have to come back in for rate cases in 2013 on both Northwest and Transco. We have come back provisions on both of those.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital ", "Thanks for the color, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question today comes from Ted Durbin, Goldman Sachs.", "Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs ", "I just had a question -- first question is on the dividend and just thinking about cash. The shareholders get a pretty big dividend hike in percentage terms, maybe not in dollar terms, but maybe just walk through how you're thinking about your payout ratio and generally returning cash to shareholders?", "Don Chappel ", "This is Don Chappel. Good morning. Well, as you know, we did not increase the dividend in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis and recession. Following the WPZ transformation, and the very stable business and the growth that we enjoy from WPZ and the growing distribution, we felt that an increase in the dividend was appropriate, and we thought at a level that was exceeding the level of increase that we passed on, back in the 2007, 2008 period. So that's how we're thinking about it. ", "I think it will be a function of those reliable cash flows coming up from WPZ as well as alternative uses of cash. But I do believe Steve and the Board also agree that dividend is an important part of the total picture for our investors. So, I'm not sure if that helps. We don't have a formula, but we are committed to the dividend and increasing the dividend over time.", "Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs ", "Now it's helpful. And then if I could just come back to the E&P side, you raised the mid-point of the CapEx guidance. Can you just give us a little more detail on what's behind that and just the moving pieces there?", "Steve Malcolm", "Yes, essentially it was just some of the lease acquisitions that we've done and exploration opportunities we're doing. And we're going to break that out next week to show that the base development side -- base development drilling is about the same as we were. It's just we've in guidance now; we're putting in some additional CapEx that we anticipate we will spend on new opportunities.", "Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs ", "That's helpful. ", "Operator", "Holly Stewart at Howard Weil has the next question.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "Just real quickly a macro question really, for Alan. Alan, we've seen a lot of producers, most recently, Chesapeake yesterday, talking about shifting quite a bit of their capital from gas toward liquids. What is your thought on this change, and just really as far as kind of the potential impact towards the liquids market?", "Alan Armstrong", "Right. Well, certainly, NGL margins are very beneficial to producers today and adding a lot of value. But I would certainly say in the case where they're going into new exploration areas like Chesapeake announced that that's a long ways away from actually producing NGLs into the market. And a lot of things will change over time by the time those NGLs get into the market. So, there's a lot of infrastructure. ", "The Marcellus is a great example of that, where a lot of rich gas, but we're a long ways away from having the infrastructure available to get those NGLs into the market. And so I think over time, I think if we continue to see high margins, we should continue to see NGL supplies increase. And on the heavier's end, I don't see that being a big problem because as long as crude to gas ratios remain where they are, that will still be a favored product in terms of and gasoline into those markets. ", "On the ethane side, we certainly would have to see some expansion in market. We're seeing that today through conversion of heavy and cracking capacity, but eventually, there's a limit to that. Our hope, obviously, would be that we see an opportunity to long-term to expand demand in the U.S. on the petchem side, if those NGLs continue to be such favored relative to naphtha and other products that are cracked globally. ", "So, certainly though, I would say the fundamentals are that we've got strong margins. We should expect supply to be chasing that margin, and I think that's what we'll see for some period of time.", "Operator", "Up next we'll hear from Faisel Khan, Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citi ", "If I'm looking at the -- Ralph, if I'm looking at the volumes in the Piceance sequentially from fourth quarter to first quarter, the drop-off seem a little bit steeper and I think you said you deferred 70 well completions. But can you talk a little bit about the steeper drop-off sequentially from fourth quarter to first quarter?", "Ralph Hill", "Yes. We did defer completions, but the fourth quarter versus the first quarter has a -- the fourth quarter had about $50 million of positive accounting adjustments in there, which really should have been spread out through the year, just normal adjustments that come through and they kind of were all lumped in the fourth quarter. ", "So, that volume should have been spread out flatter during the second, third, and fourth quarters. So if you smooth that out as it should have been, then we actually had a sequential decline of only about 2%. And that will be -- you'll see that catch up during the year. So the sequential decline looked like it was more about 11% or 8% to 11%, depending on which basin you're looking at. In reality, that was about a 2% decline.", "Faisel Khan - Citi ", "Okay, got you. And then I guess, if we're looking at your exploration project for this year versus the last two years, I mean, how would you compare this year's budget to the last couple of years? Would you consider it kind of more robust, the same? Or are you guys hunting a little bit more than you were in the past?", "Ralph Hill", "It's more robust. And it's -- and we also, in the past, we've just added as we've added deals, we put that into guidance. And this year, we're putting it into guidance before we're actually adding deals, just to let you know the flavor of what we think and anticipate we could spend.", "Faisel Khan - Citi ", "Okay, and then on a total kind of corporate sense, if you're looking at your strategic opportunities and you guys have a strong liquidity position, I know you said that you were going to be disciplined about how you allocate your capital, but is there a preference of where these dollars go, whether it's midstream or upstream? How are you guys looking at those sorts of opportunities right now?", "Don Chappel ", "Faisel, this is Don. We see WPZ to be self-funding; while Williams could make incremental investment in WPZ, it's more likely that the excess capital that we have would be pointed toward E&P or some other corporate use versus plowing it back into midstream or gas pipelines in light of the very advantaged sources of capital that the MLP space, WPZ enjoys.", "Faisel Khan - Citi ", "Okay, got you. I guess on that point, looking -- if you were to -- I was going through your data book, and I didn't see sort of a breakdown of what Williams C-Corp as a standalone entity had in terms of net debt after at the end of the quarter or cash on hand. I think I saw some of the data, but isn't WMB as a C-Corp have a much higher level of liquidity and a much better balance sheet than it did in the past?", "Don Chappel", "Williams has about $2.3 billion of debt at the corporate level, in addition to the debt that's consolidated at WPZ, and it's -- and the pipeline debt that's part of WPZ. In terms of total liquidity, it's largely -- cash is about the same as what you've seen before. It is in the data book; I'll find a page here. It's reported the ending cash of $1.64 billion. ", "Beginning of the year, it was $1.86 billion, so still very substantial cash balance. Again, about $500 million of that's offshore. International hasn't been taxed in the U.S. That's earmarked for our Canadian expansions, which we didn't talk about today but we'll talk about next week. And we have some exciting opportunities up in Canada. ", "So we take that out of the equation, and then the balance is available for our opportunities here in the U.S., and largely focused on corporate and E&P opportunities.", "Faisel Khan - Citi ", "So, C-Corp debt is $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion of cash?", "Don Chappel", "Including the international cash.", "Faisel Khan - Citi ", "Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Jonathan Lefebvre, Wells Fargo.", "Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo", "Most of my questions have been asked. Just on the Rex, or the Appalachia, Marcellus transaction, I was just wondering if that was in the [AMI] with Rex sort of that was outside of it? You may have already stated that, but just wanted a clarification.", "Steve Malcolm ", "Part of it was bolt-ons to the Rex area, but a big part of it was outside of it. So we've now got about -- initially, I think Rex was 22,000 net acres to us and we'll -- that's probably 24,000 or so. So then the other 21,000 or 20,000 plus acres is really 100% Williams outside of that [AMI].", "Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo", "Can you give us a sense for what type of royalty rates were on those leases and terms?", "Steve Malcolm", "They're exactly where you see most of the industry right now. The royalty rates are -- I think we're getting in the 80% net range in those kinds of things.", "Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo", "And then just finally, in terms of pursuing other opportunities in the Marcellus, are you guys still -- would you consider any JV type of structures, or would you prefer not to at this point?", "Steve Malcolm", "We're actually looking at it in kind of a three pronged way. We're doing some leasing, as you can tell. We're doing some JV discussions and looking at JVs. And then there's also the acquisition side of the world. So we're looking really on all three facets.", "Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo", "Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "And our next question today comes from Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "I'm sure you're going to talk about this in more detail next week, but can you speak a little more in detail to the decision process and how to handle excess cash and free cash flow at Williams Corporate? Is it just when we have higher prices? I think you all had guided that you would kind of go pedal to the metal and push our production growth organically from, say, 2011 guidance into the 12% range to more like 20% plus, which you have the ability to do at Will. But then at lower prices for the commodity deck, you're just looking to be an acquirer? Is that basically how we should be thinking about things?", "Don Chappel", "This is Don. Certainly, we have a vast resource of low cost opportunities with attractive returns. However, cash and credit are limiting factors as well as our desire not to flood the market with gas and drive prices even lower. But clearly, as prices go higher, our operating cash flows go up and we have more cash to reinvest in that business without stressing credit or raising capital. ", "On the other hand, as prices go down, we have the ability to pull back on our drilling so as not to suck too much cash in a low price environment and negatively affect our ratings. So the ratings agencies, I will tell you are very focused, not just on Williams, but all companies in the E&P space as well as more broadly in terms of outspending your operating cash flows in the E&P side of the business. ", "So not to say that it can't be done, but certainly the credit agencies are very focused on that, and so we tend to flex our production up in the period of high prices and down in the period of low prices, so that our Capex tends to match our operating cash flows. Now I would say that given that we have a very substantial and excess cash balance at corporate in excess of our needs, we have an ability to spend some of that excess cash, and we focus that on diversifying our portfolio rather than just drilling more wells.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "I guess that's what I was alluding to that in a less favorable commodity environment, are you focused a little more on growing the business versus weighing that against avenues of kind o distributing cash to shareholders in one form or another?", "Don Chappel", "Again, I would say, and I've said this before that our credit metrics are not where we'd like to see them today in light of the low gas price environment. And certainly a stock buyback, if that's the code, would be off the table in terms of our rating. So it really gets down to the extent that we reinvest in good assets in the business, that tends to be a credit positive. But if we take the cash off the balance sheet and buy back stock, that's a bad credit answer.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "Understood; thank you.", "Operator", "Up next is Andrew Gundlach of ASB Holdings.", "Andrew Gundlach - ASB Holdings ", "Steve, this is probably a question for next week, but hopefully, you'll allow me to ask it right here. Since your MLP restructuring, there has not been an energy conference or MLP conference I've gone to where someone hasn't said, haven't you looked at Williams? And aren't you going to do the same thing? And of course, you can guess the companies I'm talking about. ", "It's a groundbreaking transaction. It's been bondholder-friendly and WPZ-friendly; but WMB's stock really hasn't moved all that much. I guess you could say the same thing about Questar. I'm curious how you see all of this restructuring ultimately paying off for the WMB shareholder?", "Steve Malcolm", "Well, thank you, Andrew. We look forward to seeing you next week. Williams stock, WMB stock, has performed pretty well since we made the announcement, relative to some of the other so called integrated players. As you said, it was a groundbreaking transaction. We really like it in that. It's created a large-scale MLP that will have access to low cost capital, and that's going to let us capture the many growth opportunities that we see before us. ", "I think Andrew that, again, as we continue to execute on the plan, as we continue to grow PZ, as we grow the distributions, I think that people will see how attractive the cash flow movement is to Williams. And I really think that there are some investors who are sitting on the sidelines saying, okay, let's see how Williams and how PZ execute on this plan. So, I'm still very excited and optimistic about the new structure. And I think, over time, that it will translate into very good things for Williams and its shareholders.", "Operator", "And, everyone, at this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Steve Malcolm ", "Well, again, thank you for your participation and attention today. We look forward to an exciting Investor Day next week and we'll see you then.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Travis Campbell", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our second-quarter call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Williams. Steve Malcolm, our Chairman and CEO, will review the few slides, we have this morning. Be aware, though, that as always, all of our business unit heads and Don Chappel are available for questions that we'll take right after Steve's remarks. Also, as usual, we've put together a data book, which includes the normal information which we provide each quarter.", "So this morning on the website, williams.com, you should be able to find the slides, the data book and the press release that was issued earlier today. The second-quarter 10-Q will also be available today and you'll be able to access that on the website as well. At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements on slide two and three and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on slide number four. Those are important and they're integral to our remarks, obviously, so please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and they follow the presentation. So with that, Steve, I will turn it over to you.", "Steve Malcolm", "Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our call and thanks for your interest in our company. Let's jump right into the slides and I'll start here on slide five. I am most pleased with our ability to strategically expand our business lines during the quarter.", "As you know, we completed a major E&P acquisition at the Williams level that establishes a significant and growing position in the Marcellus, we now have just under 100,000 acres there. And Williams' partners just recently announced two major Midstream business expansions, the increased stake at Overland Pass and the new cryo plant at Parachute. So continuing with the highlights, second quarter recurring adjusted EPS was up 35% versus the second quarter of '09 on the strength of higher NGL and olefin margins.", "We've kind of passed over the breakover point in terms of production growth. I think second quarter production marks a resumption of the expected growth and you can see we're expecting 12% in '11 and 16% in 2012, while we live within our drilling cash flows. We are expanding our Marcellus position in all lines of business. The business development opportunities are extraordinary. We are benefiting from increases in the Williams Partners distributions, what is good for WPZ is good for Williams and we've increased some of our cash flow certainty with some new E&P hedges. We've taken some of the risk off the table. As you know, we're 64% hedged in 2010 from a revenue standpoint. We've increased our hedge position in 2011 from 30% to 50% during the quarter.", "Turning to slide six, please \u2013 certainly a consistent theme that we have presented really over the past few years is the attractive, organic growth opportunities that exist at Williams and that's certainly reflected on this slide, one that you've seen before but which shows for the 2010-2012 timeframe, the capital intended to be spent on maintenance of facilities, on maintenance of volumes and for growth by business unit. I don't think I need to say anything more about this. Again, it shows $6 billion in growth during that timeframe. I would like to make one comment and this is the only comment I'll make about Canada, but you see the yellow growth capital in 2011 and 2012. It's fairly significant and most of that that's shown in yellow is associated with three specific projects in Canada, again continuing to take advantage of our first mover technological advantage that we have up in Canada.", "Turning to page seven, please, or slide seven, continuing to talk about the theme of growth and this, of course, talks about our E&P production growth during the period. We have adopted a very disciplined approach. We are living within our cash flows until such time as we see the macroclimate improve but even though we're living within our cash flows, we are growing production at 30% over this timeframe.", "You'll also note that Marcellus is becoming a bigger part of the mix. We expect to drill 100 wells in the Marcellus in 2011, running about eight rigs, close to 200 wells in 2012 as we run 14 rigs. So, clearly, Marcellus is becoming a bigger part of our mix. By 2013, it will be our second largest producing basin, by 2015, we would expect that Marcellus would be producing in excess of 500 million a day. As well, the Piceance will continue to be our low-cost workhorse basin that continues to generate very strong returns.", "Slide eight, please. Continuing again to talk about growth and here we are talking about WPZ Midstream growth. You've seen this slide before. The slices of the pie there show where we will be spending our capital and I think there are just three points that I want to make here. Overland Pass and Parachute capital is now in the guidance pie chart.", "Secondly, that when you look at the potential spending in each of the categories, obviously, the activity, the business development activity, continues to be very robust. And we would expect that you would see continued growth in the Marcellus, out West, where we already have a very significant position and we continue to be excited with respect to deepwater Gulf opportunities.", "Slide nine, please. Again, the WPZ Gas Pipeline growth. You've seen this slide before. This talks about the base hits approach that we've used in gas pipes, where all of our projects are backed by long-term commitments with creditworthy customers and so this slide simply shows the $1.3 billion worth of inventory that we have associated with our gas pipeline projects. A few updates \u2013 projects placed into service.", "The 85 North Phase 1 and Mobile Bay South projects in service now. Under construction now, the Sundance Trail. FERC certificates received with respect to the Pascagoula expansion and the Mobile Bay South 2 project, precedent agreements executed on the Midsouth expansion and I'm referring there to the remaining capacity and as well on the Cardinal expansion. And we have an open season ongoing with respect to the Opal Market Link project. So, a lot of activity \u2013 bite-sized in nature, although some of the projects, like Northeast Supply Link, which is a $307 million project and the Midsouth expansion, a $214 million project, are fairly large in terms of capital spending.", "The next few slides I will endeavor to answer some of the questions that we receive most often from investors as I'm out talking, as other officers are out talking or our questions that we're receiving in IR by telephone. But the first one here relates to the slide 10 now \u2013 questions asking for more specifics about what's going on in the Marcellus. We've talked about all of the very exciting opportunities that we have there and so let me run through quickly some of the details.", "As you know, from an E&P perspective, we're approaching now 100,000 acres in the Marcellus. We doubled our E&P lease acreage with the most recent acquisition. Our all-in costs for the now-97,000 acres we hold is just under $7,000 an acre. With respect to the Rex JV, 12 wells have been drilled under that JV, seven wells are now producing, we have one rig operating. Since we took over operation earlier this year, we've drilled one well. That's the Westmoreland County Slavic Trust Well and it appears to be our best well, flowing approximately 4.9 million a day on a 30-day test.", "We would note that the 70,000 of our 97,000 acres are not part of the JV. We are ramping up our drilling activity. We're adding rigs. We just signed a contract for two additional fit-for-purpose rigs, one comes to us in late August; the other in February of 2011. The first rig will likely be employed in the Rex JV area; the second in the Susquehanna area. With respect to Midstream, the opportunities really here are special. We have the huge JV with Atlas, which clearly was enhanced by the Reliance deal, which is going to allocate more drilling capital near-term.", "Springville is just proceeding. We may even upside this pipeline depending on business demand. There's a lot of business around the system. We're talking with many other players. I think this project will be a catalyst for other deals. You see a new green dot on the slide there, which shows the location of our Shamrock compressor station. This will likely be a central facility for us and will be the largest delivery point out of the system \u2013 out of the Atlas gathering system or the LMM system. We're building or expanding 11 compressor stations in support of Atlas' ultimate production targets and third-party growth opportunities. So a lot going on with respect to the JV with Atlas.", "But in addition to that, we've talked about the fact that we have 30 confidentiality agreements, we have identified 80 prospects, a lot of deal activity. We continue to work with a number of large parties in the Northeast, Pennsylvania area around significant gathering stepouts. We continue to offer producers a short-term blending opportunity for their ethane. We think that makes a lot of sense near-term. So, a lot of activity, a lot of excitement, probably so much activity that we may need another General Manager to handle the level of activity in the area. In terms of Gas Pipeline, we show two potential projects here, the Keystone Connector and the Northeast Supply Link, both shown on the map. These continue, I believe, to be viable pipeline projects and we continue to talk with shippers.", "Slide 11 is designed to answer the question. Are you going to exercise your option with respect to Overland Pass Pipeline? And obviously, we answered that earlier this week when we went forward with a press release announcing that we were increasing our interest to 50%. We do have an option to operate there. This is a $425 million transaction. The pipeline is nearly full now. It's expandable to 255,000 barrels. You see some of the announced expansion shown at the bottom of this chart.", "I would say these are the ones that have been announced thus far. We certainly expect more opportunity to expand beyond this and in fact, I would be disappointed if we don't see more expansions occurring during the near-term. This is clearly a strategic pipeline for us. You look at current volumes flowing and about 60% of those are associated with Williams Midstream and E&P businesses.", "Slide 12, what's happening with the Rockies basis, is a question that we have been receiving here recently. Certainly, we've seen the Rockies basis forward market for '11 and '12 move to about $0.50. We think the recent moves had to do with unusual weather, on excess hydro, on regional transportation issues but again, as we've pointed out in the past, I think the key is that E&P's exposure on a revenue basis is very modest, some might say de minimis. As a result of the transportation options that we have and the hedging that we've done and so you can see in 2010 that the exposure is about 5%; 2011, it's about 12% and we would expect to bring down the 28% in 2012 as we are successful with more hedging. I would also point out the fact that PZ Midstream benefits from the Rockies basis differential and I would encourage you to look at the data book, which we have a slide in the data book which shows our commodity exposure and we are, clearly, with respect to Rockies exposure, we're flat gas and \u2013 for the balance of 2010 and 2011.", "So, turning to slide 13, a lot of questions about the impact of the moratorium on WPZ and again, you can see that we have tried to give you some numbers associated with the estimated financial effect of a six-month drilling moratorium and a one-year moratorium. As you can see, our expectation is that the moratorium shouldn't last much longer than six months and the 2011 effect is about 2% of expected WPZ segment profit in DD&A, a one-year moratorium effect would be less than 4%.", "Looking at slide 14, we could probably speak at length here. I'll try to summarize my comments here and we can go into this in more detail in the Q&A session if you would like. But we have had a lot of questions about, well, what happened with NGL and methane prices in the second quarter? What's your short-term outlook? What's your long-term outlook? So let me just organize my thoughts and comments around each of those three main categories. And so in terms of what happened second-quarter versus first-quarter, we saw a steep decline in ethane margins during the second quarter.", "The primary contributors toward these ethane margins were several outages that went on longer than expected at ethylene plants, which dramatically reduced ethane and EP mix consumption, particularly in the Midwest and so the bottleneck for ethane was ethylene cracking capacity during the second quarter. The ethane price decline was not caused by lack of demand for ethylene as evidenced by the very strong margins that we experienced at Williams' Geismar ethylene facility during the second quarter.", "What I would point out here that, due to Williams' acquisition of BASF's capacity two years ago at Geismar that we continue to consume about half of our ethane exposure at our ethylene cracking facility at Geismar. So, the lower ethane margins were partially compensated for, during the quarter by the higher ethylene margins that we were able to capture at Geismar.", "So, turning now to a few comments about the short-term outlook. We believe the fundamentals continue to be very strong for near-term ethane demand as ethane is maintaining its favorable position in being the low-cost feedstock for ethylene production. We are seeing EP storage at Conway is being drawn down to more normal levels as the Midwest ethylene plants have returned to service. Large supplies of ethane from the shale plays require significant infrastructure.", "So we are not going to see the ethane production from some of these shale plays occur overnight. A great example of that is the Bakken infrastructure project that was announced by ONEOK recently. That's going to take three years before the planned startup. So we see very strong ethylene margins, likely incenting plants to invest in small plant expansions and certainly, Williams has a very low-cost expansion investment going on at Geismar right now, which is an example of that \u2013 the actions that the plants may take.", "Longer-term \u2013 longer-term outlook, we believe that the U.S. right now holds a large advantage for being the next low-cost tranche of ethylene production, given the abundant natural gas supplies and we believe the U.S. should be in a strong position to export its ethylene derivative products at a lower cost than incremental production elsewhere in the world. I think the key question long-term will be, will ethylene capacity be expanded to keep pace with increased NGL supplies here in the U.S. and given the current high ethane to ethylene spreads that exist, we think, ultimately, that conversions and low-cost capacity increases will, in fact, happen.", "Slide 15 just graphically shows you what margins have done over the last few quarters. We have seen strong NGL margins in recent quarters. They came back in the second quarter but again our expectation is they will continue to be very strong relative to historical averages.", "Page 16, slide 16, the financial guidance update. In terms of earnings guidance, our 2010 midpoint is moving down a nickel to $1.23 on lower NGL margins and a delay with respect to the Perdido Norte startup. 2011 and '12 are unchanged.", "With respect to capital, 2010 capital is increased for acquisitions, the Marcellus acreage and the Overland Pass pipeline interest and in 2011, capital is increased for the Parachute processing expansion that we talked about earlier. 2012 consolidated shows little change.", "Slide 17, we introduced the slide on 17 and 18 at our Investor Day meeting. These are the 2010 priorities for value creation, things that we need to do well during the year; things that we need to execute crisply around, in order to have a very successful year and so with respect to infrastructure projects, bringing those online, we now have construction completed on five of the projects that are checked here. We continue to make progress with respect to maximizing growth in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford. We have already talked about some of those opportunities.", "On slide 18, we have been successful in initiating growth in the West where we already have a significant position. I'm speaking there about the Parachute cryo and with respect to the WPZ merger with WMZ, just point out that on August 31, the WMZ unit holders will vote to approve the proposed merger.", "Proxy materials have been sent to unit holders. The record date is July 15. A majority vote of the outstanding WMZ units not held by Williams affiliates is required for approval and assuming unit holder approval, we intend to close the merger transaction shortly after that special meeting.", "Slide 19, why Williams is a winning investment. We continue to believe that we have the superior assets. We have the very exciting growth opportunities. We have the balance sheet and the discipline to create significant future value for our shareholders. So with that, I will \u2013 we'll move into the Q&A session. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Steve Maresca from Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Maresca \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Good morning everybody. So my first question is on gas production and I appreciate how you guys have started to grow in the second quarter sequentially over the first quarter. But just what, if you guys are such are a low-cost operator in the areas that you're in, what holds you back from growing even more than you are right now in this gas price environment and what would change that?", "Ralph Hill", "This is Ralph. What you also heard Steve talk about is we're staying within our cash flows, which is what we did. Last year, we actually did cut our budget severely to save even more than that. So bottom line is, it's just a function of what we're \u2013 how much we're drilling now that we've gone to nine rigs in the Valley and four rigs in the Highlands. When the breakover point hits, which it's hitting now, the volumes start to expand rapidly and that's what we expect will happen.", "So what you really see is the effect of going from basically 28 rigs down to eight and now we're at 13. And we're just starting to \u2013 as we move back up from above eight, you'll see that the volumes will start to take off. Other areas such as Powder River, our partners had a delay in the dewatering process of their volumes and that's caused the Powder River to not come on as fast as we would like that to come and then you'll see, as Steve mentioned here, in the near future, as we start to add in the Marcellus and start to drill out the acreage that we already have, the 97,000 acres, you'll see a rapid growth in the Marcellus volumes.", "Steve Maresca \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. In terms of using WPZ as a source of cash, you get the general partner and the dividends from the PZ stock. What are the thoughts on the remaining assets at WMB migrating into WPZ in terms of timing for that?", "Don Chappel", "Steve, this is Don Chappel, good morning.", "Steve Maresca \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi.", "Don Chappel", "The remaining assets include an interest in Gulf Stream pipeline, a 25.5% interest, because of a partnership agreement related to a tax matter. We were precluded from dropping that down in the same calendar year that we did the initial drop-down. So that is eligible and certainly one that we would certainly expect to drop down at a future date. We are certainly not providing any guidance on timing.", "Second is the Canadian assets. The Canadian assets are relatively modest in size today but growing very rapidly. We also think that \u2013 we also have nearly $500 million of international cash at Williams that will fund the initial tranche of that growth. So, I think we're several years away from considering the possibility of a drop-down. So I'm not signaling that we will or will not, but I think, certainly, while we're still consuming Williams excess cash that's held internationally, it would not be prudent.", "Steve Maresca \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Lasan Johong from RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I'm actually interested in the other way around, Steve. What flexibility do you have to push E&P production down next year if things \u2013 if pricing doesn't improve?", "Steve Malcolm", "Well, Lasan, you've seen us have the ability, as Ralph indicated earlier, to ramp up and ramp down. And here most recently, we've ramped down. We moved from 28 rigs in the Piceance down to eight. And so we have the ability to ramp down as necessary, depending on what kind of price signals that we're getting. So, the short answer to your question is that we certainly have the ability to ramp down if the price signals become very weak, as well as having the ability to ramp up if the price signals exceed our expectations in '11 and '12.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "But I'm assuming that in order to plan for your CapEx spending, you've already contracted for a certain number of rigs next year. But I'm assuming also that you have some flexibility in whether you take those rigs into operation or not. So I'm wondering how much rig flexibility you have over and under your contracted position?", "Steve Malcolm", "We do have some rig flexibility and I'll let Ralph go into those details. But keep in mind that we have endeavored to do a little bit more hedging that allows us to implement the drilling program that we have in place. And so that takes some of the price risk off the table. Ralph?", "Ralph Hill", "I would agree that \u2013 the unique thing about our portfolio is that we can't flex it up and down without losing value. I think we're \u2013 many producers you see out there drilling full-out right now is because they have lease obligations or they have to satisfy a new JV agreement they just got into. Even in our newest area, we don't have expirations for several years in the Marcellus and those that do expire can be \u2013 80% or 90% of those leases can be rolled over in a very minimal amount.", "What we try to do is we have a staggered amount \u2013 staggered contracting strategy in our rigs and most of them are not that long-term at this point. We have the option to make them longer-term. You always have the opportunity or option to lay the rigs down and pay the penalty, which happened last year. So there's a lot of flexibility in our portfolio. If we would have to flex down, the unique thing about us is that we wouldn't lose our value. And since \u2013 when I say lose our value, we wouldn't lose the value of the reserves; we wouldn't lose land; we wouldn't lose leases. So we can go up or down in that.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. In the Marcellus, have you \u2013 what's the discussion, the tone and tenor of the discussion around the Keystone connector? And have you made any decisions as to whether you want to put a liquids processing plant on the western side of that liquids divide?", "Steve Malcolm", "Could you repeat that question please?", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Yes. Wondering what kind of tone and tenor you've had in terms of discussions around the Keystone connector? In other words, is the market enthusiastic, kind of base, interested, not interested? Second, in terms of the western side of the liquids divide, has Williams made any decisions as to whether it wants to put a processing plant there or not?", "Phil Wright", "This is Phil Wright. We haven't decided on the need or location of an extraction plant just yet. In fact, one of the things that we're in dialogue with producers about is whether we want to make Keystone connector a wet gas line and perhaps locate extraction facilities eastward, if that makes sense, largely that will turn on the total scope of the project and how many people sign-on.", "In the ensuing period of time, one of the advantages we think we have is that we have a lot of blending capability and to the extent that it takes awhile to ramp up, to have ample liquids coming through, we have capacity to handle that as long as the heavies are knocked out in the southwest end. So, literally, we are evaluating the range of alternatives there and will optimize and select the most flexible one but we think that, again, an advantage is that we'll be able to ramp into that decision with more cards onto the table in the way of knowing exactly how much volume we're talking about, when it's going to come online and an ability to deal with a lot of liquids in the ensuing period of time.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "That's very interesting. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Seinly Aou [ph] from J.P. Morgan.", "Seinly Aou \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Good morning guys. I have a question on your 2011 and 12 production growth, 12% and 16%. Is that just adding rigs from the Marcellus and do you see any shift in your rig count in other regions?", "Steve Malcolm", "It is essentially, it's primarily driven by the Piceance and the Marcellus. We are showing a modest uptick in rig count in both '11 and '12 to do that. We would average about four more rigs on average in the Piceance side of the world if in 2011. And we'd average about four more rigs in 2011 in the Marcellus. So it is an addition of that and you can see that, in our capital guidance, goes up in the year 2011 also.", "Seinly Aou \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And I see you're still running four rigs in the Barnett. And when I look at your IRR returns, at current spot gas prices you're below 10% there. Why are you still running four rigs over there?", "Steve Malcolm", "Actually down to 3%. I don't \u2013 we'd have to \u2013 offline, we can talk about the return there. We think our return is higher than that, but we just dropped a rig down to three so that's at the point. The biggest problem we have in that Barnett area is basically facilities permits. It's not actually the drilling. It's just a matter of getting the drilling completion done. It's just a matter of various air permits and compression permits and pipeline permits. But we have dropped a rig in that area.", "Seinly Aou \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. It's not because of your return?", "Steve Malcolm", "Right.", "Seinly Aou \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And shifting to your Overland Pass, do you expect the volume to ramp up to above like 200,000 barrels?", "Alan Armstrong", "This is Alan Armstrong. Yes, ultimately we do. And a lot of growth opportunity out there. You saw the ONEOK announcement on their plans to bring Bakken production down in 2013. We, of course, are proposing the Parachute TXP1 plant there in the Piceance and we also have the Opal TXP4 plant that is just be coming online here in the third quarter. So we have a lot of new production and a lot of new volumes that we can point to very specifically and beyond that, there's a lot of other opportunity for growth out of there, like places like the Uinta and a lot of new production. So what we have in there is very specific. We know exactly where it's coming from. And then on top of that, because Overland Pass is really the only system that is easily expandable out of the Rockies, we think it will capture any incremental volumes out of that area.", "Seinly Aou \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. So in terms of the incremental barrels, is it extracting the barrels from existing production that haven't been extracted or it's new \u2013 how much of it is from new production versus\u2026?", "Alan Armstrong", "Most of that is from existing flowing production.", "Seinly Aou \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "So those barrels haven't been extracted?", "Alan Armstrong", "That's right. Sorry, the gas production with the NGLs are flowing; the extraction facilities are not in place. That's correct.", "Seinly Aou \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Got you. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs.", "Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi. My question is really about capital allocation at E&P. You've always talked about the Piceance being very strong returns. Can you just talk about the returns that you're expecting in the Marcellus and how you would decide whether to ramp there rather than staying with ramping the Piceance, assuming that the commodity works out the way you think it will?", "Steve Malcolm", "The Piceance returns, in the Valley, are better than the Marcellus returns but not by that much. So the Marcellus returns we think are going to be very strong going forward. And we think as we really get into the newest area, the Susquehanna returns, that on an incremental basis, those will probably be potentially as good as the Piceance if not slightly better. So I think they'll probably end up being exactly the same. On the Highlands, returns are slightly lower than the Valley because the Highlands by definition has a couple extra thousand feet to drill through before we get to the level where you start in the Valley. So going forward, I think that you'll see that the Valley and the Marcellus will be side-by-side in the capital allocations followed thereafter by the Piceance Highlands. So capital allocation-wise, I think living within our cash flows, we feel we can ably execute on all three of those areas without hurting one or the other or trying to disadvantage one over the other.", "Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. And then just again on the Marcellus, how are you feeling about your acreage position now? I mean, do you think you're going to be big enough to reach sort of the operational synergies that you'd like to have? Would you need to add some more acreage?", "Steve Malcolm", "Well, we really feel good about the positions we have, particularly in Susquehanna and Clearfield Center and Westmoreland Counties. We also have a growing position in another county there that we haven't officially announced yet. I'd like to see us continue to add to that. As you can see, I think we were talking about 92,000 or so acres recently and now we're at 97,000 acres. So there's all kinds of opportunities up there. I think you see some of the operators that have a substantial amount of more acreage than we have, are starting to say, well, maybe we need a partner. Maybe we need to do a little bit more than what we're doing here and find somebody else. So since we're in the area in a major effort and based on the expertise we've developed in doing a world-class resource play like the Piceance, we hope that we can talk with some of those producers and maybe do some additional JVs and other things to expand our position or continue with what we've done in the past, which is grassroots leasing and/or acquisitions. I will say all that saying, as I look at Don Chappel, that we will do that in a very disciplined manner and we're going to make sure that we do everything we can and do what it takes to make sure our balance sheet stays very strong. But I see a lot of opportunities out there and I see some that are very attractive financially for us.", "Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you. And then if I could just ask a little bit of a detailed question, but you really had on the E&P side, the third party gathering and processing, so the costs have stepped up pretty significantly both in the first and second quarters. Is there anything going on there that we ought to be aware of? Most spreads just going down to PZ or what's \u2013 that trend has really picked up over the last couple of quarters?", "Steve Malcolm", "Is that our Willow Creek processing, I think? So that's full scale. But I'll have to \u2013 let me get back and make sure I gave you the right answer on that, but I think that's what that is.", "Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That's great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Carl Kirst from BMO Capital Markets.", "Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Nice. Good morning, everybody. Ralph and actually, I guess, Steve, you mentioned \u2013 I just want to make sure I heard it correctly, that the first rig at Susquehanna is coming in February '11, meaning we'll probably not get first results from that area until mid-next year? Is that about right from a timeframe standpoint?", "Ralph Hill", "Well, there's actually, there's a rig there already.", "Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Ralph Hill", "So what Steve meant is the new one, one of the new ones is going to \u2013 end of this month we'll probably dedicated more or end of August, I'm sorry, will be dedicated to the Rex JV area and then we'll have a new fit-for-purpose rig coming on early next year. There is a rig running that we inherited from Alta in Susquehanna. We've got currently 11 wells have been drilled up there. They are all horizontal wells. They are \u2013 I'm sorry, nine horizontals. They're all waiting on completion as they wait for the infrastructure to be developed.", "So we have a number of wells that have already been drilled that we're anxious to put on when the time is \u2013 when the infrastructure is done and we'll also continue to be drilling up there. So, hopefully, whenever that infrastructure is done, we're hearing late this year, could slip to early next year, we'll have some good results to start showing you about it. If you look at some of the producers right next to us, if you've seen their quarterly calls and other things, the results in that area are really doing very, very well and we're excited to start showing you that.", "Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Great. No, appreciate the clarification. And then with respect to some of the other questions, obviously, you're continuing to look at acreage growth in the Marcellus. In order to reach those goals that you have laid out as far as the 12% composition going to give you the second largest basin, is that contingent upon any new acreage being added or can you do that with what is a fairly sizable acreage position right now?", "Ralph Hill", "It's really what we have \u2013 it's based on what we have today. We do have built in the forecast a little bit of what I would call blocking and tackling \u2013 a little bolt-on leasing here and there, but basically it's what we own today.", "Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Great. And then one more if I could. And this is may be a question for you and Don. As you look at trying to do more acreage diversifications without having to perhaps tap the debt markets, we look at additional assets that could make their way into WPZ. And then one of the things we talked about prior was perhaps the Dew Point plants that are currently housed within E&P. And I just wanted to get a sense of what you guys are thinking about strategic necessity of continuing to hold those plants within E&P, if they, in fact, would make strategic sense to make a drop-down. And if so, is there any sense of size maybe that you can help us with there?", "Steve Malcolm", "Probably, Carl, there's not many details that we can offer you there. You are correct, that we do have Midstream assets embedded in our Piceance E&P operations. And we've acknowledged that fact and we've talked fleetingly about that opportunity, but \u2013 and it does exist and \u2013 but we wouldn't want to offer any guidance on that at this point.", "Ralph Hill", "It is actually a large complex.", "Steve Malcolm", "Just to remind you, it's about 1.2 Bcf a day of trading capacity. Because we've built all that out and have facilities and all that, that's why the cryo potential plant that Midstream is talking about is really a very economically-advantaged plant compared to what somebody else could do grass-roots there. So we feel very strong about the infrastructure we've built up there and the opportunities going forward.", "Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. No, understood, but no sense of magnitude of EBITDA, for instance, that those treating plants are throwing off?", "Steve Malcolm", "No. Carl, we're not prepared to offer anything like that.", "Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Holly Stewart from Howard Weil.", "Holly Stewart \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated", "Hi guys. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. I guess, Ralph, I'll start with you. The ramp \u2013 the data in one of the presentations this morning, the nice ramp in the Marcellus, I think my notes from the Analyst Day \u2013 of course, that was pre-acquisition \u2013 have you trying to get to 100 million a day in the next five years. Now you're saying 500 million a day by 2015, so obviously very impressive numbers. And the second largest producing basin for you guys by 2013, which would surpass the PRB volumes in a relatively short period of time. Can you just give us a little color on how you get there? I mean, I see the ramp and rig count, but any other specifics?", "Ralph Hill", "Well, Holly, we really believe we can get there with what we own today and we're looking to be at about eight rigs next year. And as I mentioned, we're two currently; we're adding another one in August, so that will be three in the Marcellus. And then our current projections for '12 \u2013 of course, it's a couple of years away \u2013 show us at about 14 rigs. So really it's just looking at what we own, adding rigs, building out the infrastructure and doing what we do \u2013 taking basically the Piceance model and moving it there. So we feel that that kind of rig count and since we're not giving guidance past '12 \u2013 but that rig count stays at basically in that range going forward and that will get us to that 500 million-type level.", "Holly Stewart \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated", "Okay. Do you have a Marcellus production number for the quarter? I mean, I know it's probably pretty minimal, but do you have that breakout?", "Ralph Hill", "You know, we're only producing \u2013 it's a good growth. I mean, right now we're producing 5 million or 6 million a day, basically. So it's very \u2013 as you know, we just got in. The Rex JV has drilled some wells. A lot of facilities are just now coming on so we have a lot of wells just waiting to be turned on. I think we have half of the wells in the Rex JV are just now coming on based to as we finished out our compression and gathering projects.", "Holly Stewart \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated", "Anything wet over there yet?", "Ralph Hill", "No. No, we're still basically in the dry window.", "Holly Stewart \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated", "Okay. And then I guess just on the \u2013 you know, you lay out the ramp in production over the next couple of years. I know we've already hit this, but as a four-handle \u2013 I mean, are you still comfortable doing this with a four-handle on gas heading into '11?", "Ralph Hill", "Well, we've upped our hedges to about 50%. So really the comfort level is \u2013 and we've shown the economics we believe are pretty strong at that level still. But it will be a function of what our cash flows are as we continue to help \u2013 do our part for WMB to manage the balance sheet also. So it will be a function really of the cash flows. I think you see our forecasts are more, I think, in the $5 range going up over the next several years to maybe $6 on a NYMEX-type range. So it's not a large price increase. I know it's in our slide deck somewhere, but those are the \u2013 we're not seeing a huge uptick in pricing. But we're writing more our numbers based on the, I think, combined with our hedges and our price forecast going forward, so I don't have right in front of me.", "Holly Stewart \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated", "Got you. Okay. And then I guess, Alan, can you give any specifics on what's going on with Perdido Norte? And sorry if I missed this, but just \u2013 I know there's been a delay due to the moratorium. Can you give us any color?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, we really have to let the producers speak for themselves on that. There was \u2013 we had a hydrate in our line that was affecting the Boombang Nansen pipeline and so we \u2013 during construction process, we got water into the riser and that formed a hydrate. And we have remediated that. And so that production will be coming back on at Boombang, but that was part of that construction. But the actual delay that is experienced right now is related to operations from the actual production platform that we're not involved with.", "Holly Stewart \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated", "Okay. And then just one macro \u2026", "Alan Armstrong", "Let me add to that just so I don't leave people the wrong impression there. As far as we know, that is not related to the drilling moratorium itself. In other words, it's not related to any delay in drilling. The well is drilled; it's a matter of getting those production facilities up and running.", "Holly Stewart \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated", "Up and running, okay. And then just a macro question, you guys talked about your exposure to the Rockies basin. Can you just give us basis differential \u2013 sorry \u2013 can you just give us a little color on what's going on right now in the Rockies? I mean, it's widened and I guess we wouldn't have expected it to. So can you just give us from a pipeline and production standpoint, give us your perspective?", "Steve Malcolm", "Well, there was several things that happened just for the May/June time period. And when it did get up to a couple of times, it came closer to $0.80, $0.90 on a daily basis. But we really had some \u2013 we had some transportation maintenance; we had record hydro; we had a strong weather, as in very warm weather in the eastern part of the United States and we had cooler weather in the western part. So a number of things like that just kind of combined, I think, to make the cash basis on a monthly basis seem like the basis was increasing. So going forward, we think all those things work themselves out and normalize, a little more normal weather patterns. Obviously, the transportation and maintenance goes away. The hydro goes away and we see, that's why you look at the forward curve, it's more like in that $0.50 range. So we looked it really as just kind of several things lined up together to make a blip on the screen of a higher basis for a couple months.", "Holly Stewart \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated", "Got it. Alright.", "Alan Armstrong", "Watching the ACO [ph] pricing level is a really good indicator for the kind of pressure that is coming into supply in that Western area as we add hydro and cooler weather. So Opal tends to have to eventually compete with ACO [ph] pricing and that's been very low.", "Holly Stewart \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated", "Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rick Gross from Barclays Capital.", "Rick Gross \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Good morning. Yes, I've got one on, we'll call it the Overland Pass corridor. And that the slides indicate that you think you'll be able to take it up to full capacity, which is over 100,000 barrels more a day going into the Conway area. ONEOK just announced 15,000 barrels a day expansion on Sterling. What I'm trying to figure out where the incremental barrels that come into Conway \u2013 and there may be some that sneak in the back door down enterprise from the Marcellus \u2013 where that goes. Because the incremental user in the Midwest is already an ethane EP mix user and the marginal barrel conversions in the Gulf. So how do I think about more barrels into Conway and how they get utilized, dispersed from growth in Overland Pass?", "Alan Armstrong", "Rick, this is Alan. I think what you have to look at is the fact that there's been a long-term consistent spread between Conway and Belvieu on ethane that supports some type of infrastructure development. And that remains with the low-cost transportation available on Overland Pass, we think it remains one of the cheapest incremental sources of ethane into the Belvieu area. So we think there's quite a few things that will drive an answer to that bottleneck that you speak to.", "Rick Gross \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Alternative is there's a mistral pipeline going up to NOVA Geoffrey [ph]which consumes 180,000 barrels a day of ethane. And those folks are worried. Is the expansion of Overland Pass and some of the things around that system that ONEOK has indicated \u2013 and this may be a ONEOK question \u2013 is that project, Alliance taking wet barrels versus Prairie Rose, all of those things \u2013 are these competing projects, kind of like the Bakken [ph] and the Marcellus or are these individual projects that are stand-alone and there's a lot of barrels coming out of the Bakken?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, I think you'd have to, again, direct that to ONEOK in that regard, but I do think there's a lot of barrels. We're certainly very well aware of the ethane demand in the hole there in Canada and we think that that presents an opportunity for U.S. ethane; but, as you know, that's a pretty expensive ticket. So \u2013 but still, compared to the other alternatives that you look to for additional incremental ethane supplies, like the Marcellus and so forth, we think it can still compete effectively, because we think Geoffrey and the Alberta ethane consumers have a high demand there and have a very low-cost efficient infrastructure up there, that's a good place to consume some of that ethane. So I guess what I would tell you is I think Overland Pass will provide a connection for supplies, whether it is ultimately for feeding ethane supplies into Canada or whether it is to Mont Belvieu. But I think Overland Pass clearly provides that connection for the production out of the Rockies into either one of those markets, ultimately.", "Rick Gross \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Financial question, we've indicated that we're going to, at least for awhile, live within cash flows on the E&P company. We're going to fund the Canadian expansion with international cash. We've got CTLT [ph] cut money coming into the parent. We mentioned, in a variety of ways, kind of balance sheet, protect the balance sheet kind of thing, which are into investment grade.", "The question I have is, at what level of balance sheet coverage \u2013 are we looking at BBB flat kind of, BBB plus kind of metrics before we get to the point where we can put major stock buybacks into the value creation tool kit or is there a time frame when this might materialize? Because there's going to be cash buildup, you're going to have choices. One of those choices in a down market, people mentioning $4 gas prices, would be to buy in stock relative to spend it to create value per share E&P-wise.", "Don Chappel", "Rick, this is Don. I understand the question. I would say that we're certainly looking at all the options. I would say that with low commodity prices and the down market, our credit metrics don't look nearly so good as they look in a more, I'll call it normal market. So I think one of the challenges is in a down market, it's even more difficult to buy back stock without a ratings consequence. So we're continuously looking at all the options and looking at where we stand within the credit framework. But you also have to look at what those metrics look like in that low environment. And again, the agencies also not just look at the environment in which we're living, but also look at an even more dire environment so, as they make their ratings decision.", "So it's hard to answer your question other than to give you some of the considerations. But I would say we're always looking at all the options. But I think stock buyback is something that's certainly not on the table this year. We'd like to have the flexibility to be able to consider that at a future date, but certainly it's not now. And I guess we'll take a look at where everything lines up in 2011 and beyond and see if that's something that's appropriate.", "Rick Gross \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Faisel Khan from Citi.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "On the E&P side, in your Analyst meeting, you talked about the EURs or the ultimate recoveries improving in the Highlands and you gave some data on your best to date wells. Ralph, can you give us an idea of where those EURs are trending right now, where you are today?", "Ralph Hill", "Really, no change. So we just added the rigs, one earlier this year to get to two, and now we're just in the process of where we just brought our third and fourth on. So we're just in the midst of the drilling program. So we still believe that we're in the areas that we want to be in, that we're in a little sweeter spots in some of these areas and that we hope to see that the trend you saw will continue and normalize out to be at better levels than they were in the past. But it's just a little early this year.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay. So you still think that that trend actually continues upwards?", "Ralph Hill", "Well, we felt pretty good about it and I don't know if it goes upwards from there, but basically, we'd like to at least get to where those were. And those were \u2013 that was a nice uptick from where we'd been last couple of years when we were still in the process of delineating the field.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Do you have any update on the exploration wells that you may have drilled recently?", "Ralph Hill", "Well, there's one in the Paradox that was drilled by our partner and that has been completed \u2013 or drilled but not completed yet. And we're looking to put a very large volume frac on that and a large amount of sand and water that we've done in any of the previous wells. So that will happen sometime this summer. And we have completed a \u2013 one exploration \u2013 well, we've drilled one exploration well in the San Juan Basin that we've looked at. In the Mancos, we're in the process of drilling our second, but we're going to complete those at the same time and that will be later this fall. And that's the Mancos shale type look we're doing down there.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Got you. On the natural gas liquid side, seeing your NGL sales from your processing trend down in the quarter, what's your expectation for the third quarter in terms of those NGL sales?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, about almost half of that was from an inventory shift, so just timing of sales. So kind of looking at our production as a piece of that. And then we had, as I mentioned earlier, we had one of the big deepwater wells \u2013 or deepwater platforms down in the Gulf that affected our volume as well. But a lot of that was just timing of inventory shift. And so we obviously wouldn't expect that to recur other than just the normal shifts in inventory that we see. But that was the largest driver in that. So nothing fundamentally is shifting on that in our business.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "So the 272 of that million gallons of NGLs sold in the quarter, that's kind of a steady-state number, do you think?", "Alan Armstrong", "No, it'd probably be best to average the first quarter and second quarter to get to a more steady run rate there. Because that had the inventory shift from one quarter to the next in it.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Got you. On the balance sheet and specifically the cash that you have in the international part of the business roughly, I think it's roughly $450 million or maybe $0.5 billion, I know you've talked about using some of that cash to invest in the Canadian Midstream operations. Would you also consider using that cash in maybe Canadian upstream assets?", "Steve Malcolm", "No.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Sorry. I didn't hear that.", "Steve Malcolm", "No.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Got you. All right. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ray Deacon from Pritchard Capital.", "Ray Deacon \u2013 Pritchard Capital", "Thanks for taking my question. Ralph, I was wondering, just curious what your thoughts were on the Rex JV in terms of deliverability out of that area? Like how much do you think you can scale the area? I know you're very early on in the development there. And I guess just a general comment on the, I guess, 7,000 or 5,000 acre increase. Are you kind of more interested in the southwest part of the Marcellus or the Northeast at this point?", "Ralph Hill", "Well, we're more in the middle to the northeast part of the play, as you can see. And on the Rex side, we like what we've seen so far. I don't know the exact size of that yet, so I shouldn't, let us continue \u2013 we just took over operations. We drilled our \u2013 we're on a process of drilling our second well, so give us a little time on that to let you know what we think we can get there. But primarily, where you see our activity is from the Westmoreland and Clearfield Center Counties going out towards Susquehanna on our area of emphasis at this point.", "Ray Deacon \u2013 Pritchard Capital", "Okay. Got it. And the primary takeaway I believe is going to end up being Equitrans, right? Is that a fair statement in Center Clearfield, Westmoreland?", "Ralph Hill", "I think so. There's some other opportunities in there too, but I think that's one of the primary areas.", "Ray Deacon \u2013 Pritchard Capital", "Okay. Got it. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Gundlach from Arnhold Bleichroeder.", "Andrew Gundlach \u2013 Arnhold Bleichroeder", "Good morning. If I look at your guidance where you're on the E&P side of taking your volumes from 1200, 1250, 1500, 1700 and what you said about the Marcellus, Steve, it sounds like about half of that growth will come from the Marcellus drilling and about half of that growth from the Piceance. Is that the way to look at it?", "Steve Malcolm", "Yes. Yes, Andrew.", "Andrew Gundlach \u2013 Arnhold Bleichroeder", "Okay. And the numbers that you gave on the Marcellus, which are impressive \u2013 500 by \u2013 would you say 2015? Can you help me think about how that will translate into proved reserves over that time? So, will the Marcellus by then be bigger than the San Juan, which is about 500 or so, if I remember correctly? I mean, how will this translate into proved reserves, is the question?", "Steve Malcolm", "Well, we can't really give that. Yes, I can guide you to the press release, which we thought with the Alta deal and the unnamed additional 8,000 acres, we thought that has a potential. And that's not proved reserves; that those two transactions just by themselves had a potential of, like, 1.3 Tcf, I think it was in the press release. But we can't guide on proved reserves at this time at all. But we felt very good on the potential of the area. So that would be a substantial addition if those things would come true, to our proved reserve base.", "Andrew Gundlach \u2013 Arnhold Bleichroeder", "I understand, okay. And then the other question I have is \u2013 I guess it's for Don and Steve. WPZ now has an under 6% yield and in my opinion, is one of the best positioned companies in the Midstream space out there. How can use that equity as an acquisition currency to increase your cash flows in ways that you could never do before. And thus increase your cash flows into WMB parent to deal with the opportunities that you're speaking about?", "Don Chappel", "Andrew, this is Don. I agree, it's a terrific currency, well regarded by the market. I think the key is finding quality assets; assets that we like and then at a value that creates value for both WPZ and WMB. So we're certainly mindful of that opportunity and certainly would like to be able to take advantage of it, but it will be depending on those considerations.", "Andrew Gundlach \u2013 Arnhold Bleichroeder", "I understand. But you see it strategically the way I'm thinking about it, is that correct?", "Don Chappel", "Yes.", "Andrew Gundlach \u2013 Arnhold Bleichroeder", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Craig Shere from Tudor.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "From Tuohy Investment \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Hi, guys, I missed a little of the call so I apologize if there's some redundancy here, but I know you were speaking to the opportunities with commodity pricing and recovering ethane prices. But in some basins, I think the ethane can be as low as maybe one-third of the mix, but in your Midstream, it's perhaps closer to 50%. Can you talk about the ethane mix that your equity NGL exposures have going forward, as you convert some things to fee-based and put on new projects?", "Don Chappel", "Sure. First of all, you are right \u2013 our ethane mix today is about 50% and people have all kinds of different mix formulas for when they get to a consolidated barrel. But our number is around 50% and in terms of shift, things that might move that over time, we do have \u2013 we had had some contract changes in the San Juan that heavy-up our barrel a little bit and as we do the deepwater projects and those are percent of liquid contracts for the most part, those barrels are pretty heavy if you are \u2013 sorry, that mix is pretty heavy on those streams coming in.", "So we'll see a little bit there. But as big as our portfolio is, it takes a lot to move that very much, as you can imagine. So I wouldn't expect any dramatic movement in that. What I would suggest that from an MB investor perspective, that you take a look at is the fact that much of our ethane, a little over half of our ethane, on a \u2013 if you looked at our commodity exposure, is going into our ethylene cracking business at Geismar, where we consume about 30,000 barrels a day there. So for some piece of that, you really need to look all the way through the ethylene pricing if you're trying to get to a Williams earnings impact on that but we do continue to do fee-based contracts but that won't necessarily, just a straight up fee-base contract won't necessarily change our mix; it will just lower our overall exposure to commodity \u2013 but to both the heavies and to ethane.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "Sure. I appreciate that explanation.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brad Lundy from Ivory Capital.", "Brad Lundy \u2013 Ivory Capital", "Good morning. I certainly apologize if this has been addressed earlier in the call, but as you pointed, Don, the PZ transaction has been well regarded by the market and you can certainly see it with the equity up 50% year-to-date. Unfortunately, it has not translated into the same appreciation in the MB side. And I'm curious from your point of view at what point the Board starts to reevaluate the current structure?", "Steve Malcolm", "Yes, this is Steve. You're right \u2013 the PZ deal has not yet translated into good things to WMB. We think it will over time. We think that as we grow PZ, as we grow distributions \u2013 I mean, we wouldn't have created this vehicle had we not had intentions to grow it over time. And so there are a lot of opportunities out there. We've talked about some of those opportunities in our last few calls and during our Investor Day; but while the market hasn't yet appreciated the transaction from an MB standpoint, we believe that it will over time. And I think it's up to us to execute on the PZ opportunity, to use that wonderful currency. And we believe that as we do that successfully, that the wonderful cash flow aspect of this structure will benefit Williams in a big way.", "Brad Lundy \u2013 Ivory Capital", "Is there a defined timeline as to which the current structure will be reevaluated?", "Steve Malcolm", "We \u2013 I mean, truly, we look at strategic options at every Board meeting that we have. So there's not a specific timeline because we're always looking at strategic options that might make sense.", "Don Chappel", "This is Don to just add to Steve comments. Again, when we developed the WPZ transformational transaction, we did not expect that we would get great lift in the WMB stock price as a result. We really thought it was more a long-term strategic issue, to provide that advantaged and reliable capital source to our Midstream and Pipeline business and thereby enable them to grow at a much more rapid rate than they would absent that access to capital.", "And that really has come true. So, you can see Midstream and Pipeline is now developing the opportunities without fear that we cannot finance them. So it's really turned our Midstream and Pipeline team loose to really develop all the opportunities that add value and do so on a disciplined basis. Again, I'd just remind you that when we did the transaction and really through this date, our earnings did not change, our cash flows did not change. We highlighted the value of those two businesses in WPZ, but our earnings and cash flows did not change in the near-term. But we're very confident that, over the course of a few years, that we will see very high returns from those incremental investments that are made in those two businesses.", "Brad Lundy \u2013 Ivory Capital", "Indeed. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Don.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to your presenters for any additional or closing remarks.", "Steve Malcolm", "Yes, this is Steve. Thank you for participating on the call. We think that we have a very bright future. The opportunities, the growth opportunities are extraordinary. And we look forward to a very bright future and look forward to talking more about those opportunities in the future. Thank you.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's conference.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Travis Campbell", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. As always, thanks for your interest in the company. As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday after the market closed. Also yesterday, Alan, using a few slides, had some commentary about the results, our increased guidance and our growth opportunities. That audio commentaries and slides are available on the website, and because of that review yesterday, we'll not be reviewing the slides again this morning. So on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. First, the earnings presentation with the audio commentary by Alan. Second, the data book that contains the usual information we make available every quarter. Third, the press release of the first quarter results. Fourth, our analyst package. And finally, a pod cast of Alan's remarks yesterday. ", "Also for your information, the first quarter 10-Q will be filed today. Because we reviewed these items yesterday, I expect the call today will be very brief and we'll get very quickly to your questions. In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will make some general comments, after which we'll open the lines for questions. ", "Be aware, as always, all of our business unit heads are here and available to respond to your questions after Alan's remarks. Here with me are Ralph Hill, who heads up the E&P Company; Rory Miller, who oversees the Midstream Company; and Randy Bernard, who heads up the gas pipeline. Also, Don Chappel, the CFO is here as well. ", "As most of you are aware, last Friday we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary, WPX Energy, Inc., filed a registration statement related to the proposed IPO of its common stock. Because of security law restrictions, we will not be commenting at all on WPX Energy Inc. today. ", "There are forward-looking statements on Slide 2 and 3 and disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide 4 of yesterday's presentation. Those are also included in the data book. They're important and integral to the company and you should review those. ", "Also, there are non-GAAP numbers included in these various presentations. Those have all been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles and their reconciliation schedules are also available. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great. Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just very briefly capture the highlights and key notes on what was put out as a recording yesterday and is in the slide material. First of all, we're very excited to tell you we're raising guidance, and this is based on both higher crude price expectations. We are now at $95 midpoint for '11 and '12 crude. And of course, that's still well below the hoard market and current pricing for crude. And current NGL margins, of course, are being lifted on that. And in fact, current NGL margins are actually just beyond the high end of range of what we have posted right now. ", "Also, we have greater confidence on timing and performance on a number of new projects that are going to add to the balance in 2011. So we are raising guidance for both '11 and '12, and you can see the details of that. We're now at a -- our midpoint for '11 is now $1.55 per share on an adjusted earnings basis. ", "In the current quarter, we had mixed results to combine and produce a very solid quarter. Our gas gathering production volumes were negatively impacted by severe winter weather, primarily in the Rockies and in the Bakken, with the Bakken receiving near record snowfalls. And of course, low natural gas prices also grows low quarter-over-quarter results in E&P. ", "However, our Midstream Canada and Olefins segment came through and posted a record quarter that helped to mitigate the weakness in the gas prices. And our Gas Pipe segment also came through with a strong quarter. ", "As we look into the second quarter, we are very excited about how our volumes have rebounded and conditions are currently very good for tremendous earnings results for the balance of 2011. Looking to the balance of the year, we now expect our midpoint, as I stated earlier, EPS to be $1.55. And we're going to hit now just some of the key factors that we expect to drive this even better performance for the balance of the year. ", "First of all, our operating volumes have really rebounded in all of our areas. We expect the balance of the year to be much better as the fruits of our labor in both the Marcellus and the Bakken begin to take hold both on the E&P side and in the Marcellus on the WPZ Midstream side. Also, we had some major maintenance to get through in the first quarter at our big Opal Plant, which is the largest single contributor to our NGL equity volumes. ", "Secondly, new projects that we are expecting. First of all, Perdido Norte project really will be a powerful contributor to earnings in the last half of the year and not so really dependent on permitting out there as much as some continued topside work that Shell is doing on their big platform that feeds both our oil gathering, our gas gathering and our Markham processing plant that -- and of all those facilities serving the Western Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So we're really looking forward to seeing those volumes start to ramp up and we have confidence in that happening for the balance of the year. ", "Also, our Transco Pipeline just recently placed into service 2 new projects that will combine to generate over $30 million in additional profits for the balance of the year. And then finally the Marcellus, which is really infrastructure constrained on many fronts right now, will benefit from a lot of work that E&P did in getting a lot of small gathering systems in the field to serve new production in those areas as well as the laser pipeline, which -- and our very own Springville lateral, which we expect to begin in the third quarter. So a lot of things going on in the Marcellus, on the infrastructure front, some of which will directly impact our production and, of course, others that will drive earnings at the WPZ level. ", "Third, on margins. We anticipate continued strong unit NGL margins and olefins margins. Our current forecast in margins for NGLs are really below what we are currently experiencing, and if you've noticed, we've really seen a nice shift up in ethane and as well as the heavier products continue to provide really record level margins. ", "However, we also know that things can change pretty fast in this arena, so we are only raising our oil prices assumption to $95 and, we are holding back on our NGL crude ratio assumptions below what we're currently experiencing. ", "On the olefins margin side, we continue to expect robust margins on this on the back of high crude oil because the rest of the world is really dependent on olefin products that are produced from crude oil, of course, and we continue to see growing demand for olefin derivative products outside the U.S. So we're really -- in the past, the U.S. petchem market was fairly dependent on the U.S. economy, and it's really moved offshore right now in terms of what we're depending on. ", "We, of course, cannot say much at all about the spinoff of our E&P segment, to be known as WPX Energy. I can tell you that the recent S-1 filing is spot on with what we told you to expect at the last earnings call. I can also speak to the positive impact that we expect to see at WMB. WMB is going to be one of the top interviewed infrastructure companies in the nation, and it is going to be better-positioned than any that I'm aware of in delivering reliable growing dividends. ", "It will be investment grade and it will have the power of the increasing incentive distribution rights of the Williams Partners GP, and this is going to allow for continued growth and free cash flows and providing -- those will be available for dividends without dilution or financing expenses at the WMB level. ", "So the clear and transparent growth at WPZ should provide confidence regarding our continued ability to grow distributions at the PZ level, and we have already declared a 60% increase for the WMB June dividend, and are targeting a 10% to 15% increase in dividend for the June 2012 WMB dividend. And, of course, these targets were set before the latest increase in guidance at both PZ and MB. ", "So overall, we're very excited about the amount of value we expect to generate in the foreseeable future for our WMB shareholders, and we really are sitting at the right place, at the right time, with the right assets, the right experience and a great financial position to rapidly expand our business' earnings power. And with that, we'll turn this over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Nice results and certainly appreciate the streamlined version here. Alan, maybe if I can start just on the olefin margins, and certainly we've seen a good deal of new announcements to Dow, CP [Chevron Phillps] Chem, Formosa, everyone looking to ramp ethylene production in the Gulf Coast. And I'm trying to figure out with respect to Geismar and you guys trying to get a larger market share. Is that something where their interests should help where there's more opportunity maybe to find someone with an offtake, or are you finding more sort of direct competition as overall ethylene expansion perhaps, ramps?", "Alan Armstrong", "Carl, for some reason we're having a really difficult time hearing you, but let me paraphrase what I thought I heard you ask and then hopefully, you can line me out if I didn't hear that right, but for some reason our audio on this end is breaking up. I think the question was around the -- what we expect in terms of the increase for demand in the petchem space and recognizing the new announcements from Dow and Chevron, Philips and some of the new announced Formosa, some of the new announcements on the petchem side.  We are -- and I think then another question around what we would do at Geismar. First of all, on the ethane side, I think that we're pleased to see the big petchems continuing to see the same opportunity we see in terms of being able to export ethylene derivative products and having a very low-cost feedstock here in the U.S. to continue to provide that. And so I think it's really going to be a matter of timing in terms of when those facilities come up versus when the ethane shows up. But I will tell you that it is going to take a lot of the ethane projects and ethane supplies aren't going to show up tomorrow either. There's a lot of infrastructure required to get that ethane in place as well. So I think it's going to be a matter of how those things show up. ", "But on balance, it looks pretty good from our vantage point in terms of the demand picking up with the available supply. And I would tell you that there's also going to be a lot of interim small projects. We announced our own small project there that we had at Geismar. I think we spent $18 million and got a small, I think a 3,000 to 5,000-barrel a day increase in ethane demand there. And there's going to be a lot of those kind of projects that continue to come out and what used to be referred to as refinery tree. We're going to see in the petchem space as well because the margins are absolutely there, and so I think those short-term kind of increases that people can squeeze out of their facilities, they're going to be doing. So I think -- hopefully that answered your question. I apologize, we couldn't quite hear it on this end.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Mainly, I was trying to figure out if the increase from the big petchem guys would be an opportunity for Geismar, i.e, they would be an offtake of Geismar or if its direct competition to Geismar.", "Alan Armstrong", "Those plans really are, at least what's been announced for the most part, is direct competition with Geismar, in terms of producing ethylene. But I would tell you that beyond the ethylene, obviously, is derivatives like polyethylene and ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, and those derivatives are a lot less capital intensive. The facilities required for that are a lot less capital-intensive, and we're pretty well-positioned there at Geismar. There's a lot of growing derivative demand there at Geismar, and we're very well-positioned to be able to deliver against that. And we certainly have a lot of conversations going with folks that are wanting to expand the offtake there.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Great, and then one other question if I could, just with respect to natural gas liquids production. I know there was a mention of a keep-whole contract that shifted a percent of proceeds, so I could understand why your equity production may have been down slightly, but from sort of the gross NGL has produced, I was surprised to see that sequentially off from fourth quarter and didn't know if you could maybe comment as to where you saw that going for the rest of the year.", "Alan Armstrong", "I'm going to have Rory Miller take that one, Carl.", "Rory Miller", "Carl, that's true, we are down first quarter. Other than the Exxon contract -- excuse me, some of the contracting issues that we had out there, that's a big part of the step down in production. But the other items, I would say, were our severe winter weather. We were down significantly at Opal in our volumes, Echo Springs and in Four Corners. So that had a pretty big impact on our total production and of course, our equity and NGL balance as well. We also had some major maintenance that was underway at Opal, and that's has been finished. And so we expect to see volumes in the second quarter back on the growth trajectory that we had planned and we forecast.", "Operator", "For our next question, we'll go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "First question is just on some of your Canadian spending. You talked about additional upgrade or processing, potentially adding a lot more project spending there. You've identified some spending. But I'm just wondering if you would expect to see the same returns on that or what the variability might be on the returns if you were to add on some of that greater processing?", "Alan Armstrong", "The opportunity is there and/or returns there probably will remain the same. I will tell you that I would kind of put them into maybe 4 different baskets of opportunities up there. And if you'll look at our slides, I think it's Slide 18 in our package, you'll see there we've got some of the segment profit, first year segment profits of those projects versus the capital shown there. And you'll see, for instance, the first category I would put as an optimization project, like our BB splitter, and you'll see there that's about a 3x cash flow kind of project. We invested $52 million, and our range is $15 million to $20 million in segment profits for the first year there.  And so those kind of projects will be very high returns like that. The Boreal pipeline you'll see is quite a bit lower return, and part of that is just because we were building for capacity for the future, and all you see there is just the first-year volumes before these additional projects come on. But I would expect those kind of projects to be in the low teens kind of returns for those pipeline kind of projects. And then the upgrader projects, where we actually are going in and building new upgraders, will be a matter of negotiation but are driven by a very high propylene margins. So there's quite a bit of opportunity there for us to capture, and it really boils down to how much we share with the upgrader. And we're in very good competitive position there in that we've got the pipeline now and the fractionator there at Redwater. But those would be probably in the high teens kind of returns.  And then the ethane recovery project that we did with Nova, not going to comment on that in terms of where that return is, but you can see what we expect for our first-year profit on that versus the capital investment on that. And you'll see that's about a little  over a 5 multiple in terms of what we're getting from that project. So I think that gives you a pretty good range of our expectations in that area, and we're certainly anxious to get more of that business up there.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then my other question was just -- if you look the dividend at WMB, and I appreciate the language that you expect strong increases beyond 2012. You raised the guidance at WPZ. Olefins and Canada are all doing well, so there's a lot of cash that's going to be coming out of WMB. I'm just wondering if you can comment on where you might see the growth in the dividend, whether it's even higher even in 2012 or as we go past 2012.", "Donald Chappel", "Ted, this is Don Chappel. I'll take a stab at it first here, again. A lot of the upgrade in our guidance is related to very strong commodity price, and we certainly don't count on that when we set WPC distribution and count on that for our Williams' dividends. So we really look at a much lower price margin environment as we think about WPC distributions and the Williams' dividend. So that would really guide our thinking, but even at that level, I think the 10% to 15% that we provided for guidance in '12 and strong growth beyond is still, we believe, is a conservative view of what we can accomplish. So we'll continue to look at it. We certainly appreciate that our stock price will, in large part, be driven by our ability to pay an increase of dividend, and we'll remain very focused on that. So I'd say, stay tuned beyond that.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So I guess -- and it's probably early to talk about this. If you did have, let's say, excess returns on margins for, let's say the next couple, 3 years, would you then flip over to a buyback, or what would you do with the excess cash?", "Donald Chappel", "Ted, I think stock buyback would certainly be in the cards. I think, again, we're blessed with a lot of very attractive investment opportunities, so I think it'll be continuously weighing the potential reinvestment opportunities versus stock buyback. And again, if it was a more sustainable cash flow stream, and then dividend would be the likely outcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next we'll go to Tim Schneider with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "It's Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Alan, on the -- going back to the Canadian business for a second. How do you guys go about capturing some of the existing barrels in operation in Canada? You guys have put together this slide where you show the barrels that you guys are currently recovering right now in the midst of the NGL and olefins volumes in Canada, and the future barrels that are coming online. But there's this large kind of yellow sliver that still can be captured. What's your status in negotiation in kind of capturing some of those barrels and moving some of those projects forward and where are you in that timeline?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. Great, great question, Faisel. That yellow is -- basically represents the barrels from the existing upgraders as you picked up on, which is CNRL and Syncrude. And we're pretty far along. These are big projects and complicated and things don't move real briskly on that front, but we're confident in ultimately the liquids being lifted from those streams. It really doesn't make any sense at all not to because it produces higher emissions in the air, which is obviously a critical issue as well. There's a tremendous amount of value being burnt there as that gas today is being consumed in boilers. So there's a real big opportunity to get that and then the real question just boils down to who gets it and extracts it. ", "So I have great confidence in that yellow being captured. And I would just tell you, I think we are very well-positioned to capture that, and negotiations are ongoing on both fronts. I would tell you the CNRL negotiations are ahead of the Syncrude negotiations. That's about as much as I can care to share with you on that at this point.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "And can you give us an update on your kind of your dry-tree spar product in the deep gulf, and where are you with negotiation with customers on that particular product for that solution?", "Rory Miller", "This is Rory Miller. I'll take that question. That's actually a wet-tree spar that we're calling GulfStar project. I think there was an announcement that came out last week from Gulf Marine that mentioned they'd entered into an agreement with us to build a spar hole in the Gulf of Mexico, and that is correct. We have a letter of agreement signed with a couple of producers in the Gulf. We are not at liberty right now to reveal who those players are, but that is in place. The letter of agreement includes a reimbursement provision, so we can start spending money today on long lead-time items on major construction contracts and pipe contracts in anticipation of signing definitive agreements.  We're looking at probably a third quarter signing of those definitive agreements. So that is moving ahead. That would be our first GulfStar project. I think we mentioned the last call the connection pipeline, those are around $1 billion a piece. And on this particular project, we're looking at bringing in a JV partner, so I think in all the guidance numbers that we're giving, the capital is about half of that number. So that project has been in the works for a long time. We've been able to get much of the engineering, much of the design work and much of the critical thinking done on that product done ahead of time so that we're not parallel-pathing a lot of engineering and construction at the same time. So we think that's going to reduce a lot of the construction risk on that project, and we're very excited about that. So in terms of more details, though, as to the counterparties, that's probably going to be more of a third quarter type of announcement.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "And I wonder if I could ask a question on the E&P operation, is that a possibility? Or is that kind of off limits right now?", "Rory Miller", "Go ahead and ask your question.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "I was wondering if you could kind of give us an update on what's going on with Apco Oil and Gas? Kind of what's going on with the operations there? What kind of opportunities do you see down in South America, specifically in Argentina, that seems to be a lot of the focus right now in terms of resource potential. I'm just trying to get our guys' idea of how that is taking place.", "Ralph Hill", "This is Ralph. Well, we've got several things we're doing. Obviously, we're with Apco and the Entre Lomas concession. We continue to do well in our major concessions down there, which is the Entre Lomas, the Bajada del Palo, and Agua de Marga. We also are in the process of testing some recompletion in that area of the Bakken Norte Shale, and we're just in the early stages of that. It's an old vertical well that we're testing, and we have a substantial amount of acreage that is exposed to the Bakken Norte and we look forward to continue to test that acreage as we move through. Early on, we'll just be testing some vertical wells in the Gulf, and then we'll do some horizontal drilling also as we find areas that we like.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.", "Holly Stewart", "First, couple of questions for Ralph. Ralph, the Marcellus volumes are, I think, still a little bit light. Can you just walk us through the infrastructure constraints? Is it just the laser pipeline? And then maybe some specifics on where those 5 rigs are currently working right now?", "Ralph Hill", "Holly, basically it's a combination of waiting on laser and also some waiting on infrastructure in the Westmoreland and Centre Counties. And those, the Westmoreland and Centre County are in the process -- they will be fixed here, most of that, in the very near future. So about half of our 30-some wells that we're waiting on completion are in that area, so we look forward to those coming on. In fact, had 2 wells come on in what's called a U-shack area just over the weekend. So we do believe, as we said in the -- on our slides that production should ramp up rapidly as we alleviate the concerns of the transportation, particularly the laser pipeline comes on it. I think we put that we would have a total volumes -- and just Susquehanna by the end of the year is 70 million a day, so we look for a rapid ramp up.  Our wells, our rigs right now are operating in the -- 1 in Susquehanna and the others are -- 1 in Columbia County and the Geismar and Westmoreland, Centre and Clearfield Counties.", "Holly Stewart", "Is there like a well backlog number that you have? Maybe a number of wells that has been drilled and not frac-ed or drilled and just awaiting hook up that we can kind of continue to model this ramp?", "Ralph Hill", "Yes. We have about a total of, I believe, 25 wells that are waiting on completion and have a total of -- in the 30s. They're waiting on either -- in addition to completion on our pipeline facilities. So when I say waiting on completion, even if we completed them, there's a lot that we have to do on the facility side. So the total backlogged wells is currently 31 wells.", "Holly Stewart", "And then just maybe a bigger picture question for Alan. Do you guys have an internal forecast at this point of what you expect the ramping ethane supply, say maybe between now and 2014?", "Alan Armstrong", "We don't have a specific number. We watch that and we watch that balance very closely, but we do not have a specific volume forecast for that, so the answer to your question is no. I would tell you that we remain pretty confident in -- as I said earlier, in the creep that will go on in all of these facilities that are either heavy crackers, continuing to convert to light, and there's still a lot of efficiency being gained in that area. And I think we'll see that for the next couple of years. And again, as I mentioned, projects like our own at Geismar. And so I think we'll continue to see that, and then I think those big projects in the 3 to 4-year timeframe, those big projects will start to kick in. Some of those projects that have been announced are very large-scale projects and will take a long time. ", "In between those 2 things, there's also going to be I think expansions to existing facilities that will be rather significant. And I think the current margin environment and the confidence in crude to gas right now is going to continue to have people investing in that space as well. And so I think it's rare that we have on the ethane and ethylene side, ethylene cracking, it's rare that we see the 2 things build at the same time. But because the margins in this environment, the margins are so strong in both spaces, I think we'll continue to see the ethane supplies build, and I think we'll continue to see the ethane cracking capabilities build as well. And there may be a few rocky steps here and there, but right now the trajectory looks pretty good.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Good quarter. A couple of quick questions about de-risking from a commodity risk standpoint. Alan, you've been talking for some months about the possibility of finding long-term ethane off-takers with the petrochems, but in some of the more recent earnings calls, industry peers kind of commented something similar to what you've just said that, that it's not overly tight, it's not overly loose, but the petrochems see sufficient supply at this time with no immediate need for long-term bilateral contracting. Can you comment on this and whether you see a different line of thinking from the petrochems as some of them contemplate some of these larger greenfield construction projects of worldscale crackers.", "Alan Armstrong", "I certainly think the folks that we talk to, and of course, we have our own vantage point via our own petchem space there. But I certainly think that the investors in that space recognize that there's very high margins right now available to them, and I think they are leery of seeing the demand get overheated in the space right now. And so, if I can just tell you folks that we continue to talk to and continue to work towards some structured arrangements like that are obviously very concerned about long-term supplies. And I think the effort that I think is the smart decision for the industry to look at is to look to the total pie between gas and crude, and that comes back to gas to polyethylene or other ethylene derivatives. And to figure out how they can assure themselves a portion of that margin that allows them to invest in infrastructure going forward that's got more stable earnings behind it, rather than a winner and a loser across that chain but figuring out how that margin can be shared in a way that allows both parties to invest going forward in a very adequate return that exists out there.  And I hope, I certainly think, that the current margin environment in both those sectors doesn't lead to arrogance that will cause people to forget the past. And certainly right -- I know the folks we're talking to, anyway and are interested in working with, I don't think that's the case.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "In terms of the timeline, I think last call or the one before, you may have mentioned that it certainly wouldn't be before second half of this year, possibly into early next year that we see some long-term agreement if it came. Is that timeline still there or is it maybe being pushed out a little bit?", "Alan Armstrong", "I would say we're up against those discussions, and it's kind of hard to call the counterparties' moves on those. I can tell you there's nothing imminent at this point in time, and we would certainly have liked for it to be there, but there's nothing imminent at this point in time. But again, I think the motives are strong for the players, and we'll continue to push in that direction. Obviously, one of the options we have is to do similar arrangements with our own ethylene cracking and look to margin sharing at the MB level and so those are the kind of things that keep us from being too soft in our negotiations is our ability to do it ourselves there at our Geismar facility.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Understood. And last question, given the international demand and competitive global pricing versus global opportunities in the olefin space, do you have the ability to de-risk pricing volatility for the Olefins business as well?", "Alan Armstrong", "You know, that's starting to be explored by folks. You're starting to see a lot of people that are exploiting their contacts in India and China and places like that where the demand continues to grow and so I would keep tuned to that space. That's a great question and I'll tell you that's where a lot of the air traffic is right now is between India and China in the petchem space and a little bit of South America as well with people wanting to make sure that they can shore up those markets and have some risk reduction in those forward-looking markets out there. So there is a lot going on but it's brand-new and most of those -- a lot of that buyers on that end aren't used to doing these longer-term structured contracts so even though there's a desire and a need there, there really hasn't been a blueprint there in the past. So there's some new ground being broken in that area but you're spot on with kind of where the thinking is going in that area.", "Operator", "Your next question will go to Kingston Capital, Christoph Seifert [ph].", "Unknown Analyst - ", "First question relates to the Midstream Canada business. It saw the $111 million in gross profit and obviously, the volumes coming out of Geismar are a lot higher than out of Canada. But just wondered if you could have named just in general rough numbers  how much the gross profit is from Canadian propylene versus Canadian NGLs and versus Geismar.", "Rory Miller", "Yes, this is Rory. You're breaking up a little bit there. But I think what I heard is that you were looking at the breakdown between the Canadian and the Geismar plant. Is that correct?", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Yes, exactly.", "Rory Miller", "I don't think we're -- we didn't include that in the book and I think at this point we're not prepared to provide that. We've got a small number of contracts at this point and we feel like that's probably a little too much transparency.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. Maybe just kind of directionally then on how margins compare at -- just very broadly between an ethylene cracker on  the Gulf Coast and on the Canadian Olefins business.", "Rory Miller", "I think there is a Slide in here that does a pretty good job of that. It's titled, \"The Canadian Operations Focusing Feedstock Cost Advantage.\" And that's in the floor. It kind of shows the difference between the margin processing the off gas up in Canada versus buying ethane and cracking it, which is the business that we're doing down at Geismar. So the total uplift is about -- and this is a rough estimate, about 2/3 -- well not -- let's say a 150% better than what we would see down in Geismar.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. And then with respect to the growth in Canada, do you expect that it'll be able to fund itself or do you need to divert cash from WMB to pay for it?", "Rory Miller", "The business up there, as you can see by the numbers, is performing really well. I think at this point our cash demands aren't going to be totally funded by cash flow up there, but a very large portion of it is going to be paid out of current earnings. We also have some offshore accounts that we'll use to fund international investments like Canada. And so for the most part, we think we're going to be able to handle that load with dollars that probably wouldn't be available for the dividends anyway.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "I guess just lastly maybe a broader question related to WPC and the coverage ratio, I just wondered if you could comment broadly how you see that evolving over time and I think maybe that excess cash at PZ because you set the dividend based on lower commodity assumption. If you'd do a special dividend or do you continue to fund your growth through stock and debt at PZ as you've historically done.", "Donald Chappel", "This is Don Chappel. I would say that we just don't foresee a situation in which it's likely that PZ is going to build cash. Since we have such abundant growth opportunities, I think the excess earnings will just be reinvested, which will reduce our needs to go to the capital markets to raise capital at PZ. So I would say with the high margins, PZ becomes more self-funding, not to say that the plan won't require outside financing but all that excess cash to the extent that it's at a level -- it's based on margins that are at a level that we don't think are prudent to build into distributions will just be reinvested so we don't see idle cash sitting at PZ at all.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "And then with respect to whatever your view is on normalized commodity margins, what kind of distribution ratio or coverage ratio rather do you think is appropriate to target at PZ over time?", "Donald Chappel", "I'd say it's a function of business mix and we're continuing to slowly add more and more key business in the Midstream business. Not to say that we're not adding commodity exposure as well, but proportionately, we're adding -- focused on adding a bit more on the fee side than we are on the commodity side. So we would expect our Fee business to creep as a percentage of the total, which will enable us to, over time, have a lower coverage margin. Then it's a function of how comfortable are we with margins. So I think it depends where we are in the range and at what moment in time but we'd certainly like to see that drift down. I think right now, we're kind of looking at a kind of 1.2x coverage under something that might have been more like the beginning of the year margins versus what we're seeing today.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Harry Mateer with Barclays Capital.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital", "I think it relates to the prior questions on usage of cash, but can you just talk about what you view as the optimal capital structure up at the WMB level? I think given all the cash you have coming in there, you could certainly take out a lot of debt, and I know, you've stated publicly, you do you plan to take out debt. How much debt reduction should we be thinking about versus other uses of cash up at the WMB entity?", "Donald Chappel", "Craig, I don't think we want to speak our thoughts on that given that we have some pending transactions including the WPX transaction. But I would say again, we're targeting capital structure that would put us at that BBB minus level, so investment grade, with PZ being a bit higher as we announced back in February. And the ratings agencies gave some guidance on as well. So that's the capital structure and I think you can probably do the modeling to figure out what band that puts us in.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital", "And in terms of other uses of cash...", "Donald Chappel", "We'll be more clear on that after the IPO.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital", "Okay, and then in terms of other uses of cash, are acquisitions possible at WMB in the future? How should we think about other calls on cash down the road besides just a high dividend yield?", "Donald Chappel", "I would say that acquisitions are possible, but certainly they'll be competing against a very clear and transparent dividend value uplift, but nonetheless, again, we think that we have plenty of opportunities or potential opportunities, at least, to look at. But right now, we have nothing particular in our sights other than some modest investment opportunities around the U.S. Olefins business.", "Operator", "It does appear that there are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the conference over to Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.", "Alan Armstrong", "Okay, well great. Well, thank you for the great questions this morning and appreciate the folks tuning in and being prepared from the information we put out last night. We look forward to your feedback on this different format and see if that was helpful to you or not. And so I just want to, again, say thanks for your interest in the company. We're very excited about where we're positioned right now, really across all front, and are looking forward to being a little more transparent with you, obviously, once the WPX Energy IPO is concluded and we'll be in a position to be a lot clearer around dividend and corporate structure at that point. So with that, thank you, and have a great day.", "Operator", "Once again, that does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Sharna Reingold, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Sharna Reingold", "All right. Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Williams second quarter 2011 earnings call. As always, thank you for your interest in the company. As you know, we released our results on August 3 after the market closed. Yesterday, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, had some commentary about our results. This audio commentary and slides are available on our website, williams.com, that we will not be reviewing our slides this morning. In a minute, Alan will make some brief remarks, and we will open the line for questions. Please be aware that Don Chappel, Ralph Hill, Rory Miller, and Randy Bernard are all available for any questions. ", "Please note that all the slides are available on our website, www.williams.com. There are forward-looking statements on Slides 2 and 3 and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide 4 of yesterday's presentation. They are important and integral to the company, and you should review those slides.  Also included in the presentation yesterday are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to measures included in generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules and related information are included in the slides available on our website, williams.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great, thank you, Sharna, and good morning. Thanks for joining us this morning in such a busy time in the markets. We certainly did experience a great second quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share was up 39%. We are increasing our full year earnings outlook based on the strength of the first and second quarter, and all of our business segments contributed to the gains that we had in this period. ", "While all our business segments are performing very well and growing according to plans, we also continue to work hard on restructurings at the corporate level to unlock value for our shareholders. As you're well aware, our WPX IPO, which I'll comment on in just a moment, continues to move ahead. And we are moving to a growing dividend company and expect that value to unlock significant shareholder value for WMB. Our WPZ Holdings and our Canadian midstream olefins give us a very clear line of sight to this sustainable growth for the WMB dividends for years to come. ", "We continue to be very focused on maintaining our investment grade credit and maintaining a very conservative approach to managing our margins within our WPZ segment. And this gives us a very clear growth trajectory and also gives us a very clear backlog. We have a very clear backlog of the great projects and we're very excited about for our future. So we've got great situations. We sit here today and we also have great transparency about where our growth is coming from. So we really continue to be very excited about how we're positioned today in these markets. ", "And so, before taking your questions though, I do want to briefly address our previously announced proposal to acquire Southern Union Company. But this time, Williams continues to closely monitor the situation and we are evaluating all of our options.  We won't have any further comments today regarding Southern Union or the agreement they have with Energy Transfer. ", "I also have a few brief comments about our planned IPO of WPX Energy. We are ready to go with the WPX Energy IPO so as soon as market conditions are cooperative, we will be prepared to launch that.  At this point, we still plan to get the IPO done in the third quarter and full spin no later than the first quarter of 2012. ", "So as a reminder though, the purpose of our call today is to discuss our very strong financial and operational performance in the second quarter and our new higher guidance for 2011. We intend to keep today's call focused on those topics, and so I appreciate your cooperation on that.", "We can now open the call for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just a very quick clarification, if I could, on the WPX IPO, because you just said market conditions are cooperative. Does that mean the SEC has declared it effective? I hadn't looked at that but I just want to make sure that that's not the hold up. It's now just more of your decision on when to go?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, it is just our decision on when we're ready to go. That is correct.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Fair enough. The questions from the quarter I guess really were twofold, really, on the Canada and the olefin side. And I guess on the olefin side, you had mentioned that it looks like we are going forward with an expansion of Geismar at least as far as some of the project capital that is now being put into the guidance. And I was wondering if you could give us a better sense of how you're approaching risk management to that kind of project with respect to ethylene prices going forward. Is part of doing this expansion an offtake agreement with someone, or how should we think about risk management in terms of the Geismar expansion?", "Alan Armstrong", "Sure, I would just first say that remember that on the ethane basis, we're still long ethane as Williams. And so that project actually gives us some hedge on the ethane pricing all the way through the ethylene margins. So as we've said before, we're fairly confident in the gas-to-crude ratio remaining and we're fairly confident in ethane continuing to be a favored feedstock. And ethylene continuing to have strength in the markets. What we're not so confident in is about who makes, who gets what cut of that pie. And so by having ourselves positioned all the way between the gas all the way to the ethylene, we feel like we're de-risking some of those margins and making sure that we're not getting somebody else stuck in between us and the full margin spread there. Having said that, we are talking to a number of parties about offtake agreements. And there is a lot of interest around that kind of project. We already have embedded in that.", "Rory Miller", "Yes, the other thing I would say is there have been a lot of announced projects. Probably they're not all going to get built, but a number of them can. And I think in terms of the Q, in terms of when this expansion could get placed, we think we are probably in the next tranche to pass it and come into the markets. So we think timing is right, and that there's a window of opportunity for us ahead of the other announced projects.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And, Rory, I'm sorry. Have you guys actually announced either the magnitude or when the expansion would be in service?", "Rory Miller", "We've not formally announced that. I think Alan mentioned it in the call in the pre-recorded reported comments. But it's about a 40% plus increase in capacity there at Geismar. And we're shooting for some time, probably late 2013, for in-service. But as Alan mentioned, that will be going before the board in September.", "Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Great. And then last question if I could, just on the Canadian side, with the olefins and the upgrader, it looks like more project capital is going to go into the upgraders as well. How should we, in that table we had the project capital, you guys also have been pretty good at laying out expected EBITDA and the like. Obviously it's a little premature at this stage. But should we be thinking about return potential in sort of the same ZIP code as say, for instance, the ethane recovery and kind of the 5 to 6x EBITDA deployment? Or can you give us a better sense of how we should be thinking about that deployed capital?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, I think the returns on the new projects are going to be generally in that same [indiscernible].  It's what we've seen so far.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley", "I really appreciated that you can't really talk about the subsituation you're monitoring. I wanted to offer if I could now one very high-level question. Do you feel -- when will we expect possibly to hear something, timing wise or do you feel you're up against the cost timing wise to either say we're involved or we're going to try and do something, or we're going to move on?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, Steve, you know as I said, we certainly are going to be a disciplined buyer. We certainly have exciting prospects for growth and value creation in our existing strategy in executing our existing strategy and our plan to separate off our E&P business as well. And so as I mentioned earlier though, we're going to try and address this call in the second quarter results and outlook. And so it's hard to get into a conversation without waiting outside of the strict script on that so I...", "Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. No, I appreciate that. Maybe you can talk a little bit on just with the weakness recently in oil prices and how should we be thinking about that impact on when we may be start to see switching, or moving away from use of ethane?", "Alan Armstrong", "Sorry, Steve. If you -- I don't think we quite understood the basis of your question there.", "Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley", "Just wondering if we're going to start to see, with the weaker oil price environment from your vantage point in the midstream side, are you going to start to see a move away from petrochemicals using ethane as a feedstock? Have you started to get indications of that? How do you think about that over the next couple of quarters?", "Alan Armstrong", "I think we've got a long ways to go before we get into that territory. Remember gas has moved down as well. And so, I don't think we're anywhere near that kind of ratio that we would get to that. We have seen situations where gas oil is at times pricing below ethane a little bit. But it's got a long ways to go. If people started getting on that, it would bring that price up pretty quickly as well. So I don't really see that in this, in the $80 price oil environment and the $4 gas. That's still a 20 ratio which used to be something that we wouldn't even dream of. And so, I think we're a long ways from getting to a point where ethane is not the favorite feedstock.", "Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then the final question, can you just talk where you are right now on the next kind of several quarters you see some of the bigger bottlenecks on the oil and liquid side as opportunities for you guys?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, and I do think there's a lot of emerging bottlenecks, and we're seeing them in a lot of different places. And I think there's a lot of infrastructure acquired in the field and we certainly have our eye on some of that. And Ralph's team has certainly done a great job of getting their product moved out of the Bakken. But as that field grows, we certainly think it will continue to grow. We think there's going to continue to be a lot of need for a long term permanent infrastructure in those plays, as well as on the propane and heavies. And just general petchem business in general, there's a lot of shifting of volumes that is happening with this increased volume on both the light NGLs, the heavy NGLs and the olefins products. And so we are positioning ourselves to play and what we think will be a big shift. One of the shifts obviously is Bellevue products, to either locations like the Mississippi River markets. And so, we're certainly right in the middle of opportunities like that and we continue to pursue those.", "Operator", "Okay. Great. Next, we'll go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just going back to the Geismar question. I saw that you signed an agreement with Crosstex for some takeaways -- are you locking in any sort of feedstock costs there or is that just more pipeline services and frac and whatnot?", "Rory Miller", "That is obviously a confidential contract. But it is a way for us, we think, to get some advantage pricing in the river. Alan mentioned some of the bottlenecks out there. We think that that's a going to be a very valuable contract for us, particularly with our Geismar expansion.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, and then just shifting over to E&P, you said you had 70 a day I think that's weighing on the laser pipeline. What kind of exit rate are you thinking about in the Marcellus as we come out of 2011 and then looking at the 2012, I think you said you were going to run 8 rigs in 2012?", "Rory Miller", "I don't think we've given specific by area by basin yet, so I'm not sure if I'm during this period I'm not sure I'm allowed to do that. But clearly, we have a substantial amount of back up in the Marcellus and Laser [ph] field is going to come on in September. We also have in the Westmoreland, Clearfield Centre County areas, there's a backup about another $30 million. So I would need to check and see what we've given out publicly before I can do that. But we obviously have said that in the future we expect the Marcellus to grow to be around when 20% or so of our volumes as we move forward.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the Canadian side, you talked a little bit about the sun greater -- the Suncor, excuse me, upgrade or downtime. How much did it actually hurt you from a volume and a margin perspective in the quarter?", "Alan Armstrong", "It was a pretty big blow from a volume perspective. The good news is the margins were so strong over that period, net-net we were about even with what we've forecasted. So the strong margins definitely helped there. But there's no doubt about it that it's hard to replace 49 days of production.", "Rory Miller", "It's really as simple as 49 days. We normally would see a couple of days of downtime. So you really could call it probably about half from a volume standpoint.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.", "Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil", "I apologize I did not listen to the podcast with the craziness in the market yesterday but and I know you're going to probably talk about it on the WPC call, but can you talk a little bit about Atlantic access project? It looks like that's gearing up again. And can you talk about cost estimates, time of open season, a little more color on that project?", "Randall Barnard", "Yes, I'll be happy to. This is Randy Barnard with the Gas Pipes. We've been out in the market surveying the interest in our project and are very encouraged by the recent visits. It's a predominantly a producer-driven project. It's evolving to recognize the different geographies of the source or the supply; also evolving to recognize the different timing of in-service needs for the various potential shippers. Bottom line is we think we could have a project to announce by Q4 of this year. Open season within the next 2 to 3 months, bore outs expiring October for shippers and a month later for ourselves. A possible slippage into Q1 next year, but it's very encouraging right now for a late this year announcement.", "Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil", "Any ballpark cost estimate?", "Randall Barnard", "It's in the neighborhood of $1.4 billion. But like I said, it's evolving. We may phase the project and there may be some telescope capacity. So as we refine it, that number could move. The slide -- once you get around to looking at the slides that were placed on our website, you will see that we have categorized the potential opportunities of the gas pipeline at around $1.7 billion. $1.3 billion of investment in guidance, $1.7 billion, if possible. And Atlantic access is the lion's share about $1.7 billion.", "Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil", "Okay. Yes, I saw the ones over at the WPZ. And is part of that a reversal of flow on Transco and just looking at the slides there's an arrow that points down.", "Randall Barnard", "Actually not immediately, but as Marcellus grows, the reversal of flow is truly within the realm of the plumbing there. The growth we expect to Marcellus will outstrip the zone 6 demand eventually. So physical backflows may happen. But what Atlantic access offers to customers initially is firm backhaul opportunities into the Transco zone 5 which its fastest growing markets today. I mean, a lot of PowerGen load coming on incremental and convergent from coal. And so it would be a firm transportation backhaul into zone 5, with some secondary rights into zone 6. And that would take their delivery points all the way down to the Georgia-South Carolina border at the end of the zone 5 Transco which would include Alba island as a potential if it's ever reversed and it includes cold point and everything in between.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Michael Karsch with Karsch Capital.", "Michael Karsch", "Two questions, my first one is on the IPO. If market conditions are not suitable, what could you just go right to the spin instead of having to do both steps?", "Donald Chappel", "Michael, Don Chappel, good morning. Yes, we could. Again our current plan is to continue with the 2-step process IPO, hopefully this quarter followed by complete spinoff not later than the first quarter but we certainly could change those plans if the market conditions remain challenging.", "Michael Karsch", "And then I guess the second question, I won't make it specific to the SUG acquisition, I'll ask it overall. If you bought an a company which you envisioned dropping down to WPZ, a substantial amount of assets which required an equity raise at WPZ, how do you think about -- let's just say that acquisition takes some period of time to close, how do you think about the accretion when your stock price could move, your WPZ stock price, can move very substantially between the time you agreed to a deal and the close? Are there ways to mitigate that exposure?", "Rory Miller", "Michael, I think as a follow-up to Alan's comments I don't think we want to go into the Southern Union example, but I mean, clearly, we're looking at that with every capital project that we put on...", "Michael Karsch", "Exactly, that's why I asked it generically. I guess what I'm asking is you have 2 structures. If you felt like WPZ stock was down too much, could you just hold the assets for a longer period of time at the WMB level and not feel like you have to issue equity to WPZ level.", "Rory Miller", "I would just say I think we have a lot of flexibility and the situation is different. And we're faced with changing markets on regular basis. Good news is again WPZ has a good strong base of assets and earnings and cash flows and great growth. We think it'll be a security that investors show strong preference to, we've great coverage. So we think it will outperform the MLP space. But there will be times when it's the whole market is tough and the MLP market's tough too. So we'll look to have contingency plans in everything we do.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Bradley Olsen from Tudor, Pickering & Holt.", "Bradley Olsen", "You mentioned earlier on the call the fact that as a company, your long ethane and just to kind of hit on that, that Crosstex Geismar agreement, what was the thought process, I guess, strategically when you are thinking about whether to supply Geismar with ethane from a third party versus ethane from either WPZ or from the WPX business?", "Rory Miller", "Yes, I think looking at that Crosstex deal, an opportunity to see a new pipeline built from Bellevue to the river area or at least to a point that it could get into our ethane system would be a great opportunity for us. Crosstex has got the kind of energy and the will to get that done. And it was way to help to get that project going and help make that a reality. We think that also is going to give us a preferred ethane price on the river compared to the other transportation options. And so for us, it seemed like kind of a no-brainer. They have the will to do it, they had some latent assets there that they can put back to use at Eunice, so it was a very good fit for us and we want to support it.", "Alan Armstrong", "I would also mention there that when we say we're long ethane, obviously that is at various cleared markets. And so as long as those markets are connected and fairly liquid between the spots, we're not obviously focused on just moving our molecules of ethane into our locations. So it's more a commercial link than it is actual physical molecules. We're concerned about managing.", "Bradley Olsen", "Okay. As far as the comment that it was good to see a new pipeline from Bellevue built into the region, does that imply that you guys were concerned about potentially being short-ethane in the absence of that Cajun-Sibon extension?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, more is always better if you're buying ethane. And so there's been a pretty significant delta and price between those 2 points, and this was an opportunity really to close some of that gap.", "Bradley Olsen", "Okay. And just jumping to the Marcellus, it looked like there was, on the wet cash, you mentioned that CapEx budget was slipping a little bit in 2011. Is that associated with some slippage and the timing of Marcellus projects? And I guess to that, if it is related to that, if you could maybe just discuss the kind of state of permitting up in Pennsylvania, and whether you've come to an agreement on where Springville is going to enter Transco.", "Rory Miller", "Yes, just some general comments about Construction in the Marcellus, it is one of the tougher places in the country to build pipeline. The geography there is obviously not flat anywhere across the basin. There's a lot of farming, a lot of human interaction in almost every mile of pipe you build. And so the other thing I would add too around permitting is you have to deal with the townships there as well. So there's another level of permitting that you have to go through, which adds some complexity to it. The area in general has not seen the kind of activity that they\u2019re seeing now, ever. And so, there is a lot of change in the rules, if you will, that adds complexity as well. So it has been a challenge I think over the last 2 years. We certainly perfected our model around how to execute significantly. But nevertheless, things are moving more slowly than we would like. I think it's the same on the producer side as well. Everything is a little more challenging to do in Pennsylvania than it is, say, in the highlands of Wyoming. So it is a challenge, and we think we're making good progress on it. But nevertheless, there's some slippage. It's not any indication of the quality of wells or the success up there, which has been phenomenal so far, particularly up in the Northeast area, all of the performances exceeded what we had in our plans. So we're delighted with the quality of wells, but the construction is the top spot. On Springville, we got all our major permits at hand that we need to get that pipeline built. We're under construction right now. We're clearing right away. We've got the major work going on the compressor stations. We have all of our permits in hand for our major bores that we got to do, some waterways and some roads. So everything that's on a critical path right now, we have a permit in hand for it. So that's moving nicely. We do have a couple of minor issues we're working out on the tie and point to Transco, but we're confident that going to be resolved shortly.", "Bradley Olsen", "And so you guys are still confident that Springville is a late 2011 event?", "Rory Miller", "Yes, we're looking at late 2011.", "Operator", "And we'll now we'll take our last question with Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I guess, given the potential for a weaker economic environment and even potentially a double-dip recession, how do you think that would impact, I guess, the petchem's willingness to build steam crackers? Do you think that might delay the timing of their decision? And if so, could the market be oversupplied with frac capacity?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, that's a very, very complex question, obviously. I would just say, first of all, that the market that all of the new olefin capacity is being built for in North America is not focused in North American markets. It's focused at exports. And so the global economy, obviously, is the thing to keep our eye on there. And expansions around the globe, I think are critical to that. So I do think that obviously, a continued downturn in the economy would have some people backing up. As Rory said, we think we are first in the queue there, so to speak with our planned expansion. But I do think that you'd have people checking and double-checking if we went into another recession like we were in before. There's not much doubt in my mind that, that would be the case. Whether there is ample frac-ing capacity to clear the fractionation capacity that's being built right now, I think it's a pretty complex question. Clearly, the NGL space is building up very rapidly. And there is going to have to be some cracking capacity built to consume that. And so I think it's a great question. I think it's a little early to call that, given the very near-term events we're seeing.", "Operator", "And that's all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Alan Armstrong", "Okay, great. Thank you all very much for joining us. Again, very excited about our second quarter. We continue to be very confident in the balance of '11 and '12 and beyond, given the transparency I think we have to a lot of great projects that we think the fundamentals remain very sound on. And while we didn't hear too much question about the current NGL market today, we can tell you that we remain very confident in the margins as they exist today, partially because of how high the margins got at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter, how high they've been. We've got plenty of room for that to slip down and still be maintaining our guidance. So we really haven't seen the degradation in that market here in the last couple of days that you might be expecting. So we remain very confident about both the third quarter and through the balance of the year and excited about the growth in our businesses and the way those are all executing. And very proud of the way this organization is executing on both running the business, and as well as doing things like preparing for the IPO of WPX Energy. So great efforts around here and great results to show for it. So again, thank you very much for joining us this morning.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference.

Campbell", "Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our third quarter call. As always, thanks for your interest in the company. As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday afternoon after the market closed. Also yesterday, Alan, using a few slides, had some commentary about our results, the new guidance and growth opportunities. That audio commentary and the slides are available on the website.

", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great. Thank you, Travis, and good morning, and thanks for joining us. First of all a great quarter, solid performance and significant growth in all of our segments. And certainly, we're excited that our continued better-than-expected cash flows in our infrastructure business have now provided us with the option to go directly to a spin without an IPO, if we don't see the markets become more stable and supportive of IPO.", "In the quarter, certainly you started to see the benefit of a lot of our projects that we've invested in the last couple of years really starting to kick in. Really across-the-board, the -- certainly, the Bakken's kicking in for E&P. The Perdido Norte project really starting to pick up volumes and help to fill up our Markham facility and as well, our Echo Springs facility that's now just had its 1-year anniversary of the new train being built there. We actually hit a record in the quarter of 41,000 barrels a day and are now operating a little over that. So you should expect to see more of this to come as these projects we've been investing in continue to kick in. Finally, our business really is perfectly positioned to reap the benefits of this U.S. turning to natural gas. I think you're going to continue to hear more and more about that. Our infrastructure will be very well positioned to help arbitrage, the tremendous spread between natural gas and oil-based products and as well, is positioned there to provide services to get natural gas into the critical markets and provide critical access. We're certainly starting to see a lot of strains on the infrastructure in some of the growing basins like the Marcellus, where infrastructure has become critical to getting the production on. So we're very excited about where we're positioned right now and excited to talk to about -- to you about the quarter. So with that, I'll turn it over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jason Gilbert from Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Gilbert - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick question. Post the spin on WPX, you're going to be left with the Williams Hold Co. It's going to have very few assets other than the Canadian Midstream and Olefins, and then the ownership in the Emaltino [ph]. I was wondering, what's your ultimate vision for how this Hold Co. structure is going to look? And is there a need for Williams Hold Co. down the line, or could we expect that to be collapsed at some point?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I'll take that. Well, certainly, Williams Hold Co. will hold the general partner obviously for WPZ, as well as a large number of units for WPZ. And as we've explained in the past, eliminating that would come with pretty significant tax realization. And so we really don't see much reason for doing that. We also see an ability to continue to incubate and use Williams Companies in acquisitions as well when things aren't a perfect fit. So we like having that vehicle there and there's certainly a lot of financial reasons for leaving the Hold Co. in place.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Randy [ph] from Fangles [ph]. It looks like your CapEx in the Midstream, in Canada guidance, is up a decent amount for '12 and '13. You didn't really lower '11. The first may be a timing issue, but maybe just talk to -- I think these numbers are higher than what they were at the analyst day.", "Rory Miller", "Yes, I think most of that change -- this is Rory Miller -- most of that change a result of us having better definition on the capital projects. We've advanced some of the engineering on that and those particular projects that are in guidance are in this negotiation tables have been pushed out. We also have in that same set of pie charts the Geismar expansion, I know you asked specifically about Canada, but the Geismar expansion is in those numbers as well.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Right. So I was asking about the whole segment. So I guess, would you say most of the delta is just Geismar? Or is there other Canadian spend as well?", "Rory Miller", "Yes. I don't think we've added any new Canadian things; it's really just more of refining the cost estimates.", "Donald R. Chappel", "This is Don Chappel. I just, again note that on analyst day, we spoke the Geismar, but it was not yet included in our guidance. So this is the first time we've included the Geismar expansion in our guidance numbers.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. And then if I could just shift over to a couple of questions on E&P. I think your last sort of release, you said you're planning to run 8 to 9 rigs in the Marcellus by year end 2012. You're now saying 6 to 7. Was that just lower rig count just a function of kind of your lowering your gas price forecast or is there anything else going on there?", "Ralph A. Hill", "This is Ralph. It's a function of a little bit lower gas price forecast and living within our means and also, we're much efficient with our new fit-for-purpose rigs than we thought we would be.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just thinking about the Bakken, as those volumes come up. How should we think about your, I guess your takeaway there? What kind of realized prices we should expect, maybe discount to WTI or what kind of realizations there?", "Donald R. Chappel", "We have planned for approximately about a $10 discount and what we're actually seeing is less than that and the last few months is more in the $5 range, but we continue to plan about $10 -- $9.80 I think is what's in the actual data book. And we are at this point through rail, through pipe, through trucking we are keeping up with our production. And we think we have sufficient capacity to continue with our build up of volumes.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay, that's great. And then last one for me. Kind of really to Jason's point was just -- do you anticipate making any incremental debt pay downs now that you're not doing the IPO at the WMB level? Or are you just -- you're comfortable with the debt balances that you have staying there at Hold Co.? I\u2019d just be curious about that. And where do ratings agencies come out as well?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "We're continuing to look at potential debt pay down with proceeds from the notes offering that would be transferred up from Williams. And we're in regular communication with agencies regarding our plans and again, we expect to maintain our investment-grade ratings.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Carl Kirst from BMO Capital Markets.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Actually, maybe the first question just for Ralph. There was a mention, perhaps, of cost pressure going on in the Bakken and that sort of your oil service relationships are helping to hold the line. But I was wondering if you could give us any additional color there.", "Ralph A. Hill", "Well we've established a relationship with Halliburton for our stimulation services dedicated to us. Also for our directional services, we've also contracted for a whole new fleet of rigs, fit-for-purpose rigs. And we've contracted for a rig moving company, so we've taken a lot of the model we had in the Piceance and applied it up there. So while there are cost pressures, since we were so new to basin we feel we've really started to overcome a lot of those and as that model kicks in, we'll continue to drive our costs down. So there is a lot pressure up there, no doubt. But we feel with our relationships with our vendors and our alliances with them, we'll be in good shape.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Is there anyway to quantify that as far as what your expectation is on cost pressure, if you will, maybe 2012, just over today in that region?", "Ralph A. Hill", "I think our data book -- basically, we're talking about $9.5 million wells. We initially planned on those to be less than that. Some people were talking about their well costs are over $10 million, $11 million and we don't think we'll see that. So, I guess -- and we'll be able to hold -- we think we'll be able to hold flat at the $9.5 million, is where we are now and we hope to -- we'd like to see that driven down, but we're not sure yet. But we've been able to reach the $9.5 million. We've already got a couple of new rigs up there. We also have the alliance with our stimulation services.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Great. And then just a question, if I could, on Midstream Canada. Kind of continuing to get our arms around it. I know this is kind of a smaller piece of the business but one thing we noticed that excluding depreciation, the operating cost had a bit of a spike. And again, this is small part of the business, but I didn't know if there was any additional color to be had there.", "Ralph A. Hill", "Yes, we did have more planned maintenance, both in the North and down at Redwater. So I think it was around $10 million of additional maintenance capital that we had in the quarter. So that's probably accounting for what you're seeing.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then last question and, Alan, you knew it was coming, so just to go ahead and ask it. With respect to the Kinder-El Paso M&A, the things we've seen in other company filings. Is there any additional commentary to add to the whole Southern Union situation or should we just kind of take prior comments as is?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I'll clarify but they're not going to be different than prior comments. We continue to be very excited about the infrastructure play here as the U.S. starts to really take advantage of natural gas. And we think that the infrastructure assets are going to play an important role in that, so we continue to be very interested in that and we think we're very well positioned as a company to grow in that space and we'll continue to look aggressively at any opportunity we see out there to do that. So I think you should expect to see us to be continue to be aggressive in that space.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Just following up a little on Carl's question about the M&A environment. Perhaps Alan or Don, a, if you all could take a step back and just talk about the broader competition in the market for assets; and b, the potential impact on your near-term capacities now that perhaps you might have, give or take, maybe $1 billion plus less cash because you may not do the IPO.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Craig, this is Alan. I'd say that lack of IPO proceeds has certainly been something we knew was a possibility during this entire period, so we're not at all surprised by that. And obviously it does make a difference, but I don't think it's going to make any strategic difference in terms of what we pursue. But obviously it is a factor but beyond that, we'll continue to look as assets. I think as Alan has said before, we're disciplined in our approach. Obviously it's a market where there's a lot of competition for assets and where we have unique advantages and we have a lot of such advantages and we'll look to use those.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "It seems that most are looking at acquisition as being, if not immediately accretive on the cash flow basis, at least neutral and then accretive very soon thereafter. From a strategic standpoint in terms of the M&A environment, are you all willing to look at things that, perhaps in the first year, may not help with dividend distributions?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Well I think certainly, there are assets that would be large growth assets in areas that would fit that profile. But for the most part, those are going to be smaller kind of assets that are emerging assets that we would pursue. But we certainly will look to those kind of growth assets in basins like the Marcellus where we feel like we've got great opportunities moving forward and we think we can build a great business there and a great franchise there. So we look at those kind of investments in those areas.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Holly Stewart from Howard Weil.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "First, just kind of following up on the M&A. Sorry to beat a dead horse here. But we did notice, in one of the ETE filings that you were having some conversations to buy some of Southern Union's assets. Is that door now closed?", "Donald R. Chappel", "I wouldn't say that the door is closed, but I would certainly say sub [ph] has been clear in terms of their position on that and in the immediate term. So I think in the immediate term that may be the case, but I don't think for the longer term necessarily. But I would just tell you we continue to be very disciplined on that, and we think we know what they're worth, we think we're the right buyer for a certain portion of those assets and we'll just see where that falls out ultimately.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Perfect. And then maybe one for Ralph. Ralph, kind of just looking at my previous notes, I think you thought that Marcellus would get to 25% of production within the next couple of years. You had some delays on the infrastructure side and you've tweaked your rig count. What's kind of a latest thought process there, in terms of Marcellus?", "Ralph A. Hill", "I think we'll still get to that level in a couple of years. We feel very confident, especially there are -- our results are just starting in Susquehanna because laser's still in the start up phase. But even with a lower rig count, we think we'll be at those levels. I think we're going to be very pleased with the Susquehanna joining, in particular. And our Westmoreland and Clearfield and Centre Counties are also doing better than we thought.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "If you had to break rig count out today up in the Marcellus, where are those rigs distributed?", "Ralph A. Hill", "They're going to be probably -- well we'll get to 4 in Susquehanna, it'll be -- it's rising from 2 to 4. And then the Clearfield -- or the Westmoreland County will have 2 but we may move one down from time to time to the Clearfield and Centre County areas. So really 4 in the Northeast area and 2 in the Centre part.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jusco Yellow [ph] with Tallenger [ph].", "Unknown Analyst - ", "It's actually John Kiani [ph]. Can you talk a little bit about your level of comfort or confidence in eventually moving up to investment-grade rating at the Williams Legacy or stub company post the spin with the leverage you see there versus what you would have expected in an IPO scenario? And then second part to that question is, with the spin being what the current plan is, is there a range or certain area of the growth rate range we should expect for the dividend that's 10% to 15% in the spin scenario, based on what balance sheet and leverage you see versus the original IPO plans?", "Ralph A. Hill", "I'll start with the latter part of your question. Again, the 10% 15% is our guidance on dividend growth, regardless of spin versus IPO. We don't think that, that really moves the needle. In terms of credit rating targets, we're committed to maintain investment-grade ratings. The actual ratings will obviously be determined by the ratings agencies. But we think in terms of business risk and the quality of assets as well as the leverage and the like, we can conserve ourselves to be in a very strong position. But obviously the ratings agencies will decide where they come out based on their own views. But again, we're committed to those ratings. We've seen continuous improvement and we'll see where we go from here.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "I appreciate that. On the dividend growth rate range of 10% to 15%, my question was really does the spin put you in a different area of that range than the IPO would have?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. No, it does not.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. So you feel pretty comfortable with the midpoint in either of the spin or the IPO scenario?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, we do.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kevin Smith from Raymond James.", "Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "With laser pipeline starting up, is all of your Marcellus shut-in production essentially online now? Or where are we at within that space?", "Ralph A. Hill", "No. This is Ralph. Only a couple of wells are online and we have a number of other wells that will be coming online as we prepare our facilities and they prepare the start up. So we actually just are in the process of turning our second well. So we have, I think -- we reported, we think we have about 80 million a day of production that will be coming on over the next several weeks to months as the laser goes to full start up.", "Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. Maybe by year end, are you expecting to essentially know or shut-in volumes other than just maybe the normal amounts from joining completion?", "Ralph A. Hill", "Yes, absolutely. We think will we all -- it'll be normal during completion like you said.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "It looks like Enterprise has secured the commitments for ethane pipeline at the Marcellus. Maybe Alan, if you could talk to how maybe this project would impact the need for blending projects that Williams is contemplating. And also support for the Atlantic access project.", "Rory Miller", "Yes, this is Rory, I'll take that. And our strategy I think, as you alluded to in the Marcellus, is to actively use blending in the basin, particularly with the pipes project that we've got close Atlantic access. We see that as probably the most cost-effective way to do things but we do have a project, I think we've talked about it some at the analyst day, our confluence pipeline that we are proposing is a Williams ethane solution. And that's something that would build a runway to a more complete answer, be it some petrochemical crackers up in the Northeast or be it an alliance such as the one that Enterprise proposed itself. Getting those kind of solutions up there, we see generally is a good thing. If there's a way to unlock value on the ethane commodity for producers out there, they're going to be drilling more. And as they gather and future processor up there, that's good to get the drilling going. So I think any of the solutions up in the Northeast is just a positive from herein.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess based on your volume projections, do you think there's room or necessity for 2 or more of these projects actually get completed?", "Rory Miller", "For the long haul? Ethane pipelines, is that your question?", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That's correct.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Yes. Well right now, I think one is a big first step, but probably the pipeline to Sarnia. I think that MarkWest is working on is probably the first tranche of ethane that gets cleared from the area. If we get one of these long haul pipes to the Gulf Coast, that's probably a bigger tranche of ethane that's cleared. If you do the math, if you look at the Penn State study where they were forecasting I think up to 17.5 Bcf a day in 2020. Yes, you can start doing the math and you probably could get to 2 pipeline projects, but I think that's a long ways down the road and probably so far out in the future that that's not much of a concern right now.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Any update, I guess in terms of securing commitments for the confluence pipeline?", "Rory Miller", "We are talking to a number of producers right now. As with any new project, we don't have any definitive agreements signed. We are getting a lot of interest. It's something that, I guess I would say generally is being well received, producers community out there. So we'll report on that.", "Operator", "And we did get additional question, it comes from Tim Schneider with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Faisel from Citi. Just a quick question on the -- do you have any well results at all, from some of the activities in South America?", "Ralph A. Hill", "We haven't done any Vaca Norte [ph], if that's what you're asking. We're doing our standing drilling in our 3 concessions in Entre Lomas, but we do not have -- we have a couple of vertical tests we're going to do in the Vaca Norte [ph] type but there's no other -- they're not done yet, so not yet.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And Ralph, when will all those tests be done, you think?", "Ralph A. Hill", "We'll do some in early next year I believe. But we're actually kind of monitoring the -- since we have all the acreage already, we're monitoring the progress of other producers and trying to learn from what they're doing and then we'll enter into our program probably at a later date in a more robust program. So we have a couple of vertical wells we'll test probably early next year.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, got you. And then I think previously guys had talked about kind of the target production rate in the Bakken of sort of 20,000 barrels equivalent a day. Where do you think you guys are in that sort of ramp up?", "Ralph A. Hill", "What was -- in what time frame? I'm sorry.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I think it was 2013 or so. I think when you guys first made the transaction it was something along those lines, but maybe I'm mistaken.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I think that was it. I think we would -- currently, we're slightly behind due to delay, with the weather we had, and the start up from all that. But we would expect to gain on that and get close to that level. I don't know the exact date of that, but we feel confident in our production profile going forward.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then just a question on GulfStar, you're now with that -- with the tubular belts kind of being sanctioned. I mean, how does that project kind of move forward for you guys? And is there any sort of update on what that will cost and what kind of contribution that could bring to the Midstream business?", "Rory Miller", "Yes, this is Rory, I'll take that question. Well we had a reimbursement agreement in place with a customer many months before the definitive documents were signed. So the project is well underway, all of the major contracts for fabrication and heavy lift, and installation on the pipelines, those contracts are all signed and in place. We're well on our way, steel is in the yards, things are progressing nicely. So that total cost I want to say is under $1 billion with the pipeline interconnections. I think as we noted, we are still looking at taking on partner for that. So that's probably something that we just want to reiterate, but I don't know if we got anything else on that.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to you for any closing remarks.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Okay, great. Well thank you for joining us this morning and appreciate the great questions you voiced and the interest in our company. And we look forward to telling you about our growth next quarter.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Porter", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams. As you know, yesterday afternoon we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include the press release of our results with related schedules and our analyst package; a presentation on our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our quarterly data book, which contains detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.", "This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments and then we will open the discussion for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our Midstream business; Randy Barnard is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel, is also available to respond to any questions.", "In yesterday's presentation and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to generally excepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great. Thanks, John, and good morning. Thanks for joining us and it's a busy time right now, and so we appreciate you being able to take the time out for us. Well certainly, despite a very disappointing financial performance in the second quarter and significantly lower margin forecast for the balance of '12 and '13, we're very pleased that despite that, we're able to continue to remain confident in our very well-supported dividend growth, which is still at 55% here in 2012 and 20% both in '13 and '14. So a lot of our confidence on that continues to come from the degree of coverage that we've had built into our model, as well as the extraordinary maintenance costs or maintenance capital we have built into PZ right now, and as well a lot of continued strong growth coming from our fee-based business.", "Our second quarter performance was certainly impacted by a rapid decline in NGL prices, but a few things as well. There\u2019s one thing, I think, that isn't always obvious in the way we report is that we also have a pretty significant amount of product that's in transit that is held in pipelines. And of course, that gets remarked each quarter based on the pricing decline. So in fact in this period, we had about $22 million impact on that over and above what you would see in your typical pricing model. So whenever we see prices move down, that gets somewhat accelerated. And when we see it move back the other way, it comes back to us.", "But there were certainly were other factors as well beyond pricing. Some growing pains, the Boreal Pipeline line fill. The high start-up O&M cost associated with the Caiman pipeline -- or sorry, the Caiman acquisition that we now refer to as Ohio Valley and as well, quite a bit of depreciation expense going on with that as well. But we also had higher maintenance costs, which we accelerated some of our work on a lot of our Western plants as we had a third-party fractionator being out during the second quarter that required us to take some of our plants down, so we took advantage of that and accelerated things like a lot of turbine overhauls, embezzled maintenance during the period.", "The good news for the quarter, a 19% increase in our fee-based businesses within our midstream portion of WPZ. And we certainly had great progress on our major project execution going on during the quarter as well. So we remain very confident in the way our model is growing, particularly on the fee-based business side.", "Just commenting quickly on prices. Certainly the second quarter drop that we had from the first and second quarter was over 20% on our NGL margins, and the balance of the year is forecasted to be approximately 30% lower than what we recognized in the first quarter of '12. So we certainly have, in this model we have taken it down to what we're seeing and certainly we expect for prices, particularly on the light-end products, ethane and propane, to be very choppy as we see a lot of new infrastructure and supply coming on of the NGL side, but a bit ahead of a lot of the Petrochemical build out and some of the export build out on the propane side.", "The NGL crude ratios are really what drove us. A lot of folks have thought about this from a crude standpoint, but really the crude price had very little to do with this. And we've got in our forecast, we've got NGL to crude ratio is running at about 40% here through the balance of the year versus historical average of 60% and the almost 57% that we realized in 2011. So certainly that disconnect that we saw on the ethane and propane side is what really damaged the second quarter from a pricing standpoint, and we expect that to continue as the market needs to be balanced on the supply side on both ethane and propane.", "The good news, of course, for Williams is with the Geismar facility. As we're expanding that, we moved away from a lot of the risk on the ethane choppiness. We're not all buried long term on NGLs as much as we are realizing that there's going to be a lot of infrastructure changes going on as this market tries to build out and we think there will be quite a bit of volatility associated with that.", "On the project news, a lot of great efforts going on around the company right now in terms of building out our $9 billion that's in our guidance for CapEx through 2014. The Boreal Pipeline we brought on, this certainly in the second quarter and that was brought on below budget -- below our planned budget, excuse me. And as well, brought in a little ahead of schedule. Our ethane extraction project in Canada is also going very well and that project has been very well executed. So this will really be the third project, the ethane extraction project that we've managed up there, the first being the BB splitter, the Boreal Pipeline and now the ethane extraction project. And our Canadian team continues to do a great job of executing on those projects.", "Likewise in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our GulfStar project is going ahead very nicely, the Keathley Canyon project is doing very well. And I'll tell you, we remain very bullish on the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico as an oil province and we really think that we're very well positioned to provide a lot of the service as the Deepwater comes back.", "The Caiman or Ohio Valley efforts, a lot of effort going on in the build out, people from really all over our systems up there trying to assist with getting that business built out and the tremendous amount of activity going on, a lot of promise. And we're very excited about the way things are going so far on that acquisition.", "The Laurel Mountain Midstream build out, we're getting to the point where we're almost, I can say that we're not constraining production there with the infrastructure. We have, for sometime, a lot of that volume\u2019s been limited by our infrastructure up there as Chevron continues to drill out that acreage. And we're about to get to the point where we'll be out in front of them a little bit with the expansion, so we're excited about that. And then of course, the Geismar expansion continues to go very well and it's well contracted at this point. And the gas pipeline space, the Northeast Supply Link project continues ahead, and as well our Rockway lateral. We are hopeful that we can get a positive response.  That is waiting on a bill in front of Congress, and so we're looking forward to that.", "In addition, we also have a lot of new projects that have been recently announced, the Canadian propane dehydrogenation project, which would be there at our Redwater facility. We think we're extremely well positioned for that project and it's a very nice compliment to our propylene production that we have there today in Canada already. And then the Utica JV that we announced, we're excited about the promise of that, a little early to comment too much on that today, but that JV is completed and we're excited about the promises there. And you'll see in our capital guidance, you'll see that we've added in capital for that JV in terms of our expectation for that.", "We just announced Leidy expansion and really excited about the way that's gone. That project winds up being a very nice project for us in terms of being able to expand along our Leidy system and we think that\u2019ll be both a lower-risk project for us in the immediate term but also provides, we think, a great value to producers and to our markets in giving them great access to the supplies up there. So we're very excited about that. And we certainly haven't shut the door in any way, shape or form on the Atlantic access, but we're not about to go ahead with a very risky build like that without very strong support from the producer community and in terms of contracts that make sense for the kind of return that's allowed in the pipeline basis.", "Finally, the Dalton lateral Mobile Bay South are also projects that are gaining steam here in the second quarter and into the third quarter. And so our backlog continues to mount as does our confidence in our strategy, in our growth, in our dividend. And so with that, I'll turn it over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Kevin Smith with Raymond James.", "Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Can you speak on the Boreal Pipeline, how much that lowered your NGL volumes by this quarter when you started up and to fill it?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes. That was about a $9 million hit to us with the fill.", "Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Got you. No reason that any of that should impact 3Q, right? It's all behind?", "Rory Lee Miller", "I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you repeat that question.", "Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "He ask if it would effect third quarter at all.", "Rory Lee Miller", "I don't think so. The line is full now and so we'll be gearing that, but there shouldn't be any additional hit after that.", "Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then my second question on the Geismar plant, can you kind of talk a little bit about how much EBITDA and cash flow that\u2019s generating right now? And I guess where you are in your CapEx plans for it?", "Rory Lee Miller", "We typically haven't released individual numbers for Geismar. The second part of your question on the CapEx plans. We've got a couple of capital projects going on there right now. We're upgrading some of our furnaces. I think we've got -- that project is partially completed, but is ongoing. And then of course, we've got our major expansion, the plant being serviced in the third quarter of '13. Those are the main CapEx plans for Geismar at this point.", "Operator", "And Bradley Olson with Tudor, Pickering has our next question.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Couple of questions on the Atlantic Access and Leidy announcements. I assume it's safe to say that given that Leidy is kind of running along the existing lateral, that's going to be a higher return project than building out the new laterals to Butler and Natrium would have been.", "Frank J. Ferazzi", "Alan, is that something you\u2019d like me to take?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, Frank, please.", "Frank J. Ferazzi", "Yes. I think as Alan said, the fact that we have existing Leidy Line already there, that the execution risk associated with the new build would be less than a greenfield project. The economics of each of the pieces are going to be a function of the kind of shipper commitments that you get. And so as Alan also said, we're going to continue to monitor the interest along that new greenfield build, and we will proceed with that when we get enough interest from producers to support an economic project. We're just not there for in-service day of 2015, but based on the projections that we've seen on the production in the area, we think at sometime that will make economic sense.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And as far as the Natrium lateral that was canceled, so that moves -- that was kind of designed to move gas out of Southwest PA and Northern West Virginia. Should we view the cancellation or at least the delay of Natrium as having any read throughs for your production forecasts in the part of the Marcellus, where the Ohio Valley assets are also operating?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, I'll take that. No, that is not in any way, shape or form the case. We're very confident in the volumes there and the drilling activity that continues there. I think the producers are fairly confident in the area and are happy to take the prices that they can get on some of the systems that are further to the east over there. And so time will tell if that will hold up in terms of those net backs. But today, I think they are confident that there's adequate takeaway there today. And again, that becomes crowded. Once it becomes crowded, the price will decline. But I think today, as evidenced by the interest, they're pretty comfortable with the current gas markets coming out of that space today.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "That's really helpful. Another one on Transco operations. Looking at -- and I understand that most Transco revenue is firm, but there is a variable component that can move around quarter-to-quarter. And I know that this is a seasonally weaker quarter historically for Transco, but it looks as though there's -- that revenue or EBITDA per Mcf on Transco this quarter was kind of lower than it had been on a year-over-year and a quarter-over-quarter basis. Is that just because the nature of the volumes are just increasingly short haul? And so on a kind of per unit basis, you're seeing revenues decline or was there something operationally with Transco this quarter that made the results a little bit softer there?", "Frank J. Ferazzi", "This is Frank Ferrazi. As you indicated, we do have some costs allocated interruptible transportation and we tend to -- if that can be impacted by changes in seasons. Obviously we're going to do better in the winter there than we're going to do in the summer. There really were no operational issues that occurred in the second quarter that would have resulted in lower earnings.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just one last one. I guess from an accounting perspective, why was it that the accelerated maintenance that you talked about in the Rockies, why did that show up in higher midstream OpEx as opposed to capital? And as a result of that accelerated maintenance, would it be reasonable to expect that maybe the run rate OpEx for the remainder of 2012 would be lower in the midstream segment?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes. That wasn't maintenance capital, it was just O&M that was accelerated. And mainly, we were moving forward from what would otherwise be spent in the third and fourth quarter. So we should see some moderation forward-looking for the rest of the year based on that work that we did.", "Operator", "Moving next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "A couple of questions here. First, a follow-on to Kevin's Boreal question. Was that $9 million hit all expected just for packing the new line or was that inclusive of some impact from the Suncor plant being done?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. That was just from the line pack.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "And what was the impact from the Suncor plant?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Hang on just a second, let me pull that up.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "While that's being looked for, on the prepared comments or the recorded comments, I was a little unclear on what the time frame was, the duration for the underwater ethylene supply contracts that kind of have margins at Geismar versus what the market opportunities really were in the first half?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Those basically timeout pretty well at the end of this year, a little bit of run into '13. But by the end of '13, there's not any residual impact from that. So mostly by the end of '12, most of those contracts runout.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. And then if you're still looking up that Boreal question from Suncor, I had one last follow up here.", "Rory Lee Miller", "Craig, I do have that if you want me to interject that there.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Sure, go ahead.", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes. It looks like it's a little over $4 million for Q2 that was related that Suncor outage.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. So the $9 million was naturally expected because you knew you had to finish the pipeline to fill it. The $4 million is the unexpected, is that a fair statement?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes, that is. And a part of that lapped into Q1 and then part into Q2.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Are now you're talking about the line packing?", "Rory Lee Miller", "I'm talking about the Suncor outage. They had 1 unit for about 15 days and another unit was operating about 75% load. So the $4 million is related just strictly to the Q2 outage and then the $9 million is isolated to just the impact the Boreal Pipeline.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Got you. And the last question, Alan, how do you avoid the issues regarding nonqualified income at PZ with a potential drop-down of Geismar. Because that seemed to be the logical thing all along, somehow that a contractor dropped down to make a true internal operating hedge rather than just a consolidated accounting hedge. But there's always this question of nonqualified income at the MLP. Did you find a way around that?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I would just say that -- I would say we took it head-on and I would say that we're very confident in how we're handling that and time will tell in terms of what gets exposed there about what supports that confidence.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "As far as details on any drop-down, I mean, how eminent do you think that could be?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Craig, this is Don. I think we'd be working through the process with the WPZ complex committee and their advisers, probably expect the closing in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Moving on to Carl Kirst with BMO.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "This is actually just a follow-on to Craig's about the qualifying income and recognizing was only limited, maybe you can say. But I guess regardless of how this is approached, just since this is somewhat of a precedent. Will there be some type of private letter ruling or some clarification from the IRS that kind of sets it in stone?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Again, I would just say that we are very confident in how that's going to be treated and that's really all we want to say about it at this point.", "Donald R. Chappel", "This is Don. I'd just add that again, we think that it's some information that provides a competitive advantage for us, so that's the reason that we're not more clear in terms of the basis for our confidence.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. That latter statement is very helpful, so I appreciate that. And maybe just a couple of follow-ups, one, going back to the accelerated maintenance that was done on the midstream side. Did that actually, in the third-party fractionator outage, did that have an impact on the equity sales volumes for the quarter? And if so, by how much?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes. It did. We had a total production related kind of directly to the bush and frac outage was about 25 million gallons. And of that, about 15 million was related to our own equity account.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Then one other question just on Geismar, this just goes to the utilization, the 74% utilization kind of on par with second quarter last year, but down sequentially. Was that just normal maintenance for this time of year or was something else going on there?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes. We did in Q2 have a determined issue there that had us down, I believe it was 7 days. One of those days was actually in Q1, and then the remaining 6 days was in Q2. And we were, I think that was related to about 28 million pounds total being down about $24 a day.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Yes, that would explain the difference. Great. And then last question, and this really is just Caiman, Ohio Valley, I guess, just trying to set the baseline for where we are today. Is it possible to break out what the volumes were for the second quarter?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Let me see, I've got the right-hand man looking that up right now. But I will say in general, Alan mentioned a little bit about what's going on there from a producer input standpoint. In general, I would say the volume situation has been very positive and we've got producers waiting on pipeline, waiting on infrastructure, results are looking very favorable. I think all of the movement that we've heard on volumes from producers has been to the upside, if anything. So the area and the quality of the reserves was fantastic it. Let's see, yes, for second quarter we're right around 182 Bbtu, and about 20 million gallons of NGL production.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I apologize, can you repeat those numbers.", "Rory Lee Miller", "182 Bbtu per day.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And you said 20 million gallons?", "Rory Lee Miller", "20 million gallons, yes.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "And that's just 2 months of production.", "Operator", "Moving on to Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just some follow-ups on the Geismar proposed drop-down you mentioned in the release of taking units back. Is the idea that this would potentially be solely WPZ units going up the WMB to fund this?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Steve, this is Don. Yes, and that's really tax-driven. If we take cash, we'll pay taxes. And tax basis is fairly modest, so we're inclined to take the units to be tax efficient and have as little value loss to taxes as possible.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. I appreciate that you haven't released individual numbers on Geismar's cash generating ability, but did you put a chart in there that shows ethylene produced and the margin. Is there something else to it other than that arithmetic for us to figure out?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I would say that's the bulk of it. You also have propylene production and butadiene production as well. And so that and the operating costs are the other elements you'd have to get to, to see an [indiscernible]", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Final thing on the Geismar. Is there a thought as to what -- right now you're forecasting 1.03 coverage next year at WPZ. Is there an idea of what this would take PZs coverage to where you'd like to see it after this?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Steve, I don't think we want to put any numbers out. We're in discussions with the complex committee at this point. So I think as we reach that agreement with the complex committee, we'll announce the transaction and provide updated guidance for both WPZ and Williams at that time.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I would say, obviously we recognize that business is not a fee-based business. And so our coverage needs to be higher than, certainly higher than normal in terms of how that would impact.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then you talked about, I think, an ethylene margin rebound is part of the '14 earnings going up. Can you talk just a little bit about what the thoughts are behind the drivers for that?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. We certainly feel like that the U.S. continues to be the advantage in North America. In general, I would say, it continues to be the advantaged place to produce ethylene. And we see that demand continuing to come up on a global basis through the period. And so pretty confident in the general fundamentals around ethylene. And if you think about somebody trying to build ethylene capacity somewhere else in the face of this very low-cost natural gas, I think that drives our confidence and certainty we have a pretty good picture of what's going on in the ethylene capacity here in the U.S. Very fortunate to have Geismar on the front end of any these capacity expansions, but there's really not very much other coming on in the near term -- or sorry, in the near term to 2014. So we see a great promise coming on, a lot of NGL supplies coming on, but it just takes a while to build that cracking capacity to meet that increased demand that's coming on. And so that builds our confidence there.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Finally, on the proposed PDH facility. A couple of things, you talked about, I guess transporting, I think, the propylene to the U.S. Gulf Coast. How would that happen? And then is that going to be funded with -- is there enough cash on hand to fund all that?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes. That will be railed, is the plan. And I think our belief is that with our current international funds offshore accounts and the cash flow from the existing business, that is growing along with our ethylene project that, that should be fairly well self-contained.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "We do rail, today, a tremendous amount of propylene out of Redwater already today. And so this would be just additive which is, again, a nice feature that a lot of the infrastructure in terms the storage of propylene and railing and loading of propylene, we already got all that in place. So this is just additive and I think that's why we feel very confident about us being the right builder of that PDH facility in Canada.", "Rory Lee Miller", "We've also got the BB splitter up there, which is going to help us with the products. We've also got a very unique situation with our sale to NOVA of the ethane/ethylene mix. And so those are advantages that we think we uniquely hold. And so it appears to be kind of an advantaged opportunity for us.", "Operator", "Moving on to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sticking with the PDH unit here. Have you given any thought to actually contracting up the propylene volumes or do you want to kind of keep that price risk on the propylene side as well?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "We're looking at kind of all of our options right now. I would say right now, our main focus is on scoping, getting some of the initial engineering work done and we're looking at all the options and certainly, this decision of the propylene is one of the big decisions that we'll be making before we sanction the project. But that's an ongoing exercise.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I appreciate the slides on ethylene crack. It looks like you're forecasting in 2014 that you won't quite get to the industry benchmark. I'm just wondering what would cause you to be short of that, plus or minus to hit it or try to be short of it?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "When you say industry benchmark, are you talking about the spot with the crack spread?", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes. That ethylene spread that you show in 2014, it looks like you realized margin might be short of that. I'm just wondering is there something with Geismar that you wouldn't hit the industry margin or is there just a difference in the definition there?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "There are couple of things that work there. And one is that even though I think we flagged earlier that in early '13 we'll have an opportunity to re-contract almost our entire portfolio, we still have a legacy contract out there that won't be fully exposed to the spot market. So that's one piece of the story. I think the other piece of the story is just a little bit of conservatism that's built into how we're able to execute in terms of putting those spot contracts into place. And at times, there is some give-and-take between a true spot market deal and a term deal that's tied in the spot market.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "But your intention is to pretty much be spot, in other words, to not do term deals with Geismar?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just coming back a little bit to the questions on the ethylene margin. Do you care to share what your actual ethane price forecasts are that gets to that ethylene margin in 2014?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. $0.55 a gallon.", "Operator", "Moving on to Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Lots of questions on Geismar this morning, so just maybe trying to tie the bow there. In the slides, you point out the shift in mix to spot pricing. Previously, we had talked about kind of a half based on fee, half based on exposure to the spread. I'm assuming kind of addressing Craig's question earlier by the end of 2012, we'll be all based on the spread. Is that how to think about?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. I think that's accurate. Of course, a lot can happen between now and then. But certainly, our goal there will be balanced against our ethane exposure.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then you kind of give the chart here. Can you just tell us what your margin was that you realized on the spread in 2Q?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Stand by, Holly.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "That's $0.20.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Say that again, I'm sorry.", "Rory Lee Miller", "$0.20 balance.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "$0.20, okay.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "And that was down from $0.40 in the first quarter of '12.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "$0.40 in 1Q, that's perfect. And then lastly...", "Rory Lee Miller", "Thinking about the portfolio mix, like Alan's referencing, the crack spread out there as opposed to our realized margins. So Q1 was $0.18 and 2Q was $0.20. That $0.40 which was first half '12, that's really what the broad market crack spread was. And so that's basically what we got built into our 2014 pricing is at that $0.40 level.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Perfect. And then last quarter, you gave some nice commentary on kind of the different rig counts that you were seeing across each of your areas. Is anything on the rig count side changed since last call that might impact things here moving throughout the year?", "Rory Lee Miller", "This is Rory. I think in general, that kind of step down in activity out West that we flag for you is still pretty consistent. I don't think there are any material changes to that level of activity.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then finally, just one kind of follow-up on the macro side of things. You're hearing commentary that most of those ethylene plants that were down for maintenance in the first half of the year are back up and running. Is there anything else that's kind of still weighing on that?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes. Right now, if you think about ethane supply and that's always a challenge to measure that accurately, but about 1 million barrels a day right now on the supply side, this is where we think it's at. All of the crackers are up and running now. Thank goodness. And that's about 1 million barrels a day of demand. So we see supply and demand very much in balance. I think in Q4, there are 2 crackers that are scheduled to go down temporarily. So that's all we see for the remainder of the year. So the situation should be a little more stable than what we saw in the first half.", "Operator", "Moving on to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "It looks like for your MC&O business, the guidance refers to a coverage of 1.3x. I guess Geismar is dropped down to WPZ level. Do you think that type of coverage on the cash flow is appropriate or are you comfortable with something a bit lower given the natural hedge?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Sharon, I think you have to stay tuned for that, but clearly yes, it does sharply reduce ethane exposure or eliminates the long ethane position after the expansion of WPZ. So we certainly reduce that, but we'll have ethylene exposure and we'll need to make sure that coverage is sufficient to account for that. Again, if ethylene prices are very high, it is expected to have relatively high coverage on that part of the business. And that if ethylene prices are lower, we would expect less coverage just like our NGLs today. If you look at Slide #83, I think we tried to indicate that somewhat, but we'll be tuning that up as we go through discussions with the complex committee, as well as continue to look at our view of the forward market.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess also related to the Geismar drop-down, should we just assume that it would be structured so that WPZ would not be paying, I guess, taxes on that cash flow?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Yes.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess on the PDH potential project, do you have like a potential in-service timing of that facility, the 2015 project?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. I don't think we've released anything on that yet. And it is, as we noted, kind of in the scoping phase right now. So that's probably something we'll be able to give a little more color on in the coming quarters. But I think right now it's a little preliminary to drive a stake in the ground.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess in terms of feeling comfortable to proceed with that comp -- with that project, would you be looking to secure minimum volume commitments or like a fixed propylene margin?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. I think that kind of gets back to the earlier answer that I gave around disposition of propylene and we're looking at all the options. Of course, if you do lock something in fixed, you're probably giving away some upside. And those are decisions that we'll be making as the projects get fully bedded and pulled together. So we should have a good line of sight on that by the time that project is sanctioned.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then I guess the last question, in terms of the Leidy announcement, has that CapEx been included in your budget yet?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Sharon, it has not. So when we come forward again with guidance, we'll update to include that, assuming that the open season is concluded. And we've got all the contracts tied down so we know the size of that.", "Operator", "And moving on to the Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisers.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Sorry, still one more question on Geismar. I respect your desire for the competitive advantage but when you do the drop since it is very significant, will you provide investors the basis for why you think that you will not pay taxes on the income.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Becca, I think you have to stay tuned for that. I think we'll have to see if that's something that is required or we feel is something that we need to author. Again, I think we believe that we have something that is unique at this point and we want to make sure we take full advantage of it without necessarily offering the roadmap for others.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the PDH facility, as I understand that you'll need about 20,000 barrels a day or 20 million barrels a day of propane, is that correct? And you would have 7,000. So where will the incremental come from to source that PDH facility?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, as you're probably aware from previous calls, we do have other projects we\u2019re working on out there. So over time we do expect our equity propane to increase. But there are plenty of places between now and then to buy propane in Canada. So we don't see the supply side as any particular challenge for us right now, and we're very comfortable with that. Whether we're going out on the open market and buying it or whether we\u2019re just building it over time with our internal equity barrels.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "And then the rail cost to get it down to the Gulf Coast, what kind of delta in propane prices do you need relative to the Gulf Coast in order to make up for that $0.05 a pound rail cost.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I don\u2019t think we want to get into, probably, that level of detail yet. We've got ongoing analysis on that. And I would say let's leave that for future call, but we do think the situation is very favorable and are supportive of that project. But we have some continued analysis that is ongoing on that.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "And then finally on Marcellus. If my memory serves me well, you guys were expecting gathered volumes from the Susquehanna Hub of about 1 Bcf a day this year and Laurel Mountain about 250 million a day. Is that still the case?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Those are generally in the neighborhood. I think on Laurel Mountain, we're probably already over that. I think we're over at 280, if I'm not mistaken, on Laurel Mountain. And I think our target on Susquehanna Hub is just shy of 1 Bcf a day by the end of the year.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "And where are you guys now on Susquehanna?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Let's see. Hang on just a second, Becca, let me just track that down.", "Unknown Analyst", "I can get it offline if you want. I'll just follow-up offline to get that one.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "All right.", "Operator", "And next we'll hear from Nathan Copicar [ph] from Viking Global Investors.", "Unknown Analyst", "Actually, Igan [ph].

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "John Porter", "Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams.", "As you know, yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include the press release of our results with related schedules and our analyst package; a presentation on our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our quarterly data book, which contains detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.", "This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments, and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our Midstream business; Frank Ferazzi is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel, is also available to respond to any of your questions.", "In yesterday's presentation and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. First, let me wish everyone who has been affected by Hurricane Sandy, the best of luck in the recovery. As you know, given the significant disruption that occurred to the normal market activity, we decided to delay our earnings release webcast by a day. We also know this concentrated a number of earnings calls today, so thanks a bunch for joining us this morning for this webcast amongst a very busy morning.", "Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to my prerecorded comments released yesterday afternoon. But just in case you didn't, I'll quickly hit on some key themes and then we'll move on to our Q&A session.", "We have several really important items to communicate to you this week, starting with, of course, a review of our third quarter performance. So I'll quickly touch on the key themes from that discussion.", "For the third quarter, WMB's adjusted income was up about 17% over second quarter, in spite of NGL fracs that for -- sorry, frac spreads that were about 18% lower, on average, than the already-low 2 -- second quarter amounts and the impact of Hurricane Isaac, and I'll talk about that just a little bit.", "With regard to the NGL frac spread, we saw about a 9% lower average NGL composite price, but an even higher impact from natural gas Street [ph] prices that were up about 26%, on average. So certainly, the frac spread environment that we saw in the third quarter continued to decline from what was a heavy decline from first quarter to second quarter, and so we were not expecting that degree of decline into the third quarter. And again, a lot of that was impacted by gas prices moving up.", "Turning to fee-based revenues now for third quarter. This measure grew about 5% per -- year-over-year for the third quarter. And importantly, at the Midstream segment for WPZ, this grew at about a 12% rate, so continued great volume growth there in our fee-based revenues.", "And just to a highlight a few of the areas that affected that, our gathering volumes in the business, so that's as our natural gas gathering volumes in the Midstream business, were up 17% higher from 3Q '11 to 3Q of '12. And in the eastern onshore, which is basically at our Marcellus area and the Perdido Norte, which is in the western Gulf of Mexico, we saw both of those areas gathering volumes, actually double from year-to-year.", "The main driver of the 12% growth rate for -- overall for our business was the eastern G&P business, as I mentioned. And, of course, one of the drivers there was the acquisition from the Caiman, which we now refer to as the Ohio Valley Midstream in our business, and that was up about $30 million between years.", "Also, there was a couple of factors that brought that 12% growth rate down and tended to lessen it. The Hurricane Isaac reduced some of our Gulf Coast fee-based revenues, and in third quarter of '11, we actually had a pretty significant contract settlement related to some of our Perdido Norte business. So on a normalized basis, we see these fee-based revenues actually growing even stronger than the 12% for WPZ Midstream.", "Most of the Hurricane Isaac impacts were caused by interruptions in third-party operations. So while we did have some immediate interruption in our offshore assets, in particular, in terms of getting things back up and running, it really was due to some downstream oil terminals and some downstream NGL pipelines that held us up a little bit longer. So we really did fare pretty well against our assets, but there were some assets that we're integrated with that were a little more challenged.", "Hurricane Isaac also significantly impacted our results in the Midstream Canadian and olefins business as Geismar had downtime that affected its production volumes, as well as some damage to a furnace, as we tried to restart the plant after the hurricane. So all-in, this affected our segment profit from about $9 million to $13 million, and about $4 million of this was treated as an assessment for adjusted segment profit.", "So that's a quick look at our third quarter drivers. But again, given the continued lower NGL commodity price environment and the Hurricane Isaac impact, we actually had a pretty good operational period here for the third quarter.", "So next up, we have some important updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, from both WMB and WPZ. Included in these updates are the effect of the Geismar drop-down, which we've announced we will be closing very soon. But we've also got some other adjustments, including somewhat lower revenue growth rate assumptions for WPZ. And these are really being driven by a prolonged natural gas price assumption and some of the producers' reactions that we're seeing to that as we went through our September planning process, where we take in a lot of the input from a lot of our producers around our systems.", "And I certainly want to let you know this really is across-the-board, that we're seeing this in areas that where the -- where we may -- where the producer themselves is heavily impacted by the gas prices. So some examples of that would be areas where we hold the keep-hole [ph] rights for natural gas drilling operations. And so the producers are not enjoying any of the uplift from the NGLs, and so, of course, they're responding to lower natural gas prices. Those, of course, would be mostly out west, where that would occur.", "We also had some response in the Gulf Coast and then, to some degree, in the northeast. But we'll get into a little bit, the northeast. The good news, I would say, in the northeast is that the activities continue there. And for the most part, the activities, particularly in the Ohio Valley Midstream area, really have nothing to do with either prices or with the drilling results from the resources. Actually, those are coming in a little better than we thought. It's really just a delay in terms of the activity and our ability to get infrastructure into place there quickly.", "So all in all, I would say the environment's pretty good. But I do think with our gas price assumption at $3.25, that's in our assumptions and planning around that, we do expect continued reduction in areas that are totally dependent on just the natural gas price.", "So I do want to reaffirm our plans for a strong cash dividend growth where we're expecting a 50% -- 55% higher dividend in 2012 at WMB and, as well, the 20% growth in each 2013 and 2014, which would move our dividend to $1.20, $1.44 and $1.75, respectively.", "Our stated policy of paying out WMB dividends for all of the distributions WMB receives from WPZ, less taxes, corporate interests and corporate CapEx. However, we also want investors to appreciate how committed we are at sustaining the great strength of WPZ for the long run and, of course, that's what the Geismar drop-down is all about, and it clearly shows the evidence of WMB's commitment to keeping WPZ healthy and making sure that the commodity hedge, the natural commodity hedge there is shared with WPZ and not just held with the WMB level.", "So in that transaction, WMB is receiving nearly 43 million new WPZ LP units related to the Geismar drop-down. Assuming the strong WPZ cash distribution growth rate included in our guidance, WMB will see a significant increase in cash distributions from WPZ. This could result, of course, in an ultimately higher dividend growth rate from what we have forecasted right now for WMB. And certainly, if the forecasted pricing environment that we have out there, particularly around ethylene prices occurs, then we would certainly be in a position to further increase the dividend at WMB.", "So a lot of questions around that as a lot of people have snapped to the fact that our cash distributions will go up significantly from that. And we've certainly been clear that we intend to maintain the policy. And I think our response to that is we certainly agree with that calculation, but we do have quite a bit of risk embedded in that pricing at WPZ. And so we don't really want to go out any further on that distribution being 2 years ahead of time in terms of the dividend at WMB. I do think we intend to be very sure and really work hard to maintain the distribution growth rate at WPZ, however, and some of the things that we might respond to if we did see a commodity collapse, it would pull us down -- pull that coverage down, of course, would be our ability to impact the GP IDRs that we receive. So we remain very committed to WPZ and the health of WPZ, and we think we've got a great model. And certainly, if the pricing environment occurs, we're going to be in great shape to continue to increase that dividend at WMB even further.", "Of course, at the same time, WMB will no longer enjoy 100% of the cash flow and earnings it enjoys today. And as a result, you've seen a lowering of WMB's income guidance related to the non-controlling interest that arises in Geismar, once it's dropped into WPZ. So even though the cash flow piece of that looks stronger, the -- particularly with the capital burden being shifted over to WPZ, the earnings piece of that gets diluted by the issuance of -- to the WPZ LP unit holders.", "Additionally, as I previously mentioned, we have some other updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, including lower revenue growth rates across most of our operating areas that are exposed to natural gas prices, as I mentioned. And although we have some fairly low natural gas price assumptions in place for '13 and '14, you really should not misconstrue that, that we have a lack of confidence in the natural gas market. And in fact, I would tell you, we're fairly bullish about the long-term demand that we continue to see build for natural gas. But we also have been impressed with the capabilities of natural gas producers here in the U.S. to continue to lower their cost of production, and so we're balancing that. We do think it'll take some time for a lot of the big capital that's coming on to build that demand. But long term, I would tell you we're very bullish on seeing this natural gas market continue to expand.", "Finally, in the prerecorded podcast, we provided additional information about exciting new develops in our Canadian and Petchem Services businesses and updates on all of our end-guidance projects, most of which are fee based that really continue to demonstrate how Williams is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this long-term super cycle as a trusted name in the development, construction and operation of exactly the types of infrastructures needed to realize the full potential for producers and end users of natural gas, NGLs and olefins.", "So with that, I'll open it up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I think I understand your -- the lower guidance in '14. I just want to understand a little bit more, if you could, and I have a follow-up question. But on the guidance, it seems like your commodity price assumptions are roughly the same from the last time you issued guidance. And so the decrease in earnings seems like a meaningful decrease in volumes. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what the volume decrease you expect in '14 versus your previous guidance? And I understand it's because of low natural gas prices.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Right. And I would just say this, Faisel, that really what we saw -- again, how our planning process works is that we start to pull that together in September, and we take in input from all across our systems, from producers' planned capital for the following year. Of course, it's in their best interests to have us educated on their plans as well because we've got to go build a lot of the infrastructure for those volumes. And so we've been going through that process in September, and I would just tell you that it's really across the board. And I would tell you if we thought gas prices were going to be $4.50 or $5 in '13 and -- and then we probably would have had a different perspective on that. But with our assumption of gas prices being at $3.25 for '13, with that assumption embedded, we'd have a hard time being more bullish than the producers in terms of their capital plans. And so we really basically took the capital plans from producers. Now remember, this was -- a lot of their ideas, of course, were formed over the summer when gas prices were even softer. So if we do see gas prices rebound, we probably would see some more activity and more rigs picked up. But, of course, then we would have to raise our gas -- natural gas price if we believed that. And that would -- of course, would come out of the margin for both the NGLs and the olefins margin. So I think there's a pretty good balance there. But in general, I would tell you that we gather a lot of gas. And there's just a lot of areas that are exposed to the natural gas price, and we're seeing drops in really all of our regions from what we had forecasted earlier in the year, based on producers' forecasts that we would have picked up in the first part of 2012.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then on the olefins business and the chemicals business. How are you guys thinking about the distributions at WPZ once you drop these assets in? I mean, will some of the distributions be a little bit more of a variable rate? Or were they -- will you have some base level of free cash flows that'll be distributed to unit holders and then the rest will be kind of discretionary sort of use of capital? How are you guys thinking about this cyclical business within WPZ?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, great question. And I would say that we do feel like we will need to maintain a coverage ratio there. Of course, one of the things that's heavily impacting our coverage ratio at PZ right now is the amount of growth and amount of equity that we've issued here in 2012. And so I would say that in a more normal environment, with not quite so much leverage to growth in that balance sheet, that we would expect to be seeing higher coverage ratios, despite even with these lower NGL prices that we're -- that we saw here in the third quarter. So bottom line is we intend to maintain a coverage ratio there at WPZ and try to let the swings. Good news is, is that there's a lot of cash flow in WPZ, and we would expect to let that coverage absorb a lot of those swings. If that wasn't enough to absorb that, then our next move in a more dire environment would be to waive some of the GP IDR, if necessary, to maintain WPZ's health.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Bradley Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just to follow up on Faisel's question about the volume growth assumptions that go into your guidance. How -- you mentioned kind of broadly lower gas volumes across geographies. Would you say that this volume change is enough to impact your longer-term 5 Bcf a day estimate in terms of gas that you handle in the Marcellus?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "It certainly could in some areas. I would tell you the areas that are the drier gas are most likely to be the larger part of that impact. On OBM, I would say there might be some delays there. But currently, we're actually increasing that a little bit above, in the near term here, from what we had in our September -- sorry, in our June forecast for that. So it's really those areas that are just dependent on dry gas volumes and OBM, I would say, to the degree, that is lowered a little bit. That's going to be from just delays in getting the infrastructure and the drilling activity occurring there. But we certainly are very excited about what we continue to see in the OBM area, in terms of the producers' economics and their activities and the resource there.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And as far -- in the Midstream side of the business at WPZ, it looked like the OpEx, which had ticked up in the second quarter, was kind of flat sequentially. And I was wondering if there are items in there which are transitory in nature, or whether we're looking at maybe a kind of higher go-forward operating cost in that business.", "Rory Lee Miller", "This is Rory. I'd say for the near term, across Midstream on operating expenses, we're probably pretty flat with '12. And so in terms of thinking about a run rate -- now that's probably a comment that I'm making for '13. But we're expecting to be fairly flat with '12 for '13, and then after that, there may be some growth.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And just one last question. Could you -- I realize that some of the petrochemical pipelines are making their way down to PZ, in conjunction with the Geismar drop-down. But there -- are there additional assets, as part of this Exxon asset package, that you've acquired, which will remain at WMB for the time being? And maybe if you could just give a breakdown of what percentage of those assets sit at PZ versus MB, that would be great.", "Donald R. Chappel", "This is Don. I could just mention that the assets that we announced, the petrochemical assets that we acquired from Exxon, will be owned at the Williams level for the time being. We felt that Williams had more financial capacity to hold those assets while they're being developed than PZ did, given the already large array of growth opportunities that PZ was holding. So that was the primary reason we moved that to Williams rather than WPZ. But that remains a drop-down opportunity that PZ will likely enjoy at a future date.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Maybe just thinking about the commodity exposure here at the WMB level and the increased investments in Canada. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the mix of maybe adding more commodity sensitivity with those additional investments, rather than -- and then kind of how you're thinking about what the cash otherwise you could do if there's tax issues with bringing it back, and maybe that's part of the reason why you're -- that you're driving more investments in Canada.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Just -- this is Don again. I would say that, again, for us to bring back $500 million, our cash tax rate would be about 50%, so about $250 million of that would be paid to the IRS. So that's a pretty -- a lot of value leakage. And the good news is we have some opportunities in Canada that we think are very strong with very high rates of returns. So if we look at that versus the opportunities here in the U.S., we just see -- despite the fact there's some commodity volatility, we just have higher hurdle rate on those projects, such that even in a low-commodity price environment, they're still very attractive investments. And in a more of an expected case, it's very strong. And when you compare that to paying all that cash tax and bringing it back and investing it in an opportunity here in the U.S., that the Canadian investment, despite the fact it's in commodity-sensitive businesses, tends to be something that we're interested in. I think the one area that we're exploring is PDH. And again, we think that propane in Canada is likely to be under tremendous pressure, and the margins on that business will likely be very strong.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I would add to that on the -- this is Alan. I would add to that as well that the -- for instance, the CNRL business, the ethane contract that supports that does have a floor for the ethane that's at a cost of service pricing for the ethane. So there is some contractual support for that risk that we're taking in that expansion up there, for both the new ethane capital that we're investing, as well as the CNRL expansion.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great, got it. That's great. And can you talk a little bit on the price that you came to for Geismar? It's -- you could argue it's something of a low multiple for WPZ to pay. Just kind of how you're thinking was coming to that price.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. I think the multiple is always dependent on the amount of pricing risk and where you are, at a peak or a trough, and certainly, that is a build-out of a business. And so today's pricing, of course, if it was a steady, already-existing asset that didn't have a lot of growth in it, would deserve a higher multiple for those more sure cash flows. But I think with the pricing assumption, we -- that is our best guess at the pricing assumption that's out there. But nevertheless, that is a peak relative to the market, and so we don't think it would deserve such a high multiple. So a lot of -- as you can imagine, a lot of interesting debate amongst the conflicts committee to WPZ, and it's -- the folks that support that, as well as internally here. But we think we really hit the right spot, for both WMB and WPZ, in that transaction.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And then you touched on it a little bit. But maybe talk through a little bit more of your assumptions on the price forecast. I'm particularly interested in natural gas at $3.25. It looks like the forward curve is closer to $4 for '13. And then on ethylene, you've got this big jump in '14 going from $0.50 a pound to $0.63. Kind of what's driving both of those forecasts in your guidance?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. On the gas price, I'll hit that first. I think the gas price yesterday is coming off for year about $3.90 or so, up for '13. And, of course, that's been moving around quite a bit. I would just tell you, we certainly hope that. I think for the health of the industry, that's a good thing. But we continue to see supplies grow. And, in fact, our forecast of lower volume rates is not showing up currently in our growth rates. It's continuing to grow. And so we think that a lot of the demand that we picked up over the summer, obviously, was very price-dependent growth, and you can argue whether that price is $3.50 or $3.75 or $3.25. You can argue as to where that price that kicks coal out and brings gas in, but it's certainly not $4 from our vantage point. And so I think -- we think that, that low that we saw in the natural gas price is pretty temporary and is very price driven. So we continue to be impressed with the kind of drilling and growth around our systems as we sit here today. But we think, eventually, that's got to moderate, and obviously, that's the -- our reaction to it. On the ethylene price, I would just tell you that the -- what we saw in the -- what we continue to see is really a response between crude oil and ethane. As you get into '14, we're actually completely -- or almost completely neutral to ethane prices and, in fact, a little bit short ethane. So if our ethane price is wrong, that'll just show up in ethylene price, but we're really just driving that ethylene price off of CMAI forecast and oil prices then. So that's the best intelligence that we have based on the markets that we're seeing out there.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "A couple of questions. First, I apologize I -- there were some competing calls today. But I just want to clarify, the $600 million segment profit plus DD&A for the drop-down is a proportional number?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Yes.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "That's great. And, Don, can I stay with you for a minute? Speaking of taxes that have been discussed, can you speak to what the tax rate might be on the LP distributions from PZ? Would that be changing at all with the olefins drop-down? And also, would there be any potential, over time, as you invest more CapEx and get more depreciation in Canada for that 50% tax you alluded to, to come down?", "Donald R. Chappel", "I would say that our cash tax rate moves around a bit depending on when assets were placed in service, minimum tax, a lot of variables there. It moves around a bit. I think from a planning standpoint on this slide, we have it here in our dividend illustration. We've kind of normalized it at about a 25% rate on the distributions from WPZ. Some years would be higher, some are lower. We've normalized it, therefore, to take some of the volatility out of it. I would note that when we issue equity, including in the Geismar transaction, our effective tax rate goes up. Because in effect, to the extent that we issue units to the public, there's an embedded gain there from a tax standpoint. So it's pretty complex subject. But I think the way we've modeled it here, I think is generally representative with some volatility. I think you'll some years it could come in sub-20 and some could approach 30%. As to Canada, we've got a negative basis in our foreign assets. And so the issue there is that to bring cash across the border would trigger a gain, and that's a pretty substantial gain at this time.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Since they've never been taxed with U.S. authorities, when you reinvest money in the new projects in Canada, do you get credit for that when you bring it back?", "Donald R. Chappel", "No. I mean, it's -- it comes down to tax basis in all of our international assets. And again, we've got some legacy European and Venezuelan tax positions, so it's a big ball that includes a lot of legacy stuff. So it's going to take some time to unwind that. There is a -- we do have an embedded 25% tax rate in Canada. So we are providing taxes and paying Canadian taxes at about a 25% rate on Canadian income. But it's really that cash balance that we have sitting in Canada or the cash that we might generate is still working against a negative tax basis.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. And my last question, Alan, there were some questions around the changes in expected gathering with natural gas volumes. You alluded to trying to be a little conservative, especially as maybe CPG fuel switching eases off a bit and suggested that some of the numbers may change. If you're rolling [ph] to a high side, maybe the volumes will be greater. My question is many producers that have alternatives are saying even at $4 gas, they're not going back and turning on the spigot. Because they make just so much more money on the liquids part of the plays that they have, that there's a limited amount of capital and they just can't see putting it towards dry gas. And you all have mentioned him even the Marcellus, that some of the prolific dry gas areas are easing off, even though there's probably very respectable returns at some of those very good wells today. Can you speak to whether you really think the volumes will necessarily follow price?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, that's a great question and one that we obviously wrestle with around here on a regular basis, and I honestly think it is very dependent on producers' capability. Certainly, not all these basins are created equal. There's quite a bit differentiation from one -- even in Susquehanna County, I will tell you, there's a pretty big spread in one part of the county versus others. And as well, I would tell you that some producers are better than others at getting their costs down and, as well, there's a major variability in terms of what their other options might be and what they're invested in. And so I would just say it's not as -- the market's not perfectly efficient in that regard. It is, remarkably, to -- from my vantage point, sometimes I always marvel at how efficient it is, particularly this summer, the kind of a pickup we saw with low natural gas price on the demand side. But in the producer side, it's not -- not everybody has the same number of options about where they might take the rigs, and some are more invested in others in getting their cost structure down in an area. And so we certainly saw that with our previous ownership of WPX in the Piceance, where they had a very low-cost structure in the Piceance. And we certainly see that in the Marcellus, with some players having a much lower cost structure and a -- and lower cash cost than others. So I would just tell you, it's pretty variable out there, and I think it's hard to draw it with a broad brush. And so that's not the way we do it. We do it kind of from a building it from a ground-up perspective based on all the different input we get from producers in each of our areas, and so that's really the -- how we come up with that.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just wanted to get your thoughts on what's an appropriate coverage ratio for WMB and WPZ longer term? Are you thinking about, I guess, the figures you outlined in 2014, meaning 1.2x for WMB and 1.1x for WPZ?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Sharon, it's Don. I would say it's a complete function of business mix and commodity prices and the growth rate. Because again, as Alan mentioned earlier, in the near term, we're burdened with an extraordinary growth rate. We're financing a lot of growth, and that means more units out, more interest expense, with little cash flow. But if you look at '14 and you look at the ethylene price, you can bury that ethylene price and you're going to get a of lot different coverage. You can move gas price, and you're going to get much different coverage. So I think it's really a function of what you assume on prices. So the 1.23 is built off the price assumptions we have here, price and margin and all the other assumptions. So if you have lower margin assumptions, you'll get lower coverage. If you have higher, you'll get higher. But again, I think it's going to be variable. Coverage would be variable based on where we are in a commodity cycle and a number of other factors.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess looking at your 2013 guidance for the low end, are you comfortable at this point in terms of continue to deliver growth at WPZ and distributions and have a negative coverage, given the cash flow visibility in 2014? Can you maybe just talk about that?", "Donald R. Chappel", "I'd say we still have positive coverage in 2013 based on our guidance, though. Yes, we are comfortable. Obviously, there's business risks, including commodities that we'll face and there's upside opportunities. But at this point, we're comfortable with our guidance as being what we're certainly targeting, and we think that it's realistic.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess the last question's just any operational impact of Sandy on your northeast operations at this point in time?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Frank, do you want to take that?", "Frank J. Ferazzi", "Yes, I'll -- this is Frank Ferazzi. I'll take that question. We did lose purchased power in many of our compressor stations in New York and New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania. But at those stations, we have backup generation capability that's powered by natural gas. So there's no disruption to flows. We do have our LNG facility that's located close to the water. And so we anticipated that we may get some minor flooding, and that did, in fact, happen. So in anticipation of that, we took the facility down on Sunday. We did, in fact, get some water. But once the facility dried down and we pumped a couple of feet of water away, we're not expecting any permanent damage there. No leaks on the system, no other disruptions in flow. And so I think on balance, we fared remarkably well. We're going to have to remove some trees from the right of way, some fences were blown down. But again, no permanent damage to the facilities and no disruption in flow.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "On the gas pipelines, it just looks like the EBITDA's a little bit -- or the EBIT's just coming in a little bit lower than, at least, we were expecting despite some double-digit increases in throughput. Can you talk about what you see going on in that business? And then just given where you are year-to-date, do you still think you're going to meet the low end of your guidance?", "Richard Rodekohr", "Yes. Becca, this is Rick Rodekohr. In the third quarter, we did see some higher expenses at our gas pipelines. Those were driven principally by the Pipeline Safety Act. As you know, we have to complete testing on our system by the end of 2012. So we're certainly on track to do that. But as we get near the end of that period, we did have some higher integrity and testing costs that we did see in the third quarter. And then, we also saw some higher benefit costs related to our pensions and our post-retiree medical expenses. So those were the primary drivers, I think, of the lower results in the third quarter. We are on track to hit the guidance that we have given for 2012.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "That would -- I mean, that would imply a really big fourth quarter of close to $200 million versus $178 million a year ago. So what's really driving that?", "Richard Rodekohr", "Well, we have some additional revenues from expansion projects that we put in service earlier in 2012. So we'll get revenues from there. And then we do have some projects that we look at expensing those dollars until they reach a level of probability. And so to the extent that we have some projects that move down the development path, we'd have some opportunities to reverse some expenses there as well.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Got you. And then on the Caiman Utica JV, any status updates on that?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "This is Alan. I would just say there's a lot going on there. We're not in a position to announce anything new on there, but very pleased with the opportunities that are coming forward on that. So stay tuned on there.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "And then, on shared services, you guys talked about a new shared services undertaking in your second quarter 10-Q and then had a charge for reorganization in the third quarter. Is there more to come on that? And what kind of benefit do you see to Williams as a result of this?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, great question, Becca. There has been a lot of efforts around the organization on that. And frankly, we were responding to overhead costs as one item that came at us from the spin-off of WPX and so trying to make sure that our overhead costs are in line with the size of the company and the complexity of the company today. And so we are going through a process of taking out some layers of management across the organization. But as well, I would tell you, very much on the positive side, we are bringing a lot of alignment and a lot of focus around our engineering and construction capabilities, as well as getting the customer voice from all of these various areas right up to the leadership table and getting that as close to our actions as possible. So a lot of very positive things coming out of this where we're really trying to get more of our resources focused on our areas of opportunity. And when I say that, I'm talking about people resources that are really focused on where our frontline opportunities, whether it's growing out our business on the E&C side or being able to be very responsive to customers' needs, as this infrastructure build-out continues to really amaze us; in fact, in terms the amount of demands and opportunities that are in front of us. So we're really trying to position the organization to be more responsive to the kind of build-out that's ahead of us and we continue to enjoy.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Do you have a financial impact in terms of incremental savings or incremental costs?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "We have not. We don't have a final number to put forward on that yet, Becca.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, on EBITDA guidance. It looks for the base business, it's coming down, and you talked about the gathering volumes. But we're also seeing CapEx for the base business come up once we net out the numbers for Geismar. So what is that higher CapEx related to on the base business?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Is this on WPZ, Becca? I didn't follow that.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Yes, yes. If you want, I can wait, announce that on the PC call.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "We'll get back to you on that, sorry. One item there, Becca, that I can think of that's in there is the gumbo [ph] acquisition and the capital that's driving that is a piece of that at Williams. And so...", "Donald R. Chappel", "Some of it is timing that we've shifted some capital from '12 to '13 and the timing of some other projects have moved around as well. So we'll dig out the detail here and advise you, if not on the call, after the call.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Carl Kirst of BMO Capital Markets.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just a quick question on the Petchem pipeline initiative. And I guess my question is, is since you guys have some of a first-mover advantage here, as we look at the return profile of that capital being deployed, should we be looking there in the sort of the return profile of a normal kind of fee-based contracted pipeline asset? Or is there the opportunity to earn perhaps significantly higher returns for that capital?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. Carl, good question. And I would -- we didn't get it -- given all the other moving parts we've had in this earnings call, we haven't had a chance to focus very much on that. But I think we've forecasted that in the past in terms of our bullishness around the need for infrastructure as the Petchem business grows out from all the new NGLs coming into the market there. And we are more convinced than ever that, that is the case, and there's going to be a lot of infrastructure. We've made 3 acquisitions from pipelines that we are converting the service on here in the last 10 months or so, and have been doing that fairly quietly as we want to make sure we've got the business contracted for that business. But in terms of return expectations, I can tell you that it does vary according to risk. But I would say probably, on average, it's between about 14% and 20% pretax returns on those capital investments.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Okay, great. I will close it up here. Thank you, all, very much for joining us. Very excited about our future. A lot of moving parts happening in this quarter.", "And I want to reiterate that we are very committed to maintaining the health of WPZ as you -- as I think we've demonstrated with the Geismar drop-down. And frankly, we -- as we've been forecasting for quite some time, we were concerned and had been concerned about the ethane supply getting out and ahead of the cracker capacity. We certainly think our Geismar expansion is very timely and is going to be able to take great advantage of new ethane supplies ahead of -- in the other cracker expansions. And so -- but we think eventually the petchem market is going to respond to the huge amount of NGLs that producers are going after today.", "So we're excited to be in this space and excited about the growth opportunities that are out for us, really across-the-board in our business today. So really feel very good about the growth prospects that lie before us in the company. And we've got a lot of to execute on, but very confident in our team's ability to do that.", "So with that, we'll close it up. And once again, thank you very much, and good luck in your recovery, if you've been impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's program.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Porter", "Thank you, Glynne. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners.", "Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying Analyst Packages; a presentation discussing these results, guidance updates and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.", "This morning, Alan will make a few comments, and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our Midstream business; Frank Ferazzi is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel, is also available to respond to any questions.", "In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that's been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great. Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you on the phone and webcast, who have joined us this morning. I'm certainly looking forward to your questions. Before we open up the phone lines, I want to take the opportunity to briefly touch on a few key themes for the Williams and Williams Partners investment story. In short, we are rewarding investors now with strong dividend and cash distribution growth through the guidance period and we are expanding our business to create continuing value growth in a very resilient future dividend and distribution growth.", "First, let's take a look at our fourth quarter performance. We turned in solid results in line with our third quarter guidance, despite a natural gas liquids margin environment that dropped even faster than we expected. To give some scale to that drop and to the headwinds we were facing, it's important to understand that our fourth quarter NGL margins were down 46% from the prior year, margins took another 8% hit from what we thought were low third quarter levels; and from a financial perspective, our fourth quarter NGL margins were off about $75 million compared just to the midpoint of the forecast that we shared at the third quarter results.", "Much of this didn't show up in the unit margin because we didn't produce ethane when it was in the negative margin territory. So what you saw there is a little bit higher unit margin than you might have expected but lower volumes as a result of that ethane rejection. We provide some detail in our slides regarding the positions that allowed us to overcome these very low NGL margins but here are some of the highlights there. First, we're successfully growing our fee-based revenues in this business for Williams Partners. In the Midstream segment, we generated fourth quarter fee-based revenues 18% higher than a year ago. For both the Midstream and gas pipeline business, we generated fee-based revenues that were up 5% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And second, we continue to benefit from the natural hedge against ethane exposure that our Olefins business creates. Williams Partners benefited in the last 2 months of 2012 with the acquisition of the Olefins business and there is even greater benefit for WPZ ahead with the well-timed expansion of the Geismar facility expected in service later this year.", "This combination supports our ability to reward investors with strong growth in cash dividends and cash distributions. We are reaffirming our guidance at midpoint to grow Williams' cash dividend by some 20% with this year and -- for both this year and next year. And for Williams Partners, we are reaffirming our guidance at midpoint to increase the cash distributions we pay unitholders by approximately 9% in both '13 and '14.", "When we add our large platform of growth capital projects and the rapid growth in cash distributions we're expecting from a recent investment in Access Midstream, what you'll have is a value-creation engine that is powerful, durable and resilient and will continue to grow for many years to come.", "In our earnings announcements yesterday afternoon, you also saw that we are lowering our 2013 and '14 earnings and cash flow guidance. We expect the growth in our fee-based business will partially offset the effect of sharply lower ethane and propane prices and ethylene prices in '14. And we will see Williams Partners benefiting from the late 2012 acquisition of Williams' Olefins business and a significant expansion of our Geismar facility in the fourth quarter. And I also would remind you that we have quite a bit of collared contracts that are expiring here in the first quarter of '13 and of course, those allow us to get even better exposed to the weak ethane price and continue our short position at Geismar there on ethane.", "Our coverage at WPZ is certainly being impacted by the heavy load of investing about $12 billion in growth capital during the 3-year period from '12 through '14. But we're deploying that capital towards a vast array of great growth projects across our operating areas from the Marcellus and Utica Shales in Canada to the Eastern Seaboard and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These are projects that we know and understand, many are well into the construction phase and the essential ingredient in these value-creating projects is largely within our reach, it's our execution.", "If I can direct you, for future reference, to Slide 13 in the quarterly presentation materials that are posted on our websites, you'll see here exactly where we are spending that $12 billion and when exactly it begins to contribute to our cash flows. I think you'll agree that these projects are very strategic, they are large scale and they move us even more significantly toward a business mix dominated by a revenue stream that can support strong continued growth in dividends and distributions, and these growth investments largely start contributing in meaningful value in 2015 and beyond. So there is much good yet to come with these major strategic investments that we continue to invest heavily into.", "This natural gas infrastructure super cycle is creating tremendous opportunities for North America, our industry and importantly, for Williams and Williams Partners. We are aggressively pursuing and executing on these opportunities to deliver shareholder value for years to come and we remain committed to the idea that there is a lot of value associated with this large-scale infrastructure.", "Now let's open the phone lines and I'll let others on our executive leadership team help answer your questions this morning.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Christine Cho with Barclays.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "How are you guys planning to fund the coverage shortfall at WPZ in '13? Is it going to be with debt or are you going to do IDR waivers? And can you just remind me what has been disclosed to date for IDR waivers, is it $105 million in '13 and $16 million in '14?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Christine, this is Don Chappel. In terms of the exact funding plan, we've not disclosed that but we do have a lot of flexibility around that. It will be a combination of debt and equity. Certainly, Williams is well positioned to support WPZ in many ways. But we have no additional IDR waivers contemplated at this time. The IDR waivers that are currently have been granted are very modest and I think you mentioned those numbers and they just go out for 2 years.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Can you just talk about what your plans are for the extra cash at WMB otherwise? Especially with the...", "Donald R. Chappel", "We have a number of investment opportunities in the NGL pipeline, Petchem pipeline space, where Alan has laid out our strategy earlier about building that business and Alan can speak to that again. So that's an opportunity. And the balance, we have some flexibility. And so we'll look at the facts and circumstances to determine what the best use of that excess cash is.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Can you give a little more detail about how the investment in ACMP brought your cash taxes to 0 in '13 and 10% in '14?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Sure. Our investment -- again, there is an allocation for tax purposes. The inside basis at ACMP did not change. Our investment was allocated between hard assets and intangibles. In terms of the hard assets, they enjoy accelerated depreciation. And the intangibles enjoy straight line depreciation. But it's really the depreciation of that investment that's creating a very large tax deduction for us, which, over the next few years, will significantly lower our tax rate. In addition, the January '13 fiscal cliff legislation included an extension of bonus depreciation. And given the large amount of capital that we continue to invest, that's pretty significant as well.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I noticed that your Geismar expansion, the start date was pushed back by a quarter. Can you talk about what's going on there?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I'll address that now and I'll ask, maybe Rory, to hit a little harder on that. We really didn't push it back as much as -- that's not really the cause of the drop in volumes there. But we are giving ourselves some room for the tie-ins and some expanded tie-in work on there. So I would just say, we're being fairly conservative and knowing that when you go to start up a facility like that, often, there is bobbles and interruptions as you try to do that, and we're planning for that rather than explaining that later. So that's really the purpose for that, but really, the startup is still scheduled right into the October time frame.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then, you talked about how you started to recently see ethane rejection during the fourth quarter. How much did you reject in 4Q? And then, also, you've talked about how you're assuming that all your equity volumes are going to be rejected in the first quarter of '13, what does your guidance assume for the rest of the year?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, let me take a look at that on fourth quarter. I know in the first quarter of '13, we've got rejection planned for the entire period. But if you can hang on just a second here. The fourth quarter, yes, looks like we had about 2 to 3 weeks in December of ethane rejection.", "Donald R. Chappel", "This is Don Chappel, just related to that, I'd just refer you to Slide #8 in our deck that illustrates the declining ethane margin with lower frac spreads but the widening crack margin at Geismar. And I'd note there that at our assumed about $0.06 of margin there, that equates to about -- I think, it's $27 million of remaining ethane margins. So we have very little ethane exposure left. And in fact, as ethane prices go lower, that $27 million does not include the benefit of Geismar's margins expanding. So if you look at the sensitivities in our data book, you can get some sense of the combined effect. But again, there is only $27 million of total ethane margin assumed in 2013. In our data book, we have the same slide for 2014, and you'll see with the Geismar expansion, while the ethane margin is assumed to be a bit wider, the Geismar expansion completely mitigates that. And I think I've mentioned to some investors before, if ethane prices go to the point that we are in full rejection and go even lower, then, we've taken all the pain on the ethane margin and then, Geismar starts to see even greater gains as its costs go down.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right. And then, the last question for me. This is more of an accounting question. But how are you calculating the adjusted segment profit for Access Midstream Partners? Is that just net income that you expect at ACMP and multiply it by your ownership? It just seems a little light. I'm just trying to figure out, do the Class C units participate in earnings but not the Class B, is that how that works?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Our proportionate share of their equity earnings and then, again, our purchase price was allocated, in part, to intangibles. Some of the intangibles are contracts and we have depreciation or amortization of that. That totaled about $65 million in both '13 and '14. So  [indiscernible] earnings are reduced by that amortization expense and you can see from a cash flow standpoint if you add that back, you get to a segment profit plus DD&A or an EBITDA number. Our pro rata share, it's $65 million higher than the earnings. So I think we are on, in terms of our share from more of a cash flow perspective, segment profit plus DD&A, so that's not actually the distribution, but is $103 million in '13, $160 million in '14.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. First, maybe, start with the macro. Can you just give us a little color on what you're seeing right now in the ethane and propane markets? And anything maybe nearer term that could drive pricing? You probably know better than most that most of the E&Ps right now are forecasting ethane rejection for most of 2013.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, I think the market on the ethane side continues to struggle to balance itself with a lot of new projects coming on, continuing to come on, major NGL pipelines, major fractionators continuing to come on that will continue to provide plenty of supply into a market that is going to be slow to grow. I think, obviously, with our expansion and other expansions, we'll see a little bit of growth this year. But in -- it's probably a couple years out before we really see the market try to catch up with all that supply on the ethane side. So we really don't see a lot of upside. For us, the best thing that can happen for us is probably volatility here in '13. And then, a weak -- a very weak ethane price in '14. And if that happens, then, we'll have some upside to what we have forecasted here for '13 and '14. On the propane side, I would say the fundamentals are a little more positive there. Certainly, a lot of cracking going on right now. Propane is at a price that is encouraging. A lot of cracking of propane and our crackers running rich and probably any other light-end crackers running rich and running propane in it right now as much as they can because propylene prices are so high that, that's making that a favored feedstock. So that, combined with hopefully some larger export facilities coming on later this year, I think that will start to balance the fundamentals a little better on propane. So I would say a little bit of upside to propane, but still that market has a lot of supply still available in it. I would say this, that there is a lot of propane that is on the market that can be trucked and railed and so forth, that is already in the market supply versus ethane that is being rejected and not on the supply scene. Said another way, when a lot of these big NGL pipelines come online, they're going to have the capacity for ethane but a lot of that propane is already getting captured in local fractionators and being trucked and railed. So it won't be as large of an incremental supply into the market when that infrastructure comes online.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then, maybe just sticking with propane. What's the latest on the PDH project?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "We're very excited about that project. A lot of things coming together quickly on it. And we've been -- we've contracted with an engineering firm to do a feed study on it. And I would say, we look forward to accelerating the decision on that project with continued strong fundamentals for low propane prices in Canada, with very little outlet for the propane out of Canada and as well, a lot of interest in the propylene supplies that we already have. As you recall, from our Redwater fractionator and splitter, we already have a pretty large propylene supply there, this would add to that and starts to get to a level that it could attract derivative investment downstream, which would really be a homerun for us because it would take that rail -- some of that rail cost out that we're investing in today into the Gulf Coast.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "So maybe a decision by year-end?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Oh, I would say, it would be quite a bit sooner than that.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, I appreciate the additional Marcellus-related detail on your systems and expansion plans. I guess, bigger picture, what are the production bottlenecks today?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. I would say that for the most part, it is around liquids, particularly, for instance, in the wet Marcellus and in the West Virginia area. That production has a lot more condensate and is a lot richer than really anybody, I think, expected -- certainly, we expected it, anyway, speaking for ourselves and I think for the producers as well. And so a lot of the facilities there really haven't been designed to be able to handle all those liquids. So there's a lot of redo work going on up there and there is a lot of production that is sitting, waiting behind infrastructure, on both our facilities and other people's facilities as well. And so we're working hard to overcome that. But I can tell you that we have a lot of frustrated producers sitting behind our production. And obviously, we're anxious to get things remedied and bring it online as well. But there is a significant amount of production that is curtailed, either by a lack of connection or in some cases, just unreliable operations where the pipelines continue to fill up with liquids and shut in the gas production.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "And is there more volume on a particular system of yours that's backed up?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. The Ohio Valley Midstream is really the one that's curtailed, the other systems are running fairly well. We have had a few struggles in getting the Laser pipeline up and running. And so we've had a little bit of curtailed volume in the Northeast. But as you can see, it's not curtailing it a lot because you can see how fast the volumes have come up, 80% year-on-year there. So hard to say it's heavily curtailed, but there is some curtailment there on the north end of the Laser system.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then, one last one, I promise. Just a cleanup. What was your 4Q ethylene cracker spread? And then, the full year as well, that you realized?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Randy, you want to take that?", "Randall L. Barnard", "Just a moment, I'll look that up so we can come back with a...", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Holly, was the question, what our ethylene crack spread was at Geismar?", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, for 4Q and then full year, if you have got it. And that's it for me, so you can pass it on.", "Randall L. Barnard", "Full year was $0.40. I don't know what -- just the quarter was, but I think the full year spread was $0.40.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I understand all the issues surrounding lower commodity prices and I appreciate the comments last night in your podcast on the constraints you're having in the Marcellus. I was wondering if you could quantify some of those constraints. It seems like if I -- if we look at your presentations in the past versus the presentation you put out last night, that your volume assumptions for 2013 out of the Marcellus and Utica, are lower than what you guys had anticipated previously when you looked at these assets last year. Can you quantify for us exactly what's going on? And then, I have a follow-up question to that.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. I'll ask Frank Billings to take that question.", "Francis E. Billings", "Yes, this is Frank Billings. I'd say, if we were going to quantify today the volume, kind of, curtailment issues that we're having in the Ohio Valley, I could put that at about 100 million to 150 million a day of volume that we have, that the producers could be producing into our gathering systems. For the forecast period, we're moving our volumes back to address kind of both the operating issues that were experienced in OVM and then, certain producers drilling investment to better align their drilling dollars with getting the best net backs for commodities produced. So I think that's the things driving our volume forecast today in that part of the Northeast.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "If I'm looking at your own '13 and '14 guidance for volumes, you'd say that those numbers have been curtailed by about 150 a day?", "Francis E. Billings", "Well, I think that's what's hitting us today. Our expectation is that we would be getting those volumes back online. But we have some operational things we need to solve and some asset modifications that we have to make at some of the central receipt points in the field so that we can get that volume flowing. But that volume's available to us today, we just have to get some of our assets better situated to handle the condensate volumes and get the -- so that we can get the production flowing consistently.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. I would say in general there, we are very encouraged with the resource and the value it can deliver to the producers. But there are a lot of infrastructure constraints, including both the upstream side and as well, the downstream market side. So us continuing to develop infrastructure for the NGL market outlets and the condensate outlets, is critical to the success of the producers. And so I think, even though there's already this amount of production sitting and waiting, I don't think they'll continue to drill so robustly if we don't start to provide the market outlets up there in an unconstrained way, and we're certainly working very rapidly on that. So a lot of great opportunity. The good news is, it's a great resource. And I would just say, it's even better than most people thought and therefore, it is requiring some -- pretty rapid expansions on the market outlets and the upstream infrastructure.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And Alan, do you worry about basis kind of narrowing in the Marcellus and Columbia pool area? It seems like we've basically gotten close to parity to Hub and in some situations, it looks like we actually moved into a negative basis in that region? Do you worry about that and that kind of crimping production volume growth?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I think what you'll see -- I think it will be hard to see what the actual basis differential. But the answer to your question is yes, we've got to continue to open up market outlets for both the gas and the liquids. But I would tell you right now probably, the liquids is the bigger driver on that. But I think what you really are going to see are kind of inter-regional spikes. And so it's not just what you could see as a East Dominion price or a Columbia price. It's really going to boil down to inter-regional prices and what pipes people are actually getting paid. Now if they have firm transport out of the area and they get into Zone 6 on Transco, that's a beautiful thing right now for somebody, but obviously, that capacity is limited. And so I would just say, I think it's very, very spotty up there. And I don't think those basis differentials really tell us the whole story for what producers are getting for their gas right now.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then, on the Western volumes. Is anything changed in your guidance or expectations in the West for this year versus what you had expected previously?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, pretty limited change on that, I believe, and continued -- I would say the one thing that I'm aware of that's changed is -- and certainly embedded in our guidance at this point though -- is we did have a lot of production froze off in the first quarter, not from our facilities, for the most part, but certainly producer freeze off in the San Juan Basin and some in the Wamsutter area and so we certainly saw some impact here in the first quarter on fee-based volumes there.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then, last question for me. On the quarterly comments that you have in your press release, you talked about earnings being impacted by increased cost and lower NGL margins. Can you just give us an idea of what you're talking about, what you mean by increased costs?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, certainly, getting all these businesses started up is a heavy load, developing a lot of these projects is a heavy load. So for instance, you'll see a little spike in cost in Canada, for instance, and a lot of that of course, is in developing a project like a PDH project. And so we've got a lot of upfront development expenses. You'll notice that we're pretty conservative how we book that. You'll notice in the fourth quarter, in the gas pipeline segment, we took a $19 million reduction in expense that basically was expenses that we had on capital projects earlier that we don't capitalize until we know that project's going to come through. And so in other words, we expensed those and hold them in an account until we're sure the project's approved and permitted. And so that's where some of that kind of expense is from. So when we've got a big, heavy capital budget like we have right now, a lot of the expenses in developing those projects weigh heavy against our expense line until those projects are capitalized.", "Gary Stromberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And would you say that those higher expenses are running through your numbers right now are higher than what you guys had previously envisioned in your last guidance?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I don't think there's too much more than what was in the last guidance, maybe, on the PDH project. But again, if we approve that this year, then that expense gets capitalized moving forward, so...", "Donald R. Chappel", "Just to be clear, the phenomenon that Alan mentioned in the fourth quarter is unique to our regulated gas pipeline business where, in that business, you expense it until you have a probable asset. And then, once it becomes probable, you can actually capitalize previously expensed projects. In the nonregulated business, you expense it and then, when you have a probable project, you expense going forward. But you can't go back and, call it, reclaim what you previously expensed.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bradley Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Quick question on -- and I realize that it's a similar question to one that's been asked already. But when you talk about the volume impacts, the limited volume impacts between the guidance provided on the third quarter call and the guidance provided for the fourth quarter. Can you quantify, in terms of either segment profit or EBITDA, the expected impact from volumetric declines, either in the Western or the Eastern portions of the Midstream business on segment profit or EBITDA in '13 and '14?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. I think in the -- I think the 150 or so that Frank talked about along with some other small things, I think it's about $85 million, maybe $80 million to $120 million in total there is about what's in there.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And one of the, I guess, notes in the presentation when you announced the Access transaction and mentioned again in your fourth quarter materials is the potential NGL pipeline project out of the Marcellus. And I guess, I'd be interested in your thoughts about how a heavy NGL pipeline out of the Northeast might potentially impact demand for local fractionation? And to the extent that a pipeline might reduce the demand for local, kind of, Northeast-sided fractionation, how a potential pipeline project maybe underwritten by Chesapeake volumes, would impact your plans for the development of the Caiman or the Ohio Valley Midstream assets?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, that is an excellent question. And I'll tell you, we have a very good vantage point, as you can imagine, given our investment in ACMP and our investment in Blue Racer. We have a very good vantage point up there right now around the degree of fractionation and the degree of liquids that's available from this area. And I would just tell you, I don't think that local fractionation is the answer up here. It is certainly going to overwhelm these markets and something large-scale is going to need to be built. And even, frankly, as it supports an ethylene cracker that Shell has announced and others have talked about, that also -- having a big Raw Make line provides a lot of flexibility in terms of ethane access back and forth between those markets. And so we think that something definitely needs to be done there, and we're working very hard on that. You heard Don mention earlier when asked about what we were going to do with all the extra cash at WMB, and based on both continued cash distributions as well as -- I think, when you do the math on it, you'll see there's quite a bit of extra cash distribution there, particularly in '13 and '14 given the tax rate and the performance in Canada. And so that is a very interesting place for us right now and I'll tell you, we have teams working that very hard and it's not as simple as just building a Raw Make pipeline into the Gulf Coast. There's a tremendous amount of issues about where you land that product and having the distribution network to distribute that product into the market and into big market outlets as we go forward. And so I think, if it was just as simple as just a Raw Make pipeline, we'd probably be past that at this point. But there's quite a bit of work we're doing on the distribution and storage end.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And given your comments that fractionation will likely overwhelm local demand in the Northeast, does that make your Ohio Valley development more biased to focusing on just de-ethanization opportunities or maybe less focused on the fractionation and more focused on the gathering and processing side of things?", "Francis E. Billings", "This is Frank Billings. I'd say, it's a very good question. I think what we see relative to your fractionation investment is that Williams will still have the opportunity to make those fractionation investments. I think what we're really evaluating is the market location for those fractionation investments. The producers that we have behind our OVM assets are going to be looking for a portfolio of markets to get into. And I think we are well-positioned to provide local market opportunities for those producers that want to have access to those markets but then, I think we're also going to be able to provide Gulf Coast markets and Gulf Coast access. So we're trying to position the producers such that they can maximize the value of their net back, and we feel like we'll still be able to make those investments, it may just be in different markets. We are looking at -- behind OVM, and we think in this market place in the Northeast, we think there's opportunities to have some customized solutions or customized infrastructure investments that allow Shell and others that are looking at chemical expansions to have the ethane that they need and give them ethane supplies certainty so they can make their investments. And then we're looking at producers in Canada that want to have the condensates. So we're looking at ways to consolidate our commodities such that they can have access to those. And then, obviously, the local market, we'll look at -- to propanize our investments to the extent that the propanization option makes sense. But with access to the Gulf Coast, you're going to see -- you're going to start to see those different commodities being sold into those markets based on the best net back at that time. And I think what we're doing with the NGL infrastructure is providing the best opportunities for our producers. And we think that's advantageous for them long-term, but it also, I think, it allows for us to place some pretty strategic investments in that area, as well as the Gulf Coast.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And just one last question for me. Given the fact that you guys have made moves in, say, Western Canada to take an area that's long propane and create your own solution to that with the PDH facility. When you look at the Northeast, really, Williams is pretty uniquely positioned in the sense that you are probably the only operator, either midstream or upstream up there, who's got the know-how, who's got the access to liquids volumes on the upstream side, as well as the know-how to execute an olefins or petrochemical project. Given the fact that, I'd say, the noises out of Shell, it sounds like they're probably a little bit more slow-moving and conservative than folks who are long ethane producers, who are long ethane in the Northeast would like. Isn't there an opportunity for Williams to get involved on the petrochemical side, and maybe preempt a third-party petrochemical project by building your own or JV-ing with one of those companies?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. I would just say, first of all, our focus on the petchem side is to continue to provide market outlet for both our product and for our producers' product and not to go headlong into the petrochemical business. And so I think it's always important to remember that, that we see that as a great hedge to our business, and we think it's important -- an important part of a midstream company's role today with all the independent producers that we have, to develop the infrastructure and the market outlets. And so while 20 years ago, you would've seen the majors developing all of that infrastructure and all of that market outlet ahead -- or in concert with developing a big resource, we think it's the role today of the major midstream players to do that. And so it's not out of the question, but I would just tell you that we have looked at it and looked at it, and we think all of the investment required in storage, particularly underground storage -- which as you can imagine, is a challenge in the Northeast -- and all of the derivative market for all the product that's already interconnected in the Gulf Coast, is quite a bit to overcome. And so we certainly aren't the chemical players that Shell Chemical is and certainly, wouldn't doubt their understanding of that market. But from our standpoint, we'd have to get way into a lot of other derivative markets and so forth to overcome that. And so for us, we think the simplest way is to get some of that product into markets that are expanding. And frankly, we look forward to working with Shell to help provide supplies -- as that is another market outlet as well, and we certainly intend to be connected with that if they go forward with that project.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I want to come back to this question on the use of cash at WMB. And if you look at, I guess, Page 83 of the data book, you've got about $2.32 of cash flow you're going to generate even before the Canadian operations, but paying out $1.75. If I just kind of play back what I've heard, it sounds like your preference is to reinvest that excess cash flow into infrastructure rather than paying it out, maybe even, say, a special dividend or whatnot? Maybe you can just walk us through how you're thinking about that excess cash flow?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Ted, this is Don. Yes, I think we would prefer to reinvest it. We think that it's certainly, in terms of a dividend -- to increase the dividend on the back of accelerated depreciation with knowledge that the rate's going to go up in a couple of years, is really not that sustainable. Obviously, we expect to have much higher cash flows in a couple of years but nonetheless, just with the opportunity set that we see in front of us, I think we've talked a lot about -- Alan just put a voice to the opportunities we see around the NGL side of the business. We think that, that capital is -- could be strategically invested at very attractive rates of return. And we think that will really provide greater value for investors long-term.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. Next question was just on the WPZ and the cash distribution. I mean, we are forecasting sort of just over 1x in 2014 and you made, I think, a comment in the press release about getting back to normal levels. I mean, how are you seeing where you want normal levels for coverage to be, understanding that we've got sort of weaker propane prices and NGL margins and whatnot, but I'm just trying to figure out where we ought to think about as a normalized coverage ratio target?", "Donald R. Chappel", "I would comment that we would like to see the coverage at or above 1 over an extended period of time. I'll remind you over 2010, 2011, we were operating at kind of 1.3x, 1.4x coverage. So if you take the 2 very strong years and then, if you take '12 and our current guidance on '13, you still end way above 1. So again, I think there will be ups and downs in coverage. As you'll recall, when we had coverage up in the 1.3x, 1.4x range, a lot of investors and analysts were suggesting that we should raise the distribution and we said it's high because margins are high and we want to be in a position that when margins roll back -- and they will, because they always do and then they'll go back up -- that we're not under too much stress or strain. So we really look at it on a longer-term basis. So I think longer-term, we'd like to be 1 or better. And if we are better than 1, we're pretty happy about that.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "And I would add to that. It's certainly -- if we saw this as a business that wasn't growing and we had that kind of coverage, that would be one thing. But we certainly see it transitory in nature, and we certainly put a lot of equity into this business and funding a lot of this cash flow that's very -- that's yet to come on in terms of driving our distribution. And so I think we feel very good about where we are and as Don said, we're -- we really look to the long-term. But I think to answer your question, we certainly, if we were in a steady state kind of environment, we would want to be in the 1x to 1.10x range if we were in a steady state environment.", "Donald R. Chappel", "And certainly, our business mix will be a factor of that. As you know, we are moving more and more to a fee-based portfolio and as well, access is entirely fee-based, and as the cash distributions back to Williams grow off Access, that will further shift us toward fee. And then it's a question of what kind of margins we enjoy. If we're in a low-margin cycle, the coverage will be tighter and if we're in a high-margin cycle, it'll be more robust. But I think the business mix and you have to think about Access as a contributor to that as well.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then, last one, just small one for me. You talked about the attractive economics of running propane versus ethane. Just how much can you run through Geismar, sort of, an ethane-propane mix, if we think about that?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. We can run about 30% on a inlet volume basis in propane.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "At this point, I just have a few clarifying questions, if I could. And maybe the first is just on Ohio Valley and the 150 million a day that was referenced of delay. I didn't catch -- is that something that we'll sort of see kind of a consistent delay through 2013 and 2014? Or by 2014, for instance, should the challenges of getting the right equipment in place be surpassed where we don't have any of those curtailments in that $80 million to $120 million of EBITDA, Alan, I believe you referenced, won't be dragging anymore. Can I just get a little bit of clarification on that?", "Francis E. Billings", "Sure, this is Frank again. That 100 -- that volume that I referenced, that's volume that we know is available to us today. It's actually produced volume that's just behind our system and we feel we're going to get the majority of those operational issues resolved in the second quarter. So we're hoping that we have that volume flowing freely to our Fort Beeler facility and through our fractionation assets in 2013. So really, it's really on us to make certain that we get through the operating and asset issues that we've been dealing with over the last few months and we get the assets stabilized and when we do that, we'll have a nice base business for 2013 and we will be able to grow forward from there, per the guidance.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Great. So we actually have the -- or in the guidance, the volume is actually coming back, call it, by midyear then?", "Francis E. Billings", "Midyear to the end of the year. And I think the challenge is, all the time we're doing that, of course, there's new volumes being drilled. And so we constantly will be in a catch-up mode for some time. I think it's important to note, though, if you look at Laurel Mountain, we've been at that for a while now and we are now ahead of Chevron, finally, out there in terms of capacity. We're getting close to being there while, I would say, we're going to be on a treadmill for a long time in the Northeast with Cabot and some of the other produces there. I would say, we're pretty well at pace with those producers right now and we just -- things have moved faster in OVM particularly, again, from a liquids production standpoint, both in terms of richer gas and higher degrees of condensates. So I think we're very confident in our ability to catch up, but I would just say, given the productivity of those reserves, we're going to be on a treadmill there for a long, long time to come. And likely, we'll be having some lagging excess capacity or excess production held behind our infrastructure for quite a while.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And Alan, if I could, just as a follow-up on that -- I guess, the producer frustration, is all of this, in effect, call it, industry rich gas related? Has there been any execution-type of issues where Williams has stubbed its toe? I just want to make sure there's no risk of brand franchise bruising for instance?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I'll let Frank take that, but I'll just tell you, we're not the only one struggling up there. I think about anybody, if they're honest with you, would tell you that what's going on up there is a lot of this. And as well, the producers are having their own issues, upstream of our facilities as well. And Frank, I don't know if you want to add some color to that?", "Francis E. Billings", "Sure. I would say, the issues that we've had have been mostly around our field receipt points and obviously, those are vital to getting the production into our gathering systems and ultimately, into our processing assets. We've not completed those installations as timely as we would've liked and then, we have experienced inconsistent operations and reliability as production has come back up to those facilities. Again for 2013, I think our key operating issue for us is going to be to optimize and stabilize the current assets that we have in place and have the facilities better matched to the gas quality of the production. No one really knows with certainty the composition until it's actually produced and I think we've experienced some mismatched facilities to the production and the -- and what we're seeing out there. So the reserves are there, obviously, I think the producers would be producing more. But we have to reliably handle the production and move the production for these producers.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Understood. And maybe just last question, Don, just a clarification on the cash tax guidance, and understanding what's happened has been a benefit both of ACMP, as well as legislation on bonus depreciation. Is it possible to attribute that in any way, 90% to ACMP, 10% to the legislation? I mean, if we were trying to basically ascribe a benefit, if you will, even prior to legislation from the purchase price, for instance, of ACMP -- this is real value you guys are getting. Is there any way to do that?", "Donald R. Chappel", "I'd say both are significant. I couldn't give you the number -- the exact number off hand, but if you're interested in trying to learn more about that I encourage you to call John and Sharna and they can try to help you estimate the number. But they're both pretty significant.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "I had a couple of questions. If we could kind of dig a little deeper into the Petchem Services at the MB level, it's got the distinction of being kind of a growth opportunity that if you had 7x investments EBITDA, maybe having $100 million of EBITDA in a couple of years and can be dropped down because it's in the States. Can you discuss kind of the long-term vision of that, and at what point in parts or in whole, a drop-down might make sense?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Certainly, that would make a lot of sense, I don't think there would be really any prohibition to the majority of the investments that we're making there from being qualified income. And certainly, we feel like WPZ is pretty full on capital opportunity right now. And so WPZ is well-positioned to do a lot of that development. And certainly, it centers around the kind of things we've talked about in the past, tremendous amount of liquids coming into the area and a lot of changes going on in the petchem space there where parties are trying to crack lighter products. And that changes a lot of things, it changed butane movements, changes propylene movements. A lot of things that change as a result of the feedstock coming into those plants changing. And we have been thinking for some time, there'll be quite a shift in logistics requirements for the business and that you can't build all this new cracking capacity in the Gulf Coast and not have a lot of new logistics issues. And so we've been working to get ahead of that, both in terms of getting our supplies and our producers' supplies access to better markets, but as well, helping serve the petchem market in an open access manner, which heretofore has been pretty much not the way business has been done in the Gulf Coast in terms of having open access pipelines for all these products in between the facilities. And so we think there has been a huge opportunity left to us there to be that open access provider for services. And so we continue to see a lot of opportunities. We've picked up pipelines from BP that were underutilized, we picked up pipelines from Exxon that were underutilized and we picked up a pipeline from Explorer that were underutilized and we have quite a bit of similar activity going on to continue to have distribution networks that move with an expanding market there.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Alan, do I understand what you're saying, is that there's not just obvious opportunities for the organic CapEx that you already laid out on the acquired pipes, but that there's incremental M&A opportunities in that segment?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I would say it's pretty -- they're pretty modest relative to what we normally -- what you'd normally hear from us in terms of M&A. And so those acquisitions that we've made over the last couple of years, in total are, I think, $400 million or somewhere in that ballpark. And so I would say -- those combined. And so, I would say, it's those kind of pickups that we'll continue to assemble smaller investments like that and piece them together into a smart network.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Understood. A couple of other quick follow-ups. I noticed the CapEx cost on the Canadian offgas ethane project were up from 3Q guidance. Is this just incremental accretive CapEx on an expanding offtake or is it simply inflation?", "Randy M. Newcomer", "This is Randy Newcomer. The Canadian ethane project -- recovery project at Redwater is currently in construction and slated to be completed in May of this year. And so what that represents is additional or better cost estimation basically for completion of the project. So it's inflation in the cost of the project.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. And last question for me. I noticed that the ethylene price deck had some changes. We went up a little in '13, which is benefiting Geismar margins there. But then, we kind of flatlined into '14 versus what was previously assumed to be a steep contango into the following year. Can you discuss kind of what's driving the long term expectations there?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. We continue to really follow CMAI's forecast there and so you'll say that's right in line with CMAI's forecast. And that earlier, I think, $0.62 that we had in there was also right in line with CMAI. So a lot of moving parts in that space, and we think those guys did a pretty good job of providing that guidance. And so we take a look and certainly, are influenced heavily by their perspective, and that's actually what drove that.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "I got you. So this can easily jump around quarter to quarter in terms of long term guidance. It's not something you're trying to kind of neutralize by flatlining it?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "That's correct. And I would say, certainly this year, right now that forecast is conservative relative to what we're seeing on the ethylene and certainly, conservative -- our forecast is conservative compared to what we're seeing right now on propylene. But certainly, it'll be some volumes continuing, new ethylene production coming on as some of these new facilities get back online. So I don't think it's going to be really big, frankly, in '13 and maybe, not even in '14, but beyond that we'll probably see ethylene production pick up.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Looking at, I guess, your guidance for the Geismar volumes? Is the difference really just related to the timing of the expansion?", "Randy M. Newcomer", "This is Randy Newcomer. You're referring to the volume estimate of 125 million?", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Randy M. Newcomer", "Basically, it's several different factors, but the primary factors are related to the timing of the -- timing of the turnaround where we were running longer, moving the turnaround from the spring to the fall between turnaround cycles. And at the end of -- at the tail-end of the turnaround, you end up having a little bit of natural degradation in your production capacity over the course of the run. So that's impacting it a little bit. The second thing is, as we're planning this turnaround, obviously, it's a combination of both maintenance activities and tie-ins related to the expansion. And so as you might expect, there's a lot of complexity to that and the need for a lot of good planning effort. We're not quite finished with the final plan for the activity during that time frame, but we've injected a little bit of additional -- as Alan spoke to before -- a little bit more conservatism into the volume forecast, understanding that there will probably be a few bobbles as we come up from the expansion -- we're going to come up after the turnaround in full expansion mode. Whereas before, we were going to come up at the current rate and then bring expansion on later in the year. With moving the timing of the turnaround to the fall, we will be coming up off the turnaround in full expansion mode. So a combination of factors there. Additionally, when you crack heavy with propane versus ethylene, you make a little bit less ethylene and more propylene, and so we really have to look at total olefins production rather than just ethylene and 125 million pounds per year is related just to ethylene. If you'd net it with the other olefins that you produce, that certainly are valuable as well, like propylene, it's about 100 million pounds a year.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And do you anticipate, I guess, cracking propane at that 30% max or close to it this year?", "Randy M. Newcomer", "It just depends on the relative price at any given point in time. We tune that up each month.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "So basically, if you took our assumptions on the ethane to ethylene spread, anytime we are cracking propane to propylene, it's an upgrade to those economics. That's the only reason we would be doing that, is that if we see better economics. And obviously, right now we're seeing better economics cracking the propane. And so that's always kind of an upside to the basic ethane to ethylene spread.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then, maybe if you could talk about Williams' competitive position in bidding for the new pipeline project in Florida?", "Frank J. Ferazzi", "This is Frank Ferazzi. We, like much of the rest of the market, have received the documents for FP&L's RFP and so -- it's complicated set -- it's a complicated RFP, it's 200 pages or more. And so we're in the process of evaluating both the commercial aspects of the RFP, as well as our financial planning people looking at the route and coming up with an estimate of capital. And so we have a lot of work to do between now and early April when responses to the RFP are due, and have not yet decided whether we're going to bid or not. I would say that I think Gulfstream is in a good position, currently, in the marketplace -- strong assets, strong relationships with the market. And so I think that will give us an advantage in the end.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess, if you do decide to bid, would this be a project you're pursuing with Spectra, like a JV, 50-50 JV?", "Randall L. Barnard", "It would be a project that -- a bid that would come from Gulfstream, which of course, is owned by Williams and Spectra jointly.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from TJ Schultz with RBC Capital Markets.", "TJ Schultz - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just following up on the NGL projects in the Marcellus and Utica, I guess, as the liquid takeaway options evolve and options for ethane take-away come along, what is the status or interest level of your proposed Confluence rich gas project there?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I would say Confluence has merged into a lot of different things, but we are in really good shape there. I would say, and have made good progress on contracting with parties in the area. A little different than what we've originally laid out, but in terms of investment opportunity, it'll look very much the same. And so we are excited about that and it's helping -- as well, it's helping to support our confidence in a large Raw Make system being built in the Gulf Coast as well. And so things are coming together there very nicely.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Back to the question on the use of cash at WMB. The coverage ratio at PZ was 0.95x in '12 and we have talked about where it is for '13 and '14, it's 1x with some nice increases in ethane and propane. I guess, I'm looking for more on -- at what point does MB support PZ given that need to do equity and forego some RDRs [ph] with some of that use of cash given that it's a fairly weak outlook for the next couple of years?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Becca, this is Don. I'd say, it's a fairly hypothetical question right now. I mean, I appreciate the question but I would say, it would depend on the facts and circumstances that develop. I would say if, again, the plan that we laid out, we execute on the plan, we don't believe there is a need for support. And we'll see how things play out. And if the situation were to be more difficult, that'd be something we'd have to consider. But I think it's hard to be formulaic about it. Again, we look at -- and in terms of coverage, we looked at '10, '11, '12, '13, '14, so if you really look at kind of the 5-year average -- again, the 5 years is well above 1. Yes, we expect 2013 to be below 1 but again, we are also investing a tremendous amount of capital in fee-based growth projects that we expect to come into service in '14 and '15 and really boost the fee based cash flows and boost the coverage at the same time that we're raising distributions. And 2013 is burdened by the carrying costs of those projects, both in terms of equity and debt that have been issued to fund that growth. So it's not just about the commodity price but it's about the tremendous growth that's occurring in the carrying cost of that. So again, we think this is still just a near-term challenge. And again, with the business plan that we've laid out and assuming effective execution, we think we'll be through this in relatively short order.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Selman Akyol with Stifel.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just going back to Geismar for a minute or 2. First of all, can you just remind us of the contract structure, or are you just selling all into the spot market?", "Randy M. Newcomer", "Well -- this is Randy Newcomer. We have a number of contracts and our contract mix, as Alan alluded to earlier, is changing. A lot of our ethane plus kind of contracts and collared ethylene sales have rolled off. And in fact, as of now, we really only have one that is on -- sale on ethane plus basis. The rest of them are all contracts that are priced at market, basically. Some of them are spot, some of them are yearly contracts. But the pricing is based on more spot kind of pricing. And we purposely have done that because we believe in the fundamentals of that, that ethylene is going to continue to be in good demand and we'll have a great ethylene crack going forward. So we've positioned ourselves to be exposed to the full crack for the present and including our expanded volumes as they come on later in the year.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, given your ability to, I guess, to crack propane into propylene, given margins have been extremely robust for propylene this first quarter, we could expect high margins, then, going into Q1?", "Randy M. Newcomer", "Yes, we do.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, if you look out into 2014, it looks like your capacity utilization assumptions are pretty high then going into that as well, and you're seeing that, I guess, reflected by your customers too?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Are you talking about on the volumes at Geismar?", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, yes, that's obviously a full year of the expansion coming up and naturally what's driving that. Even in the fourth quarter of this year, because of what we said, we've built in some conservatism. We normally -- you normally see us putting in a, depending on how many -- how much downtime we expect for the year, but normally, you'd see us running around 98% to 99% uptime on a facility like that. And I think we've got somewhere in the 92% range built in just following the startup there in the fourth quarter. Again, just trying to be conservative relative to the kind of bobbles we might experience as we bring that new facility up. So it's a combination of those 2 things that is driving -- but obviously, the big driver is the new expansion that will be online full year in 2014.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then, just going back to your guidance. You have about $2 billion forecasted for distributions in 2013. Can you say how many units that's based on?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Asking how many units.", "Donald R. Chappel", "That's a good question. We haven't disclosed the number of units, but it would be -- obviously, the current units outstanding in some plan for -- or some assumption on new units and we're not prepared to provide guidance on that at this point.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "All right. And one very small last question for me. The Mid-Atlantic Connector, when do you have that coming online in 2013?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Hold on just 1 second. Yes, Mid-Atlantic Connector actually went in service last week. So it was originally scheduled to be in service in November, but we had a 2-month delay.", "Operator", "And there are no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Okay, great. Well, thank you very much. On behalf of myself, our executive leadership team and our Investor Relations staff, I want to thank you for your time and attention this morning. A lot of moving parts that you all are all right on top of and I appreciate the opportunity to give you better explanation around that. We certainly look forward to sharing a more detailed, deep dive into all of our businesses with all of you at our upcoming Analyst Day that is scheduled for May 21, and we look forward to seeing you then.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Porter", "Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners.", "Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; a presentation discussing these results; guidance updates and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. This morning, Alan will make a few comments and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A.", "We also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas present with us: Frank Billings leads our Northeastern G&P operating area, Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area, Rory Miller leads our Atlantic-Gulf area and Randy Newcomer is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to any questions.", "In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great. Good morning. Thank you, John. Well, first of all, our cash flow metrics for the first quarter remained strong and in line with our expectations despite a continued decline in NGLs. Earnings at WMB, however, for the quarter were impacted by higher DD&A, including an additional $17 million of noncash amortization related to the ACMP acquisition. But we were pleased with the 1.05 coverage at WPZ despite another 21% step down in NGL margins from the fourth quarter of '12 and now a 50% decline from the first quarter of 2012.", "Looking forward, we see some short-term painful but long-term healthy cross-currents as both the NGL markets and the natural gas markets continue to expand on the backs of low-cost supplies relative to global alternatives. The natural gas market right now is ahead as the demand decisions have already been made in response to an extended low gas price period. But the NGL demand side will also begin to respond but perhaps not as quickly and certainly to more limited options for market expansions. As a result, we see a couple of years where NGLs will be oversupplied and producer's response to natural gas price signals will be more -- or will be met by most people -- be slower than most people's expectations just because of the time it takes to set the flywheel rolling in these large-scale operations. Areas like the Marcellus and the Utica will be advantaged by the benefits of large-scale development because those major programs are already in place. For Williams, this results in great infrastructure investment alternatives to expand in the market, access for these large-scale NGL and natural gas values that still will be ready to deliver quickly against the positive market signals. So in the short term, the higher natural gas prices will be negatively impact -- will negatively impact our margins. But longer term, this will drive even more investment alternatives.", "So while our 62% growth in DCF from 2013 to 2015 is certainly impressive, we could see this improve even more if the forecasted pricing environment holds up long enough to spur more supplies and more demand because after all, our strategy is built around the volume throughput that will come with expanded markets with these great low-cost resources being developed here in North America.", "We're excited this quarter to announce the continuation of our 20% dividend growth at WMB through the 2015 guidance, and we look forward to sharing more about our large platform of growth capital projects that supports this continued growth in 2015 and beyond with our Analyst Day coming up here on May 21.", "And with that, we'll turn it over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brad Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Could you provide maybe some kind of breakdown of what is driving the CapEx growth in the Northeast segment particularly? Is that the result of regulatory hurdles, labor, materials or another factor?", "Francis E. Billings", "Yes, this is Frank Billings. The majority of the capital increase in the Northeast that we're seeing and forecasting for really '13 and '14 and a little bit of '15 is really targeted for additional capacity requirements to support the drilling programs for our customers in Northeast Pennsylvania. We're actually expanding market outlets to support those drilling programs and increasing our takeaway capacity to the current pipeline connections that we have, as well as setting up for Constitution coming on as well. The other thing we have is -- the other piece of that is we do have our Three Rivers investment in that time period as well.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And when you talk about increasing takeaway alternatives, is that focused more on gathering? Or is that -- is there a specific long-haul pipeline that you're delivering into more than you expected or where you're building more capacity?", "Francis E. Billings", "It's spread out across the current delivery points that we have today. So we have our deliveries into Transco, Tennessee, Millennium, we'll have Constitution, and those are the primary ones we're going to continue to focus on. And that's the -- and those are the outlets that our producer customers are wanting us to focus on as well.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And is there an update at this point on Bluegrass, how the contracting of the pipeline is coming along? And if Bluegrass does proceed, do you believe that it reduces the demand for local market fractionation in the Northeast?", "James E. Scheel", "This is Jim Scheel. Bluegrass negotiations are going very well right now. We have operations, legal and commercial folks working to finalize the agreements. It's my hope that we'll be finalizing those some time during this month so that we can go out to customers with tariff proposals early next month. Going to the next part of the question, yes, I do believe that Bluegrass will provide a great opportunity for wide-grade [ph] product to move to the Gulf Coast in order to meet the customer demand for NGLs in the large-scale fractionation facilities in that area of the country", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And just one last question from me. In 2014, there was a revision to the Atlantic and Gulf segment EBITDA. It looked a little bit larger than just commodity impacts alone, and I was wondering if you could comment on that? And that's all for me.", "Rory Lee Miller", "Alan, do you want me to take that.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, please, Rory.", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes. Just a couple of things going on there. Effective March 1, 2013, we have set new reserve rates and rates subject to refund. And the main driver there was we wound up with a little lower rate base to work against than we were forecasting in earlier periods. We had a little lower maintenance capital spending and so that drove the rate base down, which brought that kind of forward-looking base down a bit. And then there is an impact on Gulfstar. We're probably looking at a couple of months, potentially, delay there, and that effect is kind of amplified because of the accounting treatment that we're using with the Marubeni buy end of the project. As you recall, we sold half of that project to Marubeni and due to the accounting treatment, it shows the full impact to segment profit, but the impact on DCF is only about half of that. And Don, if you -- you may have a little more clear accounting explanation of that, but that's it in a nutshell.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Just to follow up on Rory's comment, again, we consolidate the Gulfstar project, so we show 100% of it despite the fact that our ownership is 51%. And our partner, Marubeni's interest, shows up as non-controlling interest, so you see segment profit move down as we've pushed the startup of that project back by a quarter. But the net effect of that is about half of what shows up in the segment profit change because of the non-controlling interest change that offsets it.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Faisel at Citi. I appreciate the additional guidance on the dividend for 2015, but I just wanted to ask a few questions on those assumptions in order to get to that number for dividend growth for '15. I guess if I look at the analyst package and look at your coverage ratio for the dividend payout for '13 and '14, it seems like you have enough coverage. But it looks like that assumption is based on a very low cash tax rate. It's also based on ethylene prices kind of holding up where they are, and I guess it also assumes that ethane rejection kind of continues for the foreseeable future. I'm just wondering, what gets you comfortable that you have enough wiggle room through the -- over the next few years to increase that dividend all the way to 2015 by 20%? I mean, the cash tax rate looks a little bit aggressive, and the ethylene assumption also seems -- it seems decent now, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of wiggle room.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Faisel, this is Don. I'll just take the first part of the question on the cash tax rate and then I'll turn it over to Alan. But you're correct, our cash tax rate through '14 is fairly low. And even into '15, it's less than probably the long-term rates. However, we have a forecast that goes out well beyond '15, and we do account for the fact that our cash tax rate will be moving up over time. And despite that, we're comfortable that we have the coverage, the capacity and the underlying growth projects to sustain that dividend growth through 2015. And again, I think we feel comfortable that we have strong growth beyond. Despite it, we're not providing guidance out in that beyond-'15 period.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Faisel, I'll take the question on the pricing, particularly on the ethane and ethylene. At the WMB level, which I assume your question is pointed to relative to the dividend, don't forget that we do have ethane exposure, positive ethane exposure, in Canada that is not captured in a lot of that PZ analysis that we've shown in terms of our sensitivity of ethane to ethylene such that if you add back in that exposure -- now remember, that -- the way that contract is structured, we have a floor that's a cost of service basis for negative ethane. But when ethane goes positive, then that's long barrels that would offset that otherwise short position that we have against ethane. So at the WMB level, we're actually fairly neutral there. In addition to that, we also have the impact, and it actually showed up pretty significantly in these numbers as we went to full ethane rejection from our Overland Pass business, where we're showing full ethane rejection throughout this period. So even though that doesn't show up as direct commodity exposure, it's pretty significant in terms of its impact over this 2-year period. So if you really look at the full balance of our exposure there, I would tell you we're -- from a cash flow standpoint, we're pretty well neutral relative to that ethane assumption at the WMB level. And so -- and as to the ethylene and propylene margin, we're certainly showing that reducing by about 10% from what we saw here in the first quarter of 2013. So certainly wouldn't suggest that that's not without risk. But frankly, we're seeing a lot of pull through on the ethylene side right now, on the demand side for ethylene. So at this point in time, we think that's a sound assumption on our part.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And, Alan, just to make sure I understand the guidance going forward for '13, '14 and '15, the ethane equity sales that we saw in the first quarter and the ethane production numbers we saw in this first quarter, are we to assume that those numbers kind of continue with the same first quarter numbers kind of going forward, which would be a drastic short of reduction in volumes over the fourth quarter of last year and all of last year for that matter. So I just want to make sure I understand that number in the guidance.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "That is an -- I will tell you no -- even though we've said we will expect our pricing is done on a -- in terms of what we put out, is done on an annual average basis, and I will tell you, it won't be that smooth. And there will be periods where we have recovery and there will be a short period in there as prices inch up, and then we'll see rejection turn around. So when we say full rejection, we mean that in the sense that the pricing signal on an annual average basis will keep that. But we'll see spotting. In fact, I think we had some periods of recovery here recently here in the second quarter as well. So we'll see periods where we go in and out of recovery and rejection. But we think there's plenty of supply to hit that bid very quickly out there in the market, and I think one of the things that's kind of reset that market a little bit from what we would have seen maybe 5 or 10 years ago is there's a lot of ship-or-pay kind of contracts out there such that the variable expense to a producer is higher than what it used to have been. So they're making a decision against the ship-or-pay contract, which is kind of lowering the point at which people will go into rejection. And we as Williams really don't have that. And so we're right on the edge there and really looking at variable expense with the exception of the little bit of impact, the benefit we get from the Overland Pass transportation. So I think that's keeping that pricing level down below where you normally would see it for -- to encourage ethane recovery.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stephen Maresca from Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "My first question is just on the IDR waivers. Alan and Don, you had 1.05 coverage in the first quarter. What made you feel like you needed to do the IDR waivers through the year? And how much of this was just a reduction in price assumptions? Or how much of it was kind of your view that volumes are not picking up quite as fast as previously thought?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Steve, I'll take that. I would just tell you very clearly, the pricing is, by far, the primary driver for us on this. I'm actually encouraged, and I think there's a good chance that we'll see volumes respond even more positively than we have in our forecast. But I would say we're at a little bit of a cross-current here in the market where gas prices picked up. And yet, the producers -- we're not seeing that response from the producers quite quick enough. I think they're kind of looking at this pricing and wondering if it's for real or not in terms of this price pickup on natural gas, and they're not quite ready to put the capital back behind what might be a blip in price. So I think if that continues, that we'll see that. Nevertheless, I would tell you that, partially because of that response, we're showing higher gas price throughout this period, which is a big driver of that lower margin. And as we've said here in the second quarter, we watched butanes drop by $0.01 a day for almost 30 days in a row. And so I would just tell you, its hard to build a lot of optimism in that market, in that pricing looking forward, and we certainly don't have a good answer other than exports picking up some of that. We don't have a good answer because we continue to see the incredible amount of NGLs that are available in places like the Utica and the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford. And we just see those supplies continuing to roll in. And so yes, we've got expanding markets in the way of exports, but there's a tremendous amount of supply continuing to build here for the next couple of years. And we're going to need to see very large-scale solutions developed like the Bluegrass project to really provide big enough market access for these products.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then I believe you mentioned, Alan, also on the podcast, just some of the lower segment profit guidance in '14, including some changes in in-service dates for projects. Can you elaborate what is driving a little bit of that?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. I think the primary driver there for '14 was the Gulfstar project that got mentioned. And again, that just hit segment profit by the larger number, and you cut that in half when you get down to DCF. That's probably the largest impact project that we have for 2014, and I think that's really the primary driver.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then final one from me, another thing you mentioned was being a little bit disappointed with the Ohio Valley cost environment, higher cost than had thought. Can you talk a little bit also about what is driving that? How you see that playing out over the next 6, 12 months?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. I'll take that and Frank can fill in where I miss here. But I would just say, we have really poured into that. But I think one of the things that might -- some of the way that language came off, a lot of the cost increases we're talking about, just from an accounting perspective, is much higher depreciation expense. And so that's really one of the primary drivers of expense on that. But I would tell you that we are working very, very hard to get our operations in line up there, and we're really trying to not spare a whole lot of expense on that. We're certainly mindful to it. But there's so much value in getting that system up and running and getting it up and reliable that we are -- we are bringing in a lot of resources from other parts of the country and really working hard. That's a very high-margin business for us, as you can imagine, on one hand. And in addition to that, it's certainly a reputational issue for us as well in terms of serving the customers out there. And so we're working hard. There's a lot of issues to overcome out there as a lot of that system really wasn't built in a robust enough way to handle the variability that we've seen in production out there. And so we're working hard to overcome that. And so I would just say we're going to get there, and we're having to pour the coals to it on the expense side right now to overcome some of them.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just want to come back to the 2015 dividend. What is the coverage, by the way that you defined it, that you're looking for in 2015? I think you're at sort of 1.3 or 1.34 on '13 and '14, but what's your coverage on '15 that you're seeing?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Ted, we have not put that out yet. We'll put it out on Analyst Day. But we're comfortable we have more than adequate coverage in light of the assumptions that are embedded in our forecast. And again, we didn't put out all of our '15 detail and keep you interested and coming to our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. I will be there. Just on Bluegrass again. I'm trying to understand the mechanics of kind of how -- the contribution that we'll get from Boardwalk. As I understand it, they'll contribute the pipeline, you'll contribute the cash. Is there any kind of crossover where, on capital or whatnot, they need to participate? Maybe walk us through that. And then also, this idea that ATEX, the enterprise line, might run more than just ethane, how do you see that impacting the Bluegrass pipeline?", "James E. Scheel", "Well, I'll start with the first question. Again, this is Jim Scheel. The anticipation right now is that Williams and Boardwalk will be 50-50 partners in the Bluegrass pipeline. Boardwalk will contribute part of Texas Gas that will have a value in the joint venture. Williams will true up through capital contributions for new construction. We'll be equal owners throughout the pipeline, as well as fractionation and storage facilities. To the extent there's customer demand for a export facility, we'd also anticipate sharing ownership in that on a 50-50 basis. That's the expectation today, and that's what we're working towards currently with them in those negotiations. As far ATEX going into additional products, actually, we would support seeing some of those opportunities to provide clearing for near-term liquids out of the Marcellus to meet customer demand. So I won't speak for enterprise, but that would be something that I think would help the market in the Northeast in the near term.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a big-picture one. It sounds like you have a lot of great growth projects, a lot of capital going in. Is there any sense that you feel capital constrained at all? I'm just wondering if there's projects anywhere that you might be turning down, maybe the pipeline into Florida that folks are working on? Just kind of how you're thinking about how much capital you have available relative to the opportunity set?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, we certainly are in a position to allocate capital, and we consistently do. And I would just tell you, we're very wary of risk as we do that. And so I would say we're allocating on a risk-adjusted return basis, and that's -- it's a good situation to be in. But we certainly are in a regular process of allocating capital and turning down alternatives that are put in front of us today, which are above our current cost of capital on one hand, but on the other hand, we've certainly loaded into our equity pretty heavily last year, and we've got such a great set of projects that provide so much value if we execute on those, that anything that can get in the way of that kind of value being realized is something that we're going to guard against pretty heavily.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Sharon Lui from Wells Fargo.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just wondering if you could talk about, I guess, the decision to undertake Bluegrass at the WMB level and whether you envision this project to, I guess, generate primarily fee-based cash flows that would be appropriate of the drop down to WPZ some point in time?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Sharon, this is a Don. I'd just say that we felt that WPZ had a pretty full plate in terms of projects to develop and finance and that Williams had some excess cash flow, and the Bluegrass development was a good place to put it. So clearly, it's a perfect drop-down candidate, or it could even be jointly developed in time. But that was really the thinking around the decision to at least initially fund that at Williams.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess just looking at the cash balance that you guys have and the projected -- the excess cash flow at WMB, do you envision, I guess, any equity requirements to fund CapEx at that -- the WMB level right now?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Sharon, there's no equity requirements contemplated in this plan that we put forth, but we wouldn't speculate as to what could occur. But again, I think as Alan mentioned, we're -- we have a vast array of opportunities. We're allocating capital very carefully, looking at risk as well as strategic value and near-term value as well in deciding what to fund. So it'll be based on the facts and circumstances and what comes forward.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then if you could just provide some color on the operational issues experienced at Ohio Valley and how that's being resolved?", "Francis E. Billings", "Sure. This is Frank again. Right now, we're really working to debottleneck the system with some near-term projects to kind of get some -- take some quick wins. Really, we're beginning to implement our long-term operating philosophy for the area that really focuses on removing the fraction of gas stream that wants to be liquid under the conditions we're realizing in the gathering system. We're still going to move those hydrocarbons to Fort Beeler and Oak Grove, but we're going to pull them out of the gas -- gathering line and put them into our liquids line and then handle the separation and product upgrading at those central facilities at either Oak Grove and Moundsville. The primary benefit that we're attempting to do is remove those liquids that are pooling in the line and driving up the operating pressures of the system, to the point that the liquids are curtailing the volumes. Another significant benefit of the change in philosophy is really a significant reduction in our pigging activity, which has been impacting our reliability but also creates a lot of operational complexity. As an example, we're going to get operating expense improvement as well out of that because today, we probably pig that -- pig those systems 3x a day, and with these changes we'll be able to do that potentially once a month. So we'll have significant reduction in those things that could impact our pressure. But what we find is when we pig the system today, we don't get very lasting benefit given the operating conditions. And the other thing that we're really setting up for. And you've got to remember, that system has only really been out there 12 months or a little over 12 months, but we have a wide variety of temperature and pressure that we see over a calendar year. And what we want to do is set up a system that we feel we can operate safely, consistently and reliably 365 days a year. So we feel like we've got the right path forward, and we're going to begin to implement some of those significant changes throughout the summer months.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with the Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "A couple of quick ones. Don, did I see correctly that you all are guiding to slightly higher cash tax rate expectations versus the fourth quarter guidance? And what's driving that? And then, Alan, I had a quick question about the IDR forgiveness after that.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Yes, Craig, I think there was a very minor change in cash tax rate, and that's usually just a function of CapEx and taxable income. So I wouldn't read anything more into it than that. So it's just a tweak based on all of the other changes we made in our forecast.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. And, Alan, on the IDR forgiveness -- I mean, frankly, as a onetime event, as you fill in for commodity margin with your huge fee-based growth CapEx pipeline, a couple of hundred million dollars as an NPV is irrelevant on a pretax basis. The question though, would be is, is this really a onetime event as you are guiding to just over 1x, 1.03x, I think, in 2015 PZ coverage? Or could you envision a circumstance where this might have to be repeated?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I think you could certainly describe the time where we might repeat it if we saw conditions occur, but that's certainly not what our plans suggest right now. And I think we have a fairly conservative plan out there. I think it's really just the result of the amount of heavy investment that we're going through right now on the capital side to take advantage of all these great opportunities. And so we are very much investing into what we think is a great strategy and -- but that obviously has required a lot of equity issuance at WPZ to fund all that, and that certainly put a lot of pressure on that coverage. And you couple that, of course, with a rising gas price and drastically lowering NGL prices, and that's the circumstances we find ourselves in for 2013. None of that, from my perspective, overshadows the great growth prospects that we've got going on in the fee-based business, and I think our effort here is just to bridge into that more fee-based model that we're moving to. And so I think in the future, there will be less variables as we become less and less reliant on the NGL margin. I think there'll be less variables that would drive us or require us to do that. So I think that's the way I would answer that.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Craig, I -- this is Don. I'd just remind you and the others on the call that, again, Williams owns 68% of the LP units and the IDRs. If you look at our guidance, we enjoy 73% -- and I think of the cash flows out at WPZ in '13. And I think it goes up to about 76% by 2015. So the amount of IDR reduction that's given back to others is, call it, 25% of the total 200. So really, the lion's share of that is really staying, and to the benefit of Williams, it's just putting it in a different pocket.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brett Reilly with Credit Suisse.", "Brett Reilly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Can you just add a little bit more color on the OBM lower volume assumptions more in the '14, '15 time frame, recognizing the issues you face today?", "Francis E. Billings", "Sure. When we look at what's going on in '13, I think if you look back at some of the producers behind our system, they've openly said that they're scaling back 2013 drilling behind OBM as a result there, in response to the current operating capacities that we have there. There's still probably $100 million a day of volume that we're going to unlock over the next 4 to 6 months that we feel like we can bring to bear. But we really feel that the producers are really focused on the drilling programs for 2014 and '15. And given the things that we're doing up there, I think we're going to allow the producers and Williams to get to the levels that we've previously forecasted. I think in '14, our volume projection's not off that far. And I know we have a little bit of a step down in '15, but I really think that's less -- that's probably less a response to known information. I think it's really just when we try to just project what we think the producers can actually do out of that area and given their volume profiles, we're really just trying to forecast more of what we see the activity being. But really, we're going to get out of -- we know we're going to have reduced volumes in '13 for the known things we have, but we feel like we'll have the system capable of moving the volumes that we've had in our previous forecast, and I think we've stayed pretty close to that level in '14.", "Brett Reilly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Got it. And with the additional capital being spent in that area to resolve some of the bottlenecks today, is there an opportunity at all to recover some of that cost? Or is this all incremental capital just to get or satisfy the current contracts?", "Francis E. Billings", "That's a good question. And actually, what we're doing is we want to make -- we do have to do some of these things to make certain that we stay in compliance with some of our current contractual obligations for pressures at some of our field receipt points. But we have had some discussions with producers to looking at a value trade that could either be some -- maybe some acreage that is currently not dedicated or some other ways to get some improvements in revenues as a result of the improved level of services that we're going to see out there.", "Brett Reilly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got you. And then maybe looking to the Western part of the portfolio, any update on recontracting some of those commitments you have out there so that it's more fee-based versus commodity-based?", "Allison G. Bridges", "This is Allison Bridges. Certainly, we are proactively negotiating contracts with producers as they are coming due. And I think that they are interested in moving away from pure keep-whole deals. So we are looking at different ways of contracting, whether it be fee-based or based on price of gas or other items.", "Brett Reilly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one for me, the $2 billion bump in your growth capital opportunity set at the MB level, is that really just a function of Bluegrass? Or is there a few other moving pieces within there?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Brett, this is Don. I think there's quite a few moving pieces. I think the biggest change is the expansion of the scope of the Bluegrass system to include, I think as Jim described, fractionation storage and export.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Back on the cash on Page 79, the 2014 ending cash balance of $308 million at WMB level. How much of that is Canadian and how much of it is domestic? And then just along with that, with the Bluegrass project expected to come online in '15, I would expect a significant amount of CapEx in '14. So how do you kind of bridge that gap at the MB level?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Becca, the bulk of that cash is Canadian cash. How do we bridge that gap? Well, it'll certainly be from capital raising. And it could be debt, could be equity. We'll determine that when we finalize our joint venture agreement and officially sanction the project.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Becca, a couple of things on that capital I don't think we've disclosed. I think Jim took a question earlier around Boardwalk contributing to the pipeline and us contributing capital, that's not an accurate representation at all of the funding situation there. And I think the question was that -- Jim didn't say that, but that was what the question implied. And so there is a contribution of pipeline, but there's -- and there's some recognition of that in value. But the sharing of the capital obviously is a lot more easily split on the pipeline. As well, I would just say a big chunk of that -- we'd love to be in the field constructing in '14, but I'll tell you, more likely, most the construction dollars will actually be in '15. And the project is scheduled to come on very late in '15.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "And then on the Northeast, the segment data shows I think a loss of $9 million in segment profit, and the guidance is $100 million for the year. Can you talk to us about how that ramps up? Is it ratable to get to the $100 million? Or is it more back-end loaded?", "Francis E. Billings", "I guess I'm not -- I need to see -- I'm not quite certain of the information. Are you looking at...", "Donald R. Chappel", "Just looking at the first quarter versus your annual guidance.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "I'm looking at the adjusted segment guidance within the PZ first quarter data book that's on Page 5. It shows guidance for Northeast G&P of $100 million for the year versus -- sorry, I've got so many pieces of paper around here. I think the first quarter was a loss of $9 million.", "Frank Billings", "Okay. Let me see if I can get that in front of me. Why don't we take the...", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "And then while you guys are looking then, Geismar. In your call, your podcast, you talked about cost overruns at Geismar. Can you quantify how big those are?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I don't think we have disclosed that. I would tell you it's still a little bit of a moving target at this point. But the -- what we do know is that some of the estimations of the amount of steel and amount of wiring and so forth came in at a higher level. So you can see on Page 61 there, you can see kind of the new range for that. But I would tell you, we are pretty far along on it in terms of the project itself and have a very good idea of the required additional materials and labor on that. And so that's reflected in there. But I don't think we've disclosed the actual amount on that. But again, you can get a very good feel for that on Page 61 in terms of the range there.", "Francis E. Billings", "Sure. And to your question on the first quarter versus the year guidance, this is Frank again. I think what you're seeing in the first quarter is we had some slip issues, and we also had the rupture in the -- on the pipeline system in the Ohio Valley that hit some of the first Q guidance. But if you look at our businesses up there, other than the kind of the -- what we're experiencing in OBM, our businesses in Northeast Pennsylvania around our Susquehanna County Supply Hub assets as well our LMM businesses are performing pretty well. And we should be seeing good cash flow and segment profit coming out of those areas. So it's not back-end loaded. We should see it start to come back quarter-to-quarter over the rest of the year.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "And then the last one is on IDR support. You talked about up to $200 million. That's really going to fluctuate depending on how much WPZ needs. So as we model that, do we look to you guys wanting to target throughout the quarters a 0.9x coverage? Or what kind of coverage would you give support to? Or what kind of -- how much cash to get to what kind of support level on the IDRs?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Becca, I think we've maintained some discretion over that. But we have 1.05 coverage in the first quarter. We'll look at what the second quarter results are on a year-to-date basis, as well as our outlook for the balance of the year and we'll make a determination. I wouldn't expect that necessarily we'll -- we won't try to put each quarter exactly where we would expect the full year to be, but we'll look at kind of year-to-date actuals, as well as the outlook for the year in determining how much to waive each quarter to get to the full year effect that we are looking for.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "The $200 million only applies to '13, not to '14. Is that correct?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "It is for the next 4 quarters. So it does -- it would be available. As you can see right now, we're not forecasting that we would need that in '14, but it is available.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Yes. Our guidance includes a waiver for each -- well, for the next 3 quarters. So if you look at Q2 through Q4 and the -- the actual payment for Q4 would extend into early '14. That's what's in our guidance model. However, the commitment is up to $200 million over the next 4 quarters, and we're targeting a 0.90 coverage ratio for 2013. And again, we didn't model any direct waiver beyond the next 3 quarters, even though we mentioned 4 quarters potentially.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I think most of the questions here have been asked, but maybe just a couple of cleanups. And first, just to clarify, the projected spending on Bluegrass, that anticipates the 50-50 structure? Or is that being showed more 100% at this point?", "Donald R. Chappel", "It's in the 50%, Carl, but it's not in our guidance. It's only in the disclosure of projects that are beyond the guidance set of projects.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then lastly, if I could just clarify, and appreciate the extra information on Gulfstar. This is with respect to 2014 WPZ guidance. Is it possible to clarify -- maybe Gulfstar is the only major project of note, but is it possible to clarify of the reduction in 2014 segment guidance and -- so understanding this is segment, not the DCF, how much of that came from the collective shift of in-service dates?", "Rory Lee Miller", "I'm not sure I have that. This is Rory, I'm not sure I've got that. If I had to guess, I'd say it's around half of it. And then the other biggest driver would be the other item that I mentioned about going through a rate case and our reserve rate and just dealing with a little lower rate base. But the Gulfstar project is going extremely well. I was down there last week and looking at the hull. The project looks fantastic. It's, like a lot of these projects, very complex and we think it could be a couple of months' delay on there. So that's about half of that change for 2014.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "For 2014? Right.", "Rory Lee Miller", "Right. And then after that, of course there's no effect. There's no impact to any of the revenue streams coming off then.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Selman Akyol with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Most of the questions have been asked. In terms of Geismar, do you have a turnaround scheduled for this quarter?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Take that, Randy.", "Randy M. Newcomer", "This is Randy Newcomer. We are -- right now, we're planning -- we're finishing up the detailed planning around the turnaround and the integration of the expansion. That will happen -- the tie-in of the expansion will happen during the turnaround. Right now we're anticipating bringing the plant down for maintenance and for the tie-in of expansion latter part of August. So it'll be a third quarter kind of event.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And how long would you anticipate being down at that time?", "Randy M. Newcomer", "We're planning -- right now, it's looking like -- and we have it in our forecast at about 50 days down.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then also in the quarter, in terms of production given the strength of margins, I think you were at 246 million pounds this quarter compared to the prior quarter of 261 million pounds. I was -- I would have thought you'd be a little higher than that given the strength in the market. Any comment there?", "Randy M. Newcomer", "Yes, a couple of things. One is that if you'll recall, the price of propane was down very considerably in the first quarter, and propane was actually the preferred feedstock during that time. And so we ran heavy on feed, which makes less ethylene, makes more propylene and actually higher profitability. So that's part of the reduction in the volumes in the first quarter. The other one was we had some furnace issues that kind of kept us one-furnace short for most of the quarter. And those have since been resolved.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then just more of an industry question, I guess we've been hearing that ethane rejection has been running at about 175,000 barrels per day. Does that seem like the correct number? Could it be higher than that from what you see?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I would say from the vantage point that we have, the areas that we have, I would say that's probably fair of the ethane that's positioned to be recovered today. Obviously, if you included all the ethane that's being rejected up in the Northeast, it'd be considerably larger than that. But I don't think anybody is really counting that because it hasn't been in the market previously. But I do think that looking -- if you track propane volumes and then track those relative to ethane volume, a pretty good idea even though -- as people reject ethane, as I'm sure you're aware, it does lower propane recoveries a little bit. And so I think that's a good indicator. But I would say from our vantage point that 175 is probably in the ballpark. It might be a little north of that, but that's probably a pretty close estimation.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then finally, just for clarification purposes, you guys talked about your forecasting based on ethane rejection. Is that at the same level going forward for the next several years? Or do you have that declining in your forecast?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No, we have the same -- really, when we estimate that for us, we're basically just looking at our plant economics and our variable cost economics and determining what we're going to do, obviously not determining what the whole market will do. And as I mentioned earlier, I think there's a lot of contract structures out there where there might be a percent of liquids contracts where the producer might be -\u2013 or sorry, the processor might be driven economically to continue to recover because they don't have the shrink risk, or there are take-or-pay or ship-or-pay obligations where the variable decision, if you will, is lower. And so they'll take a lower \u2013- because they're going to have to pay the transportation and fractionation anyway. Therefore, they'll take a loss on the ethane. So I think those are driving some of those decisions. But for our decisions, we basically are forecasting that we'll be in full rejection at all of our plants throughout the period. Now as I said earlier, I can assure you that will not be the case, that there will be periods where we're up a little bit as margins pop up and we'll take advantage of those. But as it's modeled in our plan right now, it is in full rejection.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from Helen Ryoo with Barclays.", "Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Actually most of my questions are answered. But just on accept and rejection, is any of your keep-whole contracts on your processing plants have \u2013- on those contracts, is there any must-recover ethane volume? Or could you just sell them at methane price when you have that negative spread?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. Well, really, the way that works from a contract standpoint is we just replace any Btus that we take out. So if we don't -- didn't take the ethane out, we just leave the ethane in and we don't have anything to keep a producer whole on. So we're not really exposed on that provided that we reject it. It's just \u2013 we only have to replace any Btus that we take out.", "Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then -- so I guess the full ethane rejection you saw in the quarter it's mainly affecting just the Overland and Conway fractionators?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "That's correct. Now the Overland Pass line, of course, collects the ethane from our Piceance and our Wyoming plants. So that's Opal, Echo and the Willow Creek facility, and those are a large producer of our equity ethane barrels. That's a very large portion of our equity ethane barrels. And so those are in rejection. But remember that those go into Overland Pass, they're not actually fractionated at Overland Pass \u2013- sorry, they're not actually fractionated at Conway. They're fractionated by One Oak at their fractionation facility in the Mid-Continent typically. So those are 2 unrelated issues. I would just say Conway is seeing the impact of rejection in the Mid-Continent. Most of its barrels and its NGLs come in from barrels that are produced in the Mid-Continent area.", "Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got it. And do you have any take-or-pay type contracts on the Overland pipeline?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No, we do not.", "Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just a follow-up or it could be clarification, but I guess did you change your Marcellus gathering throughput expectations for 2015 compared to the previous quarter data book? And if so, how much of that is driven by I guess the spending reduction in the Laurel Mountain that was mentioned?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. Give me just a second to pull-up my notes.", "Operator", "And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Let me get the answer -\u2013 finish the answer to that question. There's a few things that went on in the data book to data book. To your specific question, the largest volume reduction was probably around Laurel Mountain Midstream. And what we did there is we have basically forecasted, given that's a dry gas system at this point and really in anticipation of Chevron switching their drilling program into the wetter areas over the next few years, pulled out volume out of that area. But we also pulled back some capital as well. So it was a decision to reduce the capital that was associated with some of that volume growth. In ABA, what we did is we used to -- prior reporting, we actually had some volumes that were coming out of the William zone system and then flowing into the Laser system. Even though it was the same Mcf, we were showing those as being 2 volumes. So in the current data book, we've made a change to pull that out. And we're also doing some recontracting on that business. So it was being accounted for because we were getting a fee from Williams and then we were having a fee from Laser. So to make the -- we made that change. So that was probably the 2 largest ones. And then obviously, we did a little bit of a modification in Ohio Valley, which I mentioned earlier.", "Okay. This is Alan Armstrong. I'll go ahead and close out the call. Thank you very much for your continued interest in the company. We remain very excited about the environment we're in as we see the infrastructure requirements to build out for these very low cost resources here in North America. And we are still very lucky to be so well positioned in the locations we are to be a major player in providing this infrastructure and excited to see the kind of very long-term growth trajectory we have, not just a flash in the pan kind of growth but very long-term growth trajectory that's going to come off of these major investments that we're making here both last year, this year and into '15.

Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "John Porter", "Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners.", "Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages, the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. In addition to Alan we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas present with us. Frank Billings leads our northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area; Rory Miller leads Atlantic Gulf; and John Dearborn is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to any questions.", "In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great. Good morning. Thanks, John. We are excited to talk to you about our second quarter, as well as the continued progress on executing our strategy. We remain very confident that our strategy is well positioned to benefit over the long haul as we continue to see this market emerge and tremendous demand for infrastructure to take advantage of the low cost natural gas and natural resources continue to be developed in North America.", "Just to level set before we get into the presentation. I want to run down a few key points that are key to our strategy and this is starting here on Slide 4. First of all, this -- the strategy really does frame our growth investments, our dividend and distribution growth strategy as we continue to use that as direction for how we manage the business. So we remain very disciplined around the strategy and it really is a very strong compass for us in the decisions we make. So it's important for you to understand it.", "First of all, in the competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is created by large scale and the resulting market access and low-cost that we offer to our customers continue to be a guiding light for us. You won't find us making investments without those characteristics in our sites. Our Transco system and our West operating areas are great examples of what that looks like to us. And if you look at the Northeast, the moves we're continuing to make in this area really are all focused on getting to that scale of #1 or #2 position in that area. And certainly, we are convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that over the long haul, this creates great opportunity and value for both our customers and our investors.", "On looking to the growth side, I'm not sure it's possible really at this point to overemphasize the growth opportunities that we have available to us right now. Our Williams Partners Transco system is another great example as it relates to the growth opportunities that are in front of us. This is the nation's premier natural gas pipeline system. It's connected to the right supply and certainly the right market areas and the growth opportunities that continue to come at us day after day on this -- continue to build our confidence about the growth, not just in the supply side as we've seen around natural gas, but a strong movement towards the demand side. And as we expect, the overall market continue to expand.", "The position we're in there is very enviable and we really are in a position to select not just any growth opportunity, but the very best growth opportunities available in the industry right now. Simply put, you'll see us focusing on the top layer of cream in this opportunity set and with Transco is in other areas, we're realizing our strategy and we are ensuring these benefits translate into value for our investors.", "On the high dividend growth side. This is central to our value creation strategy. We've taken steps to ensure that even during a period of high investment in all these great growth opportunities that we are rewarding investors right now. We are building in the components to see this strategy run full-out as we bring on significant growth investments, many of which come online in 2015 and just beyond our current guidance period. We are investing to connect the best supply areas with the best markets, but we're also investing in ways that focus on fee-based that is largely resilient to commodity market fluctuation businesses. This is the foundation of our strategy to reward our investors with growing cash dividends and distributions, and we believe those characteristics also will produce high-value growth. It certainly, from our vantage point, is the best opportunity we have to deliver great shareholder value both now and in the future.", "So let's get into the meat of the presentation today. Following a few comments from me as I go through these slides, I, along with the management team that John introduced earlier, look forward to hearing from you.", "Moving on to Slide 5 here, which covers the key headline for today's earnings and guidance discussion. The big stories here.", "First, the growth in our fee-based business at Williams Partners was a major driver in our second quarter results. Keep in mind that strong performance was up against even less favorable NGL margins in this quarter and the unexpected impact of our Geismar olefins plant, which was down for about 20% of the period, and obviously, related to the tragic incident that we experienced there in June.", "Second, we are, again, reaffirming our strong growth guidance for our cash dividends and distributions. We continue to expect 20% per year growth in Williams' cash dividend in each of the 3 years in our guidance period. And for Williams Partners, we continue to expect strong cash distribution growth of about 9% here for 2013 and about 7% annually in each '14 and '15.", "Third, we are updating our earnings and DCF guidance with the modest changes to reflect lower NGL margins and our assumptions related to Geismar, including the projected restart date in insurance proceeds. So we'll spend a little more time on that here in a moment. And I want to call out how things are developing from an investor perspective with our olefins business at Geismar.", "That's where, as you know, we experienced an explosion on June 13. For all of us at Williams, it was significant, both personally and professionally, and also from an operation standpoint. During my tenure at the company, we haven't had to endure -- experience anything like that. And I can tell you, it was an event that I am very mournful of on the one hand, on the other hand, I've been very impressed at how our professionals across this business have pulled together to respond to it in a way that is keeping with our culture and now getting back and working hard to overcome from the incident.", "From a financial perspective, we continue to expect that our insurance policies will significantly mitigate the financial effects of the incident. And we expect to resume operations at Geismar in April and bring -- in April of '14, and bring the expansion into operations immediately thereafter.", "We have updated Williams Partners' guidance to reflect our current assumption about the financial impact of the Geismar incident. In addition to the Geismar impact, our updated guidance also reflects the expected NGL margin to deteriorate in '14. Even though we did -- we have lowered our NGL margins for '13 and '15 as well. I would tell you that we were -- we've been able to overcome that with other positives. So really the only area that we're lowering guidance on is related to NGL margins is a little bit of modest reduction for '14.", "Fourth, we expect Williams Partners DCF to increase by 66% between '13 and '15 as our large inventory of projects and most of these, as you know, are fee-based, continue to come online. And what's notable here, as well is that we expect the impressive growth to come even as we see continued pressure on the NGL markets that I spoke to earlier.", "Finally, we'll quickly touch on the few of the recent operational developments that support our broader strategy. One that's particularly noteworthy is the progress that we're making on the Bluegrass Pipeline project that is now included in our guidance.", "Before we move to the next slide, I want to make sure that we're clear about Williams' support for Williams Partners distribution during this period of high investment in the extraordinary growth opportunities that we continue to seize. As you'll recall in May, Williams announced we would support WPZ's cash distribution coverage ratio at a level of about 0.9 by waving the $200 million in incentive distribution rights. Today, that $200 million is unused, untapped because Williams Partners' strong second quarter performance yielded a year-to-date coverage of 0.92. So great news there that due to the strong DCF at Williams Partners in the second quarter, we remain without having to use that IDR waiver. So we're very excited about that.", "Let's move on to Slide 6 here. The major story here is that we're seeing the tangible benefits of our growing fee-based businesses and what it meant in the second quarter is that we delivered solid results even in an environment of weaker NGL margins and the significant impact of the downtime at Geismar.", "At Williams, we had our second quarter adjusted segment profit plus DD&A was up 7% compared with the year-ago. And for Williams Partners, our second quarter distributable cash flow was almost 1/3 higher than the year-ago levels. The primary driver of the DCF increase at PZ of course, was the strong contribution that Geismar made to the quarter prior to the June 13 incident. And of course, as you recall, that asset was dropped down in the fourth quarter of '12. And, as you know, it is producing tremendous distributable cash flow.", "Also -- substantially secured as we've mentioned to you and we'll provide a little bit more detail. We know there's been quite a bit of confusion on the insurance coverage in this package that we sent out, we hope it helps to clarify that. But we're glad to say that our business interruption insurance is helping secure a significant portion of that expected DCF.", "Getting this asset back in service with safe and reliable operations and expanded volumes is clearly one of our top priorities for the company right now. And we've got a great team of professionals that have got their hearts and minds into making that happen and are making great progress on that.", "For WPZ, we are pleased to report that our fee-based revenue grew 9% over the second quarter of 2012. During the second quarter, we saw our Western volumes recover from the earlier winter conditions of the first quarter. And we also benefited from the continued volume growth in the Northeast, as well as the startup of some of our new facilities. Another driver of our improved DCF versus the prior year was lower maintenance CapEx and this is primarily driven by reductions in our Western segment as various projects wrapped up in 2012.", "Additionally, we saw another significant drop in NGL margins of 13% from the prior quarter, so from the first quarter, which were already pretty low compared with what we've seen in recent years. And in fact, the NGL margin for the second quarter were down a full 44% from the prior year. So I think this is very significant that even despite these continued declines in NGL margins, you're seeing our business start to ramp out of being affected by that and really start to grow from the strong impact of the growth in our fee-based volumes. So our strategy is really starting to take hold in terms of those investments, and we think this is really kind of a turning point this quarter as we start to overcome those declines with the growth in that business.", "We continue to be very excited as well about our Access Midstream Partners investment as they reported a strong second quarter with their adjusted EBITDA increasing about 71% over the prior year second quarter. And for our second quarter equity earnings, we recorded $18 million in our adjusted segment profit plus DD&A column.", "In Williams NGL & Petchem Services business, we saw higher volumes lead strong growth, up nearly 50% in adjusted segment profit plus DD&A versus the prior year.", "So with that good news, let's move on to Slide 7 and review the Williams Partners guidance. So now, we're looking forward here a bit. In addition to the strong second quarter, we remain very optimistic about our business for the balance of the year, despite the fact that we're lowering the margins on the heavies a little bit because we just haven't been able to see that increase that we've been hoping to see in the propanes and butanes and so we did lower that a little bit. But the fact that our fee-based business has been growing and we've been able to do such a good job around managing our cost, is allowing us to hold guidance. On that basis, what really is impacting guidance here in '13 was the impact of the Geismar incident.", "So the big story here is we continue to expect tremendous growth in the PZ distributable cash flow. And in fact, we're expecting DCF to grow by 66%, increasing over $1 billion in just this 2-year period from end of '13 to end of '15. This growth is driven by WPZ's end guidance CapEx, which is averaging about $3 billion per year right now. And our latest guidance for WPZ's DCF includes modest reductions for this year and next year.", "For 2013, the effect of the Geismar incident is the key driver. And if not for that, we would have seen, hopefully, actually a raised guidance because we've been able to reduce costs and continue to grow our volumes at a pace that is even better than we were hoping for.", "For 2014, our expectation of NGL frac spreads is remaining very low. And due primarily to the lower assumed values for the heavy part of the barrels I mentioned earlier, and this really is the key driver in the change here for 2014. There are a number of other moving parts in there. But including in some of our projects and first flow dates on some of these projects that are backing up. But for the most part, we're -- again, we were able to offset that through other improvements, so it really is just boiling down to the NGL margin reduction there and we think we moved this down to a fairly conservative level.", "I know there's a lot of interest now we're thinking about the Geismar effect in our financial forecast. We have a slide in the appendix of this presentation that shows what we've included for business interruption insurance and how it is recorded in our financials for both the GAAP and the non-GAAP measures. Our 2015 distributable cash flow guidance continues to be strong. And importantly, does not incorporate any support via IDR waivers from Williams and with more than 3/4 of our gross margin coming from fee-based business by 2015, we have created a cash flow stream that is more resilient to changes in commodity prices and our 2015 forecast it does, and include an expectation of lower commodity margins, yet we were able to hold it where it was again due to improvements on some other piece of our business.", "I do want to make 1 point on guidance within the segments of Williams Partners. You'll note that the Northeast gathering and processing segment profit guidance is lower throughout the guidance period. It's important to understand that this change is really driven as a result of a reallocation of support costs among our WPZ segments. It's not an actual increase in WPZ's overall cost structure, again just an allocation amongst the various regions. So bottom line, our guidance now more actively reflects support cost that are being increasingly allocated to support the tremendous growth that we're experiencing in the Northeast and this accounted for about $30 million of lower segment profit for '14 and '15 and a little less than that for '13.", "So that's a good overview of our guidance changes for WPZ, which, of course, is a major driver for WMD's earnings and cash flows.", "So let's move on to Slide 8 to review Williams and Williams Partners CapEx and investment guidance. First, just focusing on WPZ's capital, I point out that we did have a number of movements among the 3 guidance years. But in the aggregate, CapEx is consistent with our prior guidance. And of course, we have lots of additional information about CapEx guidance at the project and reportable segment levels in our data book, which you can find on our website. Outside of WPZ, we have a couple of major developments to discuss.", "First, and most significantly, our current guidance now takes into account the Bluegrass Pipeline project. Our board recently approved the project and we continue to be encouraged by the support we are seeing from the shippers who recognize tremendous value that Bluegrass has to offer these very large-scale, rich gas drilling programs, and I can tell you that the producer community out there sees this as a great resource. But frankly, they really are dependent and really extremely interested in making sure that these kind of large-scale solutions for clearing these products in advantaged markets are going to be in service. And so I would just tell you, we've been thrilled with the response and the interest in the capacity that we have available for this project. And frankly, I suspect that we'll look back in the not-too-distant future and wish that we had more capacity to have available for the area.", "We are basing our expected investment on a 50% ownership of the pipeline and related frac-ing storage facilities. And we also included a few notes on how we think about the financing of the project. We've updated our current guidance to reflect ongoing changes to our Canadian PDH project as well. We have increased our estimated cost of this project as we've seen similar projects in our sector experiencing some overruns and so we've always got our ear to the ground and really trying to gain intelligence on what's going on in the space and we've certainly noted that some overruns exist out there. And so we're now looking at pushing the in-service date into 2017, primarily to allow for the codevelopment of the derivative plants that would be designed to take advantage of geographically advantaged propylene supply. We're in the process of negotiating offtake agreements that will dramatically reduce our commodity exposure on the projects and I'll just tell you, the interest that we've seen has been tremendous, and we're very excited about this project and our ability to really convert this into more of a fee-based kind of opportunity for us and at a very minimum, really reducing our commodity exposure on the project. So still extremely excited about the project and frankly, one of the advantages we're trying to make sure we capture is to make sure that we get full advantage for the geographic advantage that producing propylene and propylene derivatives in this area has to offer.", "Let's move on to Slide 9. As we review the second quarter and the first month of the third quarter, it's rewarding to see how we are executing on our business objectives, bringing new projects into service, setting volume records and adding new growth projects. These achievements all serve to support our strategy of developing and operating large-scale energy infrastructure that is connecting the very best producing areas to the very best markets. And as I mentioned, the growing demand that we're seeing in really all areas that are really positioning themselves to take advantage of these great low-cost products that we have here in the U.S.", "As previously mentioned, our Bluegrass Pipeline project and the related frac-ing storage facilities are a major development. We executed a joint venture agreement with Boardwalk Pipeline Partners to continue developing this project and we've designed Bluegrass to transport natural gas liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays to the rapidly expanding petrochemical and export complexes on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And, as well as the developing petchem market in the Northeast U.S. Williams board approved the project in June and we are now actively engaged in the development work, which includes surveying, environmental studies and permitting activities that are required to really keep this project on schedule.", "I can tell you from the shipper's perspective, maintaining that schedule is very important and a lot of people really have their eyes on that. We do have an aggressive schedule out there. And as a result, we've got to move quickly on the permitting and environmental stage. Of course the beauty of this project, one of them is the ability to use the Texas gas line, which greatly reduces the exposure we have to permitting activities along the large portion of the route.", "In our Atlantic Gulf business, we made significant progress on various fronts during the last 3 months. As I mentioned earlier, tremendous amount of growth going on, on Transco, but as well in the deepwater. We're pleased to have reached an agreement in principle, settling all issues in our Transco rate case during the second quarter and the agreement is in line with the new rates that we started booking the first quarter of this year. And as you would expect, the new rates are reflected in the current and the most recent guidance that we've provided in May. So in other words, steady as she goes on that front. Team did a great job of getting that settled quickly and in line with our expectations. So we're very excited to have that behind us and have that piece of our execution strategy checked off.", "In the deepwater gulf, we executed another tie-back agreement for our Devils Tower prospect. And we believe there's strong potential for another tie-back agreement as well in the area. These tiebacks are very powerful because of the very limited amount of capital required to bring these tiebacks on. And as you know, they produce a very meaningful amount of free cash flow. And certainly, this latest tie-back that we've reached agreement on is no exception.", "New projects coming into service are key drivers in the strong performance in our Atlantic Gulf operating area. On our Transco system, those expansions largely are in support of growing power generation load. We recently placed our Mid-South Expansion into service, this added about 130,000 dekatherms per day of fully contracted, long-term capacity connecting Transco Station 85 to serve power generators in the North Carolina and Alabama markets, as well as a local distribution company in Georgia.", "Just a note on that to remind you, last fall, we placed the first phase of this, which is about 95,000 dekatherms per day into service in -- same time last year. So we just keep clicking off these base hits. They continue to grow the firm revenues and firm service on Transco.", "Another important note for this period, I'm sure there's -- be a lot of questions around this. Because of our -- the Transco's positioning in the southeastern United States, we really are uniquely positioned to help meet the growing demand in Florida. As a result, we work with the Spectra to develop a winning solution to serve this large-scale growth opportunity as the FPL went out for an RFP for service in the area as you're all very well aware of. So as a result of that, Transco will be expanding its system from Station 85 up to an interconnecting point with Sabal trail and the near our Station 105 and the Sabal trail partners will then lease this capacity from Transco's on a long-term and cost-of-service basis. And in addition, Williams Partners has an option to acquire a meaningful, but a minority interest in the Sabal trails project. The option gives us a chance to better understand -- because of the timing of the auction, it gives us a chance to better understand the construction risk and the volume risk that ultimately will be associated with this bold project.", "We also took an important step on pace with our schedule for the Constitution Pipeline. In June, we filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to seek approval and build and operate this 124-mile pipeline that by 2015, will connect Marcellus gas production around our Susquehanna Supply Hub in Northeast Pennsylvania with key Northeast markets. And of course, these markets are continuing to grow mostly from power generation as well, and of course from the benefits of low cost natural gas. And that does interconnect into the Iroquois and Tennessee Gas Pipeline in upstate New York. The Constitution design supports transportation of about 650,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day. In the Northeast gathering and processing business, we're seeing important progress in putting the infrastructure in place to meet the demand of growth from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays and we're continuing to steadily increase gathering volumes in the Northeast. Keep in mind that we have exposure to this terrific growth through both assets that we operate and those investments for us that are operated by ACMP and our Blue Racer joint venture with Caiman and Dominion.", "Now on our operated assets, we set record monthly average volumes for June. And where we eclipse more than 1.8 Bcf per day of gas, not bad considering where we started just a few years ago there. And for the quarter, we gathered 76% more gas on our operated assets in the Northeast than we did in the second quarter of last year. So tremendous growth pace that we're on there. And I think, you'll continue to see tremendous record set there. And in fact, here in July, our team in the Northeast there topped their June record by gathering over 2 Bcf a day on our operated assets in the area.", "So our team just keeps expanding that. And so we're very excited to see the kind of volume growth we've got there. And also on the Susquehanna Supply Hub expansions, we're working very hard to keep pace with Cabot's rapid growth up there, team is doing a great job of working with Cabot and they are a formidable group to try to keep up with, with their very successful drilling program. And we are as excited as anyone to see them add their 6th rig coming up here in August.", "So a lot going on up there and great example of how infrastructure and drilling programs need to be coordinated well together. In our Ohio Valley Midstream franchise, we added another train there, so this will be the third train to our Fort Beeler facility. So continuing to execute on the buildout of our infrastructure there. And as planned, we placed into service 3 condensate pump stations in the second quarter to maximize liquids to Moundsville and to make sure that we're getting the liquids, the vast amount of liquids to continue to grow rapidly in that field. And so as Frank Billings laid out for you at our Analyst Call, he laid out several milestones that we need to execute on and we are clipping those off on schedule.", "On Slide 10, we'll review the array of growth CapEx spending and the timeline when to expect these projects to begin generating revenue. So if you look here at the large CapEx platform we're managing on the slide, you can see all of our major projects that will be coming online here extending into 2017 with our Canadian PDH project.", "Fundamentally, this is the same way we presented our CapEx by project outlook at our Analyst Day in May and in addition to marking a couple of projects that are now complete, including the Fort Beeler TXP III project. The most significant updates relate to the inclusion of the Bluegrass Pipeline project in the Canadian PDH project as we've just discussed. A few things to point out on this as well. First, the investment WMB made in ACMP is above and beyond what you see listed here, and we expect all of their strong growth prospects will be self-funded.", "Second, with the exception of the WPZ Geismar expansion and the WNB Canadian projects, all the remaining projects are backed by fee-based revenues. And finally, I would just highlight that this page concisely summarizes what we must execute on in order to achieve sustainable growth in cash dividend and cash distributions. These are projects that are well-known and well understood. Many are well into the construction phase. Our growth is highly dependent on our ability to execute on this vast array of value creating projects and not so much directly on NGL margins has been in the past. It also is obvious from looking at the slide that it will be 2015 before we begin realizing the full value potential of most of these investments and thus that 66% growth we see in DCF occurring in 2015 from our 2013 expected results.", "So moving here to the close. Before we move to the Q&A session, I'll just provide a few closing comments here.", "First of all, our fee-based business continues to grow and the second quarter results are a strong indication of the success of that strategy and our fast-growing resilience to commodity market fluctuations. In fact, when you think about it, in a quarter where were lost our single-largest commodity margin generator in the name of the Geismar plant for 20% of the period, we still had a very good quarter. We continue to make significant investments in areas where we can realize large-scale and lower cost of operations. And we are absolutely committed to focusing on areas where we can achieve our #1 or #2 position, not because we want that for bragging rights, but because we think that puts us in the position to have sustainable, long-term dividend growth of the kind you've come to expect from us.", "We've seen that in our Transco system and the west operating area and we're making similar investments in the Northeast to drive this additional growth, not just through this guidance period, but well beyond this guidance period. Williams is working to connect the very best supplier areas with the very best market areas and we've assembled a very strong management team in our operating areas and in our E&C areas and so we're very committed to helping deliver this growth and profitability that we know is -- that we can achieve as we execute against this strategy. The strategy is providing us with so many great investment opportunities that we are in the envious position of picking the very best risk-adjusted return projects that the market has to offer, and we think over the long haul, of course, that is going to provide superior shareholder returns over and above our peers, both in the near-term, but especially over the long haul and we certainly look forward to sharing our success with our investors as we move forward.", "Thank you for your interest in our company and we'll be happy to take questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Alan, I want to talk first on Bluegrass. You seem pretty confident in the project obviously, it's now in guidance. What's your view on what sort of commitments you expect to move forward on it? What are the next steps we should hear about in terms of permitting? You mentioned getting commercial agreements later this year and then finally on that, do you expect this own -- just 50% of this or more or less as the project plays out?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, it's kind of hard to speculate on the ownership interest towards that. It's going to be up to Boardwalk and their decisions there. But I think as things stand we're so confident in the market demand right now on the asset that I would expect that they would carry through with their plans just because I think the returns are going to be very attractive relative to other options in the market. I would say from a volume commitment standpoint, remember that we have a number of opportunities that came to us through the Caiman acquisition in terms of the liquids there, at that facility, as well as we have the dedication that we receive from Chesapeake and we also have other parties that -- where we had the processing rights on various gas streams out there as well that give us pretty nice base, frankly, volumes to build off of and while we wouldn't be going forward on the project if we thought we could only get to that 200,000 barrels a day or so of production, I would just tell you that we're seeing very strong interest from some of the larger players out there that really recognize how much value this is going to mean to the acreage out there and perhaps even see it as a strategic advantage in terms of being able to acquire acreage in the area. So I would just tell you, the excitement has been pretty, pretty big on this from the customer base. These are very long term commitments that we're looking for and of course, those take some time to gain corporate approval on. But I would just tell you that I'm not sure we could be asking for any better response than we've received today from the shipper community.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And do you -- just a final on that in terms of the ownership. Is it something where you have an option to increase if you want, or is it again something where you both have to agree to change that ownership percent?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I'm going to have Jim Scheel who's been right in the thick of that answer the point.", "James E. Scheel", "Williams and Boardwalk negotiated an agreement where they have an option to be a 50% partner. However, if they choose not exercise that right, Williams has the option to go ahead with the pipeline unilaterally.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful, appreciate that. And then moving, Alan, you talked about the opportunities at the Florida market for Transco has on the expansion side, but also you mentioned about potential ownership of Sabal. Would that be something again at your option you could purchase? Would it be from Spectra or would it be from the next terra portion of it or any sort of color on that?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, sure. It would be from the project as a whole from the Sabal trail project as a whole is what our option would be on. And again, just to make it clear, we will be supplying basically the volumes in a phased approach on the front end of that project via Transco. So we're basically the supply source by expanding to a point that reduce the amount of construction -- the greenfield construction, required for Sabal trail. So we're kind of the front end of that. And Sabal trail is going to lease that capacity with a return that's consistent with our cost of service returns. So eliminates our construction and volume risk on that. And so we have that as investment, which we found very attractive. And in addition to that, when have an option down the road to invest in Sabal trails and of course, we really like that because it gives us a chance to see how the construction costs look like when they come out and the volumes will have a much better picture on what the volume commitments look like at that point.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Can you say a what percent you could potentially own of it?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. I would just say it's meaningful. But it is a minority position.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Final one for me. You mentioned as -- I was going to ask you about the reduction in Northeast G&P at Williams WPZ in terms of the segment profit and DD&A. I think you mentioned that was -- so this is just higher cost that's what brought that down the $55 million in 2014 and $30 million in 2015? I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding it.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "It's primarily just an allocation. We have things like our engineering construction costs, our technical support for operations, accounting, all those things that we allocate as a corporation out against our various operating areas and because we've got so much growth in the area and we're applying so many resources it, we studied our cost across those areas and applied those more appropriately to the real expenses. So it's not really a shift in our overall cost against the company. That's just a reallocation of overhead cost to that area.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So not a new cost or a higher cost, just taking it from where it was accounted or allocated before and putting it into this segment.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "That's exactly right.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "CapEx looks like it went up by $2.7 billion across 2013 to '15. Assuming some sort of increase over the $1 billion cost number that I think you originally gave us for the PDH facility, is the remaining mostly tied to Bluegrass or are there other large ticket items in there that were either included or taken out, of out of the 3-year guidance.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Christine, it's Don Chappel, it's mostly entirely Bluegrass. There's some other moves as you mentioned, but it's largely Bluegrass.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then would you be able to give us, I guess, some sort of idea on what the cost increase is looking like for the PDH facility, is it materially over or like 20%?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. I would just say, again, we kind of came at that with an initial estimate that was very rough and the return was so attractive on it that we decided to proceed because even at an overrun, that would have been -- or an increase in our estimate, that would have been much higher which still would make sense. And I would just say, that cost did not go outside of that range. It was higher than what we early had in our guidance. But more importantly I think, the point to be captured there is that as we look at the project, we realized one of the fundamental benefits and what I would call industrial logic that underpins the project is the fact that we have got the ability to transport propylene derivatives rather than propylene itself into markets that are much closer than transporting the propylene all the way to the Gulf Coast and then turn around and transporting the propylene derivatives back to the Midwest markets and to the -- particularly in the Northern Midwest markets. And so by getting the propylene derivative business built there, we're getting -- we are positioning ourselves to be able to capture some of that transport and logistics advantage. And so we want to build that complex in concert with those derivative plant and there may be some optimization opportunity between the propylene plant and the derivative plant. Now having said that, don't hear us say that we're going into the propylene derivative business because that's not at all what we're doing here. And in fact we're going to do this in a way that's going to reduce our commodity exposure to propylene. But it does allow us to optimize the construction of the facilities. And again, to enjoy some of the benefits of the logistics through the pricing structure.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I see. So net-net, would you say that your returns overall look better than when you originally looked at it? Or do they kind of just off -- does everything just offset each other?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I would say that our returns -- I would say our returns will be lower than what we originally thought. But I would also tell you that they're going to be a lot lower risk because you are converted to more fee-based business.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then in your presentation slide, when you talk about equity funding for Bluegrass, you say WPZ investment and then you wrote WMB and/or third parties. Can you just clarify, when you say third parties, do you mean that you're willing to sell a portion of your interest in the Bluegrass project or sell your interest in some of your other assets like we've seen you do with Constitution, I don't know, maybe with some of your assets in Canada, et cetera to raise the cash?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Christine, this is Don Chappel. I'd just say we have a lot of options. WPZ is our preferred funding source. So to the extent that we need equity, our preference would be for WPZ to fund that versus Williams. But there are a number of other sources we expect that other parties will have interest in equity in Bluegrass. We may not choose to give any of it up, but it's really -- what you see there on the slide is just an expression of we've got quite a few options. And in the near term to the balance of this year and into next year, at least, early next year, we'll be funding this with excess cash at Williams, and beyond that, we'll have some choices to make. But for the next couple of quarters, 2 or 3 quarters, it's really funding with excess cash flow at Williams.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then lastly, for me. In the Northeast, it looked like OBM volumes were slightly revised down in '14 and '15 while Susquehanna was raised. Can you verify that's the case and can you also provide a number for what volumes are today at OBM?", "Francis E. Billings", "Sure, this is Frank Billings. I would say that we did revise the volumes down a little bit. The majority of that is, as we actually have derisked a little bit it to the OBM volume forecast because we had a customer identified in our forecast and we've actually executed an agreement to have them become a true customer versus a forecasted customer. And with that, we've got a revised drilling program -- drilling schedule from them and we basically included that in our forecast, as well as one of our existing customers revised slightly their drilling program for '13 and '14. So that's the main driver for the volume adjustments, I would say, in OBM.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then can you provide a number for what volumes are today at Williams?", "Francis E. Billings", "Yes. Right now we're moving around $200 million today, kind of we're moving around $250 million to $260 million, but we do have some volumes that are not moving. We've hit a peak volume in excess of $300 million a day in OBM. And right now, what is happening is we have a couple of customers, one is drilling and frac-ing a new well, so they've shut in some production around that well frac so that they don't -- or for whatever reason, I guess they want to protect or manage that activity. And then we have another customer that is having some permitting issues on one of their well pad, so they had to shut in production as well. But I can tell you that we're also -- we have multiple producers out there that are in the process of completing some wells and I think -- we see the activity that we expected to see from the producers in OBM this summer as they're trying to get some work done before the fall and winter season hits. So I think we're on the right trajectory and I just think what we have is -- when we lose 30% of our volume or 10% of our volume, $30 million a day for producer activity, it shows up at this point. But I can tell you that in OBM today, we are operating well mechanically. All of our mechanical and operational issues are few at this time. And I think, we're in a good position to move the volume that's behind the system today. And when we complete the work for -- that we had talked about in the second -- the first quarter call around the CR -- or the facilities that we're going to get in place, I think we're going to be in great shape for the rest of the year.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "My first question is on Transco and some of the opportunities you're seeing around that asset. We've seen Leidy pricing and just pricing around the dry gas pricing area, the Marcellus come under a lot of pressure. Is that adding to kind of inbound producer demand and maybe even some inbound demand side or utility demand for capacity on projects to get out of the Northern PA and Northern New Jersey markets like Leidy Southeast and Constitution?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Bradley, this is Rory Miller. Good question. In fact, when we closed out our Leidy Southeast project, we had very robust demand. But we've had a number of producers that have called back saying if they could get in to see if it was not too late to open the door and get on the project. So I think we've got over 8 BCF a day of pipeline, interconnects and capacity connected to bring gas into Leidy. And as those new connections see additional wells drilled behind our system and behind those interconnects, people are finding they need to get a way out. So we think there's an excellent chance for additional expansion up there, somewhere down the road. But very much a supply push situation. We've talked a lot about the quality of the Cabot reserves, the quality of their wells up there. But we're seeing that sweet spot extend west of there as well. So even though it's a dry gas area, the EURs on those wells are so robust that the economics of the current gas prices are very compelling. So we see a big supply push coming out of that area and we're looking at number of opportunities to help satisfy that demand from producers. Likewise, we talked a lot at Analyst Day about all the power generation opportunities up and down the system. We continue to see those opportunities roll in the door. So there's a fantastic opportunity for us to match up demand pull with the supply push, and we think that's going to keep new projects coming for years into the future.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "But no plans today on the table to expand either the Leidy Southeast or the Constitution project?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Right now, we're probably focused on the Leidy opportunity and I would just say, we're early on in that, but something could be coming out here in the near future.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And on the Bluegrass project. As you look at the pipeline fractionation storage, integrated nature of that project, is the 2.7, give or take, that you discussed as being largely Bluegrass related in your CapEx budgeting, does that include an export facility? And do you think that you would need to enter into a JV or some kind of economic sharing agreement with someone who has an existing export facility or existing acreage on the Gulf Coast in order to get that done?", "James E. Scheel", "Bradley, this is Jim Scheel. We have not included in the guidance number the export facility. We're still defining that at this point. We have seen a great amount of interest from our customers for that, they do view the international markets as the logical destination for many of the propanes and butanes. We have identified the site and we're moving forward to acquire that. As it relates to the cost of that, we're still defining it. We'll include that in future guidance.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And just a follow-up on some of the PDH questions from earlier. The PDH, as well as the ethane recovery costs appear to have increased since the Analyst Day. Is that, in the case of the PDH something related to kind of overall labor and cost trends in Western Canada? Or are those 2 separate issues? And on PDH, Alan, you mentioned that you would kind of rule out entering the propylene derivative business. Is there any reason, specifically, that you ruled out providing your own polypropylene facility just to expedite that process?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, I'll take the last half of that and then I'll ask Fred Pace, who runs our engineering construction, to answer your question on the fundamentals in the construction cost in Alberta. On the derivatives side, I would just say that as you move further and further downstream, that starts to become more and more knowledge that is outside the base of our operations today. And I would just say, we have so many opportunities that are right down our fairway of knowledge that it doesn't really entice us to move outside of the area that we have strong knowledge in. And so we're excited to partner with others that have both the marketing expertise and the operations expertise that can help bring the value to that. So said another way, we're not really all that motivated to learn some new lessons when have such great opportunities in front of us right now. And so that's really driving that decision. And I'll ask Fred to answer the questions around the cost pressures in Alberta.", "Fred Pace", "Yes, on the PDH cost outlook kind of playing on Alan's earlier comment about our observance of other projects, having cost pressures, we've analyzed that. And did a much better job of also analyzing all of our other risks around availability of labor and contract personnel and materials, our entire supply chain around that. So that's just our best current thinking and guidance around our current risk analysis to come up with our current outlook.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And just one more and I'll get out of your hair. The Atlantic Gulf segment, you reduced kind of 2013 and 2014 guidance fairly significantly after the first quarter call. Now you've kind of printed 2 strong quarters in a row in the Atlantic Gulf segment, really the kind of Transco-related seasonality really wasn't visible on those results. And so you've kind of printed $300 million of segment profit in the first half of the year and you've kind of guided towards a full year segment profit in the low $500 million range. Is that -- is it correct to imply a decline in the second half of the year? Or is that just a segment that has, I guess, outperformed since the first quarter reporting?", "Rory Lee Miller", "This is Rory Miller again. I think the guidance that we included in the book showed us outperforming guidance, maybe $30 million on a full year basis. And I -- so I think we're going to be able to hold on to some of that, about 2/3 of that revision is attributable to lower O&M and G&A and we've been working hard I think as Alan mentioned earlier to control expenses. And I think a lot of that is -- will be sustainable improvements. We also had some other minor issues that are helping out. We did have an increase on our liquid transportation rates on Transco for condensate and retrograde. That combined with a little higher DD&A and then a reimbursement for some engineering cost from Gulfstream accounted for about 1/3 of that $30 million. So that's a lot of detail. But a number of those are sustainable type items. Of course, the engineering reimbursement would be a one-time event.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "A couple of quick questions. Does the business interruption insurance in the 2014, say, for the first quarter cover the delayed startup of the expansion on Geismar?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Craig, this is Don. I think answer is yes. Basically the policy covers our losses. So it's a comparison of what we would have made had the event not occurred to what we did or didn't make as a result of the loss. And obviously, we have a responsibility to minimize the loss and we would do that with or without insurance. So we're interested in getting the facility back up and running safely as quickly as possible, including the expansion. But the repairs are really the critical path item and the expansion will be complete along with the recovery and the turnaround. And we expect that to be covered.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. And Don, while I have you on the line, there was little uptick at least, for the quarter in the tax rate, but I don't think the full year has changed in terms of guidance. Can you give us some color around that?", "Donald R. Chappel", "I think the full year is down a little bit because of some additional bonus depreciation we were able to identify. And then just a function of continuing to refine the numbers, I think, the quarterly numbers are -- tend to move around a little bit, depending on the profitability and where that profitability is.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. And then finally, I wonder if you all could just give a little more color because I think there were some prepared comments regarding it and then also just recently some comments about attacking L&M and G&A that's helping the Atlantic Gulf segment. But could you all discuss in a little more detail the success you seem to be having with cost containment, especially in 2013 to offset some of the headwinds we're seeing?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well I would just say, we've all made a concerted effort on that front. As you know, we went through some very significant organizational restructure post the spin-off of WPX and I would just say that we are positioned and we reorganized ourselves in a way that we can really focus and bring some transparency to our cost structures and understand the areas of opportunity we have to put pressure on that and the team is doing a great job of doing that. So I would just say it's kind of the old-fashioned way. The good news I would tell you is I think it's very sustainable. And I think we have opportunities to continue to improve even more so as we kind of explore new opportunities in a much more integrated company. And so for instance, we're seeing areas of opportunity between gas pipes and midstream where previously, we operated as separate -- completely separate business units and now, we're seeing opportunities to save money because we're operating in a much more integrated fashion than we have previously. So more to come on that, but the team is doing a terrific job and very proud of the focus they've put on that.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Three, perhaps, cleanup questions. The first actually on -- just with respect to the insurance of Geismar. Obviously, you laid out the expectations and I guess with potentially only a 60-day lag that kind of implies a pretty smooth process. Has there been any contention or friction from the insurers at this point that would give you pause at all or is this -- do you expect to be a pretty smooth process?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Carl, its too early to tell. We've not yet filed our first claim. But this is something where we'll be able to: one, we can present our forecast. The forecast we had before the incident and that was prepared without any knowledge of the incident coming, so I think that's pure. There's no bias in that forecast. We can present that to the insurers now. We would have our first insurer loss in the month of August. That would have been after the 60-day waiting period, but before the planned turnaround. So there's a small period that's insured. Just a couple of weeks of operation between that 60-day waiting period and when the turnaround would have happened. So we'll be able to submit that at the end of August, early September, and get response from the insurers on that payment, and that really set the stage for the balance and then we'd be in 50-day turnaround and so then in October, we would have a partial month again where we would have another partial month claim. We'd submit that claim at the end of October and then we'd submit a claim update every month. So we think that the 60-day lag is reasonable. It's possible we could get paid earlier or somewhat later. But right now, that's our best estimate.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Appreciate the color on that. The second and not to, perhaps, beat a dead horse on the PDH facility. But just given all the cost inflation that we have seen in Alberta and seem happening in such a quick period of time. When you look out with the major spend on when the PDH would actually happen. Is there any possibility of locking something up turnkey with someone in order to stem any possible future labor inflation?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, again, I think by stretching our schedule out, we give ourselves a lot more opportunity around that. And as you'll recall and I think we mentioned this in our announcement -- original announcement with PDH facility that we were going with a little bit different design than some on the industry had because -- and a little bit smaller, so that we can build that business on a more modular basis. And so that allows us to bid out that modular construction on a fixed fee. And so the remaining portion would be the in the field construction. The good news about this project aside from some of the other projects we've seen a lot of cost pressures is this work is at Redwater, which is near Edmonton. A lot of the areas we really had a lot of struggle with in terms of low productivity and cost pressures has been in the Fort McMurray area where labor is more constrained, particularly skilled labor is more constrained. So I would just say, we're taking -- we're working hard to contract this in a way that really eliminates a lot of that build construction labor risk and productivity risk and stretching the schedule out gives us even more opportunity to do that.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Fair enough. And then last question if I could. Just on Bluegrass and if you could just refresh -- I think, you probably addressed this in prior conversations. But as you look out at sort of this large material investment, are you expecting from -- the feedback you've heard from shippers, are you expecting a return profile in line with other sort of large, almost, call it, FERC allowed type of traditional infrastructure returns? Or is it the uniqueness of the NGL solution would allow something higher more indicative of Midstream infrastructure?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I would say a couple of things allow us with a -- and remember, only a portion of this is regulated. The frac and storage business downstream of that is not regulated, so we have that opportunity, if you will, in terms of better than FERC return and I would just tell you, we have plenty of regulated cost of service returns available to us. And so we wouldn't take any additional risk or development cost like this if we didn't expect higher returns than that. So the answer to your question is, we do expect higher overall returns on the project. And one of the things that helps us achieve that obviously, is the benefit of the Texas Gas line and which provides us with a better solution than the market would otherwise had to offer. And gets us in schedule. Importantly, I can tell you from the shipper's perspective, this timing issue probably can't overstate that in terms of importance because people have all this acreage up there. They're very anxious to go drill, but they're seeing NGL prices continue to collapse up there in a very oversupplied market. Their only option is to transport out by rail and that -- even that is getting pretty congested. So I would just say that the market is very anxious for this solution and the return we're making is -- reaps the benefits of some of the things I mentioned.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just wondering if you could maybe talk about the risk to achieving that April resumption date for you Geismar? Is it really just mainly, I guess, the pace of the repairs? Or does the status of the investigation play a part at all?", "John R. Dearborn", "A very insightful question. This is a John Dearborn, on the answer to that, if you take a look at it, we've got a few investigations underway, 1 by OSHA, 1 by CSB, and of course, the Williams' own investigation. We're collaborating there in a very open and transparent way with OSHA and CSB. And as a result of that, over time, over the last few weeks, OSHA and CSB have been, I'll say, giving back more and more of that plant so that the effective plant now that's still under the control of OSHA is a very small area around the fractionator itself. And so that's allowing us now to begin to, I won't say demolish, but begin to take apart the impacted part of the plant. So pretty quickly here, we think that the investigation is going to become a less of a risk to our path of rebuild. Then the question becomes, how quickly can we get the equipment and the necessary materials to plant and construct it and that in fact sets our timeline. Though it's not without risk, we feel pretty confident about the April 1 date, that's why we've been out with it.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just another follow-up. In terms of the business interruption insurance, does that, like, cover, I guess, any obligations or contracts with your supply or sales?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I'll let John take the question on the sales contracts. I don't think we expect to have any significant losses in that area. But yes, it would cover.", "John R. Dearborn", "Yes, and again, very insightful because of course, our customers are a very important stakeholder base for us right -- but we're going out to continue to build our relationships with our customers. All of our customers essentially are on force majeure at the moment and will be over time. We want to continue to preserve those relationships, so that they'll be there when the plant comes back up. So all these information is actually fresh for our customers in the coming weeks. We're going to be going out and speaking personally with our important customers out there so that they are with us on the other end of the startup.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And this also applies for any supply sources in terms of ethane?", "John R. Dearborn", "We really don't have a concern about the ethane. Essentially, the ethane goes back into the market and probably get used and consumed by others so it's not really an issue for us in our business.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just want to understand the -- kind of picking up off of Sharon's question, sort of the range of outcomes if we're plus or minus the April 1 date on financials relative to kind of where you are with the insurance and the deductible let's say we push another quarter out, what does that do in terms of -- kind of the financial impact?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Ted, I think as John mentioned, we have a plan to get us started back up in April. If we push that back at some point, we would run out of potentially, or hypothetically, we'd run out of insurance -- business interruption insurance and the coverages combined $500 million for both business interruption and property damage. We have a current estimate on the property damage of $102 million, less a $10 million deductible. So that's $92 million of assumed coverage at this point. And then as you saw, we disclosed an estimate of $384 million on the business interruption coverage. So certainly, significant delays would expose us.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But at that point then, it's just a matter of sort of the loss -- what's called the loss margin of the downtime from that perspective? And obviously, assuming the repair costs were the same. Is that fair?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Yes. Again, we have no reason to believe that the downtime will extend past April at this point, but certainly as you think about risk, I think you understand it well.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. Okay. And then just in terms of the distribution growth here at WPZ. It looks like you're still comfortable running a little below 1x in 2014. You've kept the idea wherever is the same. But again, there's some flex here in terms of what happens with Geismar. I was just wondering how we should think about what you'll target for coverage if the IDR waivers get increased from WMB or do we lower distribution growth, say, at WPZ, kind of how those all interplay?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Those are, I would say, speculative questions at this point. But clearly, WPZ -- Williams enjoys about 75% of WPZ's distribution, so we have a big stake in it. WPZ is our primary equity funding vehicle and funding vehicle generally. So obviously it's very important to Williams. We did waive the $200 million of IDRs. We did not see any point to step forward further on that at this point. But certainly, we'll consider potential waivers, additional waivers if and when needed. So I would just say, we'll stay tuned here. If we execute as we had put forth in our plan here today, we don't believe any additional waivers are required. We look at 2014 at getting closer to 1x coverage again with a lot of fee-based growth. And by 2015, getting back to that 1x coverage number. So we're comfortable running where we are. And at Williams we'll continue to monitor the situation and see if WPZ needs any additional support and make the decision accordingly.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.", "Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "My question is with regards to the Western segment, seems like in the west, results were better than we anticipated and going nicely in the first half of the year. I was just curious as far as in 2014, you have a bit of a stepdown there as far as what you're looking for segment profit in DD&A, it was only marginally increased. I'm just wondering, is that a bit of conservatism or what's kind of driving the year-over-year step down in guidance there?", "Allison G. Bridges", "Well, partly because we do have some contracts that had changed in 2014. So that is some of the reduction.", "Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then last one for me. I was just curious, with this guidance revision, I think some of the other recent ones, it seems like maintenance CapEx has been ticking down a little bit for 2014, 2015. I was just wondering if you could touch on the drivers for that?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. One of the things is we had some, as we mentioned earlier, we have some time pressures on getting some of our asset integrity work done towards the end of 2012. We completed a lot of that work as we've laid out in the past so we kind of add an accelerated effort there to complete some of that work. And as well, we're continuing to take advantage where we can of the integrated nature of our business and looking to really invest that maintenance capital in the ways that reduce risk very best for this company overall. And so I would just say, we're continuing to really analyze that. Obviously, the thing we're going to spend our dollars on first is keeping the system safe and reliable and we certainly won't back off on the cost that it takes to do that and we'll continue to do that. But there are other areas that we can find ways to improve cost, purchasing power across a lot of our assets, which we -- when we combine our gas pipes and our midstream efforts, we got a lot of purchasing power. And so we're continuing to find ways to improve on that.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Christine Cho with Barclays.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just some follow-ups. On the PDH facility, if it's going to be in service in 2017 is most of the CapEx going to take place in 2016 with maybe a little bit in '15? I just wanted to know how we should think about the timing of the spending.", "Fred Pace", "This is Fred Pace responding. That's exactly right, wrapping up in '15, but the majority occurring in '16.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then this is just an accounting question. But are you going to be consolidating your 50% interest in GulfStar and your 41% interest in Constitution? I wasn't clear if you guys -- how you guys are accounting for it in your segment profit guidance?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "John is going to take this one.", "John Porter", "This is John Porter. Yes, those 2 assets are shown on a consolidated basis with a non-controlling interest presented below segment profit.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional closing remarks.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Okay, great. Well, thank you, all, very much. This is Alan Armstrong again, thank you all for joining us and we remain very excited about the future that we have ahead of us. And our showing of starting to really turn the corner on the fee-based projects really starting to kick in so thanks for joining us.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "John Porter", "Thank you, Divona. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.", "In addition to Alan, we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas present with us. Frank Billings leads our Northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area; Rory Miller leads our Atlantic Gulf area; and John Dearborn is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to any questions.", "In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, John. Starting here on Slide 4. I love this cover that our IR team came up with beginning. It really depicts all the tremendous amount of activity and construction and project development that we have going on right now at the company and are currently managing. And certainly, this is what is -- will support the tremendous cash flow growth that supports our 20% dividend growth at WMB. It also -- I think it's important to note, this heavy CapEx burden also weighs heavy on our coverage during this supercycle of investment opportunities that we're thrilled to be a part of right now.", "But before I get into the slide, let me just very quickly remind you of our strategy that continues to guide all of our actions and certainly our investment decisions. And so our strategy, which is to be the premier provider of large-scale infrastructure to design, to maximize the opportunities created by the vastly greater supply of natural gas and natural gas products now known to exist in North America's unconventional resource plays.", "This is underpinned by our scale, which we see as a competitive advantage in all the areas that we operate. So wherever we are, you'll see us be big. And if we can't be the #1 or #2 in an area, you won't see us playing in a space like that because we think to have superior returns, you've got to have the advantages of scale that allow you to connect to your customers to the best markets.", "So we want our supply connected to the best markets, and we want our markets connected to the best supplies. And we want to be the infrastructure in between that continues to fuel this tremendous opportunity here that we have here in the U.S. to take advantage of low price natural gas, natural gas liquids and the olefins, derivatives off of that.", "So moving on to Slide 5 here. I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on this because it really is just a overview of this presentation. But here is what we'll cover here this morning. First of all, I'll talk a little bit about our better-than-expected third quarter performance and the drivers for that beat and also show some detail on how we're accounting for the impact of our Geismar outage.", "Next, I'll also reaffirm our 20% dividend growth profile at WMB while lowering our distribution growth rate to the bottom of our earlier stated range for '14 and '15. So we're at the top end of the range here in '13, and we'll be moving to the bottom of that range, that 6% to 8% range for '14 and '15. And of course, that is designed to drive better coverage metrics at WPZ and along with something we're excited to announce and something we've been working on for a while, which is to provide you some detail on our Canadian asset dropdown. And that would be the existing assets that we plan to drop down in January of '14.", "Next, we'll review some drivers of our tremendous 60% DCF growth at WPZ throughout this guidance period. And then finally, we'll review our project execution scorecard that is so critical to our success, and we continue to show you. And so it's critical, not only for this guidance period but even beyond our guidance period as we continue to develop more and more fuel for our growth beyond 2015.", "So moving on to Slide 6 here. This is an overview of the third quarter, and it certainly was a good quarter and better than we expected on many metrics for the quarter. And so the thing I can tell you I am most excited about is where strategy is working. And finally, in this quarter, we saw our growth in our fee-based revenues begin to overcome the continual slide in the NGL margins. And so you can see there a $61 million increase in the fee revenues, and that's a 3Q of '13 compared to 3Q of '12. And so really thrilled to see that.", "In addition to that, despite the tremendous amount of development and effort we've got going into growing our business, we are also able to control cost and continue to lower cost on that same comparison of 3Q '13 to 3Q '12. So at WPZ, our DCF was up 20% as compared to 3Q of '12. And this was driven by that $61 million increase in the fee-based revenues at PZ. Primarily, this was driven by the tremendous growth in the Northeast and on Transco.", "And also, just to put that in perspective for you, that means a 9% increase in our fee-based revenues more than offset a 30% decline in our NGL margins during that period.", "Also, something I'm very excited about is the $19 million reduction in our O&M and G&A, again, in the face of tremendous growth across our system. Additionally, our WPZ maintenance CapEx was down $50 million as compared to '12, and we still are spending over $310 million this year in these maintenance capital expenditures. And we certainly -- and compared to '12, one of the drivers for that in '12, we had a lot of spending in our -- the asset integrity and the Clean Air Act issues related to our gas pipelines. And so we got a lot of that out of the way in '12.", "And in addition to that, our maintenance capital on our Midstream assets was actually down more significantly. And this was driven by lower well connect cost out West, and as well as we've been making some smart consolidations out West and retired some of our older higher-cost assets, like our Lybrook complex in the Four Corners area. And that allows us to obviously to then do not have to spend the money to maintain those assets over time.", "We continue to invest as required to maintain these safe and reliable assets. And in fact, we will invest over 35% of our segment profit from our pipes back into the proper maintenance of our 2 major gas pipelines, Transco and Northwest Pipeline. So the negative for the quarter certainly was the lack of contribution from our Geismar facility, and it only contributed $15 million to the DCF for the quarter. And this represents about a 13-day period between the 60-day waiting period on the BI and the planned 50-day turnaround.", "And we'll show here on the next slide and show some really good detail on how that works out. It's certainly fairly complex the way we're accounting for that Geismar impact. But I think it's really important to note here that even with the Geismar with this 20% growth in DCF, we only got $15 million of that 20% improvement out of Geismar for the quarter. So really truly a strong DCF for WPZ during the quarter.", "And we'll show here on Slide 7 -- now moving to Slide 7. You can see what we show as the impact from Geismar. And so I'll focus your attention here to the $79 million in the bottom of the second column, and what that represents is the negative impact or the delta that we estimate we would have seen we did see in the quarter versus what we would have seen if Geismar would have been up and running on a normal basis in the pre-expansion mode.", "So to keep this simple on this chart, you can think about this business as about a $1 million per day of impact to our DCF and in the pre-expansion mode. And so you can see there that if you -- the 60-day waiting period accounts to a total of $60 million of impact in 2013. And you can see the 50-day turnaround amounts to $50 million of impact, looking over there to the right column. So really only about 13 days of profit in the third quarter associated with the business interruption claim that we submitted for the third quarter. And this combined with the receipt of an actual insurance payment of $50 million related to the incident during the third quarter allowed us to record this $15 million of DCF in the third quarter.", "So we also show on this slide how that has been handled in our accounting for both GAAP and adjusted numbers, and we provide some additional detail in the appendix. So anyway, fairly complex, but bottom line here is we think this hurt us. Having Geismar down for the third quarter hurt us by about a total of $94 million, offset by the $15 million of DCF that we recorded in the quarter.", "Moving on to Slide 8 then. This is the -- a little more detail on our Canadian asset dropdown, and so we certainly are excited to be announcing this. This really comes at the start-up now of our last big expansion, our ethane, ethylene recovery facilities that are now in operation at Fort McMurray. And so we've got pretty big window here now between the next big tranche of assets that'll come on, which will be the Canadian -- sorry, the CNRL Horizon facilities and the PDH facilities. So this is a nice window for us to drop down these assets that are now up and cash flowing the existing assets that are up and cash flowing.", "So a little bit about this business. Certainly, as we've explained before, we've got great competitive advantage in this business. And because we really are the only parties up here that are taking the off-gas and extracting these highly valuable products out of the off-gas, and we've got the right assets, the right experience and the right operating team to be able to continue that. And so we're excited about our -- that continued competitive advantage leading further growth for opportunities like Syncrude in the future.", "We also are expecting about $200 million of DCF from these assets in 2014 and 2015. And one thing I think is really unique about these assets is they were quieter [ph]. Though they're a typical processing plant and fractionation, they have such a tremendous resource upstream off them that is invested by the upgraders that we really have very little capital required to keep these assets, keep the free cash flow coming out of these assets partly due to the fact we don't have any well connect cost, we don't have to go secure new supplies for these assets and partly because these assets are relatively new as we've been expanding these assets over the last 10 to 15 years.", "So very excited about being able to do this, and we will be funding this through WMB taking back 100% paid-in-kind units on -- so on a transaction, this will add DCF coverage for both '14 and '15. And as the many projects come online, this will continue to support our industry-leading dividend growth beyond 2015 when the PIK units convert.", "So said another way, that certainly, the PIK units give us some room on our coverage here. So we think this is a really smart transaction for WMB and Bridges to win this tremendous amount of capital investment that we're making over this period. About $8 billion really starts to kick in, in '15 and beyond.", "So the planned dropdown of these currently in-service assets is subject to the successful negotiation of the transaction between Williams and Williams Partners. And because of that, we're not going to be pinning down a price, a transaction price at this time. But I will provide you a little more insight into what we're expecting here. We certainly recognize that a portion of these assets have commodity risk. And as a result of that, the multiple need to be lower than what you might normally expect. And so just to decode that a little bit at this point, we expect that multiple to be below a 7 multiple for this transaction, and so not too different than the kind of multiples, all-in multiples that we saw with the ethylene cracker. Even though I'll remind you that these assets, for instance, the ethane and ethylene business are backed by some fixed rates in terms of capital recovery for the ethane and ethylene projects.", "Another really important point I would make on this slide is that our projects like the CNRL Horizon project, which is underway and we are certainly up and spending capital dollars on that, and as well as our PDH project and potentially, the Syncrude processing expansion are staying at WMB, and will be great future dropdown candidates for WPZ. And in fact, just to kind of put that all in perspective for you, WMB continues to build out a tremendous backlog of future dropdown candidates in both Canada and the Gulf Coast PetChem area that we've talked about in the past.", "And so just the projects that are approved and underway. We've got more than $2 billion of additional dropdown candidates for WMB, that would be dropped down to WPZ. And in addition to that, we also have the exciting Bluegrass and Moss Lake JV with Boardwalk. So we are building out a tremendous amount of dropdown opportunity, and that doesn't even include things that we're continuing to develop like the Syncrude opportunity in Canada as well. So plenty of continued growth for WPZ as WMB continues to develop some major projects.", "Moving on to Slide 9. You can see here the very impressive story of DCF growth from 2012 really as we increase $231 million from '12 up to $1.72 billion in '13, then in '14 going up $630 million to $2.35 billion and then up another $435 million in '15 versus up to $2.78 billion. So some very impressive growth going on in the space.", "And I would just say a couple of key points here. First of all, the coverage ratio that you see here does assume the distribution increase of the 9% this year and 6% in '14 and '15. So the coverage is over and above that distribution growth. And importantly, in '14 and '15, we are assuming no additional IDR waivers from WMB. So really working here to get WMB -- or sorry, WPZ to a position of the coverage ratio that we're comfortable with. And certainly, the Canadian dropdown and the reduction in the growth rate are the key tools that we've employed here to accomplish that. The drivers throughout this entire period, as you can see, are the tremendous amount of portfolio projects and the one dropdown that we have built into WPZ right now.", "I'm also going to make a few notes here on just there's been some confusion, I think, on the IDR waiver for 2013. And just to be a little clear on that, we are only planning on using $140 million of the $200 million that we have previously announced at the cap. And so what we did say was that we would contribute up to $200 million of waivers from WMB to WPZ as required to maintain a 0.9 coverage ratio. The good news is because of our better-than-expected performance at WPZ here in the -- about the third quarter and throughout the balance of the year that we do not think that we will need to contribute any more than another $50 million on top of the $90 million that is being put forth today. So anyway, good news on that from both the PZ side and the MB side.", "Another comment I'll make here quickly is on the capital side. And you'll see in the CapEx changes as you review them you'll see we've added about $375 million or about 4.6% increase over the $8 billion of spending during this period. And there's really 2 primary drivers for that. First of all, a $200 million increase in our Gulfstar 1 project. And let me remind you that Williams Partners has a 51% share of that project, so that'd be $102 million net to our interest. And so this brings the real net increase in capital spending to about 3.5% over this $8 billion.", "And in addition to that, though, to really describe what's causing that, we have 2 new Transco projects that have been added to guidance during this period as well. And so Transco just continues to see tremendous opportunity on the market and in particular, of expanding as people continue to build a demand for the very low-priced natural gas and the tremendous growth opportunities that the Eastern Seaboard represents for Transco.", "And so let me move on now to Slide 10. And this is our scorecard that we continue to show you. And just a few things to highlight here in terms of changes to this. First of all, you'll see that the third quarter projects, which was the Canadian ethane recovery and Transco's Northeast supply link are now online. And so we're excited about that. The investment in ACMP, I will tell you, is not listed here, so we have a lot of capital here. But in addition, we have growth coming from the ACMP investments.", "And also remind you that with the exception of the Geismar expansion project and the Canadian projects, the PDH and the CNRL upgrader, these remaining projects are all backed up by fee-based revenues. And so that is what's continuing to drive that increase in fee-based revenue. I think what's really impressive here as we continue to add -- in fact, we've added one project here, the Hillabee Expansion, to this Transco portion. But we also have a smaller project. It's not listed on here. But we continue to really build out the Transco expansion projects, and we think those are great projects for both WPZ and then ultimately flowing to WMB's cash.", "So that's the picture here. We've already talked about the Gulfstar increase, and I think that's the majority of the issues you'll see in the Northeast. Our spending is actually pretty flat, a little bit of movement between the various asset areas but generally pretty flat.", "Moving on to Slide 11. And this is the picture of the Northeast. Certainly, we're making a major reduction in the rate of growth for OBM. And -- but I certainly want to keep this in perspective here. We have now grown these volumes in year-to-date '13 versus year-to-date '12 by over 80%. So despite a lower projected growth rate at OBM, our growth here is tremendous. It continues to be tremendous, and we couldn't be more excited to be in what we think is the growth area in the U.S. for -- from both the Marcellus and the Utica.", "And so this growth, as you know, does not depict our exposure -- economic exposure that we have to both ACMP and the Blue Racer. And it also doesn't include any growth from Three Rivers. Yet we're still showing a 73% growth in this period from '13 through '15.", "So we've lowered, as you can see there, pretty significantly OBM, but the primary drivers for that being a lot of the private equity groups that were invested out here have now sold out to parties like Chevron and Statoil. And I would just say that they are more patient investors. And I think they're waiting to make sure that the infrastructure is available to get both their gas and their NGLs to market. And so we think they obviously make great customers for Bluegrass, and -- but they're going to look at these resources and make sure that they can get their products to market and to good markets before they go into more aggressive drilling programs out here.", "And so that's really one of the major changes here as we shifted from more aggressive independents owning some of these resources to more patient investors like Chevron and Statoil.", "Moving on to Slide 12. This is just a big list of all the various accomplishments and the things that continue to go on here. Certainly, the Bluegrass open season and the continued growth on Transco were kind of a big highlights that I would point out to you here. The Atlantic Sunrise open season was overwhelming, I guess, is the best term we have to describe it. And really very, very excited about the kind of response and how quickly we're going to be able to bring that to closure given the very strong response there. And so it's nice to be in a position of having to figure out how you're going to size a project and fit in all of the demand that we saw from that. So that's a very exciting development during the period.", "Additionally, we hit a new record high in the Northeast of 2 Bcf per day on a monthly average during the third quarter. And as well, ACMP announced earlier, as I'm sure you all saw, that they were raising their LP distribution up 23% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of '12. And that is big news for us because that really accelerates the Williams GP, first into the high splits a lot quicker than we were planning on.", "So that investment opportunity is proving out very well for us, and we continue to be very excited about our relationship with ACMP's management team and our ability to continue to support their tremendous growth opportunities that they have in and around their business. So couldn't be happier with the way that asset or that investment is performing and certainly thrilled to see the high quality of the ACMP management team that continues to perform very well.", "Moving on here to the closing slide. Just to remind you that we are all in relative to this natural gas infrastructure supercycle. We think it's the right place to be. We like a commodity that we think is so low compared to crude oil and other commodities that it is going to continue to drive demand, and ultimately, that demand is going to drive continued supply growth. So we really are bullish on our situation where we sit, and you're going to continue to see us invest heavily into this space while this opportunity to build out this major infrastructure that will be here for many decades to come gets built. And we don't intend to back off of our heavy investment cycle while the opportunity presents itself.", "We also continue to be excited about our 20% WMB cash dividend growth through '15. And I think if you really stop and look at how all of these big projects are coming on in '15 and the continued growth cycle that we see beyond that, I think you'll see that we've got good reason to continue to support a very strong dividend growth beyond 2015. And again, would just remind you that we've got over $1.1 billion of DCF growth in '13 through '15. And this is not based on acquisitions that we might speculate on. It's not based on projects that we're speculating we might win. And these are projects that we are out and developing and building right now and all identified and contacted. So very excited about where we stand today. Excited about some of the changes we made here for the third quarter and look forward to hearing your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Christine Cho with Barclays.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "In last quarter's data book, you guided towards $110 million to $200 million of segment profit plus DD&A for the WMB NGL and Petchem Services in 2014. Can you help us reconcile between that number and the $200 million DCF number you gave for the dropdown? Is most of that driven by the higher propylene prices you are now using in commodity assumption?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Don Chapelle. Yes, it's largely an improvement in margins in Canada as well as lower expected corporate allocated costs. And that's just based on formulas that we continue to implement. So our new organization structure that we announced at the beginning of the year is, I think, bearing some fruit. And our costs are somewhat less than perhaps what we expected before in the Canadian business. It's getting a bit less of that. So I think those are the -- or the NGL Petchem Services business, excuse me in making a more broad statement, is getting a bit less of that. So those are the primary drivers.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then how should we think about the potential timing for the additional dropdown that Canada, the 2 other off-gas processing contracts, the 1 -- maybe 2 PDH facilities, maybe Bluegrass. Would you be open to drop it as soon as it's cash flow generating, which may not be a lot in the beginning? Or would you wait until it's a little more mature?", "Donald R. Chappel", "I think it's too soon to answer that question. I think certainly, be eligible to drop at any time quite frankly. But we think that the right answer is to build it at Williams and then drop it once it's in service. And I think we have to take a look at the cash flow profile and determine if it's right on start-up or if it's some time after start-up as the cash flows ramp up. So I think that's a question that's a ways out. It's couple of years out at the earliest, and we'll continue to study that.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then what are the tax implications for dropping the Canadian assets? Are you guys subject to any repatriation tax?", "Donald R. Chappel", "We expect -- and I think you'll see it on our 10-Q, to record a tax provision of just over $200 million, cash taxes of about $140 million in the near term. And so it's really an acceleration. We expected that at some point that we'd have repatriation and we'd have a tax to pay. This will accelerate those cash taxes to the tune of $140 million. We'll be able to use excess cash balances, cash balances we have on hand to pay the $140 million. And then after that, we'll have the Canadian tax. Right now the Canadian tax rate is very low, perhaps 0 because much like in the U.S., we have high capital spend and accelerated depreciation that's shielding taxes. But at some point, we'll pay Canadian taxes, and we'll get a U.S. tax credit for the taxes paid in Canada, and we'll pay the differential of U.S. tax. So fairly -- so the onetime cash tax cost is about $140 million, and then beyond that, it will be some incremental amount of U.S. tax over and above what we would typically pay in Canada. Canadian statutory rate is 25%. So again, it's factored, but it's not huge relative to the value of the assets.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, very helpful. How comfortable are you with the new numbers at OBM? Are we largely derisked here? And also the other segment costs in the Northeast segment seem to be really high. Is there anything onetime here in nature? Or is this kind of more of a run rate we should be going off of?", "Francis E. Billings", "Sure, this is Frank. I think on the -- relative to the Northeast in the volume, I would say that we have probably derisked that some. And really, what I would say is the primary factors. I would call 2013 kind of the lost year. I mean, we really didn't get much volume growth. And basically, what we've -- we're anticipating and what our producers are projected is kind of push, kind of what we were expecting in '13 and kind of roll in most of the drilling plans forward. On the cost side, if you look quarter-to-quarter, we did have -- looks like a pretty significant increase in quarter-to-quarter, other segment costs and expenses around $22 million. But in that number is -- some of that 9 -- the $9 million adjustment that's down below, and we had the continued liability that we booked. We also had some slip repairs that hit us in the third quarter as well as some writeoffs of some investments that we started to undertake in OBM but then did follow through with those. Or we much changed the project scopes, though we had some costs that we had to -- that we're capitalizing, we've had to take to expense. So I think going forward, we'll have a run rate that's less than what we saw in the third quarter. In OBM, we have a liquids system, a gas system, processing plant and fractionation. And we've really kind of set up our organization to have some of those assets in place in 2013. Those assets aren't place in 2013. We won't be looking at material or much staffing increases as we get into '14. So really, we're going to kind of hold and redistribute our [indiscernible] once our assets [indiscernible] and we'll have better defined after the construction and commissioning is completed. So we did have some items in Q3 that drove that number up, but our run rate should be less than that.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then last question for me. The spread between Texas and Louisiana ethylene prices have obviously been a focus given the pipeline between the 2 states that's down. How are your insurance proceeds going to account for this? I think it was initially thought that the pipeline will be down through year end, but now I'm hearing that it's going to be pushed out further than that.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Christine, this is Don. The insurance policies provide coverage in terms of the lost value in production. So we'll calculate the -- we know what the lost production is. We'll take a look at the market prices, and that would be the basis for our claim. With respect to the pipeline, that's something we're continuing to study to determine what effects it may or may not have. So I'll just pause there and perhaps -- I don't know if Alan or John want to add anything regarding pricing on the pipeline.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Well, just because I asked because are you going to be getting Mont Bellevue pricing or Louisiana pricing? I mean, there's like a $0.20 spread between the 2 points, last time I checked.", "John R. Dearborn", "Yes, and perhaps I could make some comments there. This is John Dearborn. If we look at the dynamics in the market there, right, with our plant down and Chevron's Evangeline pipeline out of service, the Texas market has got length, and Louisiana is short, right? So that's what we always see, and that's what's driving the premium between the 2 markets. As we look forward and we bring Geismar back up and we expect that some time, Evangeline will be back in service, that same market dynamic is going to diminish in its significance. But let's remember also that second quarter next year, we move into the industry's ethylene cracker turnaround season, and I believe there are about 4 crackers that go into turnaround then. And so as we take a look at all that, in total, we're looking forward at strong demand [indiscernible], which I think is going to support very strong ethylene margins into next year and through next year if we could take you into that line of reasoning, Christine.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Again, this is Don. And I just remind everyone that this pipeline outage is a short-term issue. And we don't expect that to extend all that long.", "John R. Dearborn", "And recall also that's a Chevron asset. So I think for -- the true story that you'll have to look to Chevron for that as well.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Just maybe a high-level question on the Northeast infrastructure issues. I think you guys are probably in one of the better -- or have one of the better vantage points on the pipe side. So what are you seeing in the Northeast, what alleviates the differentials, and what's your view of the differentials going forward?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Holly, I'll take that. This is Alan. First of all, I think there's been a lot of focus on just the Northeast dry area. And certainly, there is more infrastructure over in the Southwest and over in the Utica area, but we're certainly seeing continued a lot of development over there as well. And I would say a lot of pressure has come on -- came on here in the third quarter from 2 factors, one being that certain pipes were not yet opened. So Tennessee expansion wasn't online yet, and so that, we think, will help alleviate. But as well, a lot of new gas came on in the quarter that wasn't necessarily from drilling, but it was from infrastructure tie-ins, not necessarily on our systems. But some of the adjacent systems really worked off a lot of the well connects and a lot of the pending completions. So we saw a tremendous amount of gas come on -- trying to come on in the third quarter, and it was coming into the face of the market that was lower. And so the Northeast Supply Link Project is now up and running, and so -- on Transco, so that's 250. I can tell you that's hardly a drop in the bucket compared to the kind of demand that we're seeing for the infrastructure being built out of the area. But I do believe that the fall shoulders out there are going to be a little worse than the spring shoulders because this is kind of a rare situation up here where you have the Leidy Storage, which is a very large market area storage that refills in the spring but, of course, was full in the fall. And so nowhere for that gas to go either into those local markets or to the South. I think pipelines like Transco are -- now make or got plenty of support for new infrastructure to debottleneck systems to be able to carry markets to the South. And certainly, the Atlantic Sunrise open season was indicative of that. And as well, of course, the Constitution project, we think, will alleviate some of the challenges up in the Northeast area. But I will just say this. People that are not paying attention to that and not planning for their capital expansion are taking some pretty big bets, I would say, and some pretty big risk. And those that are continuing to plan and plan well, I think, will be the winners at the end of the day and will be able to access growing markets on systems like Transco to the South. And so I think we're getting after it, and as usual, the market -- we tend to wait a little too late to get the infrastructure built. And we'll probably be having the same discussion on Bluegrass here in '15 before that capacity comes on to get the NGLs out of there as well. But I certainly think the market has gotten a strong signal from the gas-on-gas competition it saw this quarter, and it seems to be responding to support continued infrastructure development out of the area.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then I guess you gave an explanation for the, I guess, weakness in the Northeast volumes compared to maybe what you'd initially forecasted. Are -- in terms of these new customers or now the majors, are -- what are you assuming for growth in '14 and '15? I guess my point, are you comfortable that your new targets have some of their plans factored in?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "It is. It's really kind of built from the ground up, looking at the drilling plans that we've discussed with the producers. And so we feel pretty comfortable. I would certainly -- wouldn't try to tell anybody it's not without risk because there's a lot of continued infrastructure development to be built out there. But I would tell you that we feel pretty comfortable with the schedule and the detail that we built behind the volumes at this point. And so it really is kind of a grounds-up review from each of our producers and their drilling plans out there. I do think there -- perhaps there's some opportunity to improve on that. If we saw some better pricing signals and people become convinced the Bluegrass is going to be -- get built, we might see some even better development into the '15 timeframe as people gear up for that.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then you kind of led me into my final question. Can you just maybe explain the open season for Bluegrass and how these commitments will really work on the Bluegrass pipeline and the LPG terminal?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I would just say that the open season for the pipeline is completely separate from the fractionation and the export terminal discussions. Having said that, we recognize that customers don't want a pipeline to nowhere. And so that's why we've been working so hard at developing both the storage, the terminal and the export facilities is that we've got to be able to provide customers with a comprehensive solution. And I would -- the thing I'm fairly encouraged by in that regard is with the discussions we're having on the export side, we're seeing interest in customers wanting to know where that supply is going to come from as well. And so I think the market's really starting to come together in terms of the supply side and the demand side. And we see that as one of our critical roles in the industry right now is bringing together that strong demand that we're seeing from international players back upstream to our customers on the upstream side and being the party providing the infrastructure in between.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So it's not all comprehensive in terms of at all getting built.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I would say that at the end of the day, people are going to want to know what their frac deal is. But that's a -- just because of regulatory process, that's a bifurcated process. So we deal with them in the open season, and we make sure that everybody has a chance to weigh in on the capacity that they want and the terms of the capacity they want on the regulated side. And so we make sure that's a nondiscriminatory process. And then second to that, then there's a discussion around what people's needs are for storage, fractionation and export capacity. But I would say that most customers are going to want to know what their deal is on both sides of that. So on one hand, they're separated for regulatory purposes, and on the other hand, people need to know what their downstream services are going to be.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Stephen Maresca from Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just sticking on Laurel Mountain and OBM for a second, and to be more specific, you took Northeast adjusted segment profit and DD&A down about 20% in '14 and '15. Can you help us understand what changed so materially in such a short period from last quarter's forecast to now? I know touched upon it, Alan. But is it as simple as just your drilling plans are off because of the change in ownership? And as a subset to that, it seems like you dropped the '16 and '17 kind of bar chart forecast you had in your slide deck in terms of gathering volumes for the Marcellus. Did -- is that a sign or do you not feel as comfortable forecasting that anymore in light of the changes in ownership from private equity to bigger majors?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I would just say our -- what we're seeing from the majors is, as I said, just a more careful effort on their part to make sure they maximize the NPV of their reserves and not just to quick-drive towards IPs [ph] and volumes. And so -- sorry, IPs and reserve growth. And so I would just say that we've -- what shifted really was having -- sitting down and wanting to make sure that we weren't investing capital too far out in front of the reserve packages that we're seeing there and not taking on additional risk. And so that resulted in sitting down and getting very detailed granular analysis on what their drilling plans were. And as you know, that's a little harder to predict because the motives of the majors are more around allocating capital around, and so it's a little harder to predict than somebody who just has one resource to go develop. And so I would just say we've gotten a lot more conservative in our approach towards that forecast, and it's just built from the ground up. And that probably is -- the major shift that we made, Stephen, was moving from a resource capability play to a detailed analysis of what the producers are actually doing and their actual drilling plans.", "Donald R. Chappel", "And, Steve, we ceased to project '16 and '17 given the challenges we've had in projecting the next couple of years. So we've -- we're really focused on projecting '14 and '15 and just conforming the volume forecast to our guidance period and really not trying to get too far out given all the variables that we see in the Northeast.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, appreciate that. Moving to Bluegrass, I just have a couple of questions here. Alan, do you have the same level of confidence in this project getting completed as you did on the last call given the large competitor project proposal? And can you talk at all -- ballpark types of project returns you would expect? And then I have a second one just on the funding after that.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I would say on the confidence level, I think this might surprise some people. But the confidence -- my confidence level is not really all that driven at this point by the competition, by the competing project just because we think we're so far ahead in terms of development of the project and details and how far ahead we are in terms of getting project developed. I think the -- so I would just say that's not really that big a factor frankly. I think the challenge that still remains is producers knowing their drilling plans, being committed to the drilling plans. And so I think we may get a lot of commitment, but we're going to need to be weighing how solid that those volumes will be and how much we can count on those volumes being there. And so that's what we're in the process of doing with the open season. And as I've said before, we're very excited about Bluegrass. We think it's a really key piece of infrastructure for the Marcellus and the Utica. And we think that it really, really needs to be installed at the end of 2015 to protect our investment on the upstream side and other investments or other more indirect investments that we have up there. So we think it's very important, and we think Bluegrass is the only one that can really meet that kind of time line. So that gives us a lot of confidence, but we're also -- we got a lot of projects to invest in, and we're going to make sure that it's a sensible investment for us before we plow -- start really plowing the big money into it in the first quarter of 2014.", "Donald R. Chappel", "And, Steve, this is Don. In terms of financing, again, we have a partner at Bluegrass. And I'd also note that we've been approached by others, industry players and financial players that would like to invest in the project, and we may or may not choose to partner with others. But beyond that will be a combination of debt and equity to maintain our credit rating goals, which we have previously consistently espoused as investment-grade ratings.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. One follow-up there. Have you thought about something at all, doing something with your Access GPL [ph] stake, to monetize that and create some liquidity? Or is that not something that's on the table right now?", "Donald R. Chappel", "All right. I think all of our assets are things that we evaluate all of the time, and certainly, those are assets that we continue to look at as well. So I certainly don't want to create an expectation, but we certainly look at all the levers that we have to pull as we look at potential financing.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Not to stay too much on the Northeast GMP, but we do have a pretty significant cut in EBITDA but not really any change in the CapEx forecast, from what I can tell from last quarter. So we're effectively saying we're getting lower returns on capital. I must -- I'm missing. Is there any reason why the CapEx budget may not have gone down given the slower volume ramp?", "Francis E. Billings", "Yes, this is Frank. What we've done is we basically cut more of the capital out in the out years. We've taken out the third train, frac train. We've pushed out the second, third and fourth processing plants. So we've kind of -- basically, we're focused on installing the -- let's say those foundational assets, the second frac expansion, the stabilization plant, the deethanizers, the ethane pipeline. Once we get all of those assets in place in by 2Q of '14, we'll -- pretty much of that, majority of those what I would say is the foundational assets in place. Some of the assets have installed costs, have gone up some, so that's part of the reason we've kind of had -- we haven't had the 2014 capital change. If you look, most of it shifted from '13 to '14, and that's the representative of the shift in in-service date. And then most of our growth capital has been pushed out to match the volumes being pushed out.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. The -- just shifting over to Geismar. Can you give us an update on where you are with some of the regulatory side of that in terms of the -- whether it's OSHA or [indiscernible]the other folks sitting there, looking at it?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. I'll have John Dearborn answer that for us.", "John R. Dearborn", "Sure, and thanks very much for the question. Our relationship with both the agencies remains extremely strong and excellent. And we're committed to keeping it up certainly that way. With the government shutdown that we all witnessed here the last few weeks or so, we've suffered a bit of a delay, all right, as that shut down the CSB and the OSHA work for a bit of a while. However, prior to that shutdown, we had all the necessary protocols in place to continue our work around the propane propylene fractionator that was damaged. And so we've continued our work, and we don't expect to suffer any delay in what we're doing as a result. One of the other things, though, that I'd like to bring to your attention in order to continue to build this relationship with OSHA and CSB is, you might have noticed that we've released the findings of the Williams investigation, and we're taking care to communicate those findings to all of the important stakeholders, of course, our employees being one of them. But we took the time and effort to communicate that to OSHA and CSB, and of course, they were grateful to that -- to us for that. Bottom line is we still expect the OSHA to issue their report around the beginning of the New Year, and that's the next important milestone, I think, relative to the federal regulatory agencies.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Very helpful. And then last one for me just on the costs. You did actually take out a lot of costs, it looks like out of the West segment. And I'm just wondering if we should think of that as a sustainable new run rate? Or is there any kind of onetime lower OpEx you may have had there?", "Allison G. Bridges", "I think -- this is Allison Bridges. Yes, we have seen some lower cost especially as a result of some of the reorganization that Don spoke about earlier, and some are the allocated costs that we get in the plants.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just actually a few clarifications of things that were said prior and maybe first starting on the Northeast on OBM. And, Frank, I think you mentioned this, but just to be clear that essentially, the pushout that we have seen in some of the milestones, the Moundsville fractionator, et cetera, that is all very deliberate with respect to matching up to industry activity, right? That's got nothing to do with execution, is that correct?", "Francis E. Billings", "I would say that the Moundsville frac train 3 is probably associated more with preserving that decision to be in line with the Bluegrass decision when we make that determination. I would say that moving the Moundsville frac train from 3 or 4Q of '13 into 2Q '14 is a function of just physical execution of the projects that we've seen in that area.", "Donald R. Chappel", "So to be clear on that, the demand is there for the first expansion or the Phase 2 Moundsville, and it's a matter of getting that project completed. The decision for laying down third is just because we think Bluegrass will reduce the need for local fractionation. And so we think that we're becoming more and more confident on the timing of Bluegrass such that we don't need to have both the local frac and a Bluegrass solution.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, definitely, the second frac train at Moundsville with 30,000 barrels a day is definitely needed as well as the stabilization plants and the deethanizers. So those are all on track for completion in '14 to support the drilling programs in place.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. No, I -- that's helpful. And then, Alan, just to kind of go back to the Bluegrass and understanding the commercial sensitivity of where we are right now, but I guess, as you guys have opened the biddings -- the open season here. Is the general approach a minimum take-or-pay type of commitment? Or isn't there something where, for the right price, you're willing to take volume risk?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Yes, because that's a regulated asset, we offered out a, I think, very intelligent response to the market that allows us a considerably higher rate for people that are just wanting to dedicate acreage but not make volume commitments. And then a very attractive rate to the degree people are willing to make a volume commitment. And there's various steps in between that. And so we basically provided a menu for customers, and then we still -- once we get all that built into our analysis in terms of those options, then we can decide whether that we think that degree of support justifies the investment and the project. So it is a menu, and it's, like I said, a very attractive rate if you compare it to, like, an ATEX ethane where it's a pay -- ship-or-pay kind of obligation on one hand. Then on the other hand, up to a volume dedication with -- or sorry, an acreage dedication have much higher rate but one that gives producer flexibility.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, appreciate the clarification. And then maybe just last question back on Geismar and the business interruption insurance. And I guess now that we have $50 million recorded agreed to, I guess, by the insurance companies, and I guess the number is refined a little bit more from sort of the initial preliminary estimate. Don, do you feel more comfortable around the uncertainty range, if you will, around that number today versus, say, for instance, on the second quarter call? Meaning, have there been deliberations with the insurance companies that have tightened perhaps the deviation of where that number can go to? Or is it basically, each time a new claim is filed, it's a new claim, a new process, so to speak?", "Donald R. Chappel", "No, I think we feel comfortable with our claim amount. Clearly, we have a good read of the policy, and we certainly know the lost production, the actual amounts to be determined based on the market prices and we would have realized. So that'll be dependent on what happens on the market over the coming quarters. But certainly, in terms of the volume, the lost production, we know that pretty darn well. So we think we've got a solid basis for our estimate here. I think the initial $50 million payment evidence is good faith on the part of the insurers. They stepped up and paid us $50 million in advance of our actual claims because our out of pocket around the physical damage was not that substantial yet and we only had 13 days of covered loss under business interruption during the month of August. So they actually, I think, made a good-faith early payment. So I think that's a good sign. Our next covered loss under business interruption would be for a partial month in October, so kind of the end of October. That's when we assume that the expanded plan will come back to service. So we'll file a claim for the month of October during the month of November, and then we would to expect it will take the insurers a month or so to respond to us. And we're -- and that will be the process every month. So partial month in October filed in November, give the insurers a bit of time to review that claim and respond to it. And then we'll have a full month loss in the month of November, file that claim in December, and again, the insurers, a bit of time to respond to that. So I think from a process standpoint, it's pretty well established. I think volumetrically, we know what our losses are, and we're mitigating the losses to the best of our ability, the economic losses. And then I think we'll see where market prices turn out. But again, we've outlined in our guidance what we expect the lost profits to be and the market price assumptions we've used there, and that's really what's guiding this claim.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "We saw on the Leidy Southeast project, most of the shippers on that project were downstream or LDC. Are you seeing more upstream demand as you've gone out with the open season on Atlantic Sunrise?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes. Alan, would you like me to take that?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Please, Rory. Thank you.", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes, Bradley, this is Rory Miller. It has been changing, and there was an earlier question about pricing in the Northeast. Of course, we're looking through a knot whole, a bit there. But certainly, what we've on the -- our current Leidy system that moves about 3 Bcf a day, there's much more gas than that trying to get into that line every day. We've got 8 Bcf a day of interconnections there. And so there's a lot of gas-on-gas competition for things that are playing in the spot market, and the prices have been at huge discounts to the Henry Hub. So I think that really is leading up to the answer to your question, and that's that we've seen a lot stronger response from the producer community. That being said, the people that made requests within the open season were fairly balanced between the market side and the supply side. But the producers were definitely stepping up in a much bigger way than what we've historically seen on Transco.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And you alluded earlier to having interest from potential partners in the Bluegrass project. And in the past, with projects like Constitution, you've obviously brought E&P partners into the project to secure volumes. Have you found so far that there are E&P shippers who are maybe making their participation in Bluegrass contingent on getting a significant equity stake in the project?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No, we really haven't seen that from the key customers that we're talking to because it's such a big investment. Mostly -- usually, when we have the parties that are wanting to take equity, it's a project that's fairly specific to their needs. So for, instance, Constitution with Cabot. That project was mostly -- capacity mostly taken by Cabot, and they wanted to make sure they were involved and had a stake in making sure the project was executed well and as well enjoyed some of the economic benefit of their capacity obligations. I think in Bluegrass, we've got a variety of different shippers such that it's not enough -- nobody has a dominant position in the pipeline, like we've seen on some of those other assets. Having said that, I would tell you there's a lot of interest from more strategic players, I would say, in wanting to have an interest. But it's likely not going to be the -- from the E&P side for the reasons I stated.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And the MOU that you alluded to last year when you acquired the ACMP interest that Chesapeake would -- at least intended to commit volumes, is that still an agreement that's in place as it pertains to Bluegrass?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just jumping to the Canadian side, just in rough numbers, maybe when you think about the top line in the Canadian off-gas processing business, how much of the revenue is there? And I realized it's kind of a key polar arrangement in the off-gas processing, but what percentage of that margin is coming from the olefins side versus from just the NGL side?", "Donald R. Chappel", "We'll have to get back to you on that. It's -- that mix has moved a little bit just recently as now we're starting up the ethane recovery plant. And that business, as I remind you, is a floor -- has a margin on it that has a floor that we're operating at because ethane is it's based off of Bellevue ethane. And therefore, that will be a fixed fee that will not be commodity-sensitive. But we can get back to you some detail. I don't have that right off the top of my head here.", "John R. Dearborn", "That would -- and it is John. The precise number for the majority would be NGLs and the minority being the -- being olefins up in Canada today.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And just one final one. Looking through the guidance, and there are a couple of other questions that alluded to this point, in the Western segment, you mentioned some of the things in the field that you were doing more efficiently. And certainly, it looks as though there was a big move up in 2013 full year EBITDA guidance, and fairly sizable move in '14 and then a little bit smaller move revising upwards in 2015. Maybe just qualitatively, if you could talk about why is it that the benefit from those cost-cutting or efficiency gain initiatives that you're taking gave a larger -- provided you with a larger step-up in guidance in '13 and '14 than it did in '15?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I think what you're really seeing there is just a lack of confidence in drilling volumes continuing out West is really what's driving most of that. And so the cost savings, I think, are very apparent to us there. But I would just say I think most of that is driven by an expected decline in volumes out West.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Curt Launer with Deutsche Bank.", "Curt N. Launer - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Two questions if I may, one more back to the Marcellus. In the 10-Q, you're referring to less favorable economics in the Western region. And I think that's been discussed a lot already in this call. But from the standpoint of the lower volumes in '13, what are the conditions, what are you seeing relative to your discussions with producers that could make that materially better in '14 and '15? Clearly, we think about it from the standpoint of NGL takeaway capacity boosting the netbacks. Or is it a question of natural gas prices needing to be higher that would spur that activity?", "Francis E. Billings", "Yes, this is Frank. I'm assuming you're referring to the Western part of the Marcellus...", "Curt N. Launer - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's correct.", "Francis E. Billings", "Or our Eastern business up there? I would say that the biggest thing we see relative to the Western area and volumes is more a function of what the ultimate netback might be for those areas, especially as you get into Northwest Pennsylvania, Northeast Ohio, some of those areas that are very infrastructure-challenged. I think in the -- our area, especially in the OEM area, I think we have -- we saw an improvement in the netbacks when we brought our fractionation train on, and we're going to see continued improvement in the netbacks to the producers when we bring this stabilization plan and the next fracturing as well as rail load facility. So for us in OBM, I think it's going to be able to show its consistent ability to get the commodities sold into the market. And I think that's what's going to support in our area we're currently operating. But I do think the Western part of the Marcellus, it's going to see -- and even Ohio, it's going to see -- we'll see some -- some of us could see some of the same pinching of basis relative to net gas sales and NGL prices as supplies outstrip, being able to get those commodities out of there.", "Curt N. Launer - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And switching gears to the Canadian assets. I wanted to ask if there's anything you could tell us that will help us model that into the outlook here. You mentioned the PIK units certainly, but what would be the expectation relative to debt as being part of the financing package as the assets are dropped down?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Curt, this is Don. Again, I think, as Alan mentioned, we expect the multiple not to exceed 7x on the purchase price. We expect it to be all equity. That's advantageous from a tax standpoint to Williams. Again, we defer taxes on that basis other than this tax that's triggered by changing the ownership -- structure of the Canadian assets to WPZ. So that's really the driver there. I hope that responds to your question.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Is there a fine on Northeast -- I'm sorry to keep harping on it. But I think you talked in all those slides, you're deferring $200 million a day processing out of '15 into later period and 30,000 barrels a day of frac. Yet we don't see CapEx go down. Can you reconcile that?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Yes, I think what we've done is we need the second fractioning. If you look at our 2014 volumes, our 2015 volumes in OBM, we will need to start to put the second $200 million a day train that drove in. But a lot of that balanced plant work has been done as far as the initial work. So we don't have a significant, significant requirement. But we have pushed it out to where we may not have to spend those dollars until 2016 given the current volume forecast that we have today. So you have -- that's probably the only asset that we've kind of shoved out of the '15 into '16 relative to kind of assets that you've seen before.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "I think the frac capacity sound like 30,000 barrels a day also.", "Donald R. Chappel", "That's the other thing, yes, that I mentioned earlier.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "So are you saying that the CapEx -- you've already spent the dollars on that, and so that's why we don't see CapEx coming down?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Well, we purchased the frac train. So we have that in our inventory, wasn't going to redeploy that in either some of our other opportunities that we have going on today whether it be up to 3RM [ph]. But today, most of the CapEx -- to get the kind of the investments that you see as -- on the slide, Slide 8, most all of that capital will be deployed in 2014. We have a little bit of capital in 2015 that prepared to get the second Oak Grove facility on. That one would be in our 15 plan. But beyond that, we've pushed out frac train or processing plants 3 and 4 and some of the other things that we've had in our 15 plants.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then this is -- it's smaller in the scheme of things and I don't have all the numbers in front of me. But looking at the maintenance CapEx, in this guidance, it's down by $85 million over the 3-year period and it looks like the last -- probably the last 4 quarters, maintenance CapEx keeps coming down. In an aggregate, it's material relative to the size of maintenance CapEx. Can you talk about what is it driving that and your thoughts behind the maintenance CapEx?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. As I mentioned earlier, we're still spending a very large amount of our profit particularly within the pipes. In fact, over 35% of our segment profit, we're putting back into maintenance CapEx if you take the 3-year maintenance CapEx and put that over the -- our segment profit. And so very significant amounts still going into that. But I would say that we invested very heavily in both '11 and '12 in catching up and beating the deadline that we had relative to some regulatory requirements for getting some of the asset integrity work done on the pipeline. So we had kind of a lot of that capital squeezed in to the '11 and '12 period. And as well, we also had things like we had some work that we had to get done for the Clean Air Act on -- so on our compression, on our major pipelines that we had to get done as well. And so again, those kind of culminated in '11 and '12. And so we've been working that hard in terms of getting done what we needed to get done for those timeframes. But it's allowed us a little bit of relaxation here in terms of that heavy capital spending in the guidance period that we have before us.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "I understand why it was higher in '11 and '12. But what I don't understand is why the guidance keeps coming down for '13 through '15 because I mean, that's past. So why would the guidance keep coming down?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I don't think I can -- sorry, I didn't follow your question there. Well, a couple of things. One, with the continued decline in volumes in the West, we have less maintenance CapEx. And we've made some decisions, as I mentioned earlier, for doing things like taking the Lybrook plant out of service. So some of our older fleets out West is a result of the volume reduction, and those older plants, as you can imagine, suck up maintenance capital. And so those changes have been made to our Midstream maintenance CapEx and on the gas pipes. One thing we did do -- and I'm not sure this is a major driver, but it's certainly embedded in here, is we had some pressure-testing obligations that we were trying to get all done by '18. We took a really close look at those in terms of really where we needed to reduce risk on the system and negotiate it with FEMZA [ph] to -- and got them to understand that really, the better risk reduction was spreading out that timeframe on some of that pipeline integrity work. So that spread things out a little more versus where we had some dollar spending in there in '18. So that's a little bit of that reduction on gas pipes. But I think the major reduction you see is really on the Midstream side. And it really is the teams out West working pretty hard to reduce our maintenance capital out West, and it's resulted in reducing volume.", "Rory Lee Miller", "Alan?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes.", "Rory Lee Miller", "One other item, too, that's probably worth mentioning to Becca here, the -- with the changing flow patterns on the Transco system, where we're now getting a lot of our supply or much of our supply from the Northeast as opposed to just the Gulf Coast. The middle portion of our system is the compression on that portion of the system is running much less frequently. So we're having a lot less hours on those units. We're having a lot less maintenance there, and our turbine change-outs are being able to pushed out in the future years. So as we kind of put that whole new dynamic into the equation, that's also a bit of a significant impact.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great point. Thanks, Rory.", "Allison G. Bridges", "Yes, and this is Allison Bridges. And I would also just like to add to the lower sort of maintaining the facilities. We do have some pretty significant reduction in well connects than we had previously had. So at least for the next few years, that's continuing to come down.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Selman Akyol with Stifel.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "In terms of the Canadian assets, in your assumption there of the $200 million, what capacity utilizations have you guys assumed?", "John R. Dearborn", "They're flexible. There are -- there's actually 3 assets there to be thinking about. One is the -- is liquids extraction plant up in Fort McMurray. The other is the pipeline, and the other is the fractionator. In terms of our operating in the next year and future years, the fractionator is going to be running near to full capacity. We'll need some incremental expansion in order to accommodate CNRL plant and the liquid extraction plant up in Fort McMurray when the upgrader is running -- be running pretty much full out because it's a dedicated to that facility.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I'll take recovery point.", "John R. Dearborn", "I'm sorry?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I'll take recovery point. Can you do the other? Let's partner. I would also add to that. Normally, we build into that about a 97.5% run time. So in terms of how much, that's up and that's consistent with our typical capabilities. And perhaps, you can speak to the pipeline?", "John R. Dearborn", "Yes, the pipeline will have a little bit of excess capacity as we -- we'll have some room on it as we bring on these other projects into the future.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Great, And then just to confirm, are you still looking for an April 1 start on Geismar?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes, that is correct.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Armstrong, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to for any additional or closing remarks.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us today. We are blessed to have such a great portfolio of growth -- major growth projects to pursue, and those keep coming on. And that gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow our WMB dividend and our distributable cash flow at WPZ for many years to come. And we certainly are excited to make the step we're making on the Canadian asset dropdown, which moves us closer to a pure play. But we also retain the benefit of some very significant dropdown candidates for WPZ in the future. So we think structurally, we're very well positioned. And we think in terms of our business opportunities, they just couldn't be more robust. And the team is very excited about continuing to execute and deliver on this tremendous cash flow growth. So thank you very much for joining us this morning and for the great questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "John Porter", "Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.", "In addition to Alan, we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas with us. Jim Scheel leads our Northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western area, Rory Miller leads the Atlantic Gulf area; and John Dearborn is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to any questions.", "In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great. Thank you, John, and good morning. Let me welcome all of you who joined us today for our fourth quarter results. We'll also talk about our major developments and our outlook today. We do have a lot to cover today concerning items like Geismar, Gulfstar, Bluegrass, our Northeast volume growth and now our big exciting project, Atlantic Sunrise.", "But before I turn to our fourth quarter results and our full year, let me provide a brief update on where we are with Corvex and Soroban. As you know, in December, Corvex and Soroban disclosed their interest and each having representation on the Williams' board. Since that time, we've been engaged in discussions with both Corvex and Soroban related to the company's strategic plan to drive continued value creation and, of course, we look forward to continuing those discussions with those parties. We do have a long track record here at Williams and, in fact, in recent years, have been a leader in taking advantage of transformational and structural opportunities that create value for our shareholders, and we continue to welcome input towards our goal of enhancing shareholder value for this great company. And so with that, let's turn to our fourth quarter results.", "Before we get into the details of fourth quarter performance for WPZ, I'd like to remind you of our strategic focus to grow our exposure to fee-based revenues. We are accomplishing this by continuing to develop large-scale infrastructure that will be critical to connecting the fastest-growing supplies to the fastest-growing markets for natural gas and natural gas derivatives. And in fact, this train is just gaining steam as we saw an 8% increase year-over-year in fee-based revenues at WPZ, and we expect even faster growth into 2014 and '15.", "In the fourth quarter, WPZ enjoyed this growth trend despite harsh winter weather conditions in the Rockies and, in fact, we had another record for DCF growth in the fourth quarter of $509 million, up 26% over the previous fourth quarter.", "This strong performance exceeded our internal expectations in spite of about $43 million lower in NGL margins. One of the drivers for the better performance was lower costs and maintenance capital expenses.", "About 1 year ago, we reorganized the company to enable a flatter management structure and better cost efficiencies by deploying our very best knowledge of things like asset integrity and procurement across our entire operations. And as you can see by analyzing our numbers, we've been able to drive the combination of our O&M and G&A expenses lower despite managing tremendous growth in our business. I want to be very clear that our lower maintenance cost in our maintenance CapEx area has been driven by better efficiencies and fewer required repairs, not lower standards of care across our facilities.", "WMB also -- moving on to WMB, we also enjoyed an 8% increase year-over-year in the segment profit plus DD&A for the quarter, with Williams Partners carrying much of that increase. One disappointment for the fourth quarter was the financial performance for our WMB NGL & Petchem Services segment, primarily driven by Canada, where third-party outages dramatically impacted supplies available for Fort McMurray facility. But that project is up and running very well now and is now exceeding our expectations for both recoveries and volumes, as we really have that business up and running very smoothly now with the ethane recovery portion that we added in that business in the third and fourth quarter of last year.", "So we look forward to that project becoming the driver for WPZ's results with the drop-down, and we expect that to be completed very soon here, actually, at the end of this month.", "So of course, we appreciate the great work the team at ACMP is doing to grow their business in a steady and predictable manner, and of course, this also helped us outperform the year for the fourth quarter.", "Moving on to the DCF growth and our expectations for growth looking into '14 and '15. We do continue to expect strong DCF growth, in fact, greater than 50% from 2013 to 2015. This extraordinary growth rate is on the backs of large capital investments that we've been making over the last couple of years, most of which -- a lot of which has been financed by equity, and our organization is very focused right now on executing this large capital program that is essential to this growth. We updated our commodity prices and our latest assumptions on all of our key projects for 2014. With the degree of volatility we've seen recently in commodity prices, there are a lot of different impacts in our guidance, but in summary, our guidance range is unchanged from the third quarter.", "We have great visibility around the projects that we expect will drive this growth. We continue to hit key execution milestones that serve to substantially derisk these major projects, and I'll talk a little bit about that in some more detail in a few of our projects. Where we did update our guidance is for growth CapEx, where we have added some noteworthy changes, and we'll see that here on the next slide. And so you can see for the WPZ increasing CapEx, we've got initial spending on some new projects, so projects like Atlantic Sunrise and Dalton. And this higher spending reaffirms our belief in growth potential of our business both within and well beyond our guidance period.", "2 of the new projects we've listed here, Atlantic Sunrise and Dalton are on our Transco system where we continue to see strong demand for our services, and really, I think in very positive way here, not just coming from the supply side but from the market and the demand side as well.", "I expect you saw our news release this morning with some additional detail on Atlantic Sunrise, and we'll hit that topic here in a few minutes. Gunflint, which is mentioned here, is a deepwater tie-back to our new Gulfstar One facility, and our team on Gulfstar have done a terrific job of making some modifications onto the top sides there at Gulfstar to be able to accommodate the easy tie-back of Gunflint. So we're really excited about the way our team continue to execute on Gulfstar One. And WPZ will be adding CapEx for the new Redwater projects. So these are expansions at Redwater that will accommodate things like the CNRL Horizon volumes that will be coming in, and so we've added capital in there for that as well.", "We're also incorporating $175 million higher capital spend for the Geismar expansion on higher costs that result in part from delay in the restart.", "For WMB, specifically, you'll see that we have lowered our growth CapEx to reflect a shift in timing to mid- to late 2016 on the joint venture Bluegrass pipeline project to better match the needs of the market. We remain very excited about the Bluegrass pipeline project, and I continue to believe that it's the best solution available in the market. And what I can tell you in terms of where we are is that the activity that we continue to see and the input and discussions that we're having, there is -- there are a number of parties out there who share our view of the market and the attractiveness of the solution, and we are working to reach definitive agreements with all interested parties as we push that project forward.", "Moving onto next slide here, on Atlantic Sunrise, just a little bit of update and just some brief information. We did issue a news release earlier today on the milestone that Transco executed firm contracts with 9 shippers or 100% of the 1.7 million dekatherms per day of firm transportation capacity. And so we're very excited to announce that very important project for Transco in that it not only serves as a great investment, but it really opens up a lot of supply availability for expanding markets as well. The project includes 15-year shipper commitments. Then the shippers are both producers, local distribution companies and power generators.", "The project represents vital energy infrastructure designed to connect surging, new supplies of natural gas in the Marcellus producing region in, really, coming mostly from the northeastern Pennsylvania area with growing demand centers along the Atlantic Seaboard.", "We expect to bring the Atlantic Sunrise into service in the second half of 2017 and of course, this assumes all necessary regulatory approvals are received in timely manner.", "Moving onto our milestones and the key accomplishments and developments here on Slide 9. We did have a number of recent milestones in the fourth quarter and even into this year. We brought the Canadian ethane recovery project online as I mentioned earlier. The volumes in the fourth quarter for that were disappointing for a number of reasons, but primarily impacted by some third-party outages, both upstream and some difficulties delivering the project -- the product downstream. Those have all been worked out now, and we're enjoying, as I mentioned earlier, great volume growth now.", "We're reaching important milestones on our Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar projects. We also are rapidly growing our northeast business. We saw a 63% increase in our gathering volumes from the fourth quarter of '13 to the fourth quarter of '12, and that compares very favorably, if you really look at the whole Marcellus volumes, which grew about 40% last year. So really, we're growing -- that says we're growing at a 50% higher rate than the broader Marcellus base is growing. So we're very excited about that. We did see our volumes reach an average of about 1.9 Bcf per day for the full year, and of course, our actual volumes are well above that now.", "We touched on the impressive financial growth that we expect to see between '13 and '14. I would certainly say that's not without risk, and we've highlighted the largest of the growth drivers here for 2014 as we continue to push forward on these projects. Looking at 2015 and beyond, we're really starting to see the development of our growth, as some of our projects experience a full year of earnings and we bring these new projects online. So '15 is both the combination of a lot of the full year benefit of projects like Gulfstar and Keathley Canyon, which come on in the last half of the year going into '15, as well as some exciting new growth projects through '15 as well.", "Beyond the guidance period, you'll really begin to see the effect of these major projects. They provide visibility to our continued WPZ DCF growth and support for Williams' continued strong dividend growth. Because we do have the luxury of so many projects that leverage off of our competitive advantages, we can be selective in pursuing only the best risk-adjusted return projects. So we're in a very envious position to be allocating capital to, really, the very best projects.", "Moving on to Slide 10 here. A picture of different services we're providing for the Northeast, and here's our large scale strategy. It really comes together and plays out in this key growth area where we have operations and investments and opportunities across our various lines of our business. We're strategically positioned in one of the fastest-growing production areas. The biggest challenges in the Marcellus and the Utica are exactly the kinds of problems that our large scale infrastructure strategy is designed to solve. This is a great resource basin that needs great market access.", "And what stands in our way? Well, as we've been pushing through these major projects, certainly, one of the key issues is the customer's ability to make major commitments up against very complex regulatory structures and the risks in their business. And certainly, the regulatory complexity that it's taking to get this large-scale infrastructure installed as well are barriers to growth. That's both an impediment, but it's also a great opportunity for a company like Williams that's very skilled at taking on these very large complex projects.", "Atlantic Sunrise and Bluegrass are really big infrastructure solutions that we've been working on. And in the case Atlantic Sunrise, it took some chronic, very visible infrastructure constraints in the market to bring adequate shipper support and firm transportation contracts with long 15-year terms to the project. Consider that, in this example with Atlantic Sunrise, it takes more than $400 million in annual revenue each and every year over those 15 years, along with very strong credit support behind those, to underwrite a project to the side. That's a very big commitment to make in the face of these regulatory mazes, but as we mentioned earlier, the market has really recognized that it's going to have to invest and support these kinds of projects.", "And so Atlantic Sunrise is one of the first major investments that's coming -- that connects increasing markets with the increasing supplies in the Marcellus area. Of course, it's on the backs of 3 smaller projects that we've been doing out of the area, but this is really a very large scale project that we're bringing forth. We certainly believe that the Bluegrass pipeline project will be the next chapter in how the stories plays out. But in the NGL segment of the market as the constraint in the supply sources become more evident and people look harder for really the right solution out of the basin and our discussions with our customers certainly indicate, that's where we're headed.", "We expect to bring the Geismar plant back into service. Sorry, I'm moving to Slide 11 here. We expect the Geismar plant to be back in service in June this year. The delay in returning the plant to service and completing the expansion resulted from a variety of factors including the extended loss of utilities. So that's primarily things like steam, our electrical system, those were all damaged severely in the incident. And as a result, getting the project back up and running without those systems has proved to be very difficult and very complex.", "Based on the current commodity price assumptions, we continue to expect that we are mostly covered on the financial effect of the incident with the exception of the 60-day period before the business interruption insurance kicked in during 2013 and the $13 million in cash deductibles that were primarily associated with the property damage.", "Moving on to Slide 12 here. Talking about some exciting milestones here in our deepwater projects, and of course, that's included in our Atlantic Gulf segment. On Gulfstar One, we've now achieved an important milestone with the mooring process. So Gulfstar has now reached storm-safe status and the contingencies to cover risks related to weather and powerful eddy currents can be dramatically reduced. So one of the key issues is getting a spar like this set. When we set Devils Tower originally, we were faced with some pretty bad eddy currents in this area. And getting that facility moored is a major milestone for our team, and things have been going very smoothly in accelerating the schedule on Gulfstar. So very excited about the team's performance out here on Gulfstar.", "And so we do expect our facilities to be in place for an on-time startup of production. Keep in mind that our production -- that a portion of our cash flows will be dependent on the startup of the production and of course, we will be doing everything we can to help to produce and bring production on as soon as possible. I'll remind you that on Gulfstar that Hess and Chevron's Tubular Bells prospect initially, and then as I mentioned earlier, later, outside the guidance period, Gulfstar -- sorry, Gun Flint would be tied back. We do expect production to commence in the third quarter of this year. On the Keathley Canyon project, the customers are Anadarko and Exxon, and we expect this work to be done well ahead of the production commencing in the fourth quarter of this year, and in fact, our deepwater line is now more than 80% laid.", "Moving to the summary slide here on 13, which just tells you, we are very committed to the strategy with an intense focus for the long term on the natural gas supercycle. We are convinced more than ever that we're really in the sweet spot. We've positioned ourselves very well to create value in this environment. We are now getting some tailwinds from a lift in both NGL prices and gas prices, and these are exactly the kinds of signals that the producing community needs to see right now to continue to develop the resources that are out in front of us.", "We're rapidly converting our business to a volume, fee-based business that is enduring, and we're putting in the kind of infrastructure that is difficult to replicate in the long term. We're very focused on this critical infrastructure and very well-contracted business is going to be here for the long haul due to its competitive advantages in the market.", "That's hard work. It's a lot of risk, and it's a lot of grit on the part of our team to push through all of that, but that's exactly what we're going to stay focused on. And it's the stuff that in the long term, the market is going to have to have for a sustainable growth in natural gas and natural gas derivatives markets here in the U.S. I truly believe that there is no other company in this sector that enjoys the degree of visibility to growth that we enjoy both now and over the long period.", "So with that, I thank you, very much for joining us, and we'll turn it over to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Brad Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "First, a quick question about weather. Obviously, the price impact of this winter has been very good for gas and NGL markets. What impact, if any, do you expect to see as we move into Q1 in terms of freeze-offs or other operational issues as a result of weather either in the West or in the Northeast? And have we seen some of the buildout in the Northeast or some of the drilling activity slow as a result of some of the cold weather?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. Great, Brad. Thanks for the question. First of all, I'd like to commend our Western team and our Northeast team for some great operations despite some pretty difficult environments out West in the fourth quarter. Moving into the first quarter, where your question was targeted, I would say the West continues to do pretty well up against our norms -- we normally do have quite a bit of freeze-off. But I would tell you, they continue to perform very well up against the norms for the Rockies in the Western areas. San Juan Basin has actually had one of the better periods during this than we normally see quite a bit of reduction in production there. In the Northeast, I'm very thankful for the work our team's done up there. Key to reliability up on our system. I will tell you there's certainly been some freeze-up upstream on some of the producer's equipment and some of the volumes upstream of our facilities, but our facilities have remained very reliable. And really excited to see our team having pushed through some very challenging times of getting these facilities up to reliable standards. And so we have set some freeze-offs out there in the wet Marcellus area. But again it's not been on our systems, it's been upstream, and producers have been working quickly to overcome that.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And another question about a little bit more of the long-term outlook in the Northeast on your OVM systems specifically. There have been some really impressive dry gas well results just across the river in Ohio, and it appears that there is some potential prospectivity in Marshall and Wetzel for those very productive dry gas horizons. Are those -- is that kind of emerging play something that you've discussed with your OVM customers? With that dry gas production, if it does emerge, would that dryer gas maybe alleviate some of the operational issues that you've seen with some of the especially super-rich gas that you've had on the OVM system just by diluting some of the liquids content and providing you with maybe more of a dry gas blend stock for some of the ethane-rich gas you produce?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. Well, first of all, I would tell you there are several of our key producers that do have plans this year to test into both the Utica dry and the Upper Devonian. And while the Upper Devonian doesn't provide any relief, I hate to -- as a processing company, I hate to think about getting -- moving to dry gas as relief. But to your point, some of the big volumes that we've been seeing from Utica test in the dry area would certainly help provide some sweeping volumes and a more reasonable gas-to-liquid phase in our pipeline. So we're excited about that, and we certainly are working with the producers. I would tell you included in our capital is some expansions of our systems to be able to accommodate some of those higher volumes on the dry gas side.", "Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great, and just one last one. On Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise. Constitution kind of stood out as the only Northeast pipe project to involve a significant laying of new build pipes, and Atlantic Sunrise, at least from the map you have provided, it appears as though that project would also involve some significant new pipe from kind of the Leidy Line down towards Station 190. And I guess, is there anything from the Constitution process that's maybe something that could be applied to the Atlantic Sunrise process? Or is it something where, as long as you're laying significant new build pipes, there will be some regulatory risks of delays and what have you?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great question. I would tell you that on Constitution, the real issue we're facing right now from a regulatory issue really relates to the New York DEC, not to the FERC. And so the nice thing about Sunrise is it does not go through the New York area. So we're not faced with that same regulatory issue. On the FERC side, I would just tell you, no, they are continuing to push through. You've saw the Constitution's draft EIS. So we're very thankful for the FERC continuing to try to do their part to accelerate these projects, and we continue to work well with them. And we certainly have some -- a lot of discussions, communications we need to do in New York to find the right answers and right solutions there as well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A couple of quick questions on Geismar. So you say, expect to be out of service until June. How firm is that date? And then how much extra out-of-pocket costs are there for each month you missed that? It seems like there, you only had, if I'm reading this right, $10 million of additional uninsured losses from delaying this, 2 the 3 months from April to June. Is that right?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. It's for 2 months. That's correct. Just a little over 2 months of delay, that's correct. And so to answer your question, right now, the mechanical completion is expected in the first part of May, and I would tell you there's obviously a lot of things to go right, but I'm very proud of the work that our team has done to really dig in some great detail to understand what the drivers of that are in the productivity and labor. And I think we've got a very studied perspective on that issue. Having said that, I would tell you the window is probably from the last week in May through the end of June as the expected window right now for that startup. And in terms of that cost, of course, if we were delayed beyond that, it's very dependent on ethane to ethylene spreads. But in a range, that's probably around $1.5 million to maybe up to $2 million a day of expected revenues we lose on that.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then one more. The $175 million more CapEx and the higher cost for Geismar, is it relating to repairs? Or are you getting a return on that increased capital spend?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. There are -- unfortunately, this isn't one that we'll get any return on. And I would just tell you, it's been driven by a lot of the complexities associated with the damage at the plant. So we've had, as I mentioned early, we would have to go in and wait on utilities being ready, the complexity of working in both the damaged-repaired areas, as well as getting the expansion that's just put a very crowded and complex stage there. So I would tell you that is one of the major drivers for us, but there certainly isn't, unfortunately, any incremental return to come to us from that investment.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Understood. And then moving to Bluegrass, Alan, you pushed it out, but you're still talking quite favorably on the project. And is your sense that producers are eventually going to be willing to sign up, but this is just a timing issue, and I guess, what is causing them to hold off on signing right now and still giving you confidence that there will be in the future?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. Steve, great question, and thanks. I will just tell you, if you look at what cost for a producer, the kind of commitment, if somebody's got 30,000 to 70,000 barrels a day of commitment, and you look at what that looks like on a roughly $0.30 a gallon by the time you pay for transport, frac and go to an export facility. That $0.30 a gallon, put that times 30,000 to 50,000 barrels a day and pile it up for 15 years, that's a very, very large commitment from many of the producers we're dealing with. And it's just taking time for them to get all their approvals and work through all of the issues and concerns that they have with that because it is a very, very large commitment, and if you do the math on that. And so I really think that's the practical issue we're dealing with. We have some very engaged customers. I think, as I mentioned, a lot of our costumers see this opportunity just like we do. That it is essential, and it's an essential piece of infrastructure, and I think some folks would just like to see some of the else get it built, and hopefully be on the coattails of that. But frankly, we're going to have to see an adequate amount of financial support before we push through with additional investment.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And I appreciate -- moving away from Bluegrass, and your comment about discussions with Soroban and Corvex. I want to know if you could just talk any discussions you have with respect to the Access's 50% GP interest held by GIP. Is it something that you would ultimately like to own at WMB? And is it something you're working towards ultimately?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I would just tell you -- we think the ACMP business is a great business. We think it would be a great complement to Williams in a lot of ways, both from a management team standpoint, as well as the structure and the contracts and the focus on natural gas. So it's very much in line with our strategy. But of course -- so I think fundamentally, the answer to your question is yes. We would like to look towards bringing in the synergies of combining those businesses, but there's another party involved. And that means there is a value trade to be added, and we'd have to make sure that the value trade really makes sense for our shareholders. And because we do have some many great investment opportunities in front of us right now, we have to keep that in balance as well. And so to answer your question, yes, we'd love to do it, but at the right price and at the right timing as well, because the bigger hurry we get in, the more extensive that likely becomes.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "One quick follow-up. Are there active -- would you describe as active discussions in that for this or not right now?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. I wouldn't describe there's being any active discussions. I would say we continue to study the opportunity from our own perspective. But I wouldn't suggest that there's any active discussions with GIP on that.", "Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Final very quick one for me. Do you expect to have IDR waivers in 2014? I saw you didn't have them in the fourth quarter.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. We do not intend to have IDR waivers.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Abhi Rajendran with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "A couple of quick questions. You increased a lot of your assumptions on your commodity deck, but your outlook was largely unchanged. I guess, is this just a function of most of the commodity movements largely netting themselves out? Or are there some volume offsets? If you could provide some color on some of the puts and takes? That would be helpful.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Sure. Yes, really, it is very much an offset. So you'll see, of course, some higher NGL prices reflect the current market, and you'll see the slightly lower ethylene prices. And of course, all of that is up against the higher natural gas price. And so as I mentioned in my comments, really, those -- all of those work to offset each other primarily. So really fairly little movement in all those businesses as well.", "Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Got it. And on the topic of ethylene, ethane prices. I mean, could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on margins for Geismar over the long run? Obviously after it's up and running. Ethane is spiked recently, but there's still plenty of supply coming online. And on the pricing side, ethylene is largely driven by crude, international crude. So just some of the puts and takes there and your thoughts on how margins will shape up over time.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. Abhi, I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take that question for us.", "John R. Dearborn", "Sure, and thanks very much for the question. Starting with -- let's start with a short-term look at ethylene. As we look back over our shoulder, coming out of last year in anticipation of the second quarter turnarounds that are in front of us, I think there are 3 factors that are about to turn around in the second quarter. The industry, if you look at the EFPN [ph] inventory data, built inventory, in our estimate is they built somewhere between 700 million and 800 million pounds through the end of this year. That's roughly how much ethylene will be needed in the second quarter. I think on the back of that, we saw the weakening prices in the first quarter. It's our expectation they'll warm up again into the second quarter, and that's -- and then back to what we would consider normal for the year in the latter part of the year. And so I think that's the way we see this year playing out. If we look at ethane, I think in the short term, ethane is facing some operational difficulties in the Gulf Coast, mainly related to brine that's all the new fractionators have built there in the Gulf Coast. I think folks just challenged in moving the inventories around us is necessary because of some brine difficulties. We think that's going to clear out over the short period of time, and as a result, coupled with -- as a result, I think that we're going to see the ethane prices drop back to what would be a more normal level in the $0.30 per gallon range. I think that's what we've got in our guidance. So I think that takes care of this year's view. So now as we look forward, the next significant tranches of ethylene come in, in the 2017, '18 time frames. So our expectation is -- on the back of oil staying high and naphtha being relevantly related to oil, that our ethylene margins through that period until we see new, significant supplies of ethylene come on in the latter part of this decade, I think our ethylene margins are expected to remain pretty strong.", "Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And then one last quick one, if I may. Could you maybe talk a little bit about recontracting on the Northwest and Transco pipelines in terms of what's up for renewal, how we should think about changes in the transportation rates? Obviously, Transco is running pretty close to full; Northwest is not quite there. But any color there would be very helpful.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Okay, great. I'll ask -- we're in very good shape on that, as well as Gulfstream. I'll ask Rory Miller to take Transco, and then Allison Bridges can give you a response on Northwest. So Rory, if you'll take that Transco question?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Yes, that's a good question. Just thinking about Transco a little bit, we've got what I would call some pretty fresh market signals around pricing with our new Atlantic Sunrise project. And although we're not really disclosing all the information on it right now, the rates are above, significantly above where our system rate is. I think we've got an average of 6 years or so on contract length there. But we believe that with the change of the system, supply coming in both ends and the kind of growth that we have from the market side, it's truly a \"supply push, market pull\" kind of scenario. We believe as those contracts roll off that re-upping those contracts is going to be very attractive for our end users. We don't think anybody in the marketplace will be able to touch the opportunity that the LDCs have to just re-up those contracts. And in fact, that's what we've seen as contracts roll off. We've not seen any pressure at all in terms of getting those recontracted. So it's kind of -- it's a very healthy situation, and I think, due in large part just to the quality of the service and the positioning of the assets.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great. Thank you, and Allison, if you'll take the North -- question on Northwest.", "Allison G. Bridges", "Yes. On Northwest, we are fully subscribed even though we don't run at 100% load factor day in and day out. We do -- our contracts are fully subscribed, and I believe, on average, we have a remaining term of over 9 years. And we continue to be able to extend terms with customers. Additionally, we're really starting to see, I think, some exciting new market growth opportunities come to the Northwest through potential new fertilizer plants, potential new methanol plants for exports. So I think that not only will that continue to bode well for our existing capacity, I think longer-term, it will also result in some expansion opportunity.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "In the Northeast, your processing volume was a bit stronger than I would have expected. How much, if any of that, was due to benefiting from a third-party outage?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "There was some in the month of -- mostly in the month of December there Christine, that came from the Natrium plant being down, and I think it was around varied, but up to about 50 million a day during the month of December.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then if I look at your NGL production, it looks like you guys may have hit your fractionation capacity maybe at the end of 4Q or sometime this quarter. Is that the case, and is your new frac unit online today?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. We are up against the limits on the base frac, and the second frac, we are -- we'll be commissioning here towards the end of the first quarter.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Was there a buildup in NGL volumes that couldn't get frac-ed or no?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Going to Bluegrass. Was there maybe more acreage dedications than you would have liked and not enough minimum volume and/or ship or pay commitments? Is that delay in the pipeline more about reducing your volume risks, and that's only going to happen when producers feel more pain in netbacks. Also, have the smaller projects that have been announced since your original announcement of the project played the part in pushing back your timing?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, first of all on the acreage dedication versus not enough volume, we certainly appreciate both of those as contributions. But clearly, we want to have a baseload of revenues that we can count on initially, and so that certainly is a major part of the issue. Secondly, as to the smaller projects -- I think those are great projects. I think they're needed. But they don't provide the kind of long-term underground storage opportunities that you get with the Gulf Coast nor the diversity of the markets for both the growing Petchem businesses and as well as the export opportunities that are very large-scale in nature in well-protected ports. So I would just tell you that I think we're excited those other projects exist because we think the growth in volume is certainly is dictating those kinds of solutions. But we really haven't seen that as a big deterrent for producers committing to Bluegrass.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one for me. Can you provide an update on the PDH facilities? Last we heard, you narrowed it down to 2 international players or 2 players, I guess, who are interested in building derivative plants alongside your facilities. But we'd like to know if there's been any progress there.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take that as well.", "John R. Dearborn", "Yes. Christine, thanks for the question. Yes, we've made some good progress there. We actually narrowed it down to one person, and we're entering into definitive agreements on that. Give us a couple of months and probably by Analyst Day, we'll be able to bring you a good update on where that the project is at that stage, but progressing as expected at the moment.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I was hoping just to possibly drill down a little bit more on the Northeast G&P. Would it be possible to quantify how much weather impacted the quarter, the ROIs?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I would tell you it wasn't very large, actually. I'd say, some of the more significant issues were line breaks and a number of onetime operational expenses and some write-downs and so forth. But not too big of a volume impact from weather. One impact, though, that we did suffer was the ethane limitations going into the TETCO system. And so without the ethane systems being up and running yet, there were constraints that TETCO imposed on points like the Fort Beeler connection that required curtailments there. And so that did have some impact on our volumes in the fourth quarter.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then as we look forward into 2014, I was just wondering if you could provide any color on how you see the segment ramping up over the year? Do you expect the first quarter to be similar to fourth quarter or a steady ramp across the year or any step change in any given quarter?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, some of the big projects that we have coming on, of course, is the Gulfstar project, which would come on in the third quarter, and the Keathley Canyon project, which comes on at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and then the Rockaway lateral project. Additionally, though, the projects in the Northeast, many of which will come on either at the very end of the first quarter or the second quarter, really, are some big drivers, not necessarily just the volume, but to the rate that we achieve for those services. And so even though people come accustomed to looking at volume there, a lot of that will be just an increase in rates. So those are really some of the big projects, I would say. On the Cayman system -- sorry, on the system in Susquehanna Supply Hub area with Cabot, those volumes will continue to grow throughout the year. And we're really excited about the continued growth up there, and we're working very hard to keep the infrastructure out in front of the growth up there. But that's pretty well steady. That growth will be well steady throughout the year.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So specific to the Northeast G&P, sounds like going into the second quarter, there could be a bit of a step change there?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Correct.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Harry Mateer with Barclays.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Two for me. The first, can you just talk about whether your thoughts on the need to have investment grade ratings of WMB have evolved and whether that financial policy might be part of your discussions when you consider taking advantage of the structural and transformation opportunities that you mentioned at the start of the call?", "Donald R. Chappel", "This is Don Chappel. Certainly, our -- I'll call it policy and desires have been to maintain the investment grade ratings at Williams. We think that it provides a lot of flexibility and ability to be opportunistic, particularly during very challenging times when the high-yield market is locked up. But having said that, we're certainly open-minded to other paths that create more value but it would have to be something compelling that would cause us to deviate from the path that we're on. So again, we continue to be open-minded, but we think it would take a compelling value-creation situation in order for us to deviate from our current path.", "Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then just a follow-up on Transco and Northwest earlier. Appreciate the commentary on rolling contracts. But you said there's been no issue with getting contracts renewed and extended. But I'm just wondering, has pricing been stable as well? Or do you feel like you're giving up some pricing to get tenor?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Rory, you want to take that, please?", "Rory Lee Miller", "Sure. Harry, we really haven't seen price pressure on those re-up contracts. If you look at where our system rates are, they're probably the lowest-cost opportunity that people have in the marketplace. And so the other thing is so many of our -- the LDCs that we serve, it's not like we're just dropping off large volumes of gas at one point. In some of our bigger customers, we've got over 40 delivery points. And so when you think about the way that we're distributing that gas into a 60- or 70-year-old distribution system and the low rates that we have that they can re-up at, it's just really hard. Plus, it's virtually impossible to replace those with gas from a new competitor.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "And to be clear on that, we haven't discounted any of that firm. It's 100% contracted, and the rates are getting set by those rate cases. But to those long-haul 100% firms, there's not any discount. There may be a discount in the production area for IT and so forth, but not on the long-haul firm.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess, first question for me, it's WMB-leveled. You've obviously reduced the CapEx here with Bluegrass getting pushed out. I'm wondering if you can just talk about capital allocation, thoughts on the dividends, I don't know, share buybacks, keeping dry powder for acquisitions. What would you do with the extra cash, now that you'll have here for a little while?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Don, take that.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Ted, this is Don. I would say that the extra cash flow now is still going on into some of our growth projects like CNRL. And we'll see what Bluegrass does, but for the near term, that extra cash is being reinvested in that Canadian business. Longer-term, I think we have a lot of options, and we'll have to see how things play out here in terms of investment, as well as all the other options that we continue to evaluate. I think as Alan mentioned early on that we continue to evaluate kind of all the options, and we're very open to possibilities that will create additional value.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then we've sort talked around it a little bit, but can you just give us a sense on Atlantic Sunrise? The returns that we're ought to be modeling in there, it sounds like it's higher than your current system rates. I think there was a mention of $400 million of revenue. Just give us a sense of what kind of returns from the $2.1 billion of capital we should expect.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "That looks like about -- without providing specific returns there, it does look like about a 7x multiple on that project. Of course, that's a little better than you normally would see on a pipeline project, and some of that is driven by the fact that we did have the competitive advantage of having a lot of that service being provided by the existing system. And so that allows for some higher returns than normal.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then last one for me is -- you sound now a little more bullish on the Gulf. Any thoughts on potentially affecting Gulfstar here? As you're getting close to completion of the first one, what's the opportunity set look like right now?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. Well, first of all, I'd tell you, one thing we are very excited about is the tie-backs that we're seeing to both Gulfstar One and to the original Devils Tower spar. And I'll remind you, those 2 facilities are very close together until there's a pretty nice area there that we can serve from those 2 spars, and we are seeing some nice tie-backs. And certainly, the Gunflint tie-back is a big boost to our expected economics for Gulfstar and came on much earlier in our assumptions. In our projects like that, we assume some tie-backs for the future, but this one came on much earlier than we had expected originally for that project. So that's very positive and of course, we've got a couple of tie-backs to Devils Tower as well. On the new spar front, we have many projects that were out there working, as you look out into the further reaches. I would tell you, we're pretty excited about some of the opportunities that we see to serve PEMEX with some of their big deepwater finds, which I'll remind you, are just south of our Perdido -- of the Perdido fold belt and our pipelines that go out to serve Shell's projects at Perdido Norte. So anyway, we're very seeing a lot of interest in the product, but we don't have any capital and guidance right now. We don't have enough confidence in those projects at this point, have any capital embedded in our guidance right now.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just maybe if you clean up questions, if I could. Alan, maybe going back to Bluegrass. If we get abandonment -- FERC abandonment in March, do you see that playing any type of catalysts? Would -- did anyone have any concerns over that as they may have with other alternative projects? And two, could you help us with any color, maybe, you saw from the international petchem community as far as going through Moss Lake and perhaps getting capacity on Bluegrass from that end?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. Well, those are both really astute questions. First of all, on the abandonment issue on Texas Gas, certainly, Boardwalk's in control of that issue, and I would defer that question to them. It's certainly at some point with the timing of that abandonment would certainly play into the decisions on Bluegrass. And the catalyst for a decision, we'll just say, we're not certain of the timing of that. And I think we certainly work closely with Boardwalk, but they've been working to manage that issue. But at some point, that would likely become an issue as abandonment word would come out and a decision would have to be made in terms of which direction to take there.", "On the question around the international players, lots of interests. A lot of a big interest, I would tell you, from a lot of international players. And I think there are some great strategic matchup there in terms of what we're trying to accomplish in the markets that we're trying to present for our producers in the Northeast. But I also would tell you the challenge to that is it is a very slow process in terms of working through all the approvals not within -- not regulatory or anything like that within the governance, within those very large multinational corporations. And so we're excited about it in strategy, but it's a long arduous process to gain approval on that. And so we're not waiting around, I would just put it that way. We're not waiting around for those approvals for moving on, but we do have a lot of exciting talks there. And we'll remain very excited about that strategically. But we've got to execute in the near term sometimes, and those parties can move, too.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. No, I appreciate the color. Two last questions, if I could. And understanding what the Canadian PDH, we haven't seen the first one yet. So I don't want unless I put the cart in front of the horse, but to the extent that my understanding was at the end of last year, we were looking at perhaps wooing 2 different companies, and that led into potential even assessing the twin of the project. Is that something that is still progressing? Or is it more at this point, let's get the first one locked up under construction, and then we'll, perhaps, assess a twinning at that point?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "A great question, Carl. I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take the question.", "John R. Dearborn", "Appreciate the question as well. Yes, the second PDH is certainly still a bright spot in our future that we want to keep our eye on. But I think you've got it exactly right that we need to have success with the first one, before we're ready really to take a big step into the second. The marketplace, though, is continuing to express great interest. In fact, the partner that we're talking with is interested in the second one as well. So just that person is interested, and then we've got an arms-length-long list of folks that have come and approached us about number 2. So I guess, I'll just say stay tuned. There's more future growth opportunity for us up in the Canadian franchise.", "Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then a final question, if I could. Maybe one for Don and understanding that is sort of one of the risks that were outlined, the insurance recoveries for Geismar and the risk of perhaps oversimplification. Is there any additional color to share that, say, for instance, of the $125 million second payment that should be coming this quarter? Can you express that in any terms of bid versus ask, of what you had requested from the insurance companies versus what they were comfortable at this point paying out?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Carl, the insurance paid 100% of our claim to date. So I think to date, they've paid the claim as filed, and I think we're pretty well paid up through the end of the year now. In fact, obviously, the business interruption loss mounts every month. So we'll continue to update the claims process and make requests for additional payments. We'll see where that takes us. But the actual claim is based on actual losses, so we can't expect to get paid for February until sometime after February ends, or -- March until after March ends and we know what the real price is. We're in the market, and therefore, the basis of our claim. So those will kind of tick off periodically.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "A couple of questions here. Alan and Don, on this call, you both commented a couple of times about being open-minded to transformational opportunities. But Don kind of emphasized the bar was set high for giving up that investment grade credit rating and also noted that WMB level free cash flow is already spoken for a bit in the near term. My first question is do you kind of see this ongoing internal discussions with investors being an ongoing long-term issue to keep in mind or something that's more of a 2014 catalyst?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I would just say -- it's a great question, Craig, thank you. But I -- we've always had our eyes open to any arbitrage that's available in the market and any additional value we can add to our shareholders to either transformational or structural changes. And as I mentioned earlier I don't think anybody can accuse us of not having been aggressive, and in fact, we've certainly been a leader in many of the structural changes over the last several years. And so we'll continue to look for those, and I think the drivers will be what the market is valuing and how our businesses are being best valued in the market, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as time goes by. So I don't -- unless there became a roadblock between a really good idea and what we are willing to do, that would be catalyst that might limit '14. I just don't see that. I think we're very well aligned with both Corvex and Soroban in terms of looking for the great value. I think their perspective is that we're well undervalued relative to marking to our peers. And that we've got the best growth story in the business, and we ought to be getting value better than our peers and not just at par with our peers. And so I think they see a huge value gap there. And I have to say, I share their perspective. And I'm very well aligned and will continue to work with them or anybody else that has good ideas on how we can achieve that value.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. I appreciate that, and a couple more. With Gulfstar One pending completion, do you see this completion -- successful, on-time completion, being a catalyst for other significant deepwater projects?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I would just tell you, I think our producers -- I think Hess and Chevron, and particularly, Hess discussed with some more visibility to them, are going to wind up, looking really smart on this project both in terms of the time that they brought their production to market. And the capital that they have tied up or the lack of capital they have tied up. So I think it's going to look like a really good project for them. It's going to look like a really good project for us because we're bringing in third-party volumes, and we're marketing the project for that. So I think when people sit back and analyze that, they're going to look pretty smart. I think Hess will want to do more business. Chevron want to do more business like that, and I think their peers will be pressured to do that kind of businesses as well. So I think this is a smart solution out there, and certainly, it gives -- we'll continue to gain confidence in our ability to execute on these kind of projects, as well as the producing community.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. And last 2 small ones. Can you provide some more color on that $20 million Petchem Services pipeline project write-off? And as a follow-up to Abhi's question about long-term commodity price outlook, and I know this is going out a bit. But if we are thinking maybe nat gas and even ethane pricing, especially could be a headwind towards the end of the decade, would you consider leading up to that, balancing out your short positions by expanding midstream processing POP exposures through development or acquisition or new processing?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "First question on the write-off in the Petchem Services, that was related to an NGL extension up in the Northeast, a line extension that, through some potential partnering arrangements, we don't think we need any longer. And so we found a better solution than the investment that we've made in the right away and so forth developing the project. So that's the first one. And then secondly, on the commodity price outlook, certainly, the natural gas pricing is one that is kind of bittersweet for us in the short term. It will put pressure on our NGL margins and therefore, ultimately, on the ethylene spread as well, as ethylene prices, as you mentioned. But the good news is, and I think this is very positive news, is that just as we stated, we're really trying to move it forward to being a volume-driven company, and with this shot in the arm for the producers, the gas and the NGL prices that we think are going to spur additional drilling and additional volumes into our system. And so frankly, I think it's very -- long-term, very healthy for our business. In terms of contract restructuring, I think you'll see that we continue to restructure into -- away from the business. And if you look at how rapidly our fee-based business is growing over the period, it's tending to push out the importance of those NGL margins. And so we're always looking to try to reduce the risk in exposure, but it has to be done with an eye towards really the expected net present value versus the commodity risk. And so -- but we're always looking to do that. We see great value in more and more predictable cash flows, and so we're always working towards that.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "I guess, my question there was a little more focused on an appetite even if the individual investment is not as high-return, in balancing out your commodity exposures longer-term. So you have a little less volatility. So in other words, would you be willing to go into fresh midstream commodity exposed operations that would balance out your existing risks.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I would say that I don't see adding POP contracts as reducing risks all that much frankly. And so I would say you'd see us investing in more fee-based investments. I think POP is a different kind of risk, but I really don't see it balancing out all that much risk. We do have some contracts that will reduce risks like our Laurel Mountain contract with Chevron that's a percent of gas. And that does, but that's not just limited to the processing business that's on the gathering business as well. So we certainly will look to those kind of opportunities that reduce our exposure to natural gas but not necessarily adding length and exposure to NGLs.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of follow-ups. For the Atlantic Sunrise project, do you anticipate that 7x multiple at the start? Or is there a stairstep in the commitments to get to the full capacity?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No, that is both initial and end of term revenues. So that's fully contracted from day 1.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then also for the planned Canadian drop-down. Any change in the target multiple? I think you previously mentioned around 7x.", "John R. Dearborn", "Sharon, we said less than 7x, and I think we're in that same zip code.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And I guess, given the recent news on Boardwalk, do you anticipate that this could have an impact or bearing on shippers' decision to commit to Bluegrass? Or maybe on the way you would like to structure the JV as the project goes forward?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. Just to remind you -- and I'm certainly going to be careful. I do not to speak for Boardwalk here, but I will tell you that Boardwalk has been very clear with us from the inception and have certainly recently reiterated that Loews really stands behind the bulk of their capital commitment. And so we did not worry the recent reduction in their distribution and the impact that's had on the company. So we -- we're very excited to have them as a partner. They've been a great partner to work with, and we really don't see any issues there because of they've got such strong backing from Loews on the project.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Timm Schneider with ISI Group.", "Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just -- I was wondering if you guys can maybe discuss what you're seeing in terms of operating cost creep in some of your different service areas. So if I look at Northeast, for example, volumes and revenues were up pretty nicely, I think, 18% sequentially, but that didn't really push through to the bottom line. Was this just kind of onetime issues? Or is there something else going on?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "It really -- Timm, thanks for the question. It really is -- has been a lot of onetime issues. We also have allocated quite a bit of cost the way we allocate kind of our support services across the company. Those get allocated on both the capital and a revenue basis, and so the cost of them coming up directly with those allocations as well. But for the most part, the real issue was a bunch of onetime matters in terms of write-downs and so forth that on various assets. And frankly, we're kind of cleaning up what's been a pretty fast-paced period up there. And I would tell you, as we move forward, Jim Scheel and his team are going to be very focused on operational excellence and really fine-tuning our cost structure up there. So I'm very confident in our team's ability to do that. If you look at our overall cost structure across the entire company, you'll actually see that, that actually -- between our O&M and G&A, actually, reduced a little bit from 12% to 13%, which is pretty impressive, considering the amount of growth that we've been managing. So I'm very confident in our team's ability to get after cost and get those in line. But we've certainly been trying to make sure we got some of the reliability problems behind us and for the benefit of our customers and because we saw that as kind of a job one. And I think we've done that and reliability has been very, very impressive over the last 6 to 7 months. But it's come at some expense to get it there, and I think that's a lot of what you're seeing right now.", "Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And as a follow-up, can you guys just discuss maybe your preliminary funding plans for Atlantic Access? Are you kind of happy with the $2.1 billion, I guess, CapEx outlay at this point, or would you consider selling some of that balance to another party?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. I don't think we would be planning on selling that down. It's part of the Transco system and as a result of that, it's not an individual project, the way like a Constitution project is. So Constitution is not part of the Transco system, and it allows for that, but being part of Transco makes that a little more difficult.", "Donald R. Chappel", "Yes. We like the risk return profile there, and again, most of that capital is in 2017. The amount of capital for 2017 is pretty modest. So it puts it out in a period where we'll have a lot of capacity and be looking to make big investments.", "Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Lastly, for me, on Constitution. I guess, what are some of the big moving parts around the in-service date, whether it's going to be kind of end of '15 or early '16? And how are some of the conversations going with producers in that part of the woods?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, that -- the Constitution system is fully contracted as you know. And so the discussions are really more around what all we can do jointly to accelerate the permitting process. And really, the permitting is the issue. As I mentioned earlier, the FERC has certainly been constructive, and they are pushing things along. But there are some permitting requirements in the state of New York that, for various reasons, can be a bit of a barrier. And frankly, I think we just got to work towards the right resolutions that meets everybody's needs on that. And I feel we'll remain confident that we can do that, I think it's very clear, politically, that the infrastructure is desperately needed to serve the New England markets. And I think that bringing that to life, clearly and firmly, will help bring some reason to getting past some of the permit issues that we're facing right now.", "Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So was that more at the state level? Or was it actually land owners challenging rights of ways?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. It's state permitting issues.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I hate to beat a dead horse, but if could just go back to sort of the response that you guys have to the activism in the market and your stock. Is there going to be like a formal response from you guys, from all you guys, to the activist shareholders' sort of demands? Or is there going to be any change in the board over the next several months? I know that there were some requests by the activists to take board seats, too. So just wondering is there a timeline when you have to respond to them or put out a formal sort of response and discuss sort of what are the strategic options or at least adopt the strategic options that they're recommending?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes. Well, really, the only thing they really asked for at this point is the board seats. And so that's where the discussions have centered, frankly. And as you noted, we -- I'm sure we put out an 8-K announcing that we had expanded or extended the window for nomination post this call in our 10-K release. And that really was to eliminate any disclosure kind of risk and really allow the parties to have a more thorough discussion post that information being out there. So I think you should see that as very accommodating on the company's part and very interested in continuing those discussions.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Is there sort of a time line when sort of these discussions and you guys all present your sort of findings to the market? Or is it sort of just ongoing?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "I would say it's ongoing, and certainly wouldn't try to speak for Corvex and Soroban. But I think from Williams' standpoint, we certainly are interested to reengage in the discussions. And again, just given the timing that we were up against the window closing ahead of a 10-K and our earnings release, we just wanted to make sure that we didn't -- that the compliance issues were first and foremost in the attendance of the various issues we need to deal with there.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And then going back to the funding on Atlantic Sunrise. So do you guys envision sort of issuing sort of pick [ph] units in the future for -- to fund the equity on this project? Or do you think that you are -- the cost of equity will be low enough that WPZ to sort of to move forward with the common equity offering?", "Donald R. Chappel", "Faisal, one is that the significant funding is on a long way out. As I mentioned, the bulk of it is in 2017. So -- and we would expect the WPZ cost of capital to improve significantly, particularly as we -- as Alan cited here, we've got a lot of projects that we -- are expected to go in service here in '14 and '15, which will really boost WPZ cash flow and coverage. And as we do that and the coverage comes back to a -- I'll call it a more attractive level, we would expect WPZ will trade in line with fundamentals. So I'd say, we're optimistic that WPZ will come back in line here over the next year or so.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies.", "Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I guess, first, Don if you could talk about maintenance CapEx. I realize in the prepared remarks you talked about some synergies that were realized in 4Q that led to the improved spend versus what you were guided in the third quarter. But I'm just wondering a bit more about that, given that we didn't see any change in '14 or '15 guidance, is that more of just a onetime synergy? And if so, what's sort of additional color around it?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Let me take that, if I could, please. This is Alan. I think, first of all, the -- a couple of drivers to that. We have a lot of maintenance capital items that had been driving a lot of the costs in '11 and '12. So they were Clean Air Act issues. There was a lot of required inspections on the pipeline to be done by a certain period, smart pig inspections. And so we got a lot of that out of the way. If we also -- if you think about reducing risk on your systems and your asset integrity issues, you always want to hit the systems that have the most risk on them first. And I would just tell you that our costs have been based just assuming that we would continue to find the same number of anomalies on our systems, as we completed those smart pigging and some of the hydro testing. And in fact, as we've gotten further down the profile and the lower-risk assets, we've had less and less dig outs. We've had less and less repairs required, and so that has driven some of that out. In terms of -- so if you were the team that's responsible for that asset integrity work, when you do your forecasting for that, you go in assuming you're going to have a certain amount of digs and certain amount of anomalies to clear. And if you don't find them, then those costs don't show up. Certainly, the big cost is in the repairs of that. So that's one item. And certainly -- and because we had such rough winner out West, in particular, towards into the November and December time frame, it did slow down some of the works that we would have done in that period and would have expected to get done in the fourth quarter. And so a little bit of that'll get pushed in to '14. But it's not like you miraculously have a bunch of new capacity to get the work completed, so that tends to get pushed out into '15 as well. And so I would just tell you that we haven't backed off it all in terms of maintaining the integrity of our systems and spending the right money. We've just been very fortunate that a lot of the early work that we did was on some of our pipelines that we did most reconditioning, and as we moved into the less -- or the newer parts of our system and areas that we've had less issues, our costs are coming down as we do that pipeline inspection and asset integrity work.", "Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Great, Alan. That's very helpful. As you think about the '14 and '15 programs, and just as a quick follow-up, in what you have planned for asset integrity. Might there be upside opportunities like what you mentioned when you find less there than what you think, given where you're moving to? Or is it kind of entirely a different aspect of the system?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. I think we're having a hard time, really, believing we're going to get that fortunate on a repeated basis. And so I would just tell you our assumptions haven't baked that in at this point, but certainly, that possibility exists, but we just haven't baked that in at this point. Secondly, I would tell you an area that may be an impact on that would be around well-connect capital. Again, this isn't built-in. Because we're seeing gas prices and NGL prices move up so nicely, we may see more drilling coming on, which might increase our well connect capital towards the last half year. We love spending that money due to the degree that's producing revenues for the future. But nevertheless, given the way we account for maintenance capital, we would include that well connect capital as maintenance capital.", "Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And I think that actually drills down to rather nicely out to questions I have on the West segment, Alan. We saw the ethane equity volumes come down again in a big way in 4Q. Obviously recognized, rejection's been something we grapple with all year. But I was curious, 2 questions out there. One, if there's something in particular that drove the change in 4Q that can be sort of isolated and highlighted? And then two, as I think about '14 and '15, with the commodity construct we're seeing today, if you've had any sort of revised views around the volume could be out there. I did see WPX had numbers out last week, calling some increased numbers out of their Piceance program, for example. Sort of how that might translate into what you guys are expecting out late?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great question. Let me ask Allison Bridges take that question.", "Allison G. Bridges", "Yes. We did have some -- a little bit of anomalies, I think, in the fourth quarter in that we were -- third parties were actually continuing to recover. And so we were actually giving them some of our equity ethane, which was a positive thing from our financial standpoint. And additionally, we did have a contract that terminated at the end of the third quarter. So those 2 things caused a rather large drop in the fourth quarter. We have been seeing some declines in volumes. As you said, we are starting to see some good signs with increase in gas prices, as well as WPX announcing that they were adding rigs. So we do believe that a little bit out in the guidance period, we're going to start to see arresting of some of those declines.", "Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Great, very helpful. One final follow-up for me. Just to dovetail on what Timm had asked earlier about costs. Alan, we did see a very strong bead relative to your guidance in Atlantic-Gulf. Obviously, some cost creep continued into the Northeast. You had mentioned, as you have in earlier quarters, about sort of this week calibration or reallocation of costs more towards the Northeast given the activity. Was any of that present in the fourth quarter? Or is that sort of -- have we reached run rates we should expect from here?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. And just so you know, I mean, I think if you're just focused on the Northeast segment, you'll see movement. If you're looking at the total cost structure, you won't see that much movement as it relates to that allocation because it's basically just pulling cost out of area where there's less activity and less growth, and it's being applied again. That's done on a modified mass basis, which basically takes in as a primary allocation is the capital invested and the revenues. And so as both the capital invested and the revenues grow there, it will shift more costs to there. That doesn't necessarily mean that the cost of that business directly is going up, but it just is the way and the method that we allocate cost across the business. And of course, we need to do that because we have regulated assets in our businesses as well, and so we need to make sure that we keep proper tallies on how we allocate those costs, and we keep constant method going on how we do that. So to answer your question, as you'll probably continue to see some allocated costs even though, I would tell you, in terms of the lack of operating profit performance in the Northeast for the fourth quarter, very little of that was driven because we are already expecting that cost allocation. A lot of the drivers, really, a bunch of onetime issues that we had in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned earlier.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Becca Followill with the U.S. Capital Advisors.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "On Atlantic Sunrise, are these 1.7 Bcf a day capacity incremental to the, call it, throughput on the system that's really running from south to north?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Yes.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "So it doesn't reverse flow on any of the system to cannibalize the existing system? Or is it all incremental?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Well, I think if you just looked at our initial flows back then and you looked at our initial flows after the project is done, those 2 numbers are additive.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "So it won't displace any of the existing, roughly, 60% of contracts that you have rolling off by 2016?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "No. The -- where the product -- projects are going and deliveries for it will be incremental. And so I think you could -- really, if you think about it, it's the amount of gas going off the system that you would see. And so while you may see the benefit of physical displacement allow us to increase our capacity, so in other words, we don't have to go build as much capital as you normally would think to get incremental volumes because you've got gas coming from both directions. The volumes leaving the system will increase by that amount.", "Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division", "And then on Bluegrass, when should we expect a go or no-go decision?", "Alan S. Armstrong", "As we mentioned earlier, we're still in those discussions, and I don't really think we should pin that down. But -- because frankly, it's some really big commitments, and we think it's the right project, and it's taking some time to get people to make those huge and long-term commitments. But I'm really not willing to put a specific time line on that at this point, Becca.", "Operator", "And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.", "Alan S. Armstrong", "Great. Thank you, Dana. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. We remain very excited about the tremendous growth that we've got ahead of us. And a lot of the big capital investments, as I mentioned really on the backs of a lot equity, are really start to come in to '14. We're pleased with the performance we saw for the fourth quarter and particularly pleased with some of the operational reliability improvements that we're seeing across the systems. And so we look forward to talking to you in the future and continuing to talk about the great growth story we have here at Williams.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Porter", "Thank you Rochelle. Good morning and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday\u2019s press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages, the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.", "In addition to Alan, we also have the four leaders of our operating areas with us, Jim Scheel leads our Northeastern G&P operating area, Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area, Rory Miller leads our Atlantic Gulf area and John Dearborn leads our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to any questions.", "In yesterday\u2019s presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we\u2019ve reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great. Good morning John and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Certainly the second quarter was very exciting for Williams as we seized the opportunity to make an important acquisition that moved us closer to fulfilling our vision of being a premier provider of reliable large scale infrastructure that really has become very clear to everybody that this kind of large scale infrastructure is going to be absolutely critical to allow North America to take advantage of its fast natural gas resources. We also rapidly accelerated our earlier stated plans of establishing WMB as a pure-play G&P hold-co and continue to lead the space and dividend growth by very wide margin.", "At WPZ, we had another strong quarter with operation performance being in line with our expectations and driving a 30% increase in distributable cash flow at WPZ. We also enjoyed great progress in execution on a number of very important projects in the second quarter, a tremendous amount of work going on in the organization on this front and just to name a few and you really only hear about the very largest projects, but a tremendous amount of efforts going on across the organization, but just to name a few Gulfstar, Keathley Canyon, the condensate stabilizer at Oak Grove and Ohio Valley Midstream area, the new ethane line which is being completed in the OVM area and we also started construction finally on the Rockaway Beach Lateral after a very long and drawn out permitting process.", "So for those of you there in the New York you look at see some of that work going on in fact on the front of our slide you see some picture of that. So that\u2019s going to allow us to bring that project in on schedule as well. So a lot of very big projects that we made tremendous progress on and remain on schedule on some of those major projects.", "We also saw continued strong demand for our services with two significant new market pull projects on Transco that were fully contracted and I think it\u2019s becoming pretty evident that Transco discontinues to line up these hits and I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s not slowing down in terms of continued business development opportunities just keep coming at us in that business line.", "The Marcellus area volumes continued their rapid growth as well with a 31% increase in gathered volumes as compared to last year\u2019s 2Q volumes and we are on track once again to lead the industry on volume growth in the Marcellus this year.", "Our Geismar E&C efforts were in line with plan and our rebuild was completed last week. Our final efforts on the expansion will be done by the end of next week. So our E&C team, our engineering and construction team is wrapping up and moving out as we now are turning that important solely over to our operations team.", "Unfortunately and certainly this is something we\u2019re all very disappointed around here with, but unfortunately did find a new concern there at Geismar that is going to require enhancement to our safety systems that we expect to cause about a six to eight week delay in the first sale at that point at Geismar.", "As I mentioned this is certainly disappointing to us but as difficult as this is, I\u2019ll tell you, I am proud of the fact that our organization will always put a safety of our people first and this is certainly just our organization following those words with action by having the courage to pause and do the right thing in terms of making sure that, that plan is as safe as possible.", "So even though this is an out of the norm situation here, I know this is such a big issue, I really would like to take you back to the appendix and if you look back on, I believe it is slide 14 in this deck and we\u2019ll move that on our webcast even though it is out of order here.", "You will see that on slide 14, we show the incredible progress that has been made on the expansion and the rebuild and the pre-commissioning efforts which were all but complete and will be complete at the end of next week in terms of getting all of our systems turned over to operations. So what does that mean, it basically means systems like our steam systems, all of our auxiliary systems and we break those down in to about 62 different systems and as those are mechanically complete, we turn them over to our operations team for them to take control of those facilities.", "And so we were finalizing some of the release valve study that was required as a result of the event of June 13th, we determined and were frankly a bit surprised but determined that there was another scenario that we needed to be prepared for in the event of a blow down or the event of an error at the plant and the malfunction of the plant.", "And that assumption that we embedded has required us to do go back and study the press release system and we determine as we did that that we actually had to make some further modification to the relief valve system again certainly a tough decision to do that, but again I think absolutely the right line when it comes putting a safety ahead of anything else in our business.", "So you can see here in July 31, we are started on that relief valve system and modifications, we had a lot of this, the plant already buttoned up and in many cases lot of the systems were dried out, we haven\u2019t open the system back up now and so that introduces moisture into the system.", "So when you see that plant dry up, it\u2019s basically backing up on some of the systems that we had already turned over. And so we think the relief valve system modifications will take about seven weeks and in parallel that as we start to complete, button up some of those systems will start to dry out and will start tuning up some of the cracking furnaces there and so that\u2019s the second blue part that you see they are called plant dry out and hydrocarbon introduction.", "And then finally moving us to a first week in October as we start to get into ethylene production and so one of the things I would like to clear here that is certainly our target. We think that is a very achievable target, but in terms of our financial projections, just given the number of issues we face there we have spread that contingency up and basically we have the range in our financials now just basically starting with that first ethylene production running through the end of the year and so that\u2019s the range of outcomes that we\u2019ve got to built into guidance now.", "So we are building ourselves some additional contingencies in there beyond what our targeted date is there. So that\u2019s our detail and we\u2019ll be happy to take any questions on that later John Dearborn will be here to help address in that as well.", "Moving on now to the rest of the presentation and on the Slide seven, it\u2019s really a impressive growth numbers continue to be posted were both WPZ and ACMP and that continues to drive very impressive cash flow growth at Williams and this is especially impressive when you consider that in the second quarter, we only recognize about two months of business interruption coverage there Geismar.", "And so our fee-based revenues in the quarter continue to steady march up into the right and despite a very mild second quarter in terms of any weather on our pipeline systems, we still continue to move that up about 7% over 2Q of last year on our fee-based revenues and I think also important were well over 80% of our reported net revenues were coming from fee-based services.", "It also should be understood much of the big capital investments that we\u2019ve been making here really over last two and half, three years, don\u2019t start producing cash flow until the third quarter and fourth quarter of the year as Gulfstar, Keathley Canyon and our OVM or Ohio Valley Midstream investment really began to generate significant cash flow and earnings here in the last half of the year.", "And then of course ACMP continues, it\u2019s very steady progress up into the right as this group continues to benefit from its very tight focus on growing the gathering the compressions business in the nations very best natural gas basins. So I\u2019m very pleased with the way the business is continuing to expand and we\u2019ve got a really exciting last half of the year in front of it.", "Now looking at some of these important growth drivers that we continue to focus on and report to our investors. One item of significance been added to this was you will see there at the bottom is the ACMP acquisition and in terms of results, pretty impressive work by our finance and legal teams this last second quarter moving from price agreement with GIP all the way to closure within a matter about five or six weeks. So very impressive work by that team and just continues to shine light on the kind of town we have around here and our commitment to continue to drive shareholder value here at Williams.", "And so this was, the half year represents a tremendous amount of effort really across the whole organization and with the exception of Geismar we are very pleased with the results on the store card here as we pause here in first part of third quarter. Now there is certainly many E&C projects that are nearly complete and now we are beginning to turn our attention on the next waiver projects that just keep coming, things are very well positioned assets and the competitive advantages that we constantly focus on developing.", "I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s a very natural part of the way we run the business here at Williams and a lot of these major large scale projects that we take on and the challenges that we take on really are in support of making sure we maintain strong competitive advantages in our business.", "So moving onto Slide nine and looking forward here to this next waiver project, we see that this list is long and it just keeps coming. The bulk of the large projects in 2015 come from our Atlantic Gulf region that continue to perform very well, Atlantic Gulf region continues to execute and continues to hit this number on a regular basis.", "And we certainly are, as we look here at the projects in \u201815, many of these are really in the major projects are expansions of our Transco and our gas pipeline system in the Atlantic Gulf area, projects like Kodiak for instance really are capital led to tie back to an existing facility and we do have continued what we call program capital as we continue to build up northeast GMP but a bulk of our major projects have really in the northeast, a lot of that is getting out of the way this year and we\u2019ve really set ourselves up for a lot of big fundamental growth looking forward beyond 2014 in the northeast.", "The major projects in 2017 really come on light in the year but our backlog of projects beyond 2017 just keeps building and you really should expect this to continue for some time as we bring the combined strength of both WPZ and ACMP now and bring those resources together and the opportunities that they combination brings really is going to be critical as the nation here tries to get up on a 100 Bcf natural gas market. We think Williams and the combined entity is going to be very much at the forefront of reaching that 100 Bcf today gas market here in the U.S.", "So moving to Slide 10, I\u2019m kind of looking at the big picture of what this new MLP would be, we are, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about, not only the size, the scale of this MLP, but the very consistent focus on being the player in the natural gas phase and natural gas products and derivatives they are coming out of this big road to natural gas and we think the combination of Williams access just continues to load us towards more and more growth, just some important things to note on here that are very impressive in 2015 and expected EBITDA of about $5 billion and in addition to that continued best in class growth distribution of 10% to 12%, which is really impressive when you consider the scale and what it takes to grow the cash distribution in this business and something of this scale.", "And so continuing to be able to do that through 2017 and maintain strong coverage really provide an investment vehicle that we think is absolutely unmatched and is going to continue to give us the kind of firepower to continue to expand this business larger and larger.", "So, couldn\u2019t be more excited about the combination of this business and if you look on slide 11, this really conveys the breadth here that Williams has but it also shows really what ACMP is doing for us in the upstream piece of our business and if you think about the way, we have genuinely grown a lot of our businesses over the year, we basically have linked and levered either the market back into the upstream or we have taken the upstream and the gathering & processing business and move those opportunities downstream certainly nothing is more obvious about how we have done that in recent times, you know many times over the years nothing is more obviously than the way that\u2019s is going for us up in the Susquehanna supply area and the ability that we have generated may large projects off of about brig upstream growing volumes there.", "So, if you look at that and think about ACMP today on a operated gathering volumes PZ and ACMP are every close to the same number and if you look it on a capacity basis WPZ is larger part of that just because of the legacy large scale assets that we have had out in the Western basins.", "But nevertheless very impressive position in the gathering space upstream and our ability continue to deliver services and link that to service opportunities for our customers downstream this basically just reloads our set of opportunities in continuing to grow that, I can tell you didn\u2019t feel like we needed a lot of that but nevertheless I have got a lot of confidence in not just the assets but the combination of the people of ACMP and Williams, there is some incredible strengths at ACMP that frankly we are very excited to have hitched to our wagon and a lot we can learn frankly from expanding the upstream gathering business and a great job they have done there and what PZ brings to that of course is the ability to continue to expand opportunities beyond that. So, tremendous strategic fit as well as a great financial for Williams and WPZ.", "So, moving on to slide 12 here, really couldn\u2019t be more excited about how we are positioned strategically right now and thrilled to see the ACMP piece come along, it further fills our hand out and this scale and the opportunity set that we have and the growth that we have, we think is unmatched.", "And we have a very fired up organization I can tell you right now, very excited to take on these new opportunities both at the ACMP level and at the Williams level. So, very excited about the quarter, disappointed with Geismar but extremely excited about the second half of this year and the kind of growth we are going to get to witness here in the second half of the year.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And first we\u2019ll hear from Christine Cho with Barclays.", "Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Good morning everyone.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning Christine.", "Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Your other fee revenues in the Northeast doubled quarter-over-quarter even though NGL production didn\u2019t change that much. I am assuming that this is the condensate handling that came on during the quarter. When did that come on and how much of the 6,000 barrels per day capacity are you using currently?", "Alan Armstrong", "Jim can you take that please?", "James Scheel", "Sure, Christine good to talk to you again. That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s the stabilizer fee revenue and the stabilizer came on, it was 50% of the stabilizer I should say came on you can see we have the first phase of 6,000 barrels a day come on in April of this year.", "Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And that how much of that capacity are you currently using?", "James Scheel", "We are using about half of that today and that\u2019s growing as additional wells come online. We have got about 73 wells coming online for the balance of the year.", "Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And then if you\u2019re GPM of the gas is 8 or something like that how much of that is condensate is 10% is a fair assumption?", "James Scheel", "I am not 100% sure on that Christine I had to get back with you but I think that\u2019s pretty close, it is probably in the 8% to 12% but I don\u2019t know exactly that number.", "Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s fine. Also the de-ethanizer getting moved up by a quarter. Did this impact volumes in second quarter at all meaning did anyone have to shut in wells because the gas wouldn\u2019t meet pipeline respect with ethane in it?", "James Scheel", "No, we haven\u2019t had any of those issues right now although that continues to be concern a Christine. The de-ethanizer had no impact in the second quarter, actually even if it had been online we wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to move ethane because of some other downstream issues, we are right now working to commission that asset and it should be up during the third quarter.", "Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. And then Alan or Don I think you have told in on a prior call that you guys have \u2013 your first refusal came into \u2013 it came in energy too JV position but what about on the ACMP side you know there are some partners who are backed by private equity in E&P companies who may or may not want to a minority owner in such assets in the longer term and I would think that they would want to monetize at some point with the combined ACMP/WPZ MLP have any first rates there?", "Alan Armstrong", "You know I am not sure what the confidentially terms are for ACMP on that issue. So, we\u2019d rather not comment on what their rights are there I would just simply say that we do feel like we are very well positioned to consolidate a lot of those assets in the Utica there I am pretty excited about Blue Racer \u2013 what our opportunities to consolidate look like there?", "Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. And then while I think its consensus opinion that the first part of the deal of ACMP is accretive I think there is some confusion in the market as to whether or not the second part of the deal adds to that accretion or chips away a little from that accretion is there any clarification you can provide?", "Donald Chappel", "Christine its Don. Since the merger is currently being negotiated or about to be negotiated between the two partnerships I don\u2019t want to go too far on this. But certainly the way we styled it Williams would take reduced cash flow in the early period and enjoy higher cash flows, higher growth beyond so, likely mildly dilutive initially and then turning around pretty quickly.", "Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll next move to Shneur Gershuni with UBS.", "Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS", "Hi, good morning guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS", "Alan in your prepared remarks you talked about market pull of projects and so forth it seems to have come to fruition during the quarter. I think in your slides you had said that you got about a backlog of 25 billion at WPZ and another 4 billion at Access. Any sense on how large this backlog could potentially grow in terms of order of magnitude, are we talking in the neighborhood of 10% to 20% or are we talking to something significantly higher assuming you are able to commercially negotiate some projects and so forth?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, you know I think a couple of thoughts on that. One, we may actually see a lot of opportunities that come to us that require less capital so, higher earnings and better return but less capital as we look at opportunities between the two. So I would just say the opportunities may not be measured in capital and will be measured in earnings growth.", "But I will just tell you that the number of opportunities that just keep coming at us along the Transco system and on the northwest pipeline system as the market continues on the demand side to try to figure out how to take advantage of all this low cost gas and continued confidence in low cost gas is pretty impressive that given what a deficit we had in storage this year and we are sitting in sub 4 gas price really tells you the confidence that the demand side has and the supply capabilities, the long-term supply capabilities of the gas basins. But what that\u2019s developing is a lot major downstream project", "And so I would tell you, I think a lot of our growth is actually going to come from that and our ability to connect the supplies into those opportunities and of course all of that new gas supply leads in to both natural gas liquids and olefins as well as we produce that gas we got to something with the liquids and find market to those liquid.", "So, I would tell you rather than the ACMP combination driving a lot of capital increases, I would say it\u2019s slightly going to drive in the northeast, it will drive some higher earnings but perhaps I don\u2019t know that it will reduce our capital but I would say a lot of it would be just higher earnings in here.", "Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS", "Great a couple of quick follow ups, we saw some ramps in volumes in the northeast and you didn\u2019t have any change to your 2015 guidance, is it fair to say that the way the northeast acted in the second quarter is exactly the way you wanted it to, it is running according your plan and you would expect to see a significant acceleration in 3Q and 4Q. I was wondering if you can sort of walk us through the ramp as to how we go from 1Q and 2Q of this year as to how we end up with kind of the guidance for 2015 in terms of where you expect the big pick up in ramp acceleration to\u2026?", "Alan Armstrong", "That\u2019s an excellent question and I\u2019ll tell you I am very excited what we are seeing there in the engagement I\u2019m going to ask Jim Scheel to provide a little more color on that, thank you for asking the question.", "James Scheel", "Yeah I\u2019ll answer that in a couple of phases. I think we are very excited about the progress we are making in the Susquehanna supply hub or ABA area. We are right on target and actually probably a little bit ahead of where we wanted to be. We have a lot of projects coming online during the third and fourth quarters of this year, they will be on time-on budget. We\u2019re growing those volumes by about 34% versus prior year as we come out of the year and quarter-over-quarter this year we\u2019re up 8%.", "So obviously we\u2019ve always wanted to do better up there and smash more gas in to the system but we\u2019re right on target with where we want to be. OBM has been a bit of a different story, it\u2019s very consistent with the last analyst day in the last earnings call.", "You can actually see on page 20 of the book that we\u2019ve lowered our average volumes for the year, that\u2019s primarily due to a number of producers having some challenges at the front end of the year and so we are seeing the way on wells coming online.", "But we will actually end the year higher, we adjusted the number for the year end at 420 and again as I\u2019d mentioned a bit earlier, we have a number of wells, we have lots of visibility on getting ready to come online.", "We have 73 wet Marcellus and in addition to that some dry Utica wells that\u2019s not included in that overall number that could actually add to some of the volume but obviously that will be at a bit of a lower rate. Our biggest issues right now as we look into the third quarter are commissioning the assets that will drive some incremental fee revenue, you\u2019ll see our fee revenues increasing and then just seeing when the producers tie those lines in.", "L&M is on target with where we expect for the most part and will end the year about 25% higher than last year as well. So, although there are challenges in the northeast that we\u2019ve been seeing around OVM on the producer side; the good news is unlike past discussions the assets seem to have the reliability in order to move the gas and we\u2019ll be able to meet our customers\u2019 needs as we go through the third and fourth quarter with the incremental processing options for them.", "Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS", "Great one last question if I may. Just if we can turn the Geismar obviously a disappointment that it wasn\u2019t able to start up on time so forth. I was just wondering if you can sort of elaborate a little bit on the safety issues, did it come up in the inspection process and sort of prevent a permit from being issued or is this something that you\u2019ve just decided to do over and above the process in all permits and everything is in place. I was just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color around the safety measures that are being enhanced?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah let me have John Dearborn take that, he\u2019s been right, square in the middle of that.", "John Dearborn", "And thanks for the question, very insightful question the way you ask it. And to take on the first part of your question as to whether it had something to do with the permits. I would say no not at all it rather to put it into some context for you, the overall \u2013 and in the overall plant there were more than 750 pressure safety valves throughout that plant and on a regular basis you go through and you study all the pressure scenarios on these various pieces the equipment and how these valves are expected to control over pressure circumstances and prior to the incident and then of course as a result of the incident we were doing over pressure studies and they were being done in a very prioritized way and a very careful way as well.", "We have to be very deliberate, very disciplined in how we go about doing this work. And the work, it progressed extremely well, some of the valves just to give you an idea, some of the valves get studied and we said okay the valve is fine and you put the documentation to the file about how the valve has been restudied and no further work was needed.", "In the prioritization we left several studied valves towards the end of the study and it until early in July as the study was finishing up the team came to learn of a particular scenario that truly required mitigation.", "So as we came to learn of that, the team considered several strategies that could have potentially worked in the circumstance and determine that the best solution we could have applied was to install several new PSVs and just so you understand the number of several is really about 12 PSVs are being installed and to replace several sections of piping.", "Now it happens that the full impact of this essentially new work on our schedule is not known until earlier this week and frankly it\u2019s what resulted in this disappointing disclosure today but I just want to reiterate once again that we\u2019re taking this extra precaution here to enhance the safety of our workers and the public and I hope that provides some adequate colors everyone on the phone about this entire issue that we\u2019re grappling with as we move forward toward the safe and sustainable restart the plant.", "Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS", "Great that was extremely helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll move next to Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi good morning. Just kind of following up on Geismar there really quick. I was just wondering if you guys can discuss a little more at length kind of what the drivers of your range is in terms of for first ethylene production and what could possibly delay this further?", "John Dearborn", "Sure glad to bring some color to that. So let\u2019s reflect again about what happened at the time of the incident, this plant went down in a very unusual and a hard way right. We had to take some unusual precautions and go through certain procedures in order to clean it out.", "And so certainly there could be some potential risks related to some of the equipment as a result of way it had gone down. Secondarily I would say there\u2019s always a concern that exists around restart of a plant especially when it\u2019s been extended.", "Now as to whether the systems as designed and as reinstalled work, take for instance rotating equipments, sometimes you have to go in and look at the rotating equipment a second time. Now that\u2019s historically happened to us, from time to time it doesn\u2019t, we don\u2019t know anything today that says we should have an unusual worries on the startup, so I have nothing that I know of at the moment but with an abundance of caution we thought it was appropriate to guide that, that the start-up is not risk free once we are through this next round of installation of pressure safety release valves and that\u2019s the entirety of the story behind the contingency range that we put around that start-up.", "Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Got it, and Don I was just wondering if you could just update us on your discussions with the insurance companies and your recovery expectations and kind of once we get into this outer period where you be above your business interruption, insurance, how you are kind of thinking about that and how that\u2019s kind of baked into guidance?", "Donald Chappel", "Let\u2019s say that now that the plant is substantially complete from a construction standpoint and we\u2019re moving very quickly and toward the start-up most the facts are now very well-known and obviously we\u2019ll continue to update our claim as we move through start-up.", "We\u2019ve retained some expert consultants, if you will that are doing studies to support our claim. We plan to present those studies and conclusions to the insurers in the fall and we would be hopeful that, that would then start the next round of settlement discussions.", "Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And in terms of I think you mentioned previously that you expected to use your ATM kind of in 2014 to be largely at the equity markets and \u201815 at PZ I mean you put out kind of share count applying some meaningful equity issuance in the back half of the year. I just want to make sure that was kind of still your expectation that you do any incremental equity on the ATM this year and you\u2019d be largely out of the markets at PZ next year?", "John Dearborn", "Brian that in fact is the case again our car financing plans is pretty well unchanged obviously the drop down of the Williams owned assets is another factor and we\u2019re looking to do that ideally post merger in the late \u201814 early \u201815.", "Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And then finally just I mean I think Cabot mentioned on their call some infrastructure issues that they were having which impacted their production in the quarter. I was wondering if you guys could just elaborate from your perspective what some of the issues were and kind of how the event resolves going forward?", "James Scheel", "This is Jim Scheel I\u2019ll comment on that again I listen to the earnings call too and I want to just reiterate, our performance quarter-over-quarter were 8% more than we were previous quarter and first quarter\u2019s 4% more than the year end.", "So we\u2019ve been continuing to grow volumes obviously, we have to do a fantastic job in coordinating volumes into this system. I think Cabot is probably relating more to the opportunities missed just by some coordination on scheduling gas because actually we were moving more than we have and again as the additional horsepower comes online during the third and fourth quarter this year, we\u2019re going to see a rather rapid ramp up so that we finish the year about 34% more. So again I appreciate the concerns of the shippers but we continue to put some more gas through that system and are only accelerating that as we end the year.", "Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And just finally from me, in terms of any update in terms of timing on the ACMP/WPZ negotiations, is there any update from most recent disclosure?", "Alan Armstrong", "Nothing new I would just tell you, the complex companies are working hard and have got, are very well advised and I think everybody understands the importance of moving ahead with it and with some diligence and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on right now.", "Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you gentlemen.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll move on to Abhi Rajnandan with Credit Suisse.", "Abhiram Rajendran \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi good morning guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning Abhi.", "Abhiram Rajendran \u2013 Credit Suisse", "In your data book outlook for WMB you show a revised outlook at the excess cash flow available you went after the dividend step up which is around 28% for year through 2016. And it sounds like the remaining part of the deal will be may be modestly dilutive upfront and accretive beyond that so I guess how should we think about the current and potentially more excess coverage being brought down overtime once the entire deal is done?", "Alan Armstrong", "Abhi again yes, we would expect some of that excess coverage to come off because one of the big considerations that Williams is making here is moving the distributions we received really took the ACMP schedule in terms of those ISR. So Williams is making I\u2019d call a concession there to enable the merger and we think that that\u2019s going to drive significant value long-term but certainly with some near term reduction in cash flows. However by \u201817 that really turns around we would expect to have a nice increase in accretion if you will, cash flow accretion on a per share basis. I hope that answers your question.", "Abhiram Rajendran \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yeah I know, that helps. And then just a couple of other quick ones, at WPZ you have a shortfall this year of about 400 million between the DCF and distribution. So I guess how should we think about how you make this up is this just with capital raises or do you need any sort of support from WMB, any color there would be helpful?", "Alan Armstrong", "We expect that WPZ\u2019s financing plan is largely intact. I think at midpoint here, we moved the cash flow about $150 million and as well we do have, and anticipate the litigation settlement that we would expect would largely offset that in terms of cash so we think not a lot of change there.", "Going back to the cash flow, your first question, I would point out that our 2017 to 2019 cash tax guidance is an assumed rate of 14% and we would expect that to come down somewhat as we continue to add to our capital spending, as you can see our capital spending is about $4 billion this year and it declines to 2 billion unchanged by 2016, it\u2019s because what we have in guidance is really sanctioned projects and we have a lot of projects, organic projects that we\u2019re working on, those are added to guidance and those projects are placed in service that will continue to press that cash tax rate down somewhat, so just consider that as building your models.", "Right now, our run rate seems to be about in the $4 billion range and if you take that 25 billion and divide it by the six years you get about $4 billion a year and that\u2019s pre-ACMP and they have been spending about $1 billion a year. So you can think about that as you think about our cash tax rate and while the rate looks to be fairly low remember that, that\u2019s based on cash distributions received and if you look at it on a percent of pre-tax income which is more conventional, you\u2019ll see the rates quite a bit higher.", "Abhiram Rajendran \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay got it that\u2019s helpful and then just last quick one from me. On the Canadian projects, can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving the shift back in CapEx and this is at the WMB and Petchem segment level, are these delays in locking down customers or just a slower than expected construction schedule, any color there would be helpful.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah great question and particularly the PDH project is what I assume you\u2019re referring to primarily and the other being the Syncrude and I would just tell you that, given the kind of increases that we are seeing in the Petchem space on engineering and construction side and the kind of demand we\u2019re seeing on labor and we expect to continue to press forward we are working very hard to not get ourselves in a difficult situation relative to schedule and to make sure that we are pushing away from that risk as much as possible in terms of overruns because we do, as we look forward we see a lot of pressure on the skilled labor that it\u2019s going to take the build out this infrastructure and so I would just tell you that we are making sure as we move forward in that we don\u2019t get ourselves in a position where we\u2019re relying upon thinner and thinner resources and lower and lower productivity and so that\u2019s the primary cause.", "Abhiram Rajendran \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay got it thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll move on to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc", "Thanks. Just sticking with sort of Petchem and I guess bigger picture, do you see being in the petrochemical business as a core competence for you or do you think it is maybe distracting you from some of the maybe bigger midstream activities that you have, should we read in6to this PDH, maybe delay something around there, there\u2019s some questions around what constitutes qualifying income I am just wondering if you can just talk about the value chain a bit more?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah sure. We continue to see the petrochem business as not, for William not being in the petrochem business for the sake of being in the petchem business frankly but really as a pull through and the market outlook for these NGL supplies and so certainly I would say it\u2019s a little bit different between Canada and the Geismar facility because in Canada really we pursued that many years ago because mostly that\u2019s a processing business we\u2019re not actually reforming any molecules there that\u2019s being done that the upgrades were simply above extracting that through typical cryogenic processing and then fractionating it just like we do in other sectors of our business.", "So in Canada I would tell you the competencies if you will are not very different and we have certainly got very strong competitive advantage there. But in both cases, Geismar and as we would move in the PDH, we continue to look at that as an outlook for products in a way for us to continue to provide market access for our customers that otherwise isn\u2019t showing up.", "So I would tell you that\u2019s how we think about it, and we certainly think about it in terms of being more fee based business. I think it is a very good question that you raised and certainly given the great number of opportunities that we have in front of us that\u2019s always an issue of capital allocation for us.", "And as part of the reason that as I just answered before, part of the reasons that we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t get ourselves into a difficult spot there in that piece of business because we do see a lot of pressure in getting that business built out particularly on the PDH facility.", "So in the end I would just tell you we continue to look at it as a place for us to expand market for us and for our customers I think it\u2019s very nice complement to the ethane link that we\u2019ve had for years and it\u2019s a good place to provide market for our customers. And that\u2019s kind of the extent of it in terms of how we look at it, we don\u2019t look it at as being in the petchem business to be a petchem player.", "Theodore Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc", "Understood that\u2019s very helpful. If I can just shift back to the Northeast, I am just wondering if you\u2019re seeing any reaction by the producers to some of the gas price volatility and sort of that the price decline that you have seen recently. And especially some of the regional basis issues that clearly people are still have in there. It sounds like the issues have been more sort of physical and tie-in challenges and what not, but is there any sort of bigger reaction from producers from the gas we are seeing in the Northeast.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, no and to be fair I would say that given the kind of recent push down in price that\u2019s just really just happened here, we\u2019ve had we\u2019ve doubts with it but it\u2019s really just push down here over the last month or so I would say it\u2019s a little bit early to call that frankly, but certainly the activities that we saw in the first half of the year are just now coming to fruition and there has been quite a flurry of activity on the drilling side both in the wet Marcellus to the dry Marcellus up in the North East and now starting with some of the dry Utica in the OVM area.", "And so in the first half of the year I would tell you that that\u2019s been pretty strong. I think it\u2019s a little bit early to call with this more recent weakness in natural gas if that\u2019s going to slow much of that down. But so far we certainly haven\u2019t seen any signs of that. And I would tell you I think the producers are getting, particularly in their OVM area are getting better and better at understanding what they\u2019ve got there and are more and more excited about it. So we\u2019ll see what happens, but I think it\u2019s a little bit early to say we have seen any kind of reaction at this point.", "Theodore Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc", "Okay. And then just last one from me on constitution, any update on sort of the regulatory and permitting process there?", "Alan Armstrong", "Not much to add there. I think we are very pleased with the way the FERC has continued to press forward on that and we are working hard to work with the New York DEC and communicate to them the importance of this infrastructure and the need to deal with the some of the water quality excuse me water crossing permits that the New York DEC has in their hands. So really kind a remains focused on that issue and I would say we\u2019ve made progress but we haven\u2019t solved that problem.", "Alan Armstrong", "Okay, thanks. That\u2019s it from me.", "Operator", "And next we move onto Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.", "Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Thanks good morning everybody. I think I\u2019ve just got two questions left and then now on understanding and appreciating your comments around the Canadian PDH facility and labor inflation like. I think prior we were thinking that maybe this could come to a hit by year end and so just trying to kind of getting a little bit more color on what you were saying earlier. Is this something that we should just kind a think of now as more just on the back burner more of kind of on hold or is that still progressing?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah not at all. There is tremendous amount of work, we have made great progress with the polypropylene take contract if you will that takes a quite a bit of price risk out of it. And I would just say both parties, both us and the party that have the polypropylene take are working diligently to make sure that we\u2019ve got great confidence in our estimates and the work plan it would take constructed in a low risk manner.", "But I\u2019ll tell you the work is probably at all-time high in terms of making sure that we are very confident of where we stand with the estimate and we do very much expect to conclude and have it pinned down by the end of the year. And so in no way you should consider it\u2019s on the back turn or it\u2019s just us absolutely making sure we de-risk it is as much as possible before we move forward.", "Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Understood. Appreciate the clarification. And then just last question and maybe this is on Geismar with respect to the pressure scenarios that were studied. Clearly ethylene plants are not like processing plans. So I guess it\u2019s not exactly a cookie-cutter approach here and what I am wondering is, is that to the extent that this plant has been rebuilt or perhaps studied now maybe with all the different scenarios that are out there from the safety standpoint, does this in anyway make Geismar, I hesitate to call it best-in-class because of what we have gone through, but as we kind of look forward from this point today, does that anyway help you distinguish yourself from other plants and then how ultimately does that perhaps help our hinder Geismar 2?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, Carl good question. I would say we certainly are coming out of this much stronger than we went into it both from an operational focus and reliability and we have worked hard to really improve the older plant as well as making sure that those learnings were built into the new plant as well.", "I would tell you that probably the fact that we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s been a right in the middle of a major construction project like this that\u2019s also looking at Geismar 2. And so it\u2019s not some distant memory of the lessons learned it\u2019s kind of real and available, puts us in a very knowledgeable position to push forward with Geismar 2 if that\u2019s what we choose to do.", "So I would say I am very thankful that we\u2019ve got a team that is, and this has been a really tough project if you think about it, if you\u2019re managing this major expansion project in the first place in and around a plant and then have the major explosion that isolates us from being able to complete the plant right in the middle of a project, that\u2019s a project managers worse nightmare. And yet they have hung with it.", "So I would just say we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s very schooled on what it takes to be successful as we look forward into Geismar 2 and certainly we all have a lot of confidence in pushing forward as we look to Geismar 2 opportunity.", "Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Great, appreciate the comments. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "And next we move onto Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.", "Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Hi good morning.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning Sharon.", "Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "John I guess with regards to the dividend illustration you provided. Those tax rates do you anticipate those cash tax rates to change materially if the ACMP/WPZ transaction occurs?", "Alan Armstrong", "No Sharon, we do not. So we don\u2019t expect that to change. The distributions will change somewhat so there will be some effect. But we wouldn\u2019t expect any material change in those tax rates as a result of that. I think right now they are driven largely by the placing assets and service.", "And we are in the middle of appraisal for both accounting and tax purposes. So there will be some adjustment of estimates along the way as we conclude both the accounting and tax appraisals to really key in this process.", "Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay. And then I guess just trying to gauge the potential for the exchange ratio to be renegotiated. Maybe if you could provide some color on some of the key factors, management considers when you determine the proposed exchange ratio?", "Alan Armstrong", "Sharon we did some extensive modeling and really trying to come to a transaction that we thing was value adding both ACMP and WPZ unit holders for let trying to balance the considerations there. So obviously a lot goes into it, but that really was the design criteria we wanted it to be a transaction that we thought would be beneficial to both partnerships, really trying to strike that balance and that\u2019s really what we put forth in our proposal.", "Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay. And just the last question. I guess given the IRS\u2019s scrutiny on some of the non-core \u2013 activities in PLRs. At this juncture, is there any concern regarding the PLR for Geismar?", "Alan Armstrong", "Not here, not at all.", "Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Alan Armstrong", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll we move on to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers", "Good morning guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers", "So back to Geismar 2 prospects. Any further updates around the markets capacity to provide long-term fixed return contracting versus commodity exposed returns?", "Alan Armstrong", "Don you want to take that.", "Donald Chappel", "Yeah. I am glad to take that. Thanks very much. Not much has changed since Analyst Day, so just to reiterate where we are there we\u2019ve got a very warm reception when we put our RFP out to the marketplace and our interest was oversubscribed quite significantly. What we are doing with this particular investment is we\u2019re essentially trading off that commodity margin to the buyer of gasoline to our joint venture partner in exchange for a fee for service opportunity for WPZ in total concert with our strategy. And certainly the markets appetite given recent and current ethylene prices is quite warm to a provider that\u2019s willing to provide on a fee per service basis. So we\u2019re seeing very, very warm reception both on the JV side and on the ethylene purchase side or fee-for-service type arrangements.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers", "Great. When do you see that, is that like a 2015 really 2015 period to try to true up some of those negotiations?", "Donald Chappel", "Yeah, we\u2019re going to work those negotiations through this year and into the early part of the next year I am sure. But I think the bigger emphasis here is very much aligned with Alan\u2019s comments earlier about the PDH unit at the strategic level. So until we\u2019re absolutely that we\u2019ve got the right commercial deals lined up here and until we\u2019re absolutely certain we know how we\u2019re going to execute and derisk the capital project on an investment of this magnitude, we\u2019re going to hesitate to rush our way into a sanction if I could call it that. So we will sanction only when we\u2019re absolutely ready for both commercial and the project side.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers", "Got it. And Don if I could return to the insurance recovery question. If I remember when I asked at the Analyst Day the comment was made that debates about recoveries has less to do with debates about what true commodity price should be versus taking best care in not only being safe but also being appropriately efficient and starting up again. Could the fact that you are now delaying start-up comfortably beyond the recovery period basically obviate that issue a little bit and make it to easier to achieve recoveries since you are kind of taking some of the dime on your own accord?", "Donald Chappel", "Craig good question. Certainly the claim \u2013 our claim continues to get somewhat larger because we believe we\u2019ve worked prudently to bring the plant back into service. Obviously insurers who have the money in their pockets argue against that but we think we have a very solid claim, we think that our outside experts will help us present our claim in a way that is compelling and we\u2019re optimistic that we will receive a very substantial additional payments perhaps as early as late third and fourth quarter.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers", "Okay. So you think that much of those could be resolved by the time the plant is actually up and running?", "Donald Chappel", "No I think more likely it\u2019s fourth quarter.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers", "Okay.", "Donald Chappel", "Yes the plant being up and running in the fourth quarter but with the target of October date it could take a bit longer than that is I guess my comment.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers", "I got you. And last question kind of a little broad spectrum and big picture. But we\u2019ve got a couple of things going on with potentially a competing NGL line from the northeast to Belvieu maybe looking a little better prospect at the moment and also condensate exports looking more realistic than ever before. There is obviously competitive pressures for new business opportunities from all these types of events across your system I wonder if you all could just comment on any net positives or negatives from these types of events?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well I guess if you are just asking generally about the competitive environment that we see out there I think we continue to see not see much impact from competition frankly we just have so many opportunities coming at us that, that\u2019s probably why I want to say it\u2019s the least of our worries, it\u2019s certainly low on the list. And really if you think about some of the larger risk to the business it\u2019s more around the macro environment and one thing we do compete for frankly we\u2019ve become very aware obviously we comment for rigs from one basin to the next. And so I think having ACMP alongside gives us a little bit better diversification to that in terms of being exposed on big gas basins.", "But I would say that really the issue that keeps us focused on getting great market access for our customers and keeps us aligned with them frankly is that we desperately want to see good market access for the basins we\u2019ve invested in and that\u2019s obviously a service we would like to provide as well and providing better market access and better long-term markets for their products and so that\u2019s how we\u2019re continuing to go about that. But I would say on the competitive front that we\u2019ve just got our hands so full with the opportunities that are coming to us and we\u2019re uniquely positioned to win that we\u2019re not having to stretch very far beyond that.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers", "Great. I appreciate it.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question we will hear from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.", "Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies", "Hey guys thanks a lot for taking my question. Don just curious I\u2019d see the guidance for WMB effectively DCF but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that you reported along with quarter reports, so I am just curious if you could either for the second quarter sort of provide on the same schedule of how you would guide it. What the DCF or WMB entity was and is that something that on a go forward you are plan to report as part of the financial.", "Donald Chappel", "Chris great question. We have not done that yet but we certainly expect to, so you can look for that next quarter.", "Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies", "And any broad framework as to what it might have been for the quarter?", "Donald Chappel", "I don\u2019t have that number off hand and I don\u2019t know if John has it but we can get it to you or we could post it on our website.", "Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, great. That would be helpful. Thanks guys.", "Donald Chappel", "I\u2019ll just comment here again we\u2019re going through a transition here with ACMP and that our acquisition of the additional interest will know cause us to consolidated ACMP beginning in the third quarter which will create some differences in reporting. Obviously we\u2019ve done reporting on equity basis will be fully consolidated, we will be looking to gain significant gain in the third quarter to revalue our initial investment in ACMP, we will be looking some substantial and tangible assets and we will have some additional depreciation, amortization related to those assets as well.", "So just kind of a heads up and look forward to quite a bit different presentation you still get to the same bottom-line here in terms of cash flow but from a balance sheet than earning standpoint there will be some changes in the basis of presentation.", "Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. Great, thanks Don.", "Donald Chappel", "Welcome.", "Operator", "And our last question today will come from Bradley Olsen with TPH.", "Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in I know we\u2019re running a little bit late, so I really only got one question. Now that you\u2019ve closed the ACMP general partner acquisition, can you comment on any ongoing efforts to retain key personnel from Access and kind of broadly speaking how successful those efforts have been?", "Alan Armstrong", "Sure. That\u2019s certainly something we very much value that organization and their capabilities and that was high on our list of things to accomplish. And so we did move swiftly and aggressively to do so and I think we\u2019re with comfortable with where we\u2019re right now on that front. And so what a great work by our teams here at Williams and the team at Access to really address where any of those issues might be and take care of them swiftly. So, I\u2019d say we feel very good about where we stand today and I am you know particularly proud of both the organization coming together and work that so quickly.", "Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Okay, great. So, broadly speaking I guess it\u2019s fair to say that in the Utica and the northeast where Access is maybe most their capital is being deployed that he team is kind of largely in fact for a post acquisition?", "Alan Armstrong", "That is correct.", "Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Great, thanks guys.", "Operator", "And will conclude today\u2019s question and answer session I would like to turn the call back to Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great, thank you. Thank you for all the great questions. As you can see, we are very excited about the future we have got in front of us and this team as you know I think just continues to generate momentum towards this vision that we have of really being de-premier player in this natural gas super cycle and very excited about the opportunities that keep coming at us and we keep executing on to accomplish that and we look forward to reporting to you in the third quarter with great continued progress and certainly at the balance of the year.

[Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Porter", "Thank you, Tanisha. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams, and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website www.williams.com. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong will speak to you momentarily.", "Our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to questions and we also have the five leaders of Williams operating areas with us. Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem services; Rory Miller leads our Atlantic Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream, and Jim Scheel leads Northeast Gathering & Processing.", "In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we\u2019ve reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great, thank you very much John, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us here for our Q4 and full year 2014 earnings call today. To begin with, I'd like to welcome a couple of new members of our leadership team and they are joining us today as John just mentioned by phone. First is Bob Purgason, who became Senior Vice President of our Access operating area in January, and just to remind you, Bob has been COO at Access since 2010 and before that he was here at Williams for about 19 years until 2006. So, the organization here at Williams is very excited to have Bob back and really looking forward to a lot of the leadership he is brining.", "Additionally, Walter Bennett is here with us, and Walter previously led the Western operations for Access, and in January he began leading Williams' Western operations post Allison Bridges' retirement. And of course that includes our Northwest pipeline area and all of our big gathering and processing out in the Rockies as well as we've added to that now the Niobrara area in Wyoming that ACMP had this built, and our team, the Williams team had collaborated to help bring that business up as well. So, we're really excited to have Walter's very strong operating background and strong technical expertise brought to our team out there in the west.", "Additionally, I would just tell you, there are a lot of great leaders that have come in from ACMP, and they really are contributing a lot to our organization and help us lead through this tremendous growth period that we've got going on here at Williams. So, really nice to see the teams come in together so nicely and so quickly.", "Moving on here to slide 2, and you'll see a lot of the major topics listed here on this slide that will hit on this short presentation, but this is the place I'd like to spend a little more time discussing the drivers of our new guidance and really the significant derisking that has occurred as we have dramatically lowered our planned commodity margins. We've lowered our fee-based volume assumptions, and we've got more conservative on our Geismar ramp-up schedule.", "So, here first on the commodity price deck, our new price deck is centered on a $55 WTI and $3 Henry Hub gas price, and we've tried to be conservative with the price decks that are largely below the forward curves for products like propane and natural gasoline, where we're along the commodity and below the forward curve where we are short like our natural gas and ethane.", "We believe this is certainly one of the most conservative decks being used amongst our peers in the industry, and overall this resulted in a 44% reduction in our planned commodity margins and commodity positions at WPZ, and this now represent only about -- this commodity price only about 12% of our gross margin is now exposed directly to the commodities.", "On the gathering volume side, we've assumed reduced activity on the assets with unprotected volume exposure. So, in those areas, we're directly exposed to volumes and in many case we're ahead of what the producers have publicly communicated to investors. In other words, we're trying to get ahead of the lowering of rig counts and making sure that we've got a good handle on what we expect, and in many cases where that hasn\u2019t been publicly tried to get ahead of that with our own estimations.", "And fortunately though, I would tell you these impacts are only limited to a handful of our assets, and in the context of the new larger enterprise, the impacts we think are certainly manageable. So for example, our Northeast volumes are currently tracking ahead of our revised plan for 2015.", "On the Geismar ramp schedule, we have incorporated a much lower utilization of the facility over the first three months of the year, and this is going to allow for safe controlled ramp-up to full production. We\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of time doing it safely and ensuring a very high quality asset, and we certainly don't want to try to make any shortcuts here at the last minute on that. So, very proud of the team there continuing to be very focused on safe and making sure when we do get up to full capacity that we've got a safe and durable asset there.", "A couple of offsets to the impacts of these more conservative assumptions do exist in our plan. First of all, the early in service for Transco projects on the mainline portion of the Leidy Southeast expansion and the Virginia Southside expansion, and I'll hit on more of this in just a little bit, so I won't spend any time there. And then finally, on the next, on the cost cuts, we do have some offset to some of the negative variances as we\u2019ve stepped up our focus on really rightsizing our cost structure to match the reduced levels of activities in few of the regions.", "And so, while we've not specifically called out that number, I would emphasize that this can and will be a moving target depending on the ultimate levels of activity, and the production around our assets. But we certainly see an opportunity to offset some slower growth, and take advantage of the lower energy prices and materials in our own business because we certainly are exposed to energy and materials in our own business and a lot of those prices have come down.", "So in general, we're taking advantage of this low commodity market to position ourselves for a very strong consistent performance. And with many of the potential upsides that have been taken out of our guidance now, we still see a lot of those upsides out there, but we pulled a lot of that out of our guidance, and so as those occur, they will result in upsides to our guidance.", "But despite the significant derisking, WPZ still has one of the highest distribution growths amongst our peers, and this is driven now by approximately $4.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2015 which is further driven by fee-based revenues which make up about 88% of our gross margin. And then, we expect our EBITDA to continue to grow to about $6 billion on the backs of over $9 billion of fee based projects as we look forward to 2017.", "Moving on to slide 3, we can see here the key drivers of the fourth quarter and the comparisons to the fourth quarter of '13 along some of the mixed results that generated headwinds for us in the fourth quarter. So, this was certainly another very busy quarter for us as we undertook the commissioning of three very large assets. These assets are now ramping up to our expectations here in the first quarter and will be big contributors to our growth for the balance of 2015 and beyond.", "So, first now to hit on the WMB highlight, WMB received $515 million of distributions up from WPZ and ACMP and this was a 16% increase up $70 million. The higher distribution was supported by 30% increase in the fourth quarter adjusted segment profit in DD&A which was up $216 million to now $944 million there in the fourth quarter. So this large increase was certainly driven by the additional ACMP interest that we acquired in the third quarter of '14 and as well the associated consolidation of those interests.", "WPZ had mixed results for the quarter. We had some real positives and some real challenges as well. Ongoing mature businesses continued to perform as expected; however, we did have some delays and higher expenses in bringing on Geismar and along with lower commodity prices caused the quarter to come in lower than we had planned.", "So, now looking into each segment, the Atlantic-Gulf, strong underlying performance in Transco in the Western Gulf, but this was offset by some producer startups on the Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar facilities. These projects are now online and ramping up nicely here in the first quarter and really pleased to be serving our customers out there both the Anadarko's Lucius facility and the Hess' operated Tubular Bells facility up there.", "On the NGL & Petchem side, Geismar being offline versus an expected mid fourth quarter startup plus some LCM inventory adjustments that marks most of the products that we have for linepack and operating inventories back to a much lower market and so this is nothing new in terms of how we account for our inventories, but the sever downward move in NGLs caused a much larger than normal swing in this inventory valuation. We also saw some high expenses for the quarter associated with commissioning and repairs through our Geismar facility.", "In the Northeast we continue to ride the wave of strong growth in the Marcellus volumes with a 26% increase on a quarter-to-quarter basis and 28% increase in a full-year '13 to '14 comparison. However we did not hit our expected numbers in OVM due to a delay in bringing on some of the major well pads that producers were bringing on right at the end of the year, but we do continue and enjoy tremendous growth in this area and our current production levels in the Northeast segment as I mentioned earlier are ahead of a more conservative plan now for 2015.", "Southwest, the West really performed largely in line with what we've expected with the exception of the commodity prices which certainly clipped our NGL margins in the area. And this area has really held up fairly well despite of lack of drilling and as always our Northwest pipeline asset remained quite steady and in 2015 our plan has less than 15% of the company's gross margin in the west coming from commodity exposed contract.", "So, in the past as you know the west has always been an area of big commodity exposure to us and to some of our big processing facilities out there and because of the continued growth in our fee based business as well as the large decline in NGL margins now only have about a percent of that gross margin, actually a little less than that out West. So, lot less volatility as we go into 2015 at West.", "So overall, a noisy quarter for WTZ given several one-time and discrete events, but our underlying fundamentals are very strong they give us complements in our 2015 plan and certainly now on the ACMP side, ACMP produced another very impressive quarter. Fee based revenues were up 48% to $593 million and this was driven by a lot of new capital investments that delivered record gross gathering volumes of 6.5 Bcf a day, so tremendous accomplishment by the ACMP team there in the fourth quarter as well.", "Moving on to slide 4, talk about some of the milestones and the recent accomplishments here, that certainly give us a lot of confidence in our plan going forward. First of all as I mentioned Gulfstar won the typical startup issues I would tell you for the producers bringing on a lot of new big wells on to that platform, but it is looking like some ultimate upside to our original expected flow rates from the facility and so we're really pleased to see the way that's going and very excited about that investment.", "On the Transco side, another winner and another big increase in peak volumes on the nation's largest and fastest growing pipeline. With this year's peak a day here in January beating last year's record by 8% despite a very, very cold winter in January 2014. So, really just a lot of continued growth is driving that on the Transco system and that team continues to do a great job keeping up with all that growth.", "ACMP as I mentioned also hit another record volumes and this really a major contributor to this was the gathering volumes in the Utica and those fed into the 49% UEO processing JV there in Eastern Ohio and the latest train to come on line was the new Leesville plant. So, continued great exposure there to the growth in the Utica and really excited to see the way those volumes continue to perform.", "More recently, the big addition to our discovery partnership, the Keathley Canyon connector received first production from Anadarko at their Lucius platform and now as we move into March we expect to begin receiving much larger gas volumes from Hadrian field and so again, another huge accomplishment brining on that major facility out in over 7000 feet of water.", "Our Geismar restart has certainly been long awaited and we're excited to be where we are on that finally and it is, we are in the process of getting that lined out and we expect to continue to ramp up here in the end of February and our plan does really expect consistent full rate production until the very end of march and so we've derisked that as well and we currently are working to improve the ultimate efficiency of several of the heat exchanger systems before we can reach back for full production.", "But all the systems in the base plant have been activated and we've been able to fund that up to about 70% of load there on the base plant. So, we're very confident and where we are today on that it's really just a matter of getting those exchangers being able to operate up to their peak efficiencies.", "Our combined access and Williams operating teams came together on the new Bucking Horse plant in Wyoming right during the dead of winter and so, while we don\u2019t expect this plant to generate a significant amount of cash flow, here in the near future, it was very important for our teams to get this plant online for the benefit of our new largest customer Chesapeake and it also demonstrated the clear benefits of integration between both Access and Williams personnel into one new organization out there. So hats off to that team that worked through the pretty touch winter up there to get that plant started up.", "Many of our recent expansions have involved along with other facilities modifications to the Transco mainline and so, this allows us to facilitate moving gas from the Marcellus and the Utica from the North to the South. And so, with two kind of projects in common here on this was first Virginia Southside which started up in December '14, the mainline portion did, not yet the lateral but the mainline portion started up much earlier than expected and that full facility of the lateral will come on in the third quarter of 2015.", "And then the same story on Leidy Southeast which in March of this year will bring on the mainline portion of the Leidy Southeast project and that also beats our expectations for that project as well. And together these projects will yield $50 million to $75 million of incremental operating profit in 2015. These are all fully contract and that's been approved by the FERC. So we are ready to put these into service and of course bringing on all this incremental operating profit wasn\u2019t expected originally in those investments really gives a very nice boost to our original expected returns for those projects.", "And then finally, our Rockaway Beach lateral is expected to start up in either late March or early April and the team has been working hard to hold the schedule despite as a lot of you all know a very wet and cold weather there in the New York area. But really excited to finally bring that project to closure and being able to serve our big customer of their national grid.", "Moving on to slide 5, this slide really just provides a real quick snapshot of the different types of cash flow that make up our $6 billion of gross margin. And just to make a few points here, first it shows that now only 3% of WPZ's risk remains tied to the NGL margin commodities and the spread on NGLs and only 9% is tied to our olefins margin in both our Geismar and Canadian facilities. So, meaning 88% of our cash flows are now from fee based revenues here in 2015 and including nearly two-thirds of those that are under contract that have demand payments, cost of service with minimum volume commitment.", "So as we can see on the next slide our future growth is even less dependent on commodities as we move to slide 6 here, and this really shows that 99% of our $9.3 billion of growth capital that's in guidance are tied to fee based projects. So this slide really gets to the heart of our lower risk and growth strategy for the next few years. And as you can see the vast majority of this is tied to, even the fee based projects the vast majority is tied to the kind of business that are either on our gas pipeline system or in the ACMP area where we have a lot of protection from volume risk. And so lot of confidence and certainty from our perspective about how we go forward.", "So, while certainly commodity prices are and remain important to our business specifically here for the near term cash flows and coverage they really are not the driver of our growth. Our business strategy is built around natural gas volume growth and the demand for associated large scale infrastructure that are going to be required to build out as the natural gas and natural gas products markets continue to build on the back of a very low priced commodity. And as a result we're confident in our ability to deliver one of the highest rates of distribution growth amongst our large cap peers, despite the lower expected commodity prices that are not built into our plan.", "Moving on to slide on to slide 7, this slide just drills down into the known projects over this longer period. And so, I'm not going to go through each of these facilities, but one of things that I think we have not spoken very much about but is pretty impressive is the amount of exposure that we have to the LNG export facilities and in fact the Transco has connections that allow it to receive or deliver gas. But nearly every LNG import/export facility in the Gulf Coast and the eastern seaboard other than the Everett facility in Boston.", "Those LNG facilities include Cheniere's Sabine Pass, Exxon's Golden Pass, trunk lines like trialed [ph] Sempra's Cameron LNG, the Elba Island LNG and the Toe Point LNG [ph]. And as you know, we've talked in the past about our access to our Gulf Trace Project being a 1.2 Bcf a day commitment to Cheniere's Sabine Pass facility that's fully contracted and will start up in early 2017.", "But we also recently concluded an open season in December of '14 for the Gulf market expansion and this is designed to provide an additional 1.4 Bcf a day of firm transportation from station 65 going back to the West to points on the mainline in Louisiana and Texas and great progress there and we're in the process of negotiating the firm commitments from our shippers and that came out of the open season and it is anticipated that this could possible 1.4 Bcf a day of capacity could be in service as early as late 2018, so just continued tremendous growth on the Transco system, both on the market side and supply side.", "Moving to slide 8 here for the conclusion, certainly we're very pleased to have the PZ/ACMP merger closed and remain more excited than ever really, we continue to see tremendous benefits from the combined strength of this new MLP and we think it is the MLP to be exposed to amongst the large caps if you like the prospects of overall market growth of both natural gas and natural gas derivatives because clearly our strategy is very tightly focused on this opportunity.", "As we look to the PZ distribution growth, all of the issues I've gone through the day really drive to this and the revised outlook for PZ and WMB result in a new guidance of 7% to 11% annual distribution growth at WPZ through the '17 period with the midpoint of 9% and this really reflects the strength and the quality of our underlying assets with a growing coverage ratio of greater than 1.05 once we get through this first quarter and '15 ramp up period.", "So, not only do we think we have good growth there, but we are continuing to build coverage through period and so we're really excited that despite these much lower and a very relevant to our peers at very conservative price that we continue to be even at the lower growth rate at the low end commodity prices we're still at the high end of our large cap MLP peers. And so, even though this is slightly below the plan that we articulated at the time of the ACMP and WPZ merger, these level of growth in cash and coverage are indicative of the best-in-class large cap MLP.", "As we look at the WMB dividend growth we have also slightly slowed down our targeted levels of growth for WMB and this of course is driven by the lower price environment that we've forecast with a range now of 10% to 15% growth largely to match the underlying growth of cash flows coming up from the MLP. So just to highlight the stability of this business plan even under the low price commodity case we can grow WPZ at the 7% we talked about and continue to move over 1.0 coverage there at the low price and at WMB at 10% with additional layers of coverage index of 1.0 at WMB as well. So, we really like our position now with the distribution and coverage and we certainly like the underlying fundamentals that underpin that.", "So, overall we're very confident in this business plan. We think it's realistic. We think it allows us to continue to provide tremendous total shareholder return whichever commodity price environment develops as we go forward and in fact across all scenarios we have the best-in-class growth at WPZ and a top-tier growth at WMB with growieng levels of coverage across both entities.", "So, this continually building list of investment opportunities are very tightly aligned with our strategy. They give us great confidence in our future and continue to give us a very high quality long lived cash flows that we think are some of the highest quality in the industry and this is coming from our continually, very competitively advantaged assets.", "And so with that, I thank you for joining us and we'll turn it over for questions that you might have. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Carl Kirst", "Thank you. Good morning everybody. I'll start maybe with the growth projects, and I'm just curious in the current market as you look to Canada, one of the things we were looking at was the PDH facility, I didn\u2019t know if you'll be at the weaker Canadian dollar and perhaps some of the activity coming out of that area might be tempering down the investment costs, and perhaps you know, keeping that potential growth project still in advanced stages, as well as in third quarter, you guys were certainly opening up the possibility of Appalachian Connector, I didn\u2019t know if we could get an update on that as well?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes sure. First on PDH, you are correct Carl, the fundamentals are actually improving there as we are seeing some, the signs of lower-cost coming in for equipment and vendors as we go out and are in the process of really tightening up our estimates on that. And additionally, that project is really built around the benefits of the logistics of taking low-cost propane right there in Canada and converting it eventually into polypropylene by our partner and being able to serve markets. ", "So, we're basically just cutting down on a lot of rail logistics, and those things continue to improve. Propane prices continue to be a huge spread to Mont Belvieu, propane prices up there and we think that's going to continue for some time because there's not really any logistical answers coming out that will improve that any time soon. And so, we really like how that continues to unfold as well. And really just a matter at this point of getting contracts finalized with our downstream partner there that pulls a lot of that risk off of our shoulders from a commodity spread standpoint, but we really do like the fundamentals and they are certainly improving for that project.", "On the Appalachian Connector project, we are certainly still excited. We think the strengths of our market pool and the demand of our market, they are along the mainline is a real positive for us. There has, as you know, there's been some turnover in some of the properties upstream, and certainly with the lower gas prices, people are looking for creative solutions out of that area, and so we're certainly working with a lot of those customers both on the market side and the upstream side to try to bring those two together in a way that they can firmly support our project. And so, we're feeling pretty good about that, but it is -- certainly everybody is kind of, anybody in the energy industry right now is reeling a little bit in trying to get their forward-looking perspectives tend down before they make any major commitments, and so obviously that's where we stand on that today.", "Carl Kirst", "Do you get a sense, and that's kind of where I was going to, do you get a sense that even as these continue to percolate, they've both been pushed back to the back half of the year if they do come together or how would you think about timing?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, I would say on the PDH project, it really is just we're going to be very, very careful. That's a big investment for us. We want to make absolutely certain that we've been, that we know exactly what our numbers, we get as many bids and estimates, solid estimates that are well engineered in the door, so the PDH project is more, just of us moving along at a pace that is focused on making sure we can execute on the project effectively rather than being in a rush on it. And so, that one is more driven by our own efforts and getting the contracts finalized than it is anything in the broader macro industry at this point.", "On the Appalachian Connector piece, I think that answers have got to come a little quicker on that, and so I think we'll be pressing in the next quarter to decide one way or the other on where we go with that, but in any way, shape, or form, I think we're going to position ourselves to benefit both our assets in the area, both our wholly-owned and some of our equity investments in making sure that we get good market attachment to those assets and as well making sure that we get the investments that are due to us for the downstream mainline expansions for that gas as well. So pretty excited about it, but we're not going to push a rope on that. We've got plenty of great investment opportunities, and we're not going to step up and take risk on that.", "Carl Kirst", "Yeah, I appreciate that. One final one just for Don, just very quickly, I appreciate the WPZ equity as far as obviously retaining investment grade. Don, do you have any planned equity issuances in '16 and '17 at PZ in the kind of base case budget?", "Don Chappel", "Good morning Carl. The PZ equity issuances in '16, '17 at this point is de minimus. So, it gives us capacity to really take on some additional opportunities since we see exciting opportunities develop.", "Carl Kirst", "Thank you, guys.", "Don Chappel", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Ted Durbin", "Thanks. First one for me is just on the balance of distribution growth, dividend growth coverage keeping PZ flat here it looks like in 2015, I guess how are you thinking about the right level there, especially given that you have a much higher mix of fee based cash flow?", "Don Chappel", "Ted, this is Don, I'll just note that we felt we want to go in with a fairly conservative plan here in light of what happened in the marketplace. So rather than continue to boost the dividend or distribution during the year we set forth a plan that we'd hold it steady. And obviously if we see things develop to the upside we could change that, but we felt that we'd set a plan here that was more conservative and one that hopefully investors will agree that is conservative as well.", "Ted Durbin", "Okay, great. Next one from me is just on Geismar, can you maybe quantify a little bit more closely how many pounds of ethylene are you actually planning to sell in 2015 or some sense of utilization rate you're looking for as we ramp up through the year/", "Don Chappel", "Well, as I said really, you can call it about anyway you want to, but we are expecting very little here in the first quarter and then we would be at our typical run rates on Geismar for the balance of the year. And so that would be up against the expanded capacity and somewhere around 98% to 98.5% of that expanded capacity.", "Ted Durbin", "Got it, very helpful, thanks. And then last one for me, it looks like you're no longer giving guidance by segment here. I guess I'm just wondering if you can give us any sense of versus the old guidance that you used to have of the different WPZ segments, how much plus or minus are we against those or will we start to get some more color there in terms of how the actual operating areas are performing?", "Don Chappel", "Ted, this is Don, I'm sorry again, given as much changes we have here we took a little different approach this quarter. I would say that as we approach our Analyst Day we'll look at providing some additional information about, I'll note for you that we did take volumes down fairly substantially up in the Northeast at OVM as well as Marcellus, but some volume reduction from our prior growth expectations that is in the West. So hopefully that helps.", "Ted Durbin", "That's helpful. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.", "Don Chappel", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Abhi Rajendran with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Abhi Rajendran", "Hi, good morning guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Abhi Rajendran", "Just a quick question on the dividend illustration and outlook over the next couple years, obviously on the cash tax rate line, you're not paying anything for the next couple years. I think previously you talked about that kind of eventually rising up to maybe the high single digit, low double-digit sort of percentage, how should we think about that kind of looking beyond 2017 and then what that might mean for maybe long-term growth covers, et cetera.", "Don Chappel", "Yeah Abhi, this is Don again. You know we had a couple of things change here since our third quarter guidance on this matter and cash tax rates are down substantially. A couple of key points there, one was the bonus depreciation, which again lowered our cash tax rates nicely and then as well the fact that income was lower also it kind of extended in the chart, the period of time although which some of these deductions will be realized.", "So, I think you can see there the cash tax rate is about zero through 2017 and in our footnote on that schedule you can see that we've disclosed '18 and '19 we estimated about 4% currently and obviously things will move around a bit, but as we continue to add projects or potentially even M&A that will have the tendency to push the cash tax rate down in '18 and '19 as well as perhaps periods beyond that. So again, some good news on the cash tax front.", "Abhi Rajendran", "Hey got it and since you mentioned M&A, what are your thoughts on the M&A environment and possibilities? Are you continuing to look or are things sort of put on the back burner a little bit, you know, you guys deferred the drop of the NGL Petchem projects from WMB until bit later down the line. How are you thinking about that whole dynamic?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, sure, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. You know, I would just say we have a lot of acquisition opportunities that are where we have a preferential position to acquire and those are right down our alley and our knowledge base. So we wouldn't be taking a lot of risk where we are already know the area, know the asset, know the investments and so I would say those are probably first on the list for our capacity in that space.", "And but you know, we're going to be pretty prudent frankly and we like where we're positioned right now and think that as the cash flows really start to come through and people really see the strength of these investment opportunities we think we're going to be very well positioned to take on some of those transactions. So, I would say that's first, but I think one thing you can, we've certainly been consistent on as we stuck with our strategy very tightly on the acquisition front and have stuck to things that are very consistent with our strategy and so you should think about that as we go forward the same thing.", "Abhi Rajendran", "Got it, thanks very much for the color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Jeremy Tonet", "Hi good morning.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Don Chappel", "Good morning.", "Jeremy Tonet", "I know things have been changing really quick here, but I was wondering if you might be able to expand a bit more upon conversations you are having with your producer customers as far as their drilling activities in 2015 and if there's any way we can think about quantifying the risk of throughput through the legacy WPZ G&P assets that's a low end of guidance and that certain volume assumptions are different than the high-end or any help there will be great?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, just to kind of put that in context for you from where we were in the previous guidance period, we pulled well over $100 million out on that from those fee-based volumes and so we have dramatically reduced that and I would tell you the areas that are hardest hit and we think are going to be hardest hit and I would tell you we've been more conservative than some of the input we've had from some of our producers in many areas, but the areas that have been hardest hit were areas that were enjoying a big lift from liquids.", "And I think the gas market overall particularly the demand side probably doesn't appreciate all the nice benefit of continued supply that has come on the backs of high-priced liquids margins and with those pulled out of the space right now you know, we think that is going to dramatically retard drilling. And so if you're, I would say conservative and may be even bearish relevant to our peers about where we think liquids prices will be for the year then that also has you not being very bullish on people drilling for rich gas. And so I would say those are the areas that from our perspective are most affected not so much the dry gas, but really the richer gas areas are the ones we'd really pulled back our assumptions on.", "Jeremy Tonet", "That makes sense. Thank you and just one last question on constitution if you could provide any updates there as far as how that's progressing?", "Alan Armstrong", "Sure, Rory, you want to take that one?", "Rory Miller", "Yeah, this is Rory. Jeremy, we've had some pretty good news in the fourth quarter. This is probably fairly well known, but just as kind of a recap, December 2 the FERC issued a certificate of public convenience necessity authorizing the constitution pipeline project. So that's a big milestone for the project. And then later on that same month on December 24, the New York DEC issued a notice of complete application on the project and sent out three public hearings that took place in that second week of January and they've set a deadline of February 27, 2015 to get all of the written comments and on the action that they are considering.", "So, we've been working very closely with the New York DEC, that's probably the next hurdle that we need to clear, but they're asking a lot of questions. I think they are very intent on doing their due diligence on the project and they've been very inquisitive, but we've been working very hard and very steadily to get them the answers that they need and put them in a position to issue that permit hopefully in a few months after the, month or two after the close of the comment period.", "Jeremy Tonet", "Great, thanks for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brad Olsen from TPH. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Brad Olsen", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Brad Olsen", "I had a really kind of a financial structuring question, we've obviously seen Kinder Morgan take the step of getting rid of their MLP entirely and as you look out with the ACMP deal now closed and you guys have provided what I think is very conservative guidance versus you know, what market expectations are and you're still building coverage even in this conservative $45 scenario that you painted and yet, we still see WPZ trading a couple hundred basis points in several cases wider in terms of yield than a lot of the big cap MLP peers that its comped against.", "And so, I guess you guys have provided some interesting color in previous presentations in terms of kind of where you expect on a yield basis WPZ to trade based on its growth rate. It seems like that discount is persisting and I was wondering if you had thoughts on a) any kind of further steps that you can take to close that discount and b) if you still find that WPZ is not an effective financing vehicle or is just simply too expensive of a financing vehicle would you consider simplifying your structure and eliminating the MLP or folding it into WMB?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, I would just tell you. I think that's certainly a tool for us in the future, I think though right now right we've got a great plan in front of us and we do believe that as these big projects come on and really begin to generate kind of tremendous cash flow that they've got that we're going to see the market reprice that the WPZ currency.", "And so, we think that is yet to come and certainly with Geismar continuing to be down and the big Gulfstar and Keathley Canyon, Rockaway Lateral all these big projects really starting to kick up here for the balance of the year. We think that's going to give the market a lot of confidence. So I would say you know, we certainly understand that the benefits of that as a tool for the future, but I think right now we've got to execute on what we have and let the market retune itself before we make any further decision on that.", "Brad Olsen", "Got it, thanks for that color, just one follow-up, as you look out into potentially heating up M&A market in light of the market dislocations that we've seen recently and you think about potential opportunities in the M&A market, would you be willing to contemplate using WMB as a consolidation vehicle given the fact that you've spent the better part of the last year getting WMB into a fairly streamlined General Partner HoldCo or would you be willing to wait for WPZ's evaluation to get more competitive in terms of an M&A currency before attempting to do anything?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, I would just say I think both of them are fairly undervalued right now from our perspective and so I think I'm able to get them both in position, but I think it certainly would depend on the transaction as we move to that point then it will certainly depend on the transaction as to which one would be the more appropriate currency for that. So, it's nice to have both of them frankly because there are times when the co-op currency would be a much more favored currency than an NLP currency. And so we think it's important to have both of them right now and we like having both those tools.", "Brad Olsen", "Great, thanks a lot for the color Alan.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Hi, good morning guys. Just a quick follow up to actually to the discussion you just had with Brad, when you were thinking about it taken or whether it\u2019s a tool in your chest further down the road, is it fair to assume that given the fact that you're effectively based on an earlier comment not a taxpayer at WMB through 2017 that it pretty much wouldn't make sense to even consider it until you actually become a taxpayer, is that sort of the way we should be thinking about that as kind of the first step in terms of whether you would consider taking it at all?", "Don Chappel", "Shneur this is Don. I think the tool is one that we'll continue to look at and yes, we're not a taxpayer for many years. However, there are other attributes to the option, but again I think as Alan mentioned earlier we think execution is likely to cause WPZ to trade at a level that is appropriate given its opportunity set, the growth set and we think the relatively low long term risk that natural gas growth demand drives. So again, we'll just put that on the shelf. It is something we'll continue to study, but we think that execution is job number one and yes, taxes are something that would not be all that valuable for quite a few years.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Great thanks. Okay, so just moving on to some of the questions that I had, first there's been quite a few announcements by many of the processors around the country of significant cost saving initiatives, some headcount reductions and so forth and I realized at the time of the merger you were very adamant about no headcount reductions, if anything you were looking to hire people and so forth. But I think more kind of in a different commodity environment today, I wonder if that thought process has changed at all and you are pursuing some sort of cost reduction strategies? Sort of I was wondering if you can sort of comment against what you're doing versus what the rest of the industry is doing?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, great question and we certainly are going to put a lot of pressure on costs and we do think that we've got a lot of room to do that and so certainly using the buying kind of into these lower material costs, costs on things like lube oil which as you can imagine is with as many spending parts as we have in our businesses is a big number for us. And so, we certainly are going to go after cost on that side. On the headcount front, I would say there are certainly a lot of those opportunities coming to us as we merge a lot of support functions.", "But I would say we still really need continue to preserve our strength on the operating and technical side because we do have a lot of growth on that front, but it is shifting around and we will need to shift some of those resources around to be focused on where the opportunities lie, but I would tell you we still are looking for great talent in the technical and operating side and we do see some opportunities on the support function side as we continue to consolidate the organization. So we are pursuing them aggressively I guess is the best way to say that and we do think that's quite a bit of opportunity around that.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Okay, and then a question about the dividend policy, last night you\u2019ve effectively tempered the growth you said it in your prepared remarks reflecting the current commodity environment, is it also fair to say that this is somewhat of an affirmation that's no longer going to be kind of an idea or waiver type strategy in terms of how you sort of structure the PZ distribution and the Williams dividend policy or is it really just about the current commodity environment?", "Don Chappel", "Shneur, we believe that WPZ is sufficiently strong to carry itself without requiring any IDRs. We initially designed it very stout coverage. Fortunately we have that stout coverage designed in and we used it, but nonetheless as you can see here we're building coverage back again in a way that we do not expect WPZ to need that reverse. And as Alan pointed out with 88% in fee-based gross margin with 30% of that coming from interstate pipes and another 27%, coming from ACMP and its cost of service contracts and MDC's, we have nearly 60% of our gross margin coming from either interstate pipe or cost of service MDC type revenue. So very low risk we think on relative basis cash flows, so again we don\u2019t see a need for IDRs, we don\u2019t think either the market puts enough value on those to make it worthwhile.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Okay, that's fair enough and one final question just with respect to Geismar, I was just wondering if you walk us through where you are with ethylene production today and sort of the confidence that you know, it will be at full runway in the first quarter kind of like what are the hiccups or challenges that you're dealing with today that you need to get complete so that you can actually be at full run rate by the first quarter?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, well, I am going to have John Dearborn provide you a little more detail here, but I would just say in general as we started up the plant we hit a \u2013 we started seeing some inefficiencies and some fouling in our heat exchangers that are critical to reaching peak efficiency in a plant like that. And so rather than continue to be dogged with that, we chose to take those heat exchangers off line, stop sales on ethylene out of the plant for a while and get those heat exchangers cleaned out adequately to make sure that we could get back to absolutely full efficiency on the plant.", "So, and not continuing to try to run through that as we pull through startups. So that's really what's going on, that's not a big issue, it's just a matter of getting some of the residual fouling that had been sitting in those heat exchangers and getting then tuned up. But we have gotten the plant up and running. We've had all the systems up and running. We just weren\u2019t hitting the efficiencies that we wanted to and so we're back getting that tuned up. And then the next step would be to bring on the larger expansion as well and so we think we've got that part of the plant ready to go as well and so that's what we'll be doing here for the next three weeks or so is tackling both those issues, but things are going well on that front and we're pleased with the way the work is going. John, have you anything to add?", "John Dearborn", "Yeah, obviously Alan is very well informed on this issue of how Geismar is going. I think we should keep him well informed that way. The only think I would add is as we look forward, it's our intension that we bring the plant back notionally to the base capacity level that 1.3 billion pound rate and at that rate which as you heard Alan say earlier we've demonstrated now 70% of that rate already operating with nine furnaces, then we'll line up plants and will be absolutely certain that the plant is running stably and then we'll take the next steps to ramp up to the full capacity getting up into that high 90s operating rate against the full capacity over the subsequent few weeks.", "So that's the way we had it planned out and we're making very good progress of getting this heat exchanger cleaned and expect to turn the plant back over to operations next week and in a few days after that be back in the pipeline.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Perfect. Thanks a lot guys, I really appreciate the color.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Christine Cho", "Good morning. I was just curious, you guys in the press release talk about the deferral over the planned drop down of the remaining NGL and Petchem projects. When are you thinking that that's going to be deferred, do you have a sense of an idea when that's going to be?", "Don Chappel", "Christine, this is Don. You know, we didn't put a date on it, so it's not embedded in any of the guidance that you see here; however, I think I'll just say we'll be opportunistic about that, so we'll look to do that when we think WPZ has the financial capacity to do that in a real value creating kind of way with that capacity or with a combination of some debt and equity when the equity is trading in a way that we think is more appropriate. So right now I'll just say we'll be opportunistic and we'll deal with that as we see the right facts and circumstances line up.", "Christine Cho", "Okay, and then my next question is a bit of an operational one. You know in a prior response to a question you talk about how you stripped out $100 million of margin tied to areas where there is obviously rich related drilling. If I am to think about kind of the Marcellus and you know, you've previously talked about Oak Grove coming on at the end of this year, is there really a reason for that to come on by this year? Can we defer that, I mean it doesn\u2019t sound like Fort Beeler is going to be fully utilized this year, so can you just kind of migrate whenever volumes are dedicated to Oak Grove to Fort Beeler in the meantime?", "Alan Armstrong", "Christine, actually Oak Grove is PXD 1 [ph] is up and running already and recall that that is where our de-ethanizer is and so we have both the processing train there and the de-ethanizer there at the Oak Grove facility. So for operational reasons it's good for us to have that up and running. I would tell you that again even though we pulled the upsides in the step that's not fully contracted out of our guidance on our forecast, there are a couple of very sizable packages of gas out there that we are extremely well positioned to capture, because we do have that capacity available.", "And so, I'm not going to get into specific customer names there, but I would just tell you we're extremely well-positioned to capture those because we do have that capacity available and so we're excited to have that Oak Grove capacity ready and available to serve those customers and we think we're going to build and capture that. There's quite a bit of gas that is just sitting there not flowing today because producers have had troubles bringing pads up. And so, I think as those come on and as we have an opportunity to capture some of that other gas out there we're going to be really glad we have that capacity available.", "Christine Cho", "Okay, so no changes to at least a second chain of Oak Grove then the timing of that then?", "Alan Armstrong", "That's right.", "Christine Cho", "Okay, and then my last question is you know, we've always talked about potential to convert Geismar into fee-based with the customer. Given all the changes that have happened in the last couple of months, has this thinking changed or is the challenge really finding a counterparty to do it with?", "Alan Armstrong", "No, I certainly don't think it has changed and we are certainly looking to really think about that from a shareholder value standpoint. Certainly if we were just looking at the PV or the cash flows as we think that having the commodity risks, especially as it covers our ethane processing risk, we think that absolute PV of those cash flows is probably better providing the commodity risk. However, given the beta and the volatility that that brings in from an investor perspective, we think there's some value to be had by lowering our risk. And so, it's a matter of finding that right trade-off.", "And as we said, as I said earlier the fact that we've got a much lower assumption and expectation right now on the commodity margin actually gives us a little more room to go do a transaction like that and so we certainly are very interested in that. And I would tell you that while they seem separate, the ability to bridge between somebody's needs on Geismar 2 and perhaps their more current needs from available production at Geismar 1 starts become the opportunity there. So we're still very interested in doing that and we think the current margin environment gives us a little more room to do that because we wouldn\u2019t be coming out and having to lower our guidance so much if we weren\u2019t able to convert that into fee-based.", "Christine Cho", "Great, thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Brian Lasky", "Good morning. Just want to back in on Christine's question a little bit, you guys seen the appetite among producers potentially to convert to fee-based contract as they are looking to print more barrels and show more growth, is that something that they\u2019re potentially open to in this tough environment for the right price level?", "Alan Armstrong", "I would just say that a lot of our business has converted to fee base. And so really the place that we have remaining exposure on a key pole basis as I mentioned is about a little less than 15% out West of our total gross margins out there.", "And so, I would say it continues to be an opportunity, but we structurally I would just tell you there are ways for us to keep the risk and for them to report the barrels. And so, that I would say we figured out and we\u2019ve done a lot of that in the past for the producers report the barrels as an owned equity barrels, but we don\u2019t have to really change the equity ownership of those barrels.", "And so, that\u2019s always a discussion that we\u2019re always interested in, I\u2019ll tell you that we on the processing side we have over the years tried to contract for fee base when the margins are high.", "And take on the key pole when margins are really low and so, but just because we certainly believe in that cyclicality of the processing margin. And so, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re really changed the perspective so much on that front.", "Brian Lasky", "Got it and just on the Access business seemed like quarter-over-quarter a little bit more flat this quarter. Can you maybe just kind of talk about the trajectory you see going forward there and kind of what puts and takes are you seeing?", "Alan Armstrong", "Bob, can you take that one please?", "Robert Purgason", "Yeah, certainly Alan and Brian glad to look at, I think we didn\u2019t feel we felt like we had a really good quarter actually and are seeing good volume growth in our Northeast areas, Utica very strong, still strong volumes in Marcellus, Eagle Ford volume is still growing as Alan noted, Niobrara coming up although whilst picking that up here in process. So, we feel very good about our performance coming out no integration impacts from that. And in fact or looking for the kind of growth that you saw in detail as Access standalone continuing and in fact accelerating with the Williams team.", "Brian Lasky", "All right, thanks Bob, that\u2019s helpful. And then finally Don, I was just wondering if you could maybe just speak to the kind of leverage capacity you think you have at the MB level, I mean in order to stay aren\u2019t you rated up there? I mean then would you guys have any appetite potentially fund some projects of that level? ", "Don Chappel", "Brian, I think at this point in time we don\u2019t have much in the way of debt capacity to volumes level. So, obviously as cash flows build and for past margins improve or build into that capacity. But today it wouldn\u2019t be here that we have that capacity to do much of anything in the very near future.", "Brian Lasky", "Okay thank you very much guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Craig Shere", "Good morning guys, thanks for fitting me in. ", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning, Craig.", "Craig Shere", "Alan in response to Brian\u2019s question about processing contracts you expressed the long-term contrarian view where you see the cyclicality continuing. On that note, in contrast to going to fee based to Geismar would you have the appetite for increasing the commodity exposure on the midstream processing to kind of neutralize some of your exposures on both ethane and also take advantage of that long-term cyclicality you are describing?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, great question Craig and I would just say that we certainly are not in the Olefin business for the sake of being in Olefin business and we see it\u2019s a nice extension of our midstream business in a way to push through into those markets and keep those markets open. On the tail end and certainly we are working to try to be neutral on that ethane to ethylene spread we\u2019re actually a little bit short ethane right now. If we were to turn on all of our ethane recovery capacity, obviously we\u2019re very short right now, because we\u2019re not recovering ethane anywhere.", "But if we wanted to turn on our ethane, if we were at full ethane production against the contracts we have we still would be a little bit short ethane. So trying to get neutral on that, but another way of getting neutral on that would be to and we\u2019re into some T based contracts on the ethylene side and therefore reduce our length on ethylene and reduce and improve our balance between ethane and ethylene. So, I would say that\u2019s more likely the way we would approach that. ", "Craig Shere", "Great that\u2019s helpful and on the commodity deck for guidance on obviously very conservative. But the one area I had a question on and I understand that you don\u2019t really have a long-term ethane markets that are useful.", "But if I\u2019m not mistaken recent ethane-ethylene crack spreads are perhaps few cents below the full-year guidance if I\u2019m not mistaken. Can you provide some color around Olefin\u2019s margin expectations and market drivers you see as Geismar achieves more capacity?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, sure. Well, first of all, just want to tell you that on the ethylene side, remember that that is at a $55 oil price. And so, we think that ethylene price is very commensurate with a $55 oil price that we have in there. Also you obviously have to pay attention to the spread and not just the absolute price that we have in there would it sounds like you are focused on Craig. But the other thing that I think it\u2019s missed sometimes in this is that we are actually at the netted price and remember that we produce in the Mississippi river market.", "And so while we certainly sell and exchange a lot of our product in the Mont Belvieu as well, we do have exposure to the Mississippi river market, which has been extremely short and there\u2019s actually a lot of derivative production that\u2019s been down in the area due to shortages.", "And so, you have to take that into consideration when you look at our proposed ethylene spread. And so, I think we feel pretty good as you look into the 2016 and 2017 timeframe you can see our ethylene price coming up, but you can also see that the ethane price is coming up right along with that as well.", "And so really again need to look at the spread I would say I\u2019m pretty bullish. The ethylene market as we look out in next couple of years, because the growth that I think we're going to see in the economies and the lack of near-term productive capacity coming up, it\u2019s pretty hard to argue there isn\u2019t going to be quite a bit of pressure on those Olefin markets to the upside and lot of demand coming to that.", "So that\u2019s what I would have to offer for you. I think we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re positioned there and John is a great student of that space as well and I\u2019ll John provide any additional comment you want to make.", "John Porter", "And I, only one few other things to add up, first the lower prices are certainly expected to stimulate some demand, but also we\u2019ve been looking at some recent reports that would say that we\u2019re seeing slowing exports and increasing local demand here in North America for ethylene and ethylene to reproduce.", "And certainly the ethylene derivative market remained quite strong. The second point I would add for consideration here is that if you look at ethylene inventories, there are pretty much all time low levels to estimated to be about six days worth of production in inventory at this point in time. ", "But remember that all those six days are not available to take advantage of a production mishap and nearly no one forecast production mishaps. So we think there are probably only about maybe three or four days worth of usable inventory they\u2019re ready to make up for some production shortfalls.", "And certainly coming into the year we see a couple of crackers that are down now though we have a light turnaround season this year. And then lastly, I'd turn your attention a little bit further to the Louisiana market, today with the Evangeline pipeline shutdown and suffered some from reliability issues at the moment, the spot price premium between Texas and the Louisiana is in the $0.08 to $0.10 down range. I think as we bring our facility back in operations that will likely return to more normal levels, but we\u2019re very well aware on some derivative capacity there on the river that is underserved, because of the combined outage of both Edmonton and Evangeline. So I think as Alan expressed and as I would confirm here we are generally positive as our guidance would suggest, so thanks for the question.", "Craig Shere", "Very helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Sharon Lui", "Hi, good morning.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Sharon Lui", "Just a follow-up question on ACMP, maybe if you could provide some color on the organic growth opportunities and what type of CapEx is embedded in your guidance relative to the historical levels for the G&P business?", "Alan Armstrong", "Bob, you want to take that?", "Robert Purgason", "Sure, yeah Sharon, it's nice to hear from you. In terms of just looking at going forward you'll notice we had a good strong capital year this year and we\u2019ve given I believe a three-year look out here in the new numbers.", "And if you compare those to our past guidance you\u2019ll see some strength in capital over our older forecast just in terms of our thinking that there are still new opportunities coming. These assets have not been worked hard and we are seeing the kind of backfill that we\u2019ve always talked into our capital not just dropping off the ledge when we finish this first round build out that arguably happened this year. So we still see good capital investment opportunity and as you know that drives earnings given our business model.", "Sharon Lui", "But has that been, I guess the shift or change in producer's willingness to commit to like a contract under cost of service under the current commodity environment?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, these are not new contracts these are continuing to build on the footprint that we have already established. And are continuing to build out in these core areas like Utica and the strength that we\u2019re seeing there in the Eagle Ford where, yes drilling softer, but there\u2019s still good strong drilling going on and really just filling out our existing portfolio.", "Sharon Lui", "Okay, great. And I guess just one question with regards to liquidity at WPZ, so post the merger, does the partnership have access to both credit facilities or is there plans to, I guess renegotiate with the bankers for one larger facility?", "Alan Armstrong", "Sharon, we put a new larger facility in place effective as of the date of the merger as well as a supplemental liquidity facility. So we have abundant liquidity.", "Sharon Lui", "Okay, and has the pricing terms changed?", "Alan Armstrong", "The pricing terms are more in line with WPZs pricing given its historic WPZs pricing in light of the fact that we have a mid-BBB investment grade ratings. So the ACMP pricing really moved to the WPZ level of pricing and it felt a little better than it was in our prior facility.", "Sharon Lui", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Eric Genco", "Hi, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on Craig\u2019s question. When we look at the spot prices for ethylene, if I will get sort of the Bloomberg today, it looks like for Mont Belvieu you\u2019re looking at $34.75 per pound. Is that the right number to be looking at and what is that now for the Mississippi River market today roughly?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, thanks for the question. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not an awful lot of transactions happening on the Mississippi River. The few recent transactions that we saw came out to be plus about between $0.08 and $0.10 to that number that you see at Mont Belvieu.", "And as I mentioned in my commentary just a moment ago, at least I would believe that as we bring our plants back into service here through this early part of this year, we would probably see that differential climb to more normal levels.", "And those more normal levels range between $0.01 and $0.03, so if you are looking forward and it would be reasonable to expect those kind of differentials, but certainly and once again, we feel that there\u2019s a pent-up demand over on the river that\u2019s been lagging by our outage and the reliability of the pipelines getting ethylene to that market in recent past.", "Eric Genco", "Okay that\u2019s helpful, but the $34.75 that\u2019s a good number that\u2019s kind of the good number for ethylene pricing in Mont Belvieu as of right now?", "Alan Armstrong", "It\u2019s a good number whether all transactions happen at that level they\u2019ll probably happen around that number, so yeah it\u2019s a good number you are looking at.", "Eric Genco", "And just, I mean just kind of to remind me, I should have this somewhere, but I just don\u2019t it top of my head. If Geismar is running at say 95%, 98% or whatever the target is, what percentage of, I guess U.S. ethylene capacity would that be like? How much more is coming back onto the market?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, it\u2019s around, it\u2019s just under 4%.", "Eric Genco", "4% okay.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah, right in that range, right.", "Eric Genco", "Right and then my second question just switching gears I guess to Atlantic Gulf and I'm sorry if you touched on this, it looked like the other segment costs jumped pretty significantly there. I can understand that there\u2019s going to be some, perhaps some startup costs associated with Gulfstar, I was hoping you could quantify that a little bit more? And then just try to understand if that\u2019s what it is at Gulfstar, are there any revenues or any revenues whatsoever in the quarter from Gulfstar, inventory and charge or anything like that?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well yeah, there were revenues in the quarter from Gulfstar. I think we had $19 million of new Gulfstar fees. We actually collected quite a bit more than that in really the second half of 2014. So we have the cash in, but based on the revenue recognition model that we\u2019re using we kind of have to dose out those collected dollars based on the forecasted throughput through the facility.", "So our cash numbers are actually are far in excess of the $19 million that we took to earnings. But that will continue to grow and we are collecting a base fee or demand fee under that contract. And then there\u2019s a usage fee as well as those barrels and those MMBTs of gas total across the facility. So that\u2019s a fairly significant impact on revenues in the quarter. Also our Transco transportation revenues were up, fee-based revenues were up about $15 million.", "And there was some IT volumes and some short-term firm deals and as well as some seasonal volumes that we saw pushing that number up.", "Eric Genco", "Okay, but is there something that kind of caused the, I mean is it really Gulfstar startup or how much of this is one-time to go from sort of 3Q number of $133 million above the some of the cash cost to say $160 million?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yeah that the quarter I would say is not really indicative of the year. So if you look at the year in total on the expense side we were right on our target, but if you look quarter-to-quarter, it looks pretty extreme. I\u2019ll tell you what happened though if you remember the polar vortex that we went through Q1 of 2014, it was kind of an all hands on deck period for Transco we were sudden new records seemed like almost every day.", "It was a pretty severe environment and we saw almost all of our expenditures that we could push got pushed into the second, third, and fourth quarters. So just it was a game of catch-up all year and we just wound up loading a lot of those expenses into the fourth quarter. If you look at the year\u2019s total, it\u2019s pretty much right on.", "Eric Genco", "All right this was helpful, thank you very much.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yep.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Timm Schneider with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead your line is open. ", "Timm Schneider", "Hey guys just real quick, and first of all I appreciate all the color you gave on the ethylene markets that was super helpful. I think it is funny as your call was going on Axio filed for Private Letter Ruling for their MLPs, so you already got someone for your fee base Geismar ethylene I guess.", "I mean, so I just want to switch over real quick then to the Northeast. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what the exit rate maybe was at OEM? And then secondly, have any of the producers up there actually pushed back to you and kind of had some look, can you give us a break on any of these rates that you guys are charging us in exchange for it will keep the volume going?", "Alan Armstrong", "Timm, sorry Jim Scheel, you want to take that please?", "Jim Scheel", "Sure, you know as we spoke last time we were pretty bullish about ending the year around 400. That didn\u2019t happen. We had a couple issues associated with some pretty significant CRPs that had some operational issues associated with producers actually having a much richer liquids content. So we\u2019ll expect that volume to show up later in the year as we install the equipment necessary to handle that quality issue that we faced at the end of the year. So we ended just over 300.", "We have been talking to our producers and as has already been talked about it, that number of different times we have a much different expectation for growth around OVM, but it is continued growth, it\u2019s just at a slower rate. We have had discussions with producers about renegotiation of agreements and that\u2019s not to go not without opportunities for us to improve on the base agreements that we had achieved with Cayman and negotiate some better terms.", "But at this point, those are just preliminary discussions and we have not made any commitments to make any changes, but obviously if we can create a win-win position with our producers we will be open to those discussions.", "Timm Schneider", "All right, super outlook, thank you guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions at this time. So I would like to turn the program back over our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Alan Armstrong", "Okay, great well thank you all very much, very excited about our future and really like how we've repositioned ourselves here and derisked our forecast substantially and yet still tremendous growth in distribution. And we think, best months it appears, considering our conservative forecast. So, thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to talking to you in the future.", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s program.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Porter", "Thank you, Joshua. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include yesterday\u2019s press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions and we also have the five leaders of Williams\u2019 operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL and Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P.", "In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Finally, I mentioned that we will webcast our annual Analyst Day on May 13, where we will provide an in-depth look at all of our businesses and our extensive backlog of in progress and potential projects. We hope you will join us for that session.", "So, with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great, thank you very much, John and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and I will jump right in here on Slide 2 with snapshot of our first quarter results. The highlight for the quarter was the completing of our merger of the two MLPs to create the new Williams Partners. And with this milestone achieved, we have created a leading natural gas focused MLP that\u2019s positioned to drive consistent long-term value for our investors. And this quarter\u2019s results also show very strong underpinning of growth in our fee-based revenues that will drive our growth for many years to come. And in fact, all five of WPZ\u2019s operating areas had fee-based revenue growth and four out of the five enjoyed double-digit percentage growth compared to first quarter of \u201814.", "And so the Northeast Gathering and Processing segment delivered an impressive 43% growth in fee-based revenues and that was even despite an outage on one of our \u2013 an ethane pipeline in the area and the Atlantic Gulf posted a very impressive 22% gain due to the first of many new projects coming online during the quarter and a continued build on the strength of that business and of course Access Midstream fee-based revenues continued their steady upward march going 11% over the prior year 1Q. We expect this growth in fee-based revenues to continue as we had major projects like our Keathley Canyon only start to contribute very late in the first quarter and big projects like the Rockaway Lateral and Leidy Southeast will provide substantial growth in 2Q and beyond. The weak spot for the quarter was NGL margins being off by $105 million versus the first quarter of \u201814 and our Geismar plant did not start consistently producing ethylene until late March. So, due to the strong growth in fee-based revenues and the strong contraction in commodity margins, actually 96% of our gross margin in the quarter came from fee-based revenues.", "Overall, our first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA was up 12% to $918 million and Williams received $515 million in distributions from Williams Partners, which is up from $455 million in the first quarter of last year. Overall coverage for WMB was at 1.14 times and this was after increasing our quarterly dividend per share up to $0.58, which was up from $0.40 last year.", "WPZ\u2019s coverage was lower than we would have liked, but even with the major drop in NGL margins, if just the base, Geismar volumes at the actual sales prices during the quarter had been producing we would have fully covered our distribution in the quarter. So, again, that\u2019s just the base Geismar volume, not the expanded and just at the actual prices so really shows, I think the strength that we are positioned for as we look forward to the Geismar volumes really starting to kick in here in the second quarter and then get to our full expanded growth volumes in June.", "I am also pleased that we are reaffirming our guidance today as it relates to WPZ distributions and WMB dividend. And for Williams, our guidance is $2.38 per share in 2015 with 10% to 15% annual dividend growth through 2017 and all that with growing coverage. And for Williams Partners, we are reaffirming our distribution guidance of $3.40 per share \u2013 per unit in 2015 with 7% to 11% annual LP unit distribution growth through 2017 also with growing coverage. So we are also reaffirming our EBITDA and dividend and distribution growth for both Williams and Williams Partners, but we do expect that 2015 to be near the low end of our ranges as we communicated in our 2014 year end conference call. And so this is really primarily due to three items here.", "One, the planning assumption that we have changed on the ethylene prices that we think now from a planning assumption, we have got that built in at closer to the first quarter actual prices of about $0.38 a pound for the balance of the year. And we think there will be some ups \u2013 we think there may be some upside of this, but we certainly want to be closer to current prices with our assumptions right now. Secondly, we have been informed by a couple of our Northeast producing customers that they will curtail Marcellus production as natural gas prices in the basin have been low and they will continue if they don\u2019t see this improve. So we have seen some price related curtailment. We haven\u2019t seen that fall into necessarily the drilling operations, but we have seen it in terms of just physical shut-in of production. And so this is going to dampen some of the expected growth from our Northeast volumes. However, we continue to feel very strong about the health \u2013 overall health of that business as demand for natural gas picks up and some of the extreme bottlenecks that exist in the Northeast started to be relieved. And then finally, we missed some revenues in the first quarter from Geismar and we are currently expecting to not get up to the full expanded plant rate until June. And, as you know, earlier we were expecting that to come on at the full expanded rate in April. So those are really the there items that are driving us down towards the lower end of our range for EBITDA and DCF.", "So with that, let\u2019s move on to Slide 3. This list really shows some of the large scale assets that we are executing on. As you can see, it\u2019s a long list and you will also see a tremendous amount of progress that occurred during the first quarter here. An important trend that you will see here is that a lot of these projects are really on the demand side of the business. And so the natural gas market as we have talked about, we think is going to continue to expand. It was first driven by low gas prices on the supply side and now we are seeing the demand side start to pick up. So whether in the near-term, with projects like the Rockaway Lateral, Mobile Bay South III and Leidy Southeast wherein the longer-term projects like Dalton Lateral and Virginia Southside II, the demand side of our network is really picking up and the request for proposals continue to come in for many market driven expansions.", "These projects, when we talk about for instance like the Dalton Lateral, they don\u2019t just include the laterals into the new markets, these projects also provide shippers with firm on our mainlines back to the supply point. So we are expanding our mainline all the way back to the supply points as we build out those laterals both, because as you know the Transco system is fully subscribed. So, really nice investment opportunities as the market expands. We have also put some of the mainline portions of our Virginia Southside and Leidy Southeast projects in service early. And we have been very busy at the FERC filing certificate applications for projects like Atlantic Sunrise, Dalton Lateral, Virginia Southside II and Garden State project.", "We also are seeing the market into our NGL business coming to life with projects like Bayou Ethane in Texas Belle being placed into service this quarter as well. And on the supply \u2013 and during the first quarter we commissioned the Bucking Horse plant in the Niobrara area. And that will now be reported over in our West segment. We also commissioned the Keathley Canyon Connector project and we have reached an agreement to acquire up to 21% interest in the Utica East Ohio gathering system from Enervest.", "The Keathley Canyon Connector, just a little more of that, we did receive first production from Anadarko\u2019s Lucius platform about midway through the quarter, but then in late March, we began receiving a very large volume of gas from Exxon's Hadrian field and so just a little more detail on that. The Lucius field, as you probably know is a deepwater oilfield and the Hadrian field is a gas field. And so really the power of that Keathley Canyon project because the Hadrian field didn\u2019t get turned on until towards the end of March, we really didn\u2019t enjoy a whole lot of Keathley Canyon Connector. But here in the second quarter that facility is really ramping up very nicely with some very strong volumes coming off of that as well as our Gulfstar project continues to build in production and volumes there as well. So as you can see, this list is fairly lengthy and it\u2019s a testament to our great teams that are working very hard everyday to execute on this very aggressive and robust growth plan. And we are really starting to see a lot of these projects come to fruition and we are beginning to see the financial benefits, a lot of tremendous efforts by our \u2013 all of our project teams that are executing.", "And so with that, let\u2019s move on to Slide 4. Just to close out here, first of all, the ACMP-WPZ merger, as we said really we think puts us in the position for the natural gas MLP with strong cash distribution growth and investment grade credit ratings. We do think it\u2019s the MLP to be exposed to amongst the large caps if you like the prospects of overall market growth for both natural gas and natural gas derivatives. We would remain very focused and dedicated to our strategy on that side. And we really feel very good about where we are positioned on that. And additionally, I would say on the merger, we have also build some confidence in the synergies and the cost reduction opportunities as the combinations of our businesses has preceded.", "We continue to commission and bring on these large scale assets. And the first quarter is a great evidence of that, which you are going to see throughout the next several years continued strength of these big projects coming online and really driving strong growth in our cash flows. I will remind you about 88% of our WPZ gross margin is we expect to come from fee-based revenues. And as mentioned, a combination of the strong growth in the fee-based revenues in the first quarter along with some very weak commodity margins actually drove that up to 96% in the first quarter. So we probably will be below that number here in \u2013 sorry, we will probably be above that 88% number here in 2015 by a combination of very strong fee-based revenues and less dependence on these weaker commodity margins here in 2015.", "And in fact, in about $9.3 billion of our 2015 through 2017 in-guidance growth CapEx, 99% of this growth CapEx is focused on fee-based projects with nearly $30 billion of committed and potential growth capital through 2020. So our strategy remains very sound and the backlog of projects to serve the demand side of the growing natural gas markets continues to build and it\u2019s also continuing to firm up. And we are very confident our plan is realistic and allows us to continue to provide solid shareholder return in whichever commodity price environment develops. All of this gives us great confidence that we will deliver high quality long lived cash flows from our competitively advantaged assets.", "And finally, I want to give you one last reminder about our Analyst Day being held on May 13. And as I said, you can find information related to this event on our website, as John pointed you to. And we really look forward to sharing with you our great future. And with that, we will open the line up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you so much sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Good morning, guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Shneur Gershuni", "I guess my first question is you sort of talk about a host of projects I think it\u2019s about $9 billion worth of capital to be spent over the next couple of years. I was wondering if you can sort of talk about plans to finance these assets? Is there enough EBITDA coming in place in 2015 that your leverage ratios can support you investing mostly in debt or alternatively will you need to rely on the equity markets as well too?", "Don Chappel", "Good morning, Shneur. This is Don. I think the beauty of it is those projects come in fairly ratably during this period. So, I think you can look at it as a continuation of the kind of organic growth that we have seen over the last several years. And we have a lot of that built into our near-term plans for 2015 as it is. So, not to say that there couldn\u2019t be some additions, but we think the capital additions would be relatively modest. It could require some additional debt and/or equity, but we think that will be pretty modest in 2015. Certainly, as you can see in our guidance, the capital falls off somewhat in \u201816 and \u201817 and that will be filled with some of these organic projects as they are contracted and/or sanctioned and we would expect a combination of debt and equity to finance those in the future.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Okay, great. And just a follow-up to some of your prepared remarks, you talked about the potential for drilled uncompleted wells in the Northeast, is this a scenario where we would see those volumes really manifest itself in the second half of this year after the summer smoothen gas prices that we typically see or is this something that could take longer to play out? And then, if you can also talk about what the impact would be on the legacy access assets as well too in terms of the fee of service rate structure that you have in place?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, sure. I will take that in the two parts there. First of all, just to clarify, what we actually are seeing is actual shut-in of existing flowing production. So \u2013 and my comment around the drilling operations was comprehensive to both the drilling and the completion. So, we are not seeing a lot of drilled wells not being completed, we are just seeing actual decisions to shut-in production because of extremely low netbacks in some of the constrained areas up in the far Northeast part of the Marcellus. On the second part of that question, ye, the areas that we see that we would obviously see that pickup to the degree that volume coming in lower we would see that affect the cost of service calculations for the future if those volumes didn\u2019t flow. And we will by the way, Bob Purgason is going to be given a nice tutorial of that at the Analyst Day and going to provide some more detail at our May 13, Analyst Day around the way some of those contracts work in this environment.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Cool. And one last follow-up, I was wondering if you can just talk about the Canadian oil fields business for a minute, margins have been challenged and so forth kind of like what steps Williams is taking to try and improve that and so forth or is it really just going to be dependent on the macro environment?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, great question. I would say that first of all extremely low pricing in the quarter on propane up there. And so, we actually saw Edmonton propane a lot of you probably don\u2019t follow Edmonton propane, because you just see the Belvieu and Conway postings, but Edmonton propane really actually got down to around a dime. So, it was quite a bit lower than the value of natural gas in the quarter. So, we did see some extremities up there in the Alberta markets in terms of seeing very low propane prices and that certainly did hamper and will continue to hamper. The long-term solution to that is great projects like our PDH project, which will provide great markets for those captive propane barrels up there. The propylene market remain actually pretty good and we are railing that out of there as part of our PDH project to the degree we go ahead with that, which we are excited about that project still and to the degree we go ahead with that, not only will that open up markets for the propane through the conversion to propylene, but also will provide a new market for the propylene there via the polypropylene unit that would be built downstream of our facility, but \u2013 and we wouldn\u2019t own that, but it would be part of the overall complex. And so we are working to open up markets if you will for those stranded products and so that\u2019s really the effort that we have growing about that. We also do have with that some structure contracts that will come, that will put some callers around the value of our products up there and help make that look more fee-based and take some of this extreme volatility that we have seen there.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Great. Thank you very much guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.", "Christine Cho", "Good morning, everyone.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Christine Cho", "So, I just wanted to touch on this \u2013 the acquisition of the 21% equity interest in UEOM. And given it was immediately accretive, you guys still are or at least WMB is waiving $43 million of IDRs between now and \u201817. Is this because the JV is reinvesting in the cash flow back into the business or is there something else going on?", "Don Chappel", "Christine, this is Don. Good morning. Williams chose to waive the IDRs, because it\u2019s a business that also has quite a bit of growth. So, the cash flows in the first year, first couple of years, are not nearly as robust as they are a few years out. So, that\u2019s really what made it immediately accretive is really the willingness of Williams to support the acquisition, because we think it\u2019s strategic one. And two, we think it will provide very attractive returns. Does that answer your question?", "Christine Cho", "I guess just a follow-up \u2013 actually, I will follow-up offline. Pricing for Geismar at least for the existing facility, I know that you have numerous contracts, but from what I understand at a high level, the reference pricing is Mont Belvieu, but I think you are actually selling it in Louisiana. So, are the contracts structured so that it\u2019s Mont Belvieu plus some fixed number on top of that, maybe $0.02 or $0.03, because that\u2019s what the customer would have to pay for transport if they were physically bringing it from Texas? And then it\u2019s \u2013 some of the expansion capacity that will be exposed to the actual spot pricing in Louisiana, which is currently $0.10 to $0.15 higher than Belvieu. Is that kind of how I should be thinking about it?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. Christine, actually those contracts are swaps back \u2013 a lot of those are swaps back to the Mont Belvieu market at Belvieu market. And so there are exchanges between parties that have product in the river versus \u2013 and parties that have demand at Belvieu. And so those are actually are setup as swaps. And so you shouldn\u2019t build anything on top of that. The way the business is structured of course there is a number of different contracts and there is quite a bit of complicity to it, but the way you really should think about it is that we have customers that have a call on about 80% \u2013 up to about 80% of our production at Geismar. And sometimes they will take all of that, sometimes they won\u2019t. If they don\u2019t take all of that, then we have the 20% plus whatever they leave for us to sell into the \u2013 physically sell into the Geismar market on spot. And so that\u2019s really how you should think about that. So, when we are operating at just the base rate, we won\u2019t have any excess available to sell in to that market, unless somebody doesn\u2019t call on that production for whatever reason, they might have a plant down or they maybe have a better price from somebody else and it might not call on that volume. And at that point, we would be free to sell it in to the highest value market wherever that is. So, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about that.", "Christine Cho", "I see. That\u2019s very helpful. And then what about the expansion capacity is that going to be the same way or that\u2019s going to be actually exposed to spot pricing in Louisiana?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, as you can think about a lot of the actual expansion, so \u2013 basis, we are running at about 70% of total expanded, which is very close to base rate. And so at the number I quoted at 80% is 80% of the full expanded rate. So at the base rate, we don\u2019t have any excess provided that people call on their volumes.", "Christine Cho", "I see. Okay, that was very helpful. Thank you. And then I guess could you also talk about expectations for the ethylene market maybe near-term and medium-term, it sounds like worldwide supply demand is pretty tight for the year and maybe was short in the U.S. next year, but any insight into what you are seeing would be helpful?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. I am going to ask John Dearborn to pick up on that, please.", "John Dearborn", "Yes. Thanks, Christine and thanks for the lead-in on the subject as well. So I guess from our perspective, we would be a bit bullish on ethylene as the year wears on, but we don\u2019t want to set an unrealistic expectation. But if we take a look at steadily increasing oil prices, strong demand, strong margins in the derivatives, certainly here in North America, we will be filling some underutilized assets in the Louisiana market. And we came into the year with relatively low inventories and so all of that I think would blend credence to a positive outlook on the year. Of course, how the market performs would \u2013 is yet to be proven.", "Christine Cho", "Great, thanks so much.", "Operator", "And next, we will move on to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.", "Carl Kirst", "Thank you. Good morning everybody. John, can we just kind of keep on the thread of the ethylene price for a second. And I guess I am trying to think of basically to Christine\u2019s question, you are trying to reconcile thinking that we would maybe be on a gradual strengthening through the year versus it sounds like Alan what you said for planning purposes, we are kind of keeping it more flat at this $0.38 level. And so I guess I am just trying to better understand what may \u2013 what\u2019s going to have to happen to kick the ethylene price back into the 4 years or where our midpoint of guidance is for \u201816 and \u201917, is there a gating event we should be watching or is it something as simple as quite frankly, just global GDP here?", "Alan Armstrong", "Thanks for the follow-on question. No, I think there are a number of factors that could play into the prices moving up. I think this is a natural tightening of the market as these markets the uses of ethylene growing year upon year globally into the very large markets at somewhere above 2% a year, somewhere about 3% a year, I am sorry. These global markets grow every year. And its okay, that supply has been \u2013 and there is not a lot of high coming in the next year or so. And so you could imagine it\u2019s going to be a continual thing you can just basically find on demand. Of course, we are going to un-restrict the market a little bit here but from Louisiana and Texas, that should be helpful to the Gulf Coast certainly to the Gulf Coast market. And I think the third factor that could play into this is with relatively low inventories coming into the year of ethylene. And we always predict rather high utilization rates on crackers. We have had a pretty good first quarter, but if there should be some mishaps in some crackers around the system in the Gulf Coast, of course that could provide a negative supply shock to the market, which would of course have an impact on prices. So I just think it\u2019s a general growth in the ethylene building markets that\u2019s going to continue to see us enjoy some positive pressure here. But I can\u2019t ever predict as how quick it\u2019s going to move. If we look at polyethylene today, polyethylene is selling somewhere around this $0.50 range. And so there is certainly plenty of margin in the changed matter of like a split between each of the products in the chain.", "Carl Kirst", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Alan and I understand you guys are going to be doing a deep dive here quite shortly, but is there any additional color perhaps to share, say for instance on Appalachian Connector at this point whether it\u2019s on a slow burn or I guess, is there anything incremental to add at this point?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, not a whole lot to add there at this point, Carl. I would just say the market is continuing to try to shape around that. And I would say it\u2019s a mix between \u2013 on our project is a mix between producer push and market pull and trying to find the right balance of that. And obviously, one of our primary goals there is to make sure that we have the very best market outlets available for our upstream assets coming out of OVM. And so that\u2019s an item that we have focused on pretty tightly and has I would just say, added some parameters and constraints to the project. And so that\u2019s one of the things though that from our advantage point, we are very focused on and we are very serious when we talk about connecting best supplies to best markets. We are very serious about making sure we accomplish that. And so that\u2019s really been one of the complicating factors on that. But we will have more to talk about at the Analyst Day on that.", "Carl Kirst", "Would it be fair if I think the last timing update is potentially late 2018 and the service if it all came together kind of working backwards, is it fair to say \u2013 well, to meet that date, you need to get commercial viability contracts by the end of 2015 as far as the potential target?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. I would say given some of the difficult areas that includes Appalachian Trail crossing and some forest \u2013 right around some forest service, I would say that\u2019s getting pretty late if it pushes back that far. So I think people are going to learn some lessons on that effort in terms of trying to get build through that difficult area.", "Carl Kirst", "Understood, I appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.", "Chris Sighinolfi", "Hey, Alan. How are you?", "Alan Armstrong", "Great. How are you doing?", "Chris Sighinolfi", "I am great. I just had a couple of questions. I am not sure if this is one for you or for Don, but I am just looking at the project sort of calendar, which slide that is, it looks like the CapEx on Atlantic Sunrise came down by a touch from the time you reported 4Q, it looks like about $200 million, just wondering what drove that?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, sure. Well, I would tell you that\u2019s pretty exciting news. And I would say that the \u2013 if you think about all of the resources and the \u2013 whether it\u2019s steel mills or skilled labor, if you think about all of the resources that we are supporting some massive drilling operations here in the U.S. and the fact that those are now slacking, we really are starting to see that come through even though it\u2019s a different area of the business, we are really starting to see that come through in our sector of the business as well. And so that reduction was based on a number of things. One was a firm we now acquired, our pipe is purchased and we saw that come in dramatically lower than our expectation for the price with the price of steel coming down. And we also are seeing much softer prices on the contractor rates for construction practices as well. So the team is doing a great job of really looking for any and every opportunity on that. And so we had quite a bit of contingency built into that. And so we are just taking \u2013 one of those is just actual prices of steel coming in much lower than we expected and some of the rest of that is taking some of the contingency out that we had built in there.", "Chris Sighinolfi", "So, Alan is that something we are likely to see on some of the other projects you are advancing or is it just given where Atlantic Sunrise was in the development phase at the time of the price collapse that was sort of squarely manifested on that project. And then as the second question, I think you had talked about a seven times multiple anticipated on that project in particular, is that now likely to be improved versus that prior estimate or given your assessment as to what was sort of captured originally is it unchanged?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. No, you are right. That will come \u2013 that will fall right to our bottom line because that project was negotiated, great projects. So whatever capital we save comes to us on that. And on the first part of your question around will we see it, that kind of savings trends into other projects, I would say absolutely. We are seeing some pretty big relief on major equipment, on steel prices and importantly on the availability of engineering and skilled labor resources. And so we certainly will see that come through. I would say though that before we write that into our books, while that is subsiding, I would say the regulatory environment for projects continues to get more and more difficult. And so we have to leave some contingency in there for that. So, the actual cost of construction for these projects, I think is definitely \u2013 the answer to that is definitely that is coming down, but clearly like we have seen on projects like constitution, where the regulatory format is \u2013 and several people have say so over it and sometimes are mutually exclusive requirements. Those kinds of complications I think will continue to hit the industry, particularly in areas where there is heavy population centers like in the Northeast, where a lot of the growth is.", "Chris Sighinolfi", "Yes. No, I understood. I guess switching gears my second question would be in regards to the ACMP side of business, I think you guys have reiterated the CapEx plan there roughly 21% of the $9.3 billion, with the CHK CapEx reduction already sort of anticipated by you in that number or is there downside to perhaps how much CapEx to put in the ACMP side in conjunction with a slowdown over at Chesapeake?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. Let me have Bob Purgason take that.", "Bob Purgason", "Yes. Chris, I think what you are seeing is the big build out on our systems has largely already occurred. So, even though we are seeing a slight kind of current decrease in capital in general, just you are not going to see something significant, because the infrastructure is built out.", "Chris Sighinolfi", "Okay. So, in terms of the cost of service modeling that we had done historically on the ACMP, the major driver of that is simply how much you could deploy in any time period? I guess what I am getting after is do you have much in the way of sort of visibility on that side of it certainly as we move past 2015 or are we sort of just cautiously trading along and watching what the producer CapEx might shakeout to be?", "Bob Purgason", "Yes. Well, again I think we will talk some more. In fact, I have got some good examples of how the cost of service models respond to this environment coming up at the Analyst Day, but again remember, the bulk of that build out was in the early years that\u2019s occurred. And we had planned always for the capital to tail off in the out years and then you have adjustment there for some contractual growth that happens as a result of that levelized rate. But again, it\u2019s, I would say, on plan to what we have expected in terms of current performance.", "Chris Sighinolfi", "Okay, great. Well, thanks guys for the help there. I look forward to more color on the 13th.", "Bob Purgason", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next, we will move on to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere", "Good morning, guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning, Craig.", "Craig Shere", "Don, to start with your answer to the equity issuance question didn\u2019t exactly sound like what I thought I heard on the last call when maybe you might have described \u201816/17 base case budget following de minimis equity issuance. Are you perhaps more agnostic as you see how commodity pricing shakes out and how does the CapEx deflation pressure Alan just referred to reflect on those kinds of decisions?", "Don Chappel", "Craig thanks for the follow-up. Again I was commenting on again what I think we have a modest amount of equity required to execute the plans in our guidance. However, obviously, we have a lot of other projects on the burner here. And I was really commenting on the fact that some of those additional projects would require some additional financing. I think that was part of that question. And that additional financing would be a combination of equity and debt. And the real guiding \u2013 the guidelines there are really maintaining our credit metrics and credit ratings. So, that will really be the guide. In terms of the way we are thinking about UEO right now, we are always thinking of that as more of a 13% acquisition versus the 21%, because we do expect that our partner will step up and acquire the 8% that they have a right to acquire.", "Craig Shere", "I got it. So, the base plant hasn\u2019t changed at all in terms of funding despite some of the first second quarter headwinds you all described?", "Don Chappel", "Yes, there is some I would call it modest changes obviously the UEO was certainly not part of the plan.", "Craig Shere", "Sure. And any further thoughts I am sure you will discuss it in a couple of weeks here, but around ACMP WPZ merger related commercial opportunities and CapEx savings over and above the $50 million cost synergies?", "Alan Armstrong", "Let me take that. I think the commercial opportunities continue to be very exciting, particularly in kind of the West Virginia and Southwest PA area. And so that\u2019s very attractive. And as well I would say the combination of our joint venture opportunities between in the Utica are also presenting some nice opportunities and the combination of the liquid clearing outlets for that business are very attractive to us as well. So, I would say the opportunities have probably been maybe even a little better than we thought, because we have got Access with providing basically a greater reach and some great capabilities in terms of well connect and compression addition in the area that really allows us to kind of expand the reach for OVM. So, we have got several deals that we are working right now that are fairly substantial and really are just firmly as a result of having those two capabilities brought together. So, we remain very excited about that.", "On the CapEx \u2013 sorry on \u2013 further on synergies, a measure I like to look at is what percentage of our overhead or our G&A costs are hitting us as a percentage of our fee-based revenues and that has come down pretty dramatically here over the last \u2013 as we look in \u201814 in other words we take all of our G&A expenses compared to fee-based revenues in \u201814 and look at that into 2015. That\u2019s come down pretty dramatically. And it\u2019s hard to move that number very big, because it is such big numbers, but that\u2019s a measure that I like to watch and that\u2019s improving very nicely which tells me we are able to use the scale of our overhead to grow our business and bottom line improve our net margins. So, both of those things are very positive. And I would say as well on the CapEx side, we are in general expense side we are finding things where we are able to take the best contract offerings, where we buy chemicals or lube oil or things like that on a procurement side and our supply chain management side, we are finding some good synergies there in taking the very best prices amongst the two entities.", "Craig Shere", "Great. That\u2019s helpful. And last question again I am sure we are going to hear some more, but is there anything more to speak on with regards to PDH and Geismar 2 opportunities?", "Alan Armstrong", "I would say that as I mentioned earlier the cost reductions that we are enjoying on the pipeline side were also seeing that on some of the heavy equipment side for project like PDH. And so as we are refining those estimates on PDH to come forward for our final investment decision on PDH, we have got a lot of positive tailwinds associated with lower cost on that. And we are hoping to be able to provide a little more detail about where we are on that at the Analyst Day Meeting in terms of the traction, but I would just say just generally the PDH project is moving ahead very nicely and we are more nearing having all the facts and figures in place to make a final investment decision on that. And then on Geismar 2, really strong interest in the project and I am pretty excited about the way that\u2019s positioned with some pretty attractive partners and I think that one is moving at the pace we would expect and we are excited about that as well. So both of those projects I would say continue to gain momentum.", "Craig Shere", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.", "Brandon Blossman", "Good morning, guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Brandon Blossman", "Alan, moving kind of to the longer dated end of your project backlog and thinking about what\u2019s out there, including potential projects, it looks like quarter-over-quarter, one, you have rolled forward a year, but two, you have added $5 billion to that big picture outlook, is that just a function of rolling forward or is there quite a few incremental projects in that outlook?", "Alan Armstrong", "There are a few incremental projects in the outlook and I would say that we also \u2013 I am proud to say we are firming up some things as well as some projects in the kind of the medium-term that have \u2013 that we have added in there that just kind of came to us unexpectedly that have been added. So several of the market-type expansions for instance on Transco, but we have also got some sizable opportunities as the market continues to build out for the LNG. Transco, of course is extremely well positioned to serve many of the LNG projects. And so we have gone through some very successful open seasons and so that\u2019s adding some projects. And as well, we have got some opportunities to with \u2013 into serving Mexico that are \u2013 have come on the radar screen as well. So overall, it\u2019s a combination of new projects kind of in the medium-term that have been added in and are firming up very nicely and further out on the back end some of these new projects that has Transco serving markets in the southern end of its system.", "Brandon Blossman", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess fair to assume that we will hear more about that at Analyst Day or all those projects. Third question for you even bigger picture. Are we kind of firmly moving as it relates to Transco but gas transport in general, are we moving from a temporary supplier-driven project Q2 much more weighted towards demand things and demands in your project?", "Don Chappel", "We absolutely are and I am really excited to see that. I think all along, we have thought that this natural gas market growth would come \u2013 has been supply-led and obviously that\u2019s put lower prices out, which is just further encouraged the confidence in the demand side just are taking advantage of that and we are really starting to see that come through on our systems on the natural gas side. But we also, I think we remain really excited about that as it relates to the natural gas, liquids and the Petchem space and positioning ourselves to be able to serve that growing market as well. So I would say the natural gas market expansion is upon us. And we are seeing that through all of these RFPs and all this growth in our system. And we would try to be ahead a little bit of the NGL Petchem build out. And we are very confident that with the expansion going on in that space, it\u2019s going to take a lot more plumbing and storage to serve that growing market. As we positioned our self well for that and the Bayou Ethane project and Texas Belle are just kind of the front end of those opportunities for us.", "Brandon Blossman", "Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate the color.", "Don Chappel", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi.", "Eric Genco", "Good morning. I was wondering is kind of piggybacking on some of these CapEx questions, is there some building conservatism to your maintenance CapEx guidance of $430 million, because the roughly $15 million this quarter seemed \u2013 is that really just seasonality or is there sort of a hint there that maybe that\u2019s some built-in conservatism?", "Don Chappel", "No, I wouldn\u2019t go put that in the bank. That is seasonality and we typically see that in the first quarter. We have got winter weather and we have got the crews tied up on meeting peak demands. We hit some extreme peaks on our system here in the first quarter and so that\u2019s a really bad time to be to be maintenance on your pipelines. And so you will see those dollars increase here over the summer months. You will see as our work crews are out doing those \u2013 doing the maintenance on our pipelines, you will see that pick right back up.", "Eric Genco", "Okay. And then my second question, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on sort of the Canadian side of things, is the Canadian PDH facility all included in some of the CapEx guidance that you have given for the MB side of things?", "Don Chappel", "No, it is not included in guidance. It is in that potential pie, the $30 billion, but it is not in the $9.3 billion guidance.", "Eric Genco", "Okay. I am just trying to, I guess, get a sense of the different pieces of what\u2019s there because I kind of look through the projects that are there, it looks like their horizon upgrader comes on 4Q \u201815, is that in parts of PV through 2015 [ph], Texas Belle build through 2015. There is - and then kind of looking at that relative to the CapEx guidance of $260 million for growth for 2015, $185 million for \u201816, what - I guess what are some of the $185 million in \u201816 and just to try to understand how the capital spend is going there, because it really if you look at and I understand that there are some commodity issues that work but given kind of the way it looks like some of those things are coming on, I just want to understand what I am missing because it looks like for an incremental $35 million of EBITDA over that period of time, but $445 million in over those 2 years, I am just trying to understand that and what\u2019s missing?", "Alan Armstrong", "I am not sure exactly what you are looking at.", "Don Chappel", "For the segment capital guidance there.", "Eric Genco", "It's on Slide, maybe not 17, but probably close.", "Alan Armstrong", "And so your question is where is the profitability from all of that capital spending that\u2026?", "Eric Genco", "Well, there is that and then maybe also just the timing of what is \u2013 what\u2019s going on in \u201816 that requires $185 million, if Horizon comes along in 4Q \u201815 and the ethane pipe and then what Texas Belle in \u201815, where is sort of the \u2013 where is that going and what\u2019s the incremental?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, great question. And as I mentioned on the previous response, we really are excited about being kind on the tip of the iceberg and building out the infrastructure for the Petchem expansion. And so a lot of that capital in \u201816 is focused on building out for what we think is a growing position on the Petchem side there. And so we are putting quite a bit of capital to work building out some of these legacy systems that we bought a couple of \u2013 2 years or 3 years ago, we bought quite a bit of a latent pipeline down there from parties like Exxon and BP and Explore. And so this capital is putting a lot of those pipelines to work making interconnections, extending them, expanding them and pushing them into those markets. And so that\u2019s what a lot of that capital was.", "Eric Genco", "Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Alan Armstrong", "And you can see some of those projects on I believe its Slide 37, I believe it is, you can see some of the detail. And we will be providing some more detail in the Analyst Day on that.", "Eric Genco", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And next, we will move on to Mark Reichman with Simmons & Company.", "Mark Reichman", "Good morning. Alan has alluded to some of the challenges in receiving permits, etcetera. And so just wanted to ask if you could just walk us through the process of bringing Constitution in service in the second half and what variables could lead to and in-service date at the front end versus the latter part of the year. And maybe expand your answer to talk a little bit about some of the regulatory challenges of some of these projects that are listed on Page 18 of the data book and your expectations with regard to how they apply to the expected in-service dates?", "Alan Armstrong", "Question, and then I am going to ask Rory to give you some more detail on the Constitution project and what\u2019s going on. The projects that many of which are on Page 18 there, many of those projects are along our existing right of way. And so to agree they are along are existing right of way, much less public resistance and certainly that\u2019s one of the huge advantages of Transco is that it\u2019s already got right of way in the extremely heavily populated areas that are very difficult to establish any new routes and so most of those projects are expansion along that existing right of way. You can see that one big exception is that leg coming down on Atlantic Sunrise. But our team has really gotten ahead of that and it\u2019s done a nice job of getting out and getting some of the tougher areas of right of way pin down on that one.", "And so I would say we are very fortunate to have the established right of ways that we have. And I would say Constitution is an example of one where we didn\u2019t have existing right of ways. And I think as kind of foreshadows what the industry is up against in terms of getting new pipelines built in areas like this. And particularly, as you get further into New York and New England area, it gets more difficult as you get into those areas. And everybody wants lower priced energy, but nobody wants the pipeline in their backyard and that\u2019s simply the issue that we are facing here. And we really need some political leadership to really establish an energy policy that would encourage and help the public understand the benefit of having these lower priced energy into their areas. On the Constitution piece, I am going to turn that over to Rory to talk about the detail to permitting them.", "Mark Reichman", "And just quickly is it challenged more at the state level, it\u2019s more at the state level than the federal agencies, correct?", "Alan Armstrong", "It is certainly in general that is correct. In the case of Constitution it is almost squarely on the state there. But the challenge is when the feds have delegated their authority to the state and the state doesn\u2019t see it as something they critically need. That\u2019s the reason we have interstate commerce laws and so that one state can\u2019t block another state from enjoying the benefits of infrastructure. And yet in some of these cases for whatever reason the feds have delegated some of their authority and that is where we run into some of these problems. Rory will take the permit, please thanks.", "Rory Miller", "Okay. That was a great runway to kind of where we are at from a regulatory standpoint to get this project in service. I think everybody is aware that sometime ago we got our FERC certificate for this project. But as Alan pointed out, some of the permitting had been delegated to the state of New York. We have most everything we need other than the New York DEC final permit on this project. We do have all of our land and right-of-way secured. We are what I would say \u2013 what I would call in the final pros of working through some final details on some wetlands issues and the New York DEC I feel like it really rolled up their sleeves and working with us very closely on trying to get the remaining questions answered. And we are very optimistic that we are going to be getting a permit here in the next couple of months. And I believe there is also Corp of Engineers permit that would follow that. But that\u2019s more of a sequencing issue than an issue where we expect any type of dispute or anything like that.", "Once we get started and like I said we believe that will be in a couple of months and take about a year to construct, that\u2019s not exactly right, but for planning purposes just figure a year or so. If we get the New York DEC permits than the permits from the Corp of Engineering which would follow say middle of the summer then we can be in service in the middle of the summer in 2016. If they come in later just kind of use that year timeline as how much we would move back in-service date. But I would say in general right now I feel better about this Constitution project and where we are at than I have in the last 2 years. Things have really been coming together. People have been very engaged at the agencies. They are trying to do their job. And I think because of the climate in New York, their standard is very high. But they are just going to make sure that they have all of their ducks in a row and I think we are very close to that point.", "Mark Reichman", "So if the DEC is taking public comments until May 14, then you think that they could file or grant the permit say in the June timeframe?", "Rory Miller", "I think that\u2019s the case. This latest re-filing that we did with New York DEC was merely procedural. In fact the year prior we had done the exact same thing but we basically canceled and re-filed with all the existing information that we have been building up in the project. And in fact the New York DEC came out and said, they required to have this open comments period, but they said look, we have already commented, we got your comment, we are going to be using and considering all the previous comments that have been supplied. So the additional 14 day period would be for if there are any new comments that hadn\u2019t already been covered by the previous comment period then those would come in. But I think all of that\u2019s has been run down to ground pretty sufficiently and I don\u2019t really see that as introducing any new risk into the timeline that we see before us now.", "Mark Reichman", "And not to flog it too much more, but \u2013 so this was for the water quality certificate application, so what about the air title permit related to the compression station upgrade?", "Rory Miller", "I think we have got all that. This water issue is the issue that\u2019s really kind of the last has been push we need to get through.", "Mark Reichman", "Okay great. Thank you very much for the color.", "Rory Miller", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we will move to Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Lasky", "Good morning. Just curious on the shut-in volumes, can you just quantify the impact of that for the quarter or just the magnitude going forward?", "Alan Armstrong", "I am sorry could you repeat that?", "Brian Lasky", "The shut in volumes, yes, can you quantify that?", "Alan Armstrong", "Sure. One of the probably most obvious pieces on that as Cabot has made some announcements on that. And we expect that to be to between about $300 million and $500 million of shut in volumes over a number of that would grow and we think that\u2019s probably for about five months or six months. So and most of that we think will just be here in the second quarter, during the shoulder months. And so they can make good money at very low prices up there. But when the systems are full up there and there is not enough market. They really get \u2013 the spot incremental sale gets extremely low and puts pressure on their other productions since they are such a large producer in the region they tend to put pressure against their own sales. And so we think this is short-lived but and maybe second and into the third quarter a little better, but that\u2019s about it. So that\u2019s the amount we expect.", "Brian Lasky", "Got it. And then just on your \u2013 I was wondering if you could just walk us through high level I am sure you will go through this more at the Analyst Day, but just high level how you guys are thinking about volumes across your gathering and processing in the West and Northeast kind of the balance of the year, if you could provide kind of a high level trajectory of how you are thinking about that?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. Sure. I would say in the West volumes continue to remain pretty flat, pretty steady out there and the rate escalators that we have in our contracts over time have basically after gathering our fee-based gathering revenues extremely flat in the West despite some pretty light declines. And so I would \u2013 I think we would expect that to continue. I think the bigger question will come into the \u201916, \u201917 timeframes in terms of what kind of continued drilling might occur. The one area we are seeing some continued activity that our team has done a great job of capturing is in the San Juan Basin, particular with the Mancos play and the team has done a great job of continuing to capture that business. And of course the volumes in Bucking Horse will continue to grow and that plant just got really as we speak is really just getting lined out to build a ramp up to full throughput on that facility.", "So those are kind of the drivers that I think will keep us relatively flat. And we will just have to wait and see what holds for \u201816 and \u201817 depending on gas prices and how those move over time. In the Northeast, I would say continued very, very impressive production rates from wells particularly the Utica dry the wet really have kind of for somewhat \u2013 to some degree of kind of not built into our plan, but we are seeing more and more evidence that the combination of the Utica dry along with the Marcellus wet particularly around our OVM system is some pretty powerful combination of the economics for producers. And of course the other side of that coin is the great success that they are having is continuing to put pressure on the bottlenecks and constraints getting out of the area. And so, again I think we are excited about seeing all of this demand pool coming into the market on our Transco system because we know where there are some great supplies that can help feed that for years to come and continue to grow the market steadily. But I think we are going to continue to see pretty moderate drilling in the Marcellus and the Utica as forecast. We don\u2019t see really big changes to that. And I think really the only surprise to this for the quarter was just the shut-ins due to lower prices was really the only surprise we have seen on the volume side.", "Brian Lasky", "Got it. So would you characterize what you are seeing thus far in the first quarter is pretty consistent with what you are planning in the guidance?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes.", "Brian Lasky", "Absent the shut-ins? ", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. Very close to it, staying right in line with our expectations.", "Brian Lasky", "And then maybe just one last question. You talked a little bit about the dry gas Utica, and then \u2013 and one of your competitors that are out there talking about potential opportunity there and I was just wondering if you guys could talk about the competitive dynamics for some of those opportunities that you are seeing right now with the increase in the number of MLPs up in the region and also in light of what\u2019s going in the broader commodity environment?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. I would just say whoever has got the pipe in place and has the best market outlet is probably going to win that business up there. And we have positioned ourselves very well to get that accomplished. And anybody can always come in and buy business and so forth. But I think we are positioned to really make a nice return on our investment by just capturing the business that is \u2013 that we are well positioned to capture in the area. And so I think we will continue to do that. But clearly, one of the key issues up there is going to be a multitude of market outlets, not just any one market outlet, but multiple market outlets. And we are trying to make sure as we grow our system, we are really investing our efforts in making sure that we have got best market outlets for the gas up there. And so that\u2019s involved a large team on both our marketing side, on the gathering end as well as our team from Transco and our Atlantic Gulf team really trying to make sure we are providing very best market outlets for the producers up there. And just like that, it\u2019s always been a winner for Southwest, we think that will be a winner for us in the Northeast as well long-term.", "Brian Lasky", "And just one final one on Appalachian Connector there, do you have to negotiate directly with the park service there, is that how that one works and does that require enact of Congress, can you just maybe just walk through the regulatory process for that project in particular and kind of what you guys have baked into your timeline in terms of the regulatory schedule?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. Maybe we will get into that level of detail a little more at the Analyst Day, I will just say we worked pretty hard to stay away from areas that would require that kind of protracted permitting requirements in the area. But it\u2019s an area that requires some pretty careful orchestration to step through. And we will provide some more detail on that \u2013 on the Appalachian Connector at the May analyst meeting.", "Brian Lasky", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Abhi Rajendran from Credit Suisse.", "Abhi Rajendran", "Hi guys, good morning.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Abhi Rajendran", "Couple of quick questions, now that the commodity backdrop has stabilized a little bit do you have any update on the drop down of the remaining NGL Petchem projects at WMB level, I know last update you guys gave was that was going to get pushed out maybe later in the year, but any update or color there will be helpful?", "Don Chappel", "Abhi, this is Don. Really, no update at this point, we can talk more about it at the Analyst Day. But there is no urgent need to do it. And certainly, we feel better about it when equities are trading better. So that\u2019s kind of where we stand.", "Abhi Rajendran", "Okay, got it. And then last quick one for me. Looking ahead to Analyst Day, are you guys thinking about sort of reintroducing the segment level guidance which you had last year would kind of help give some color by segment what\u2019s going on to volumes and margins and whatnot?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. Abhi, I would just say we haven\u2019t confirmed that yet and so just stay tuned for Analyst Day.", "Abhi Rajendran", "Okay, got it. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next, we will move on to Timm Schneider with Evercore.", "Timm Schneider", "Hey, good morning guys. Most of my questions have been answered, so I have a macro question for you guys. How do you see the Northeast NGL scenario kind of play out, right, so one of your peers is saying they are going to be running at 90% utilization just firing NGLs into the base and you are getting into the shoulder season where it\u2019s another real propane demand basically lack of storage, how do you think about realizations up in the Northeast and getting those NGLs to a home where they are actually needed?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, great question, Timm. And as you know we have been concerned about this since the Bluegrass days and we remain very concerned about the clearing of liquids out of the area. And I think unfortunately, the answer is they are going to get cleared out there by rail. And just as evidenced, what\u2019s going on in that space, our Conway rail facility for the first time that I can ever remember is even though we have dramatically expanded our rail position \u2013 our rail rack position there at Conway, our inbound which I don\u2019t ever remember this occurring, our inbound capacity on rail is fully contracted for the summer months. And so I think that tells you kind of what\u2019s going on, which is all those products getting put on rail and it is going to any home again for storage and Conway is an attractive place for that. And of course Conway then has great access into the Bellevue markets when it\u2019s needed there as well. So I think that\u2019s what we are going to see, I think already seeing it. And I think the wholesale marketers of the NGLs have realized that\u2019s one of the few places that you can clear those liquids and then sell them into the market as the market demands them. So I think that\u2019s what we are going to continue to see more of the beneficiary that there with Conway. And if anything, we are probably guilty of under-pricing that service given how strong the demand has been there.", "Timm Schneider", "That\u2019s interesting. Can you tell us how much of it is to rail from the Easter Conway?", "Alan Armstrong", "No, I don\u2019t have the detail on exactly what that rate is.", "Timm Schneider", "Got it. And in terms of building additional storage in the Northeast, specifically I realize it\u2019s all above ground storage because it\u2019s simply reservoirs and that doesn\u2019t really work for NGLs, do you have any sense of how much more it is to build storage in the Northeast than in the Gulf Coast?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, I would \u2013 if you don't have a salt formation, you really don\u2019t have a very attractive place or a few projects that we have been looking at through the Access team and looking at some areas to try to develop that, but I would just say it is the scale of opportunity is very limited for storage because you don\u2019t have the big salt lands like you do in either the Conway area or the Gulf Coast area salt land has provided the opportunity for storage. Without that, it's very difficult \u2013 and frankly that\u2019s one of the reasons that the Gulf Coast Petchem space is continuing to be prolific for year after year after year as one it has access in ports, but also it\u2019s got the great advantage of salt dome storage for both the raw \u2013 feedstocks as well as the finished product. And that\u2019s in the Olefin\u2019s basins. So those are the big advantages. And frankly, I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. So, very expensive to build any kind of storage capability in the Northeast, because mostly it\u2019s going to be above ground storage capabilities.", "Timm Schneider", "It sounds like your view that Northeast in fact does need another export solution over call it the next 2 year or 3 years?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes.", "Timm Schneider", "Okay, thank you.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thanks, Timm.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we will move on to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.", "Jeremy Tonet", "Good morning. Thanks for all the color this morning, it\u2019s been very helpful. I just wanted to touch base \u2013 here has been some chatter in the marketplace for the potential of a family level consolidation to improve the family\u2019s cost of capital. Our impression has been that there is not really any rush or need to do that, do something like this right of way that we can give the post-ACMP structure a chance to prove itself and earn a re-rating from the market. I was just wondering if you can provide any thoughts on Williams cost of capital and any other updates or thoughts on family level consolidation if that makes sense?", "Don Chappel", "Jeremy, this is Don. I think we have discussed that periodically in the past in terms of pros and cons. And we do believe that WPZ is positioned to improve its cost of capital. So you know we don\u2019t have that here today and we can certainly talk more about that during Analyst Day.", "Jeremy Tonet", "Okay, fair enough. Thanks.", "Don Chappel", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Ms. Cho, please check your mute function.", "Christine Cho", "Sorry. I just had two very quick follow-ups. The 80% swap at Geismar to Bellevue when does that roll off, if at all?", "Alan Armstrong", "You know there is a multitude of contracts there Christine and so none of them \u2013 they don\u2019t all start in, but typically they are not real long-term contracts that are established in that market. But there is a variety of terms on those contracts.", "Christine Cho", "And then with the maintenance CapEx, I know you kind of addressed the regulated maintenance CapEx, but what about for the well connects, I mean if we are seeing a slowdown in drilling and completion could there be \u2013 could that number have come in lighter than you expected?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, slightly. But as Bob pointed out we have got a lot of catching up to do still. We are still working off of quite an inventory of getting caught up. So even if the drilling does slowdown we still \u2013 the well connects will still keep coming for quite some time.", "Christine Cho", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ross Payne with Wells Fargo.", "Ross Payne", "How are you doing guys?", "Alan Armstrong", "Great, how are you?", "Ross Payne", "Good. I was wondering if you can give us a little more detail on the Geismar startup kind of getting pushed back into June, are there other issues outside of the heat exchangers that you talked about in Q4 and has anything really changed from Q4 to where we stand today in terms of trying to get it up fully to specs? Thanks.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. Thank you and appreciate the question. It allows us to spend a little bit, because we really haven\u2019t hit that much today. And a couple of things I really want to point out there, one is that we did have the major equipment for the expansion up and running. And so and in fact as we sit here today we are utilizing many of the components of the expansion facility. So contrary to what probably you would be left to believe, it\u2019s not like we have just got the base plant sitting over here running and the expanded plant is sitting idle. We are utilizing in this period a lot of the big elements like the furnaces for instance on the expanded facility. And in fact we had the major equipment up and rolling when we had this transformer fail on us.", "And so I think that\u2019s very good news because we been able to test all of the major components. And in fact we are using this time period to put load test on the expansion parts of the facility. But at the end of the day this EBR system is what is bottlenecking if you will the production on the plant, on the ethylene side of the plant. And until we get that transformer back in then we can\u2019t go on with the rest of the plant. So the good news is we are not sitting here wondering about the rest of the major equipment in the expanded plant. We have actually been able to utilize it and get it up and tested. And so really this is \u2013 I hate to \u2013 there is nothing simple in a big complex plant like this, but to try to put in simple terms, we have got the plant \u2013 the expanded plant has been up and tested. And it\u2019s a matter of getting this transformer repaired at the manufacturer\u2019s facility and getting it plugged back in. And we did run that compressor that this transformer drives and everything was fine with that compressor. And so it\u2019s just a matter of getting the transformer plugged back in.", "Ross Payne", "Okay. And in the last conference call you guys talk about the heat exchangers getting up to about 70%. Are you comfortable now that they can get all of the way up to 90% plus or are there other things that you need to do on that front? Thanks.", "Alan Armstrong", "Again we have kind of had the luxury, unfortunately we have had the luxury of time in getting some of those things that lined up. And we have gotten \u2013 we had some fouling and some residue oil coating on some of those highly efficient exchangers and we have gotten those cleaned up and they are performing very well now.", "Ross Payne", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you and that will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great. Well thank you all very much. Appreciate all the great questions. And we certainly are excited about bringing all of these projects and we really look forward to talking to you in more depth here on May 14. Thank you for joining us.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John D. Porter - Head-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Julia. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com.", "These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us. Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL and Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P.", "In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to General Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Great. Thank you, John and thanks everybody for being on the call this morning. We've got a lot of things to cover today, but before we discussed the second quarter results, I'd like to briefly comment on the WMB Board Strategic Alternatives process that's underway. And as you'll recall, Williams announced on June 21 that it planned to explore a range of strategic alternatives that could include among other things, a merger, a sales of Williams or continuing to pursue the company's existing operating and growth plan.", "A robust competitive process, we believe, is the best way to get the best options on the table and to maximize shareholder value and the board's review is meant to accomplish just that. The process is underway and we're pleased with the progress to-date.", "As I'm sure you'll understand we do not intend to comment further on this thorough review of these alternatives before the WPZ transaction today and we won't be commenting further on that until the process is completed and a more definitive course of action is determined by the board.", "In the meantime and I can assure you that our focus remains on maximizing value and we continue to act in the best interests of our shareholders as we through this process. And so, with that, let's move on to the first slide and talk about the tremendous growth that we enjoyed in the second quarter and a strong trajectory of growth in front of us.", "So look here on slide two, the package, here in the second quarter, certainly, demonstrates the benefits from our clearly defined strategy of capitalizing on the significant natural gas market growth by connecting the very best supplies to the best markets. We've been on this strategy for quite some time and is really starting to deliver a lot of significant growth, particularly in our fee-based revenues.", "For this quarter, WMB's adjusted EBITDA was $1.02 billion, up 32% versus second quarter of 2014 and at WPZ, we had a record distributable cash flow of $701 million and delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $1.01 billion, which was driven by fee-based revenue growth.", "Overall, we had solid performance from four of our five segments, and the performance was delivered despite the fact that volumes were lower in some areas, as a result of price related shut-ins and also because we are operating in a historically low commodity price environment. So when we say lower, just we mean lower than they could have been. We actually had very significant growth in lot of those areas, but certainly, significant impact from volumes being shut in from gas prices.", "So let me walk through some of the numbers here. First of all, in the Atlantic-Gulf, really the strong performance from Atlantic-Gulf, $389 million in adjusted EBITDA and this was up 44% on fee-based revenues from new projects. And this group really is managing a tremendous amount of growth, and just keeps on delivering this growth in a very safe and reliable manner, so couldn't be prouder of all the great work going on there.", "At Access, $345 million, up 25% on fee-based revenue growth, and I have to say that certainly we're pleased with the contributions being made from this acquisition, and it's not just the predictable growing cash flows that we all expected, but I would tell you, probably, the piece that's been most impressive from my perspective is the great injection of new talent and ideas that are coming from our new fellow Williams' employees that came from this acquisition.", "So integration and the synergies are going even a little better than expected there and we continue to see great opportunities out in front of us, as we take in a lot of the ideas and we merge the entities, particularly seeing a lot of opportunity up in the Northeast and we're really starting to get into some of the synergies within our operational excellence and E&C areas as well.", "In the Northeast G&P, this is $92 million, up 21% and impressively on 54% higher Ohio Valley Midstream gathering volumes, so really starting to see that come through and noted that the team had a record volume there just this week, and really pushing out some big numbers there, as those volumes start to come in and I'll let Jim Scheel address that later.", "In the Northeast, in general, I would say that as the face of the energy in the U.S. has changed over the past years and where it's coming from, we have certainly worked very hard to get ourselves into a position to unlock the tremendous value of the Marcellus and the Utica areas like never before.", "And we have put ourselves in a position and we are the leading gathering systems in the Northeast. And we believe our shareholders are going to see great long term value from this tremendous position that we've been able to accumulate in the Marcellus and Utica position.", "On to the West, EBITDA was $150 million, and this was down 27%. But as we mentioned, this really was driven by lower NGL margins and so that really was the big story out there. But I will tell you, from an operational standpoint, continuing to see great performance there on both reliability of our operations out there and the safety of our operations out there. And in fact, in the quarter, our gathering volumes were flat really as compared to the prior quarter and as the year-over-year quarterly comparison and our equity gallons, so the gallons that we take for our account, and our plant inlet volumes were both higher on a year-over-year comparison. So West continues to hold its own, but certainly impacted by lower prices there in the second quarter.", "And then in the NGL and Petchem space, the adjusted EBITDA was just $33 million and that number is certainly lower than last year due to the absence of the business interruption proceeds that we reported in the second quarter of 2014. And the near zero prices for propane that we saw in the Edmonton spot prices from our Canadian operations.", "But this, of course, was a little bit offset by the Geismar, as Geismar began to ramp up here in the second quarter. But really that was probably the disappointment from my perspective, for the quarter, was not getting Geismar up as soon as we would have liked to, and we did have some very serious electrical power problems on the feed into the plant and we've gotten that behind us now, but it has certainly hampered our operations there in the second quarter.", "So once again, I want to reiterate the overall growth our teams are delivering, and we've begun to enjoy the fruits of our labor as we manage the tremendous growth that we really have thought very hard to win on our Transco system in the deepwater, and certainly, in the Northeast G&P, and we expect big improvement now in our NGL and Petchem services group for the balance of 2015, with Geismar now online and Horizon coming on towards the very end of 2015.", "Moving on to the next slide here \u2013 sorry I'm going back to \u2013 stay back on the slide sorry. When you look at our results this quarter, you'll see that our fee-based revenue growth really is coming through in a big way and pretty powerful the way it overpowered lower commodity prices in the quarter. And I think that's really important that we are executing on that strategy in a big way of shifting our business to fee-based revenues and this quarter is an example of where that really pushed through what was some really strong headwinds on the commodity price this quarter.", "And in fact, at WPZ, our fee-based revenues were up $537 million or 72%, and while a lot of that was driven by the Access acquisition, a lot of this came through our major projects that we're ramping up. And so, if you look at just the WPZ historic assets, our fee-based revenues were up 17%. And this doesn't include fee-based revenues from things like our proportional JVs. So for assets like Discovery, which of course got a big boost from the Keathley Canyon project coming on and our UEO investment in the Utica, big improvements in fee-based revenues there, but given the way we account for that, that does not show up in that $130 million of incremental fee-based revenues.", "On the NGL margin side, we certainly experienced some serious headwinds and our NGL margins were down $56 million here for the second quarter of 2015. In fact, we only recorded $38 million of NGL margins for the quarter, and it's been a long, long time since we had that low a report for NGL margins.", "The Geismar plant, just to mention what's going on there, did ramp up in the second quarter. And albeit that was slower than we expected, but it is now online and consistently operating at or near its full production capacity and we expect significant contributions from the plant here in the second half of the year, as I mentioned earlier.", "On a personal note, I'd just like to recognize that that leadership team there at Geismar has been through a lot. And I want to recognize the fact they have really kept their eyes on getting that plant back up in a safe manner, and they continue to hit some really impressive safety records there, despite a tremendous amount of activity going on at the plant there. And I can't tell you how hard that team has worked to get the plant back up and running safely and I'm very appreciative of their efforts.", "And so, let's move on to guidance. First of all, we are reaffirming our Williams dividend guidance for 2015 through 2020. And I would point out that the guidance that we've provided is based on an assumption of the completion of the acquisition of the Williams Partners public units by Williams.", "We are also reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 through 2018, although we are lowering the 2015 adjusted EBITDA midpoint guidance that we issued in February by about 6%. And of course, this reflects the lower commodity prices that are showing in the market right now for the balance of the year, and as well the problems that we had at Geismar and the ramp-up in the second quarter. So the Geismar impact of that is really already in our second quarter, and the balance of that lowering is coming through commodity prices for the balance of the year.", "We also are reaffirming our dividend of $0.64 per share in third quarter of 2015, or $2.56 annualized, and also our dividend of $2.85 in 2016 with 10% to 15% annual dividend growth coming through 2020.", "And so, on to the last point on this slide, certainly, a tremendous amount of growth continues to come at us. And I want to say that we're very excited about how the major projects that are now contributing on the fee-based revenue side are really starting to drive our business and also a lot of projects that are on our list right now that will continue to build the stream of growing cash flows for years to come.", "Now, moving on to the next slide here and this is slide four. First of all, the projects that are beginning to contribute. We said back in the first quarter at our Analyst Day in May that the demand side of the natural gas market is driving our project list and we are really reinforcing that here again today. And as we look at some of the significant projects that we put into service here in the second quarter, it's easy to see that we've really been executing and delivering on these projects.", "And here, as you look at the second quarter, for example, on our Transco system, you can see here we delivered three very important projects in the quarter: the Rockaway Lateral and the Northeast Connector project that goes with the Rockaway Lateral, so \u2013 but two independent projects there.", "The Mobile Bay South 3 project, we brought into service in April of 2015, and that was on time and on budget. And our CPV Woodbridge project, which was brought into service on schedule and below budget. And our New York Bay expansion project, just one more example, we did make our FERC application in July here just recently as well.", "So a lot of hits just keep coming on the Transco side. Gulfstar One, these big projects that we put on into service at the end of the first quarter really provided a lot of strong contribution here in the second quarter. And the production volumes from the Tubular Bells prospect there does continue to grow. And in fact, the fourth well was just brought on recently there by the operator.", "Our Discovery Keathley Canyon Connector, certainly drove our proportional JV EBITDA in the quarter. And again, these are fee-based revenues that are coming from Exxon's Hadrian facility and Anadarko's Lucius facility. Our Discovery system is running completely full now, and we are really liking the prospects that sit around the Keathley Canyon system and the kind of high margin business that will continue to flow in on this system that is so well-positioned now in the Keathley Canyon.", "We also completed an acquisition of the Fox Creek gathering and treating system. And this expands Access's Eagle Ford footprint. And as we said in the last call, we expected to see producer systems come into the M&A space and this acquisition is a really good example of that. So this is a bolt-on to our business there in the Eagle Ford and a very nice addition of predictable fee-based cash flows coming in there.", "We also acquired some additional interest in UEO and that interest is now up to 62% and this area is really enjoying tremendous volume growth here in the Utica.", "On Geismar, as I said earlier, Geismar is now producing near its full expanded capacity. And in fact, our production here on Tuesday was about 5.27 million pounds a day of both ethylene and propylene, and so, doing very well there and we'll continue to optimize between our ethylene and propylene production depending on margins.", "Coming soon, as we look forward, there's a lot of exciting projects left to come on for the year. Our Virginia Southside project is expected to come in-service in the third quarter of 2015. And our Leidy Southeast project is expected to come on in-service in fourth quarter 2015. And so, we're making good progress on those items.", "Our Canadian off-gas processing, we're making great progress towards bringing our CNRL Horizon project startup in 2015; and our Kodiak tieback, which is a tieback to our Devils Tower platform, is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of 2015. And these tiebacks that we're getting to experience out here are really powerful tools in terms of driving a return on our business, as they require very little capital and large amounts of fee-based revenues. In fact, our Devils Tower field is now nearly 12 years old and this is the fifth field to be produced from this platform now.", "And Gunflint will be the first tieback to our Gulfstar platform and that is expected to come on in 2016. And I would tell you that is well ahead of our original expectations that we had for that investment thesis in Gulfstar. So really enjoying the benefits of really learning to aggregate and tieback production in these big deepwater spars.", "Once again, this list is certainly very extensive, and I'm very proud of our team's progress, as they really are delivering the growth that's out in front of us now.", "Moving on to slide five, we've said many times that Williams is uniquely positioned to connect the best natural gas supplies to the very best markets. And we've certainly focused our strategy on natural gas and are positioned to take advantage of the demand growth that's both here today and is coming in the next few years. We have bought and built our way into being the largest gas gatherer in the largest and fastest growing gas supply basin. And we've built Transco into the largest and fastest growing natural gas pipeline.", "Our second quarter results are certainly a reflection of the fact that our efforts are driving tremendous cash flow growth, despite stark commodity price headwinds and our large scale fee-based projects are meeting or exceeding our expectations as they begin to contribute in a big way.", "So the revenues from big projects like Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar are really doing very well, and in many cases, as I said, going beyond our expectations. Our focus on the fee-based growth means that we're expecting about 89% of WMB's 2015 through 2017 gross margin to come from fee-based revenues. And we have $9.8 billion of the total 2015 through 2017 in-guidance growth CapEx and 96% of that is focused on fee-based projects.", "We have committed and potential growth capital through 2020 of over $30 billion. And I'll tell you that is very rapidly growing. We really haven't updated that guidance in quite a while. But I'll tell you that book of business is rapidly expanding. It also \u2013 when we put that out, we do not include things like our M&A bolt-ons. And so, we've got a lot of M&A bolt-ons that are coming at us and are very \u2013 we're very well positioned for and those are not included in that opportunity list as well.", "So our backlog of projects does continue to grow and we just have not updated that just because it is so large to start with, but we do continue to see great opportunities in our business, both in terms of the known projects and the potential projects both continue to expand.", "So I'd like to just sum things up like this, with over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the record quarterly DCF, both of these are driven by strong fee-based revenue growth and we're very pleased with our second quarter results, as the headwinds of lower commodity prices are certainly being overwhelmed by the tremendous growth in fee-based revenues that will continue for years to come. So some pretty serious headwinds that have been out there, but well, it's really impressive now to see all these projects starting to take hold and really starting to make our NGL margin rather insignificant up against the growth of our business.", "And certainly, the growth that we're seeing demonstrates the performance of our premier asset footprint in the natural gas infrastructure space. And this includes the fastest-growing pipeline in the U.S. and the largest and fastest-growing positions in the tremendous Marcellus and Utica basins.", "So with that, as we move into the Q&A session, I'd just like to remind everyone that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our operational and financial results for the second quarter of 2015. And I ask that you please limit your questions to these topics. We won't be taking questions on the Strategic Alternatives process or the WPZ transaction. And once again, I can assure you that the focus of our strategic alternatives review remains on maximizing value and that the board and management team will continue to act in the best interests of our shareholders. And we're excited about doing that.", "And so, with that, let's move on to the second quarter Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question today comes from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone.", "Unknown Speaker", "Good morning.", "Unknown Speaker", "Good morning.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Actually, a big picture question first up. Alan, you suggested that the backlog is actually growing, no change to the official guidance. What \u2013 just kind of qualitatively, when would we or should we expect some updates there and is it just as things come to fruition or is it more of a quarterly type event?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I would say there's really two things you should see moving there. One is that many of the projects that are in our potential backlog so that are in that $30-plus billion, some of those projects will start to be moving in to guidance as we close deals there.", "So a lot of big opportunity right now, particularly in the Northeast, and as well as Transco continues to be very successful in contracting for new business along its system. And so, you'll start to see some business migrate from that $30-plus billion into the guidance numbers. So in terms of timing, we'll just update that in that particular case, as those deals are closed.", "Secondly, on the potential bucket, I would just tell you we just \u2013 the demand side of our business is really picking up in a big way and we're extremely well-positioned to capture a lot of that. And so, we are seeing a lot of additional interest in that, and we just obviously don't update that every single quarter.", "On the potential side, for one reason, it's so large already, it's not going to drive all that much, but as we see significant projects move in there, we're beginning to expand that. But I think the first thing you should expect to see in the near-term is projects in the guidance side starting to build.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's actually very helpful. And then, somewhat related, you mentioned Access operational synergies kind of showing up here recently. Is there anything \u2013 any detail that you can provide around that or any specific synergies that you want to highlight?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Thank you for that question. We had identified that we would have 25 last year upon the acquisition and then 50 on the merger. And right now, we have in our sights a number that's better than 50 here for 2015. And because some of that is being \u2013 even though it will show up in 2015, some of that will be full run rate; next year, we'll actually see a larger number than that next year.", "So a lot of those things are on some of the support services side, but we also are in the process. We've reorganized our leadership in the Northeast under Jim Scheel there and so we're starting to look at that the synergies that are available to us in the Northeast gathering area as well, and those really will be 2016 kind of improvements in synergies, and we're just really starting to identify what that really looks like.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "So stay tuned for the 2016 guidance number on synergies?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. That's good for me for right now. I'll hand it over.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni of UBS.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning guys. Couple of questions on my front here. I was wondering, first, if we can sort of talk about the MVC exposures at the old Access assets. There's been a lot of discussion about it lately. When you look at your exposures relative to your producer customers, I was wondering if you think of it on a basin-by-basin basis and if there are any regions where it's possible the producer customer has, I guess low to negative IRRs. And I guess that likely is in the case in Northeast, but I was wondering if you could comment if there's any regions where you see some weaknesses where producers are likely to be at or below the MVC should the commodity prices continue to be at the current levels, or possibly get worse?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Let me try to take that and then look a little bit to Bob here. If you are speaking of MVCs outside of the Chesapeake business, for instance, we do have some shut-ins in the Marcellus area. And those contracts are under cost of service. And so that value proposition of that would come back to us when that rate gets adjusted on an annual basis. And so that's I think the best way to think about that relative to the Chesapeake business.", "The MVCs that exist in the other Northeast, I would say, we're well above those \u2013 even at current shut-in production levels, we're well above those. I think the way you should think about that is that the volume support that we really have with that will come when the big pipeline projects come into service and there is known obligations to volumes into those downstream pipelines. So Constitution, Atlantic Sunrise and Leidy Southeast obligations into those projects will drive some support for volumes just because we know what the obligations are into those take or pay obligations on those pipelines.", "Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area", "Let me...", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "So...", "Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area", "Yeah, I was just going to add the two areas where we've got through MVCs, the Barnett and the Haynesville, obviously, were below the MVC in the Barnett. We do look at them on a basin-by-basin basis. And our view is that drilling in the Haynesville will come under the MVC that's growing in that area. And you're seeing that in the volumes that are showing up. But the Barnett is just not attracting the drill bit right now, and we don't think will be for a while, but it still is producing good cash flow in terms of its lifting cost compared to the current netbacks.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "So just to confirm, the Barnett is not attracting the drill bit, likely negative returns for your producer customers and is that the case also in the Haynesville? And that's why you're saying it's going to probably come under the MVCs at some point?", "Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area", "Well, I wouldn't speculate as to Chesapeake's returns in that area in total. I'll just note that the Barnett's producing good free cash flow in almost any environment and that that Haynesville is attracting drill bit currently.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. My follow-up questions, there was a big pickup in ethane volume sales in the Northeast. I was wondering if you can sort of talk about the big shift. Is it something that you did, is rejection suddenly not happening? I was just wondering if you can sort of give us a little bit of color on that.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Sure. One thing we didn't mention was that towards the end of the second quarter, we brought our ethane pipeline up there into service. And so, we now are running our de-ethanizer and that ethane pipeline feeds in to the \u2013 some of the contracts where producers have to sell their ethane. And so that is what's driving that. So now, we're getting incremental fees for those ethane services that we wouldn't have been getting until that pipeline and the de-ethanizer replacement service.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Final question. I realize you can't talk about the strategic review process and so forth. I was just wondering if you'd confirm whether a data room is currently open or not.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're not going to talk about that, Shneur. We're just going to have to hold a very, very firm line on this (32:42) answer your questions on.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. No problem. Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate the color.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just for the strategic process, I appreciate you might not be able to say anything here, but I wanted to bounce a couple of thoughts. Is there anything you can share with us as far as what the timeline might be there? And also, you talked about some smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Does this process interfere with any larger M&A aspirations you might have?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'll take the second question just to say that it is business, as usual, in terms of our bolt-on M&A efforts. And so, we continue to execute on our plan and our strategy in that regard.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, in the Northeast, it looks like gathering volumes were down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, but processing was up. I was just wondering if you could share a bit more with us in terms of what you hear with regard to producer customer activity there in the back half of the year, and how you guys are thinking about volumes at this point?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Sure. I'll just take that real quickly and then if you've got some more detail, Jim Scheel can chime in. Really, the only impact, the gathering volumes and production available is actually growing pretty rapidly. And as you saw, the big increase we had in OVM volumes with a 54% increase in gathering volumes in the Ohio Valley area. But the real impact was from shut-ins, particularly from producers up in the Susquehanna County area and some very substantial shut-ins that are due to lack of infrastructure availability.", "So we hear the term gas price there, but in fact, it really \u2013 the problem isn't the gas prices. They were enjoying $270 gas price up there. They would be pulling everything they could, but in fact, with all the constraints and lack of takeaway infrastructure right now, they're not getting that kind of pricing level and so some of those big producers start to bid against themselves as they put additional supplies into the market and so they're taking actions to curtail that production and so \u2013 but in fact continue to develop the reserves, and are making ready for when these big pipeline projects like Leidy Southeast, Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise come on up there.", "And so there are some big volumes and big gas purchase contracts that will stand behind those, and so they're readying their availability to deliver against those obligations. And so it's just about that simple. The rest of the business, the Northeast volumes are, in particular, like I said, OVM volumes are doing well and the Utica volumes are doing well as well on the joint venture operations that we have there.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for that. And...", "James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast Gathering & Processing", "No, I'm sorry. I think Alan got it, thanks.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just a follow-up on the Northeast. You'd outlined some of the cost savings that the Access merger had brought into the fold. I was wondering if you might be able to talk a little bit more about the commercial synergies that you might see. And I think during the Analyst Day, you talked about specific hubs there and opportunities related to that. So are there any further thoughts as far as what joint commercial opportunities could occur after the combination?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Sure. A lot happening there. Probably, the most obvious and the easiest to talk about is in the OVM, in the Ohio Valley Midstream area, where Access's North Victory system sits just to the north of our OVM system and extends the reach there. And as well, the ACMP team's capabilities on building out the gathering systems and the modular compression to attract those volumes is well-known by producers in the area.", "And so we have a really big list of producers that we're working with right now that leverage off of the combination of those existing ACMP systems feeding into OVM, as well as the expansion of those systems into new acreage that's been taken up there. So a lot happening on that front, and it really just boils down there \u2013 within OVM, it boils down to the expansion and the reach of our system just got a lot bigger into the OVM processing and fractionation complex.", "In addition to that, though, I would mention two other things. First of all, the Utica dry is really starting to hit some \u2013 people \u2013 far exceed especially our expectations, I would say, in terms of the potential of those reserves in production. And we're extremely well-positioned there on capturing the Utica dry business. And so, again, the reach of the Access system that's in the area along with the OVM system is powerful in that regard.", "And then, finally, the joint ventures between the Blue Racer Midstream business and the UEO system, both are very well-positioned on the Utica, and are enjoying growth there. And of course, we're looking to find ways to combine those systems in a way that really provides a super system for the area. And we think we're extremely well-positioned to bring that about. So a lot happening there that really is the combination of the historic Access assets and the historic Williams assets.", "And I think when we back up couple of years from now and look at this very impressive coverage of the area, in terms of being able to offer producer services on both Utica dry, the Utica wet, and the Marcellus wet, and particularly where those things cross over. So a lot happening there and we couldn't be more excited about the number of opportunities that are coming at us right now in Jim Scheel's area.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And do you see more opportunities to kind of take advantage of that liquids production, extending your footprint further downstream?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know, there's a lot of great projects out there. We are certainly working with our producers who control those liquids to try to find the right opportunities and certainly, are encouraging that infrastructure to get built on the downstream side. And so, I think from our vantage point, we're looking to try to encourage the development of that infrastructure, but it's really our producers' volumes and they'll be the ones that need to speak for the support of those projects.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. And then just one last one if I could. With regard to Geismar, how close will 3Q 2015 be to a complete full quarter? And is the O&M run rate in 2Q, is that a good run rate for the segment?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me have John Dearborn take that.", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams", "As Alan mentioned, we made about 5.27 million pounds per day on Tuesday. I think that would be a pretty reasonable rate to expect, because we've been able to demonstrate that for reasonably long periods of time, in excess of a week through this past several weeks as we brought the plant into full operation. So we're very encouraged with where we are today. So I think that's a fair way to look going forward.", "I think the one thing to take into consideration on the O&M numbers is we did face a rather substitute power failure, during the second quarter, which would have seen some higher O&M costs. I'm going to venture to say somewhere in the range of about $6 million to repair furnaces, which were unexpected. Those furnaces \u2013 it's a pretty normal thing when you face a significant power outage that you've to go in and repair the furnaces. That's what takes time, and it took some money in the second quarter.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for all the color.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Good morning, guys.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Craig.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "So I got one follow-up on Brandon and Jeremy's question in the Northeast and then a couple on commodities. So picking up on the Northeast opportunities, there's been a couple absolutely monster Utica dry gas wells. I think one was just reported this morning, but in the last week a couple really big ones. Is there any way to give a rough range of the potential size of midstream service opportunities in the dry gas area out there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Great question. And I will tell you that I think the challenge for everybody up there right now is getting the takeaway capacity out of the area. And so, there's no doubt that the potential was there at this point. I don't think anybody that's involved or engaged in the business up there doubts the potential.", "And especially, in areas where you already have pads established for the Marcellus wet and even some of the Marcellus dry, the underlying Utica under that and the ability to take advantage of the existing pads and existing infrastructure to bring that production on is where we think a lot of that big production will come on when there's an adequate call for it by the market. But as we sit today, the market \u2013 the supply side is desperate to see those expansion projects come online on the gas takeaway side to be able to alleviate that. So I think that's really the curtailment, if you will, right now, that will stop that from being \u2013 going gangbusters, but it is impressive.", "In terms of the opportunity for us, we've got a multi-billion dollar opportunities right now that we're looking at in terms of expansion of our systems up there, a lot of which is driven by both the Utica dry and where it overlays with the Marcellus wet. And so, we've got very \u2013 we're very far along in negotiations. And as I mentioned earlier, that's really where you ought to start to see our growth come from in terms of our potential projects. Besides the Transco demand side, you also should start to expect some of that business that was in the potential start to move into the guidance, as we start to close up on some of that business that's out there in front of us.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. That's helpful. And then, on the commodities side, a couple of related questions. First, on the $150 million of EBITDA guidance change relating to commodity price deck, can you roughly split that between Geismar olefins and all other and elaborate on what you're seeing as drivers right now for olefins crack spreads into 2016? And are you still seeing or expecting at least a couple cent premium to Belvieu there? And then the final thing on new projects relating to commodity issues, any updates on PDH or Geismar 2?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Boy, that was a lot of questions, Craig.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "I'm sorry.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Trying to digest them all here.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I can take the \u2013 of the $150 million change in commodities since our February \u2013 we issued that guidance on February based on the price outlook at that time, I'd say something under $60 million was olefins, and the balance was NGL margins and related curtailments.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "I got you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I'd say that's certainly the big numbers was on the NGL piece and then the Geismar piece, which is really behind us now.", "The PDH and Geismar 2 \u2013 great progress, really, on both of those projects and both in terms of putting the finishing touches on the contract for the polypropylene at PDH, and we do expect to be bringing that forward here in August before the board for further consideration on that project. But things are actually improving on that project in terms of \u2013 as we've started to getting quotes for a lot of the big equipment for that project. So we're really excited about the way that's going right now.", "On Geismar 2, very strong interest from two parties that we had narrowed that down to. And I would say we're into some pretty serious diligence now, with one party, in particular, at this point and I think very serious interest on their part and our part in terms of going ahead with the Geismar 2 project. So really great progress on both fronts there.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. And I'm sorry for the barrage at you. The one additional item, I just noticed that with 2015 that coming down, but 2016 unchanged, I think there was over a 30% increase in expected crack spreads, and I was wondering if you could give some additional color around drivers that you're seeing in the 2016 at Geismar.", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams", "Yeah, I think there are a couple of things. Let me take that one third in line. First, I'd like to just add to the earlier answer that I gave that that power outage that we faced was related to a utility power failure to our plant so that was not inside our plant. It was rather the supply to the plant that took the plant down, totally unexpectedly, in a very significant severe manner.", "Second, you had asked about premium to Belvieu, I believe. And now, with Evangeline running, with us running, that premium has essentially fallen back to more normal levels in the $0.01 or $0.02 range, though remember that Louisiana is a thinly traded market, and so, you don't get every day visibility into what that premium is.", "Also, remember that our customers have a call on about 80% of our production. So we have only available to us about 20% sell into the spot market, and coming through the second quarter, certainly, through June and in July, we have been satisfying our full contract requirements to our customers, so selling essentially all of our volume in that contract. There've been some de minimis volumes that we have sold into the spot market only when there were some discontinuities between what our customers needed and what we were able to produce. And now that I've gotten through those two, somehow I've lost track of what the third question was.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It was the 30% increase in crack spread.", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams", "The 30% increase in crack spread. Thanks. Well, looking at this year, I think earlier in the year, we were saying that we saw inventories rather low in ethylene and that we could expect some demand growth and we could expect perhaps some disruptions in supply that might drive to a tightness in ethylene that would help improve that situation.", "We haven't seen that materialize quite as yet in this year, but certainly, as time passes into next year and subsequent years, up until the time when the new crackers come on, you would expect that continued demand growth, and of course, recoveries of international markets and the like that might be hampering volumes these days would result in some strengthening opportunities for margin growth. And I think that's what we see behind the future there.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ross Payne of Wells Fargo.", "Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "How are you doing gentlemen?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning. Couple of quick questions. Could we get a rough debt number or debt number for WMB or WPZ? And secondarily, thanks for the guidance on the fee-based from 2005 (sic) [2015] to 2017. Can you give us a rough estimate of what fee-based is currently for the company?", "And then third, I was going through your press release. Can you talk about the profits that the Geismar is currently generating or what it was maybe in the second quarter? Thanks.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, Ross. This is Don Chappel. The debt numbers are in the 10-Q that we filed this morning. I'll try to grab something real quick here for you. But again, we filed the Williams and Williams Partners 10-Q this morning. All that detail is out there.", "Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Long term debt, this is at Williams, $21.285 billion.", "Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, great. I'll check the Q on that.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, great. Thank you.", "Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And on the fee-based?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "The fee-based percentage, I think, for this quarter and for 2015 is going to be in excess of 90%. I think somewhere in the 92% range given that Geismar was down for a portion of the year and kind of where commodities are. We're estimating or forecasting the fee-based percentage to be just a little below that over the three-year period, 2015 through 2017 is about 89%.", "Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And the Geismar profits?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I don't think we've disclosed the specific Geismar profits, but we did indicate that there was $50 million of gross margin for the quarter.", "Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. All right. When I'm looking at the press release and it goes over the Geismar incident adjustment of the negative $126 million, how do I think about that?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "That was business interruption and insurance proceeds. Again, a year ago, the plant was down, but we had business interruption insurance. And we estimated that during the second quarter of last year that we had a right to about $122 million. Since that date, we've collected -- we have a $500 million policy. We had losses, property losses approaching $70 million with just a little over $430 million, I believe, of BI. We've collected more than $420 million. We have a claim for $20 million that's open that's still being negotiated with an insurer, but again, the vast majority of our insurance claim has now been paid.", "Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Looking at this, I mean it looked like it was $96 million in the second quarter 2014 and then it swung to a negative $126 million for the second quarter of 2015, so.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Again, there's a difference between GAAP and adjusted. So for GAAP, for financial statement purposes, we record the cash, the insurance proceeds when we have a signed settlement agreement with the insurers or we actually receive the cash. For adjusted earnings, we in effect accrued it based on our expectation of collection.", "John Dearborn from Investor Relations can walk you through the...", "Unknown Speaker", "John Porter.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "John Porter.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "John Porter, excuse me. John Porter in our IR shop can walk you through the GAAP to non-GAAP numbers.", "Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And just one more, do you guys know the timing of when your strategic review will be complete? Thanks.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "There is no timing announced.", "Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, thanks very much, Ross.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Timm Schneider of Evercore.", "Timm Schneider - Evercore ISI", "Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, Alan, when we spoke in April, I think you were saying this was the earliest time you guys had locked up all of your Conway storage and rail racks for some of the Northeast NGLs. Obviously, if you look at some of the E&P numbers, realizations were pretty awful. I was just wondering how you guys see that shake out as we get into the shoulder season of 2016, right, Q2, Q3 without really any incremental export capacity slated to come on until the end of that year and what impact that's going to have?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Timm, great question and certainly one that a lot of people should be paying attention to, obviously.", "I do think that even though the export capacity, not any new export capacity coming on, there is, as you know, that hasn't been fully utilized. And I think the limitation there has been on ships having the capacity to carry that out. So I think that's kind of the next bottleneck, if you will, for the industry to face. And so, I think keeping a close eye on the availability of the shipping capacity to get out of the exports is probably the next thing to keep our eye on in terms of opening the markets up.", "But other than that, I don't really see much changing here domestically in terms of either storage capacity or rail loading capacity. I would say everything that can move and store NGLs right now is in full utilization, and building up behind the next bottleneck, which, as I mentioned, in this case is the export capacity getting the shipping capacity available to them.", "So I think that's the next thing to keep our eyes on here in the shoulder month. But certainly we don't see any near-term big relief here. I think we're probably three to four months out before we start to seize a lot of that capacity out there (56:35).", "Timm Schneider - Evercore ISI", "Okay. And then my follow-up is, you obviously saw a large proposed merger transaction up in the Northeast with two of your competitors. From your standpoint, how does that change the competitive landscape in the Northeast in terms of competing for projects and whatnot, how do you guys see that from your perspective?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I don't really expect a whole lot of change. I think from our perspective, we're pretty excited to see Marathon bringing their business and they've always had an interest and are very well positioned to take care of lot of the heavies and the condensate in the area. And so, we're really excited to have them engaged in bringing takeaway solutions to the area.", "So I would say that's kind of the net positive out of it. In terms of competition, I think we've got such major acreage dedications already to us and it's a matter of getting the takeaway capacity coming online for the Northeast and now, even for the Marcellus and the dry Utica. And I think that will be really the drivers there is that capacity coming online and then we will be in a position to provide a lot of supply infrastructure to handle that, as those markets open up in the future. So I really see that as really the determinant up there more than the competitive landscape.", "Timm Schneider - Evercore ISI", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Sharon Lui of Wells Fargo.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning. Just a quick question for John. Perhaps maybe you can just talk about your outlook for NGL pricing up in Canada and how maybe the recent weakness could impact I guess the returns of some projects coming on in the back half of this year?", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams", "Yeah, it's a great question. And perhaps I can take it on by giving a little bit of background on how we make money there. And I think it's important for us all to remember that we make money on the spreads between gas and what is substantially an olefin stream. So we make money between gas and propylene and gas and uplift. And of course, we're protected on core price on our ethylene production up there in Canada.", "And so, really the substantive exposure that we face that I think \u2013 and certainly causes us concern is on the NGL portion or the (59:20) portion of that production. And certainly, today, propane is not returning a cheap value. And so, therefore, it's the one product that is not making money for us up in the Canadian pocket right now. And so we're just looking for opportunities where we might be able to mitigate that situation.", "We haven't found it yet. So I don't have a clear solution for you yet, but we have found a way to deal with the heavier part of the barrel. It's making money now and all the rest of the parts of the barrel are making money. And so, if you think about the pocket in that way, I think you'll understand that we're still contributing income in Canada despite the NGL difficulty.", "One last point, though, and that is the stranded (1:00:13) nature of that propane up in Alberta does substantiate our thesis on why we think the PDH and the creation of a demand center (1:00:22) in Canada creates a value-added project and a sustainably advantage project into the future.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Do you see any potential catalyst that would decrease that propane oversupply in Canada?", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams", "Well, if you mean by catalyst a process that uses a catalyst to convert the propane into something else? I'm sorry.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Or maybe a project that would alleviate the oversupply situation up in Canada, like any drivers?", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams", "The only thing that we occasionally seek through is whether (1:01:05) would ever reverse but right now, the (1:01:07) is needed up in Canada, and so, in the absence of another large pipeline that traverses rather long distances to move the propane to the Midwest or somewhere else in the United States, I think it's very hard to imagine something that's going to alleviate the situation on propane.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would just say, Sharon, and certainly, we've got our eyes on that, and as John mentioned, there are ways that we're looking to help mitigate that. And part of that is to getting the propane back into the fuel markets. So if you think about that, where there are big straddle plants that are extracting propane, our facility extracting propane, the simple way is to get those propane barrels back into the gas stream where they came from in the first place in the most part and I think you'll see moves on people's parts to start to get a lot of that propane back into those streams.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And I guess just a follow-up, how should we think about the near-term returns on the Horizon investment?", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams", "Well, in the near-term while NGL prices are still where they are, I'd suspect they're probably going to fall a little bit short of where we would expect long-term returns to be. I think on a volume perspective, think of Horizon as being about a third of what we're doing (1:02:37) today. So I think that gives you a view on both the margin and the kind of volume.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So just to remind you though on that, Sharon, the bulk of the income on that asset really comes off the propylene and the butylene and then the ethane, which has the fee-based contract or the floor (1:02:59) contract for the ethane already embedded, which gives us a margin on the ethane and ethylene. So that's really where the bulk of the value comes from and the propane stream, even though it's very depressed right now, certainly has not been and isn't expected to be a big contributor to value in the future.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our final question in the queue comes from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies.", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "Hey. Good morning, Alan. Thanks for the color this morning.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "I have a few questions. I promise to be quick. First, following on Shneur's inquiry about the relationship with Chesapeake, I'm just wondering \u2013 you were speaking specifically or inquiring specifically about the MVCs. I'm just curious sort of more broadly about the counterparty exposure you had to them. There's obviously been some visible setbacks for them over the last couple of months. So I guess within the context of that, have you tempered at all your expectations for the cost of service growth in the Northeast? I know your guidance in aggregate remained unchanged 2016 to 2018, but wondering if there was any movement within that on cost of service efforts, given CapEx headwinds potentially? And then, related, any recent conversations with them about the midstream contracts you have with them, any effort to renegotiate, do you see that as a risk?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I'll take a stab at the broad relationship and the contract discussions, and I'll ask Bob Purgason to speak to the cost of service expectations in the Northeast and broadly.", "First of all, on a broad level, I'll just tell you we continue to enjoy very good relationship with Chesapeake. We're very impressed with their responsiveness to the situation that they're in. And I can tell you that they continue to work hard. Obviously, they announced an asset sale in the quarter. And they continue to look for opportunities, and we continue to be constructive in working with them where we can on that. And I would just tell you, again, I remain very impressed and very confident in their actions to put themselves in a position to have the right capital focused on the right assets. And I'm confident that they're going to be able to do that.", "And in terms of restructuring, certainly, they take the lead on that, and we try to provide support and find win-win ways where they can add volumes that help offset some of those obligations and that's the kind of things that we're looking at. And I'm not going to get ahead of them on that, but I would just tell you we're very excited about some of the new opportunities that we can help with where they can bring on new volumes up against existing obligations.", "And with that, I'll have Bob try to take the cost of service question.", "Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area", "Yeah. Just in terms of our cost of service growth, there in the Northeast, it's really in our Marcellus north area where we're adding some compression to continue to support the development there.", "I'd note that's an area where the cost of service contracts are delivering, we'll call it, great market fees. You noticed we had a fee reduction in the first quarter, and it was related some \u2013 a part of it was the fee reduction in that north area due to the high volumes that drive that fee lower. So we continue to see that.", "And then our Utica area, which is cost of services well continuing to expand compression there to support really great wet Utica results that you're also seeing show up in our UEO OVM volumes. So, no, we still see particularly those Northeast contracts as good strong pieces of our portfolio and also look to be good in Chesapeake's activity as well.", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot for that color. I guess, sticking on the Northeast and this is sort of a follow-up to Craig's question about the monster dry gas Utica wells we've seen recently. From a gathering perspective, can you address those types of wells or pads with the same type of infrastructure you've been using? Or is it a concentrated magnitude of production from those wells is going to alter how you have to service them and does that have any ramifications on either the type of return or the profile of return you might see gathering for such well?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would just say that certainly already having the right-of-way and the infrastructure in the area, as you know, in a lot of our OVM area, we have a loop system, so we have one line that we can dedicate to rich service and one line that we can dedicate to lean service. Having said that, the kind of size of some of these wells that are being hit are obviously going to require some massive expansion of those systems.", "And I will just tell you that having the right-of-way established and having the interconnect into multiple takeaway pipelines is going to be what is valuable. And that's exactly how we're positioning ourselves out there. But I would just \u2013 if you think about it, an existing pad up there is almost like \u2013 and sometimes I think it's even more so the case, it's almost like an offshore platform, because the real estate up there, getting a flat spot, and having a road into it, and having pipelines into it in that very difficult terrain up there is really a precious piece of real estate.", "And so that's where you'll see the development of a lot of that Utica drive, particularly in the northern part of West Virginia there. And so we have the pipelines into those locations and the right-of-way into those locations. And I think we'll be very successful in continuing to pick up those volumes as they come on there.", "But you're right, the existing infrastructure \u2013 to the degree that we get takeaway capacity established out of the area, and by that I mean long haul pipeline, long-haul interstate pipelines established in the area, the existing infrastructure would be overwhelmed if the producers started going after drilling plan in those areas, because there is so much productivity available from those areas. Obviously, though the productivity is going to have to stay in check with demand in the market.", "Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area", "Yeah. I think it's a great example of where Access legacy and The Williams fit together, right, because this initial wave of development is going to be used in existing plumbing, to the extent that we've got proximal pipelines and/or rights-of-way we can give near-term service. And then we can wait for this big takeaway opportunity which is going to create a whole new wave of large infrastructure investment to meet these big wells. So I think we're positioned well to capture that business and give near-term service to those who want to produce dry wells given their economics.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think one of the interesting elements of all this big Utica dry gas that may or may not be obvious at this point, is that it really is going to provide a lot of blending capacity into the gas pipelines. And so, if you think about this concern about the ethane recoveries and ethane takeaway, all of this big dry gas really provides a lot more capacity to put ethane into the long haul pipeline and still meet gas specs.", "And ultimately, what that means is it somewhat it helps solve the storage problem or ethane feed into some of the big crackers that are being developed there, because in effect, the gas pipelines become that storage element, and if there's a problem with the cracker, the ethane just goes into the gas stream, but still stays on spec. So that's actually one of the really interesting developments from our perspective coming out of this big Utica dry volumes that we're seeing show up.", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "That's a great point, Alan. I guess my final question. You mentioned takeaway from the basin, and so I just wanted to follow-up with you quickly on Constitution. I think at the time of your Analyst Day, you were waiting or hopeful for a New York DEC permit in June. I know that didn't happen, but I'm just curious for an update on where the regulatory process for that project stands? I realize it's not a huge CapEx item for you in the greater context, but when we think about the effect on the basin takeaway, just curious for an update.", "Alan S.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John D. Porter - Head-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com.", "These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us. Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL and Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P.", "In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to General Accepted Accounting Principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. Thanks for being on the call with this early this morning. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to provide a brief update on the transaction we announced with Energy Transfer on September 28. We are on the path to completion and we expect to file the proxy statement soon. The transaction will then be subject to SEC review and regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of 2016.", "With that, I want to reiterate that the focus of today's call is going to be on our financial and operational results for the third quarter. And I ask that you please keep your questions focused on our results, and I want to thank you in advance for your cooperation on that. So we are going to hold tight to that.", "And so, now, just some brief thoughts on the fundamentals relevant to the third quarter and the industry in general. Overall, I have to say, it really was a great third quarter for us from an operational performance perspective, a project delivery perspective, and progress towards future growth. We remain very focused on execution, on cost management, and taking advantage of the great asset positioning that our strategy has delivered, and I think this focus really showed up here in the third quarter.", "Importantly, despite the fundamental pressures on our industry from dramatically lower commodity prices, we've continued with very substantial growth in our adjusted EBITDA and DCF, so really, really showing the strength as we continue to see prices erode and some really dramatically low NGL prices in the quarter, but our strategy of continuing to invest in these big fee-based projects is really starting to overwhelm those lower prices.", "And so that's not to say we aren't feeling some of the effects of the low commodity prices directly in our commodity margins and indirectly via the volume shut in on some of our gathering systems, particularly in the Northeast. However, because of our unique position, we continue to deliver strong results and we see strong growth ahead from our projects, especially on the demand or market side of our business as the U.S. industries and the international markets look to take advantage of North America's abundant and low-cost natural gas supplies.", "The North American producers continue to really amaze us and continue to innovate and deliver production at costs levels that no one thought was possible even a year ago, and while this has led to painfully over-supplied markets in the short-term, it continues to lead the way towards growing demand and expanding prosperous markets for natural gas and natural gas derivatives. And so, over the long-term, we think we're really seeing a supply-led expansion, and I know that people are getting impatient about that, but I can assure you, as you look through our backlog of projects, it's very evident to us that that capital is going in place to pave the way for growing demand.", "So the current barrier to the success that we speak of and look forward to really is the low-cost access to these expanding markets and that's in the way of pipelines primarily, but also other infrastructure required. And we are certainly building out this capacity, it is not just important for Williams, but for the industry, and it's also important for the North American economy. And we really are very excited to be taking on these important challenges at Williams and see it as a critical next role in really delivering the tremendous value that the North American producers have developed via their innovation and continue the learnings in developing our low-cost resources here in the U.S.", "So with that, let's move on to slide two. Overall, our strong third quarter results underscore the effectiveness of our strategy to connect the best natural gas supply to the best markets with all this fee-based infrastructure we continue to invest in. This accounted for more than 90% of our gross margin during the quarter and will continue to be that for quite some time. And the tremendous efforts by our teams to deliver the continuous string of large-scale infrastructure projects required to realize the fruits of the strategy.", "Once again, we showed our ability to deliver substantial growth in EBITDA and DCF despite much lower commodity prices; and in fact, four segments of our five segments realized substantial growth and our fee-based revenue, which was up over $200 million in the quarter, overwhelmed the dramatic drop in commodity margins from the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, our DCF of $754 million delivered a 1.04 coverage, and that's even without recognizing the benefit of the $209 million IDR waiver for the quarter that was associated with the WPZ/WMB merger termination.", "So let me now drill into the drivers for this 21% improvement in EBITDA for the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2014 comparison. First of all, big congratulations to our Atlanta-Gulf team who delivered $414 million for the quarter, up 53%. Even more impressive was that this was in the face of dramatically lower NGL margins in the Gulf Coast, and the drivers for this strong performance were a lot of projects continuing that were brought on earlier in the year, things like Gulfstar One, Discovery's Keathley Canyon Connector, but also a full quarter on new Transco projects, including Rockaway Lateral in New York.", "In addition to that, the team also delivered a new project during the third quarter, which was the first phase of the Virginia Southside lateral, which our team delivered on time; and we also were able to get some early revenues from the mainline services associated with the Leidy Southeast project, and that we brought in those revenues well ahead of schedule. Of course, the Leidy Southeast lateral is not yet online, but the mainline portion for gas flowing from that lateral, we were able to bring some of that on early. So great job by both our commercial team and our project teams in continuing to deliver (08:32) on that. And as you'll see on the next page, you'll see a string of projects that Atlantic-Gulf continues to grow as we provide capacity for the demand side of this growing natural gas market.", "At the Access level, $351 million of adjusted EBITDA. That was up 9% on \u2013 this is really driven on fee-based revenue growth, of course, and we saw both the mix of volume growth and contractual benefits across multiple areas provide steady growth in EBITDA despite challenging commodity prices in those basins as well. Specifically, the increase in adjusted EBITDA between 2014 and 2015 was driven by higher fee-based volumes and contractual support from the minimum volume commitment agreements, as well as the increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream. And so, as you'll recall, we transacted on that earlier in the year, and so that delivered here for us in the third quarter as we stepped that up. And this was despite that area being impacted by very low commodity prices in this basin for both gas and NGLs. And so we did see some shut-ins in that area that were fairly significant in the third quarter, but we've seen a lot of that production return to service now, headed into the fourth quarter.", "In the Northeast G&P, $87 million, up 28%, also on higher fee-based revenue and this certainly during the quarter \u2013 a few things to note here, price-related shut-ins from our producers did dramatically impact the fee-based revenue growth on our gathering volumes, but this \u2013 we still managed to grow those volumes by 13% despite some very large shut-ins in the quarter. And as well, our volumes processed. So the inlet volumes to our (10:34) processing plants actually grew by over 40% and NGL production was up 2.5 times last year's production; thanks to new processing facilities that were installed in the first quarter at OVM.", "Of course, the NGL & Petchem, I was glad to see a solid quarter of operations from the expanded Geismar plant, and the team hit some very impressive production levels during the quarter as they really started to learn what they could do with the new facility there, but unfortunately, the ethylene margins that we realized during the quarter were much lower than we had expected earlier. But again, from an operational perspective, some nice performance coming from the team there. Canada also had strong production levels with propylene sales being up 29%, but also suffered weak pricing in the propylene area there as well.", "The NGL services side had a strong operating quarter as well. And so when we speak of that, that's our NGL transportation and storage piece that's in our (11:40) NGL & Petchem unit. And actually saw the NGL transport volumes on our Overland Pass Pipeline go up by 59%. So overall, a big step up in adjusted EBITDA from $22 million to up to $85 million for this business unit in the quarter.", "And then, finally, while the West saw a 28% decline in its adjusted EBITDA to $161 million really driven by dramatically lower NGL margins, it really was a good operating quarter in terms of the team doing everything they could to deliver the best numbers. And we really saw that show up in the way of lower operating costs, and the team was able to hold our fee-based service revenues flat versus third quarter of 2014. And so really, really great effort by the teams out there to keep the volumes continuing to flow out there and continue to reduce our costs.", "The NGL unit margins that we realized in the West actually were at a 10-year low, as we saw NGL \u2013 sorry, we saw NGL sales fall by over $70 million this year in the 3Q versus 3Q comparison. Total volumes on Northwest Pipeline were up 14% and this is due to both the increased use of natural gas for power generation in the Northwestern states as well as some basis differential spreads that were existing between prices like ACO (13:21) and the Western states. So really a good sign. I'll tell you, (13:23) when we see volumes pick up, even though they're interruptible and people taking use of the capacity, when you see that kind of increase in our throughput volumes on the system, that's always a good sign for long-term firm (13:35) sales, which is really where we make our money on a pipe like that.", "So moving on to slide three here, just a picture here of the continued delivery of projects and great job of our team continuing to put these projects into service. We said back in the first half of the year that the demand side of the natural gas market is driving our capital investments, and I want to touch on some of these projects here.", "First of all, the Transco Virginia Southside, as I mentioned earlier, was placed into service in September of 2015, and, of course, we look forward in the fourth quarter here to see the benefit of a full quarter there rather than just the one month. I also would just note there, really impressive execution by our team who really had some very difficult obstacles to overcome in the construction in that area, and I won't bore you with all of the details, but I would just say that the ability to deliver that on schedule given some of the obstacles that the team faced there was very impressive, and I want to recognize the great efforts there.", "On Gulfstar One, we continue to see strong fee-based contributions to EBITDA. Lots of work going on right now out on that platform to tie back the Gunflint prospect and to further improve production from the existing completed wells. On the \u2013 moving to the Discovery facilities, continue high utilization on the KCC system. We continue to see record volumes on that system and the team is doing everything they can to maximize throughput, because there is a lot of throughput wanting to get through that system right now. And as well, we're seeing a lot of exciting growth on the horizon for this investment as well. And so really excited about the future for Discovery out there, both in the current and in the future.", "On the Northeast G&P, on our gathering processing in the Northeast; we did execute the Pennant JV. And just to give you a little bit of color on that. That's a joint venture that really allowed us to take advantage of some large dedications that we had up in the area and that were some legacy acreage dedicated into that (15:59) we had up there and we were able to combine those acreage dedications with some players that already had some flowing production in the area as well as already had a lot of the capital invested in some new infrastructure up there.", "So really excited about the work that our team did there to take advantage of our acreage dedication and find a way to work with partners in the area. That's a very capital efficient way for us to monetize some of those big acreage dedications up there in Northwest Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio.", "On the dry Utica side, of course, we announced a significant increase in the dry Utica acreage from Chesapeake in the quarter. But we also are really excited to see some significant dry Utica wells showing up in the OVM area, so right there, just to the East of the Ohio River, right in our backyard there in OVM, and really seeing some impressive wells that are being completed on the same pads that were earlier developed for the Marcellus-rich area, and really this is a common story here for the Northeast; just tremendous resource potential up there, and an ability to produce a lot of gas at very low cost.", "But we sit here and \u2013 as a whole industry \u2013 and really are anxious to see the new takeaway into the structure (17:17) goes into service. And I'll just tell you, there is a lot of growth potential for the future up here and really just dependent \u2013 not really on improved prices from where we are today really, just access to those markets both on the gas and the NGL side. So really, really excited to see the opportunities continue and the growth for the future up here just continues to expand its horizon for us.", "On the Haynesville, the 2016 and 2017 MVC cash flows were unchanged via our contract renegotiation with Chesapeake and we were able to extend our dedication through 2035, and also brought in a very substantial additional drilling commitment, which will drive those increased volumes beyond the end of the MVC obligations there in 2017. So great job. I know there has been a lot of debate out there. But I'll tell you, from my perspective, any time we can hold our current cash flows \u2013 commitment to cash flows via those MVCs and expand the Horizon and help a customer continue to grow for the future and us enjoy that growth with them, I think that is a win-win. I'm really proud of the team and very excited to continue to work with Chesapeake on finding ways that are mutually beneficial to our organizations.", "At Geismar, the expanded plant, as I mentioned earlier is meeting our production expectations, and it actually \u2013 even though some very hot periods will tend to lower our throughput capability, we hit some pretty impressive numbers relative to our expectation in production for the quarter and expect to see that continue here into the fourth quarter.", "We also announced the fee-based off-take contract that we executed for the Alberta PDH facility and we are moving to the next phase of project development, and we do expect the FID or the final investment decision in the third quarter of 2016. But I would tell you, a lot of great work going on there by the teams and really it's hard work to make sure we know (19:42) exactly what our estimate is going to be and that we execute that project in a flawless manner. So a lot of time and care being taken on the front end to get that right, exactly how we ought to be taking on a big project like that.", "In addition, looking forward, I want to touch on just a few projects that are going to come on later this year. First of all, the Transco Leidy Southeast expansion. Really important, not just for the cash flows that that project will deliver, but as well, because it's going to provide additional gas takeaway of about 525 million a day coming out that'll be in service in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "Our Canadian Offgas Processing project, a project we refer to as Horizon; we expect that to be mechanically complete here in the fourth quarter of 2015. We don't expect any meaningful cash flow from this asset until first quarter of 2016 as we'll be starting this up in the dead of winter up in Fort McMurray, Alberta; and if you've ever been up there in that part of the year you know what I am talking about. So great job by the teams really trying to push through to get that project completed and we are looking forward to bringing that big project on line and into service well during 2016.", "And then finally, our Kodiak tieback to our Devils Tower platform, is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of 2015. And a lot of times this gets left off of our project list just because we're not spending the capital on that, so it doesn't show up as a major project where we're being reimbursed what capital we are spending, I should say. But it is a very meaningful additional to our cash flow. And so it really is an exciting project for us and continues to show that our deepwater strategy is alive and well with Devils Tower moving into its, I guess,12th or 13th year now of operation.", "Once again \u2013 I think there is a very extensive list and I'm proud of our teams for the progress they continue to make and the growth they're delivering, and Williams really does have a truly unique position in terms of our asset footprint and the kind of projects that we continue to string together.", "Moving on to slide four, you can see here a list of demand-driven projects. It is very significant. So while most of the attention in the industry for the past year or so has been focused on prices, production curtailments and shut-ins; we've really been focused on serving the growing demand side for natural gas and we expect to see that continue. And as you can see from this chart, much of our growth potential for the future is on the demand side of the business. We think that's critical to expand out into those key markets and we're really pleased to be positioned the way we are.", "Our focus is especially important in the Northeast where we've got many producers up there that are really, really critical to them to get access to those markets, and we take those obligations very serious to get those developed and working hard to overcome continued regulatory and political hurdles that exist in getting all this big infrastructure in place up there. And so in the Northeast, while we, as I mentioned earlier, we did have quite a bit of gas shut-in in the third quarter, it really is a great opportunity for us as we continue to invest out.", "In fact, if we touch where we're (23:31) invested in in these assets in the Northeast, we're exposed to these assets that gather nearly a third of all the gas being produced up there. And so as we are able to develop our own infrastructure for takeaway as well as peers in the industry, we're going to see some tremendous growth that does not depend on additional drilling rigs because there's \u2013 not only is there a lot of gas shut-in for economic reasons up there today, we also have a tremendous amount of drilled and uncompleted wells and a big inventory of that, that again is just waiting on the right price signals not from the Henry Hub kind of natural gas prices but they are locally in the area. So we're excited to be working to get our customers exposed in that area.", "Moving on to slide five, to sum up some of the things that we went over today. I would reiterate that the quarter's results were a direct reflection of our strategy to uniquely position Williams to connect the very best natural gas supplies to the very best markets, and I really think it's hard for anybody else to make that claim in terms of how we're positioned in the natural gas market there. Very unique in that regard and we've worked hard to get there.", "The fact that we're delivering record quarterly DCF and record adjusted EBITDA through some of the tough headwinds for the industry is a real testament to the teams at Williams that are out there every day executing on our plan, working hard to deliver results for our shareholders. And we remain very focused on executing against our natural gas focused strategy and are very pleased with the results we've delivered here in the third quarter. And importantly, our backlog of projects continues to grow as we see the demand side of the natural gas story continue to develop. Sustainable low-cost reserves only serve to fuel the story of demand growth and we're excited to be a part of what will be a tremendous growth of the future.", "So with that, we'll move to the Q&A session. And I'd just like to remind everyone that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our operational and financial results for the third quarter of 2015, and I ask that you please limit your questions to these topics. And I want to thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation on this. I know there's a lot of interest in understanding the transaction, but we're going to be limiting our comments today to the Williams operations and our performance here for the third quarter and drivers for the future.", "So with that, we'll turn it over to questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt Company (sic) [Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.] (26:49) Please go ahead.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, Alan; everyone.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Let's see here. There is quite a bit. I guess just a little bit of bookkeeping; in terms of project timing in the Northeast, any incremental color on Constitution and getting that kicked off?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. We've gotten through all the work with DEQ with New York and that was kind of our final barrier up there. We are working with the Governor's Office to understand what \u2013 the cause of delay of getting that permit out, but that is kind of the final issue that we're waiting on. And so we're working to understand that. A lot of great work going on by the teams there to get the \u2013 past the requirement for the New York DEC (27:46), but we think we've gotten there. So really just up against getting the Governor's Office to sign off on that and then we'll be in a position to get that done for the fourth quarter of 2016.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "And so still on track for that timeline?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "The new Edmonton PDH facility, any color in terms of just how competitive that market is? Obviously, that's a much needed project in that region. Are there other folks competing for similar projects there? And just across your footprint, do other PDH units make sense, and what's the competitive landscape for those types of projects?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Great question. Well, I'd tell you that, that PDH project is very, very unique from our perspective, and that it's taking advantage of very low-cost propylene that's already in the area as well as the propylene that we would make with the new PDH facility. And so we, for quite some time, wanted to see polypropylene unit and downstream derivatives be developed in the area, because it's just a logistics game. So today a lot of that propylene is going into the Gulf Coast being converted into various derivatives, in particularly polypropylene, and then being railed back up into the Midwest market. And so this project takes advantage of that low-cost propane there in the basin and low-cost propylene that comes directly off of those big delayed cokers in the oil sands and then just transports it in directly into those Midwest markets and also will have access to international market out of places like Port of Vancouver.", "So really excited to be teamed up with the Goradia Capital Group and a huge marketer of derivative projects \u2013 derivative products around the world, and really excited to have them as a partner there. And I would tell you, the next available project to us is clearly a PDH 2 facility there and they're very interested in that and we certainly have plenty of product, as we continue to expand our upstreams oil sands operations, we've got a lot of propylene that we want to find a better home for than having to be railed into the Gulf Coast.", "So I would just tell you it really is a logistics play for us. We're not depending on the kind of propane basis differential that we've been living on up there, but we do expect the propane to be long there in Canada for quite some time and we really look to all kinds of alternatives for other uses of the propane and other logistics for the propane and really excited PDH is a great answer up there, especially with somebody coming \u2013 partnering with us to develop the derivative business for us. So exciting opportunity, not just for us, but really for the province of Alberta and allows them to take advantage of their very low-cost resources in that basin as well.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Awesome. Got it. Thank you. Very interesting.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much. (31:17)", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Christine Cho of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "My first question has to do with CapEx; year-to-date, it's been trending a lot lower than the guidance we got five months ago. And I'm guessing most of it is due to lower than expected spending in the Northeast and for the Access assets. Is the run rate of spending that we've seen for the first three quarters a good indicator for what to expect in fourth quarter? And how much of the spending would you say has been delayed? And is this more of a timing thing into 2016? Or is some of this stuff indefinitely postponed until pricing signals improve, like you've mentioned?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Christine, I would actually say \u2013 I'll separate that. The maintenance capital piece, a number of drivers on that, but we still have a lot of maintenance capital work out in front of us. And just so you know kind of how we forecast that, a lot of that maintenance capital is invested in the inspection and improvement of our pipeline system. And so we go through the smart pigging process and we basically have to estimate the number of repairs or anomalies that we'll find when we do that inspection; and so that's how we do that.", "When we don't have as many anomalies show up or as many repairs required, then we don't have as much maintenance capital to spend. And so we still have quite a bit of inspection in front of us for the balance of the year and we would expect that maintenance capital continue to be pretty strong going into the fourth quarter. But clearly, it's a matter of us estimating at the first of the year (33:07) the amount of work we think we're going to have. And when we don't find those anomalies, then that's the money that we put back in our pocket, so to speak. But we have a lot of work out in front of us for both the third quarter and \u2013 sorry, into the fourth quarter and into 2016.", "On the growth capital side, that is somewhat driven by things like we would have hoped to have been started on Constitution by now, for instance. And so that is projects like that. But there are a lot of projects that we actually are seeing lower costs come in. And so, up in the Northeast, for instance, on our build-out in the Susquehanna County area, the capital \u2013 the team has been doing a great job up there, bringing in costs lower and as well on Atlantic Sunrise; we've continued to enjoy cost savings on that big project as well. So I would say the delay component is probably -that's built in there, is probably Constitution, and but there are some pretty substantial savings that are coming through in our numbers as well.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then on the heels of that, it looks like you funded all the CapEx with debt in third quarter. I'm assuming you couldn't really tap the ATM PZ (34:24) while undergoing a strategic review, but how should we think about CapEx funding between now and closing of the deal at the parent?", "I realize that IDR waivers are going to help some, but can you tap the ATM markets given the uncertainty around the future of PZ (34:37)? And even if you could, I'm assuming you don't want to when the units are yielding 11% and credit metrics are high. So how should we think about this? Because I would think that you can't solely lean on the balance sheet for the next six months to nine months.", "Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Christine, this is Don. Good morning.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Morning.", "Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "First, I'd say that I think the cost of equity capital is unusually high as a result of the high level of uncertainty regarding the energy industry right now. We expect that that will settle down, and in time here that the market will certainly reward the advantaged companies relative to those that are less advantaged or disadvantaged and cost of capital will make more sense as we move forward. We have a variety of options ahead of us, and the ATM is certainly one of those and we'll be balancing obviously cost and risk and \u2013 with a combination of debt and equity to finance and keep WPZ at investment grade ratings.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Can you go into further detail about alternatives to the ATM?", "Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Christine, I think the alternatives we have are probably the same as most of the other industry participants. So I'm not going to delve into the variety of options because there are many, but I would say there are a number of options, and we'll evaluate all of those in an effort to find the lowest-cost solution while balancing risk and maintaining those ratings. And again, I would say that obviously WPZ has a supportive parent as well.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Last question from me, can you quantify how much gas was shut in in the Northeast for third quarter and for how long? And then, also, Alan, you mentioned that there is a lot of wells waiting on completion. Can you quantify that behind your acreage as well?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we're certainly not going to pinpoint anything for \u2013 which producers and so forth on that, but Jim Scheel, if you'll take that question generally?", "James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P", "Sure. For the third quarter in the, what I'd call the dry Northeast, we had a significant amount of volume shut in in the Bradford and Susquehanna Counties. We probably had about 350 million a day in Susquehanna and upwards of 400 million a day in Bradford, so pretty significant for the quarter shut-ins. Again, these are all price-related shut-ins.", "As you look at the OVM area or the Ohio River Supply Hub, we had about 150 shut-ins starting the middle of the quarter. We'll see that as we look at our reduced volume growth year-over-year in that particular area. And then, we saw shut-ins also of about 300 million in the Utica, those have come off. Those are \u2013 we are now flowing at full rate. In fact, this weekend we had a Bcf production at the Utica Supply Hub for the first time.", "So right now we have about 900 million shut-ins. As Alan indicated at the very beginning of the presentation, there's a number of other opportunities for us to grow volume besides the shut-in volumes including uncompleted wells, and that's true both in the Northeast portion of the Utica as well as \u2013 I mean, the Marcellus as well as the wet Marcellus in the South. Those give us a great amount of potential for future volumes. And as we look at our rig counts, we see those holding relatively steady as we go from 2015 to 2016, probably actually seeing a \u2013 although it'll probably stay at 15, it could go up by a couple of rigs over the course of that timeframe. Does that answer your question?", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes. Thank you so much for all the color. Congrats on a good quarter.", "James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P", "Thanks.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just wanted to follow up on that last point there a little bit if I could. As far as the 900 shut-in that you talked about, is there \u2013 do you have any visibility to that coming back online as far as, is there certain price points or other kind of regional de-bottlenecks you think that could help get that flowing, or any color there would be great?", "James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P", "Alan, would you like me to take that one?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Please, Jim. Thank you.", "James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P", "All right. Sure. Obviously, we've talked about Henry Hub pricing and the basis differential, as I think you're aware. The basis differentials from the Northeast to market pricing have been significant. Many of our producers have been seeing realized prices in the $0.70 price range and that is pretty significant. But we have a number of opportunities, those of you remember at Analyst Day, perhaps, there are a number of projects including Constitution, Atlantic Sunrise which we're driving that are going to help bring the critical infrastructure we need to really unlock the value of these resources for our producers. In addition to that, you've got (40:19). You've got Leach. You've got Mountaineer.", "There are a number of industry solutions coming as we look forward into 2016 and 2017 that will help narrow those basis differentials and really unlock value for our producers in order to not only relieve the shut-in gas, but also really drive up the production rates. I think as we see that come on \u2013 we've already seen the Leidy expansion which is half a Bcf a day of incremental production coming on line that will help alleviate some of that as we go forward. But I \u2013 although we're not giving guidance as it relates to future year volume growth, I would just say, as we see that basis differential come down we're \u2013 if our producers saw the $2 pricing, we would see just tremendous volume growth in the Northeast.", "And then, finally, we need to look at winter pricing and weather-related issues as we go into the winter of this year, could also help improve some of those differentials and increase our Northeast volumes.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for that. So it sounds like some of these takeaway solutions, probably, at least a few quarters off, if not a big longer, so takeaway won't necessarily help in the near-term, but if weather can improve that basis that could potentially be more of a near-term catalyst to help you guys out there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would just add to that. Thank you for the question. I would just add to that, certainly, as Jim mentioned, in the near-term, we have the Leidy Southeast, that's 525 million a day. So that's pretty substantial. Because a lot of that Northeast volume is gathered by our system, we should expect to see some of that relief parlayed (42:17) directly to our gathering assets up there. As well, I would just say, as you mentioned, we are in a fairly warm shoulder here and certainly in the cold \u2013 not just for the sake of gas prices in the Northeast, but as well for NGL prices and particularly propane, we'll see some relief during the winter like we always do as that propane is called on to deliver local markets rather than it being transported from the South, the way it used to be.", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for that. And then just looking at Atlantic-Gulf. It was quite a nice quarter all take (42:56). And I was just curious were there any kind of weather or one-time benefits that helped with the quarter there? Or did the quarter really perform in line with your budget and this is kind of a new run rate to think about there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'll take it. I don't know if we have Rory on line, he may want to provide some more detail, but \u2013 no, it really was just a matter of these big projects really starting to mount up and it really was a matter of having a full quarter. There really wasn't any seasonal issues. In fact, volumes on Transco on a, just a throughput basis were actually a little bit lighter and that's just based on moderate weather relative to last year's moderate weather. And remember, we don't really make the \u2013 Transco doesn't get driven up/down (43:43) all that much by seasonal just because all the capacity is sold out firm and so it really doesn't move with throughput (43:53). But the answer to your question is, no, there was nothing seasonal about it, it's just these big projects are starting to pile up (43:59).", "Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. That's it from me. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Good morning. Congratulations on a nice quarter.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning. Thank you.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Good to be above one times coverage.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. It is.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "So on Christine's CapEx question, Alan, you referenced some cost savings in Susquehanna and at Atlantic Sunrise, and I'm just wondering is the bulk of that kind of project-specific with good execution or just across the board are we starting to see industry-wide material and labor cost deflation?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say in the case of the Susquehanna Supply Hub, a couple of things: that team has really worked hard to take advantage of the scale of the installation of our compression and our gathering lines up there, and they've worked very hard with the Access team to really pull together our very best thoughts about the way to put infill compression, and so that kind of thinking is really starting to pay off for us out there, and just a real intense focus on tight project controls and execution.", "So without any doubt in my mind in the Susquehanna Supply Hub area, it is better execution by our team and years of focusing on better projects execution really starting to pay off up there. And that really \u2013 it's really nice to see the teams bringing the best ideas of both organizations together and really showing up in a tangible way there.", "On Atlantic Sunrise, I would just say that given the uncertainties that we've seen in putting in these big infrastructure projects \u2013 we've built in quite a bit of contingency into these projects, and as we deliver those projects we are able to \u2013 and start to have some of those things quantified, we're able to reduce some of that contingency. What we also did see is, as we announced earlier, we did see some lower cost on materials particularly pipe and so it's a little bit of both on Atlantic Sunrise, I would argue.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay, great. And where is the current state of Geismar utilization?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "John Dearborn, you want to take that please?", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Sure. I'd be glad to, Alan. Thanks. And Craig here is where we are. You'll notice in our results we're reporting that Geismar's running at \u2013 we sold about 404 million pounds this quarter. I'll remind you that that's WPZ's share of Geismar, so Geismar actually sold more closer to \u2013 or produced closer to 450 million pounds, between 450 million pounds and 460 million pounds in this quarter. We have been running a bit of propane as a feedstock as we bring the plant back into operation. And so there's about another 18 million pounds of propylene that we've been producing there.", "Net-net, when you add all that up and make some adjustments and simplifying assumptions, so you can calculate a utilization rate we, over the quarter, ran about an average of 98%. But let me take you a little further on that. We're extraordinarily pleased with the Geismar team, the Geismar family there, because they have been setting production records that are yet in excess of that and we have a bit of upside yet to be found in that. We have two transformers that are yet scheduled to be replaced in next year that could help the team to further hone or find some increments. So I would say setting the expectation, we have a little bit of upside yet on volume out of Geismar, but it's running extraordinarily well here during this quarter and we're really grateful of the team and all the efforts they put into restoring the safe and reliable operations of that unit.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "That's great, John. I know it's been a long road there and it's terrific to hear such a good quarter in terms of execution.", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Appreciate your comments. Thank you.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Last question is the PDH project, still somewhere in the neighborhood of perhaps $1 billion investment or almost then \u2013 picking up on the answer to Brandon's question, is there any thought about the gap in timing that could be for a second PDH project after the first one is online?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll go ahead and take that real quickly. As to the costs, we're not going to disclose that until we go for our FID on that. And so really good work done by fine-tuning our estimates. And we do think it's a good time to be building up there, but we've certainly looked around the industry and seen what's going on on several of the other PDH projects and have been careful to take note of that as we continue to refine our estimates up there.", "So I would say that we've had kind of two things. On one hand we've been taking note of some of the project cost across the industry on that; and on the other hand, we are seeing favorable conditions in Alberta, but we really don't want to book that, if you will, into our estimate, and are hopeful that will provide some upside on our costs there. So big investment and we'll be providing \u2013 we're not going to be providing that number just yet until we get to the FID report, at least further along.", "On the gap in timing for PDH 2, really good question. That's a difficult issue, because you don't want to change scope in the middle of your project. I would tell you we have done a lot to make sure that when we do put in the PDH 2 or if we get to that decision that we've got all the space and auxiliary and the planning both on the propylene side and on the polypropylene side thought through, so I would just say we're making investment thinking about the future for PDH 2. And we do think the returns for PDH 2 project would be very attractive, but we're really just trying to keep our focus tightly on the scope of PDH 1 to start with. So I'd just say we're not ready to bring forth a PDH 2 decision just yet, but we are planning for the future.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Understood. Congratulations again on the quarter.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Alan, just one quick question for you. I realize you're still evaluating like you said that scope of PDH 1, but as we're trying to put some numbers around the profitability of the volume commitments that you announced in addition to obviously the low feedstock cost, is the biggest influence at arbitrage (51:44) between the level of currently produced refinery-grade propylene and where you see the demand growth for PGP and the derivatives? And that's the big driver? Or as we start to model this, do you see maybe the domestic PGP and derivatives demand significantly increasing, or maybe more margin opportunity like you said for international export? I'm just trying to figure out the drivers as to how we should think about the profitability of this plant and possibly PDH 2 over the next couple of years?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Good question. I would say really the party that will be having the lion's share of that exposure obviously would be our partner who would be in the business of marketing that product, polypropylene product, and certainly that's their expertise.", "And I think they're really excited about the markets they think this very low-cost supply can get into. From our vantage point, we're going to be very focused on producing propylene at a low cost and into that contract that is a fee-based contract. And so that's what we're going to be very focused on. And while we do have some exposure to the profitability over the time of that, primarily our focus is going to be on just driving volumes at a low cost and selling them to a fee-based contract.", "Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Ted J. Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. I would love to ask about the Appalachian Connector project. You mentioned the fact that producers are really interested in getting their gas uptown and it seems like a good solution, but there are some competing projects that look like they're along the same lines there. So just wondering if you \u2013 what the discussions are with producers, their willingness to commit to volumes, any range of sort of CapEx or return you might expect on a project like that?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would just say we've been looking at a number of alternatives on that project. The thing that we \u2013 the two drivers, I would tell you is, this continued demand for natural gas in the Southeast and power generation markets and Transco being so uniquely positioned to be able to expand cheaply out of Station 165 to the South. And so that's a huge carrot, if you will, that we have uniquely available to us and we're using that to bring forward the very best project for the market. So I would just say it's pretty fluid, but that's a very \u2013 almost immovable opportunity, if you will, that is uniquely ours and provides us an ability to enter into the very best project but we want to make sure we can maximize that value after all the other investments have been made. So that's the first piece of that.", "Second piece of that, I would say, is that the kind of volumes that we're seeing from the dry Utica are just continuing to impress us and some tremendous volumes up there that we think are going to \u2013 cost is going to continue to lower on, and those are the drivers. So I would just say, we think the need for this project will be out there and we think we've got some unique positions that allow us to maximize the profitability when we do decide to invest in that project.", "Ted J. Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you for that. And then a little more housekeeping here, but the \u2013 now, that we have Geismar up and running, the operating costs in the NGL & Petchem Services, is this sort of a good run rate that we saw in the quarter; or is there any other puts and takes there as we think about it going forward?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "John, you want to take that please?", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Sure. Glad to do that. Great question and thanks for it, Ted. I guess the run rate, if I thought about the earnings in the absence of any commodity price volatility, the earnings would be a reasonable run rate to look at for the business coming through this quarter. As I think Alan mentioned, Geismar is contributing. NGL services had a reasonably good quarter for NGL services in Canada with its commodity exposure, was probably third on the list there. As you're looking at the costs, we may have experienced some costs in this quarter that are just slightly higher than we would have expected for particularly the Geismar unit, but that would be on the order of just a few million dollars, so I wouldn't expect the costs to be hugely different going forward as the run rate goes, Ted. Hope that answers your question.", "Ted J. Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Perfect. That's it from me. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Ted.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Becca Followill of U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC", "Good morning, guys.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Becca.", "Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC", "(57:17) on the Chesapeake recent negotiation on the Haynesville MVCs, can you talk about what happens in a low gas price environment? Do they have an option for an outpay (57:26) or do they need to continue to drill into that agreement?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. I don't want to be too specific, but, first of all, for 2016 and 2017, as we mentioned earlier, our cash flow from the MVC has not changed, so there really is no change on that. And relative to the obligation to drill, that is a firm obligation and there isn't any out for pricing (57:51).", "Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC", "And then post 2017?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well 2017, that's when those MVCs ended naturally under the contract, so (58:03).", "Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC", "Okay.", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.", "And the design of the drilling obligation was to ensure that the volumes as the 2017 period ended were at a relatively high level.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So that really was really great trade for both of us on that. We allowed them to bring \u2013 combine those fields and allow them to put the best economics to work on their capital, but in exchange to that we both got a longer-term and better expectations for volumes and growth (58:39) in the future. So really (58:40) to find a winner and a loser on that, but I would just tell you from my vantage point, and believe me we've studied it hard that really, really is a win-win. And it only makes sense that there is, because when you're forcing people to make uneconomic capital decisions and you allow them to make better capital decisions you improve the lot (59:00) for both parties.", "Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC", "Thank you. And then can you talk about discussions with them? Are discussions continuing to maybe renegotiate some other of these contracts?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would just say that we're \u2013 we think those were the bulk of the opportunities, but we'll continue to look for opportunities if there are growth opportunities. And so always, always happy to work with them, great relationship developed there, and we're very, very thankful to have them as a customer. We think they're a great operator and have been very fair to work with. So we'll continue to look for opportunities, but we don't have anything immediately to offer on.", "Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Alan S.

Please go ahead.", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, Alan. How are you?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning. How are you?", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "I'm great. Thanks for all the color this morning. A lot of it's been a hit already, but just maybe two questions from me. The Gulf Connector project, looks like the proposed capacity there came down quite a bit from where you were before. Just wondering on any color you could offer on that project, either costing-wise or counterparty-wise your thoughts on initial versus maybe future expansion opportunities on the side then (01:00:23)?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question. Rory, would you take that question please?", "Rory Lee Miller - Senior Vice President, Atlantic \u2013 Gulf Operating Area", "Sure. Yeah. Good eye there, Christopher. Those numbers did change a little bit quarter-to-quarter. When we initially had that open season we had requests for much more capacity than we could handle, so we moved forward with two parties, and one of those parties has stepped out and decided that they are not going to pursue signing the agreements and making the commitment. So we've reduced the size of the project. Now, that's kind of the bad news.", "The good news is, some of those \u2013 one of the other players that wanted to get in, but couldn't is now going to have an opportunity to come into the project. So the project is going to be a bit smaller but the returns actually go up on the project. So we still think it's a very high quality project and one we're excited about pursuing. And kind of as you hinted out in your question, that does leave us some additional capacity that we have to work with for new opportunities that we think are going to be out there.", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the color on that. I guess switching gears and this is just my second question. Alan, really appreciate the update on shut-ins in the Northeast and your volumetric projections and thoughts around that there. Was curious if we pivot to the West performance, at least as we were thinking about it, it was pretty solid mostly on the pricing front this quarter. Just wondering how you're thinking about producer activities out there; potential volume movements as we move into 2016 out there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Sure. I'd just say that the producers just continue to find ways to bring in additional production out there as well with very, very few rigs running. But continue to find ways to do that, and as well are being very efficient with that. We are seeing some things that are pretty interesting out there in terms of new development. But I think our hope for that right now is to just \u2013 in the current pricing environment is to keep driving our unit costs low and keep the volumes as flat as possible, is kind of our expectation.", "The good news about the West relative to what we're seeing in the East is that, there's plenty of takeaway capacity, plenty of infrastructure, the gathering and processing costs are relatively low because it's older infrastructure that was built in a different pricing era. And so the variable cost or the cash cost to the producer to produce is relatively low. So we really just haven't \u2013 and we've seen very \u2013 we've seen a very small almost insignificant amount of ice-related shut-in, just like we would in any winter or shoulder month in the West.", "But overall, it's a very low cost place for variable production. And so we really don't expect a whole lot of change out there. So lots of reserves, lots of known reserves, and I think if we do see a price signal producers are ready to jump on it, but we're not expecting anything dramatic out of the area. And really proud of the team for working hard to keep our cash flows as steady as they have, considering how low NGL margins have been out (01:04:02).", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "Great. Thanks a lot, Alan. Thanks for your color this morning. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Sharon Lui of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Just wanted to, I guess, get your thoughts in terms of the pace of additional capital spending for gathering and processing assets in the Northeast, given the current environment? Specifically, maybe if you can talk about, I guess, the investments tied to the Utica with Chesapeake and how you see maybe that $600 million of capital ramp up over the years?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Great question. I would just say that we're really excited about that acreage dedication and think that once the infrastructure demand, or \u2013 sorry, the infrastructure constraints are lifted out there and the firm obligations that various customers have out there, they'll be working to take advantage of that firm capacity that they have, and so feel pretty good about the prospects of that.", "But I also would say that the way we're structured on that, we're not obligated to go spend that money out in front of the production showing up, and so we have an ability to step into that. So we're not going to be out spending capital in front of that drilling from a risk standpoint. But we do think that's a very, very good acreage, some really impressive cost levels available to it. And so we're really excited. We've got a very good vantage point of what people's production versus cost levels are. We're very excited about that acreage.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Bhavesh M. Lodaya - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hey, good morning. This is Bhavesh instead of John on. So most of my questions are answered. Just a question on Geismar. Given where ethylene prices are, curious to know your views on prices going ahead for the next maybe few quarters and whether there are any opportunities to maybe have any fee-based contracts against (01:06:28)?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "John, you want to take that please?", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Sure. Glad to take it and thanks for the question. Yeah. First of all, we're really pleased to be serving customers again back in Louisiana. It just so happened that as we brought Geismar back on, so did Evangeline come on, and so the market was well served. And I think looking back over our shoulder here, in the last quarter, the ethylene market was well served by production in that there were very few shutdowns or unexpected shutdowns. And I think in at least one of the months \u2013 say it was July, we saw industry-high production. So I think all of that lead to perhaps a bit of an oversupply or a slightly long market in ethylene and the necessary price adjustments that occurred during the quarter.", "I'll note, though, that over the last weeks, two weeks notionally, we recovered some of that price. It's come back up probably on the order of about $0.05 at this point. And so just to take the conversation a little further forward to answer your question, finally, as we look forward and we look into, we call it, the second quarter of next year, a couple of factors that'll play positively is a very high turnaround season. And I think another factor that will play positively is relatively low inventories of ethylene by any public accounting.", "So I'm certain that people are doing exchanges to fill their needs in next year, but low inventories and high shutdown rates, planned shutdown rates certainly bode well for the supply/demand balance, I think, in our favor. I hope that brings the necessary coloring; that's the way we see things playing out here over the next couple of quarters.", "Bhavesh M. Lodaya - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Sure. And are there any opportunities to tie in contracts, pricing-based contracts, on these?", "John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. Forgot to mention on that. We're always in the marketplace looking to secure the best value for our ethylene out there and we have been in conversations in past \u2013 I'll say, past quarters, including this last quarter, and we continue to have conversations with customers over whether or not they desire to enter into any sort of contracts, all in, including fee-for-service contracts and so trying to lock in some of the margins into the future.", "Of course, in this dynamic price environment, everyone sits across the table with kind of rubber guns pointed at each other, and we'll see where those negotiations go over time. But we're always looking, when it would appear to be favorable to us, to lock up solid volumes and solid margins on Geismar 1.", "Bhavesh M. Lodaya - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thank you. And thanks, Alan, and congrats on a great quarter.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much. Appreciate that.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, great. Well, thank you everybody for joining us this morning. We really appreciate the interest and appreciate you respecting the scope of our discussion this morning as well. So thank you for that.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "And at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John D. Porter - Director-Investor Relations, Enterprise & Planning", "Thank you, Angel. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners.", "Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And also we have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P.", "In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "Over the past many months, we've taken many questions related to the merger between Williams and Energy Transfer. The focus of our call today is our fourth quarter results and business outlook. So we're not going to take questions on the pending merger or other related matters. However, before we discuss our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results, I can provide a brief update on the transaction.", "Williams' Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer Equity per the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015, as expeditiously as possible and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams' stockholders. Completion of the pending transaction remains subject to the approval of Williams' stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Integration planning is underway.", "As previously discussed in Energy Transfer Corp. registration statement on S-4 filed November 24, 2015 with the SEC, ETE and Williams received a request for additional information and material from the FTC pursuant to the HSR Act review.", "On February 1, 2016, Energy Transfer Corporation received additional comments from the SEC related to the first amendment of the S-4. Certain requests made by the SEC relate to information that will be included in ETE and Williams' 10-Ks, which the companies expect to file the final week of February 2016, so next week. Therefore, the companies now expect to file a second amendment of the S-4 shortly after filing those 10-Ks.", "With that update, I want to reiterate that we won't be taking questions regarding the pending merger or other related matters. As always, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations teams for questions you may have. Thank you all in advance for your cooperation.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This is going to be a fairly brief presentation, we do want to \u2013 we will take a look at the fourth quarter results and also drivers for the full year. We'll offer our perspective this morning on one of our very important customers, Chesapeake, and a lot of concerns have been raised there. And we'll look at upcoming drivers that'll drive 2016 along with our 2016 capital plan.", "And then, finally some thoughts on the strength of our strategy in this difficult commodity price environment. We're very pleased with the way our business is holding up and as well, the kind of opportunities that continue to come at us in our effort to continue to connect these low price natural gas supplies into growing demand markets.", "So with that, let's look on slide two here. We recorded another strong quarter demonstrating our continued project execution, reliable operating performance and the resilience of our business to grow despite sharply lower commodity prices and what turned out to be a very mild start to the winter here in the fourth quarter.", "Even with the reduced producer activities in the supply areas, we enjoyed continued growth in fee-based revenues, primarily from demand-driven projects and expansions that were brought into service during the year. Our continued focused on a clear strategy, project execution and cost management are evident in our results.", "And very importantly, despite the pressures impacting the industry, we once again saw the dramatic growth in our fee-based revenues offset the impact of continued lower commodity prices. In fact, our adjusted EBITDA was up 25% over 4Q 2014, and our full year adjusted EBITDA was up a total of 26% despite very low NGL and olefins margins. In fact, I think impressive status across all of our system. Just on our gas gathered volumes, we were up off a very big number in terms of our total gathered volumes. We were up 6% on total gathered volumes for the year despite a lower producers activities and a lot of very significant curtailments that continue to exist.", "Looking directly at the fourth quarter, the WPZ DCF of $718 million produced a coverage ratio of 0.99x and, of course, this is before we would \u2013 if you were to include the substantial impact of the $209 million IDR waiver. This would lift our coverage up to 1.39x. And of course, this is not insignificant and certainly provides support for funding our 2016 growth capital program.", "Highlights for the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2014 comparison, I'll just give you the highlights here. First of all, fee-based revenues were up $139 million or 12% and that was driven primarily by Atlantic-Gulf and with a lot of fee-based assets that came online during the year and as well as growth at Access.", "Our olefins margins were up $43 million to $71 million, and this was strong operating performance at our Geismar plant with low per-unit margins due to low olefins prices. So, great results on the operating side at Geismar and actually across all of our NGL & Petchem Services during the quarter, but relatively low olefins margins there in the fourth quarter.", "The proportional EBITDA of equity method investments were up $37 million or 22% and most of that was coming off of our Discovery asset where the Keathley Canyon Connector continues to perform very well. There was a little bit of maintenance during the period, but those volumes remain very strong out there on that system.", "NGL margins were down $45 million or 52% and NGL prices now in the fourth quarter were 13-year low. And the full year 2015 NGL margin was only $160 million, which represents less than 4% of our consolidated EBITDA during 2015.", "And I did want to make a note have here on the impairment. We took some very large impairments in the fourth quarter, and these were largely a result of dramatic decline in the market value of WPZ and some tests required there up against the full market value and in the fourth quarter. So that was the value of WPZ in the fourth quarter and then the implied market values of the investments and associated goodwill. So looking at the total market value of WPZ up against the implied market values of our investments and associated goodwill.", "Of course, as you'll recall, the impaired equity method investments and certain of the impaired goodwill relate primarily to the acquisition of Access Midstream Partners, which we were required to book a significant $2.5 billion gain in 2014 and this reflected our purchase price allocation to these assets in 2014. So, as you'll recall, we had a big gain in 2014 associated with that acquisition and a lot of that goodwill then was taken out with this new test against the market value.", "And so, now, just a few thoughts on the result by segment. Atlantic-Gulf had another great quarter, up $122 million all on fee-based revenues and so very impressive growth continued there in the Atlantic-Gulf. And for the full year, Atlantic-Gulf was actually up $453 million and a lot of this is coming off of projects like Gulfstar One as well as the Transco expansion projects, and again the Keathley Canyon Connector on our Discovery system, so tremendous growth there in our fee-based revenues. This was offset a little bit by lower NGL margins, of course, but overall really very impressive performance.", "You might have noticed as well that Atlantic-Gulf had a little bit of higher cost in the fourth quarter and most of this was just related to \u2013 we had some repairs on the Leidy Line, as well as some additional testing required by the regulators there. And so, we continue to work on the Leidy Line there where we had a rupture on that line earlier in the year. And so a lot of continued work there that shows up in our O&M expense.", "On the Access or what will now be the Central OA, we reported fourth quarter of 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $351 million and that was compared to $325 million, and a lot of this was just driven by a continued growth in the business. But we did as well have an increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream joint venture that helps drive some of that as well.", "On the Northeast G&P, flat fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter of 2014, but a 30% growth year-over-year. So, we were at in 2014 full year was $276 million and we were up $80 million to $356 million here in 2015 and for the full year. So, really driven by continued increased service fees at Ohio Valley Midstream, higher overall volumes and those were offset by some higher operating expenses, including some line repairs that were required earlier in the year as well there.", "Really important note here, we did sign a new gathering agreement with an existing customer during \u2013 here very recently and we were really excited about this that it's going \u2013 we do \u2013 it does produce a lower rate for the customer, but we've got some incremental volumes that are coming on associated with that agreement as well as some much larger acreage dedications that came with that. So, really excited about this new agreement.", "And we're not counting on any new drilling anticipated here for 2016 on that. And even without that new drilling, we expect our revenues to be held flat for 2016 despite the lower rate just because there are some new volumes that come to us as a result of transaction and some new wells \u2013 or some new production that's being tied in. So a lot of similar story in the Northeast where we continue to tie in production that's already been drilled.", "We're really not relying in the Northeast. We're really not relying on new drilling rigs out there. We're really just relying on tying in, continued tie in of production. But the real key force there will be when we start to see some of the takeaway projects take hold because that clearly is the constraint out here. It's not a matter of rigs running in the area; it's simply a matter of seeing some these big bottlenecks open up and then us tying in a lot of this already completed production and seeing that flow for us.", "In the fourth quarter \u2013 sorry, on the NGL & Petchem side, really great operating results for NGL & Petchem from an operating standpoint, but we did have lower unit margins during the period. So really pretty good operating stint, both in Canada and Geismar in terms of volumes, but again very low unit margins. Just to remind you there, for the year, we were $216 million lower, but this was due to the lack of the insurance proceeds and about $89 million lower commodity margins. So a big step down, but again most of that was just due to the loss of some assumed business interruption proceeds that we booked in 2014.", "In the West, great continued focus on cost management in the area. We were off about $15 million versus fourth quarter of 2014, and that was really driven by $27 million lower NGL margins as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And again, I'll remind you, NGL margins are now at a 13-year low. But really proud of the team out there and their continued focus on cost management and able to continue to generate very significant EBITDA despite low prices.", "Moving on to slide three, this is a really important slide here we wanted to show you. We certainly had a lot of questions about Chesapeake and our relationship and a lot of focus by investors on the credit risk related to Chesapeake. And so we really wanted to just take this opportunity to walk everyone through some facts and some of our perspective as a midstream service provider that plays a critical role in getting the natural gas production from a wellhead to marketable condition and location.", "So, first, I note that we have a very strong relationship with Chesapeake. We appreciate them as a great operator in the nation's very best shale resources. They have some of the very best acreage in large contiguous blocks, and we are very pleased to have the opportunity to serve them as a key customer and one of the best large scale operators from our perspective. So, I tell you, we are constantly impressed with the way this team continued to be able to lower their cost and work out creative solutions with us and other parties, and really thankful for the relationship.", "They are paying their bills in a timely manner as usual and including, we just recently got paid for the minimum volume commitment related to the Haynesville, and we fully expect them to pay the MVC invoice on the Barnett when it's due. It's not due yet. But we're excited about continue to work with them on that and fully expect that to come through as well, just as they paid the Haynesville on time. So, from our view, they continue to reduce their costs and operate efficiently and effectively to maintain liquidity. And nevertheless, though, we are mindful of the credit risk that these continued low prices pose for many producers, including Chesapeake.", "And so here's how we think about the risk. First of all, we have long-term dedications with strong contractual conveyances of interest in unproduced gas. We like our argument that we hold a current real estate interest in unproduced gas and that our covenant running with the land not subject to the rejection and bankruptcy. We certainly are following current bankruptcy cases like Sabine where the general question is at issue, but people should understand that the ultimate outcome in individual cases will turn on specific facts and circumstances.", "Regardless, even if the court were to rule we don't have such legal rights, our gathering lines are physically connected to Chesapeake's wellheads and pads and we provide a very critical service, conditioning and connecting Chesapeake's production to points where they can then choose the best markets for the long-haul transportation alternatives.", "In exchange for the dedication of production, we invested capital to build gathering lines that are uniquely positioned to serve Chesapeake's well. So all these systems were built out specifically for their needs and generally at their direction and to the size and scale that they needed to be able to produce volumes on a projected basis.", "In most cases, there are not other gathering lines nearby because these are big contiguous areas and these systems were built specifically for their production. And in many cases, our pipelines have been built on populated places such as beneath the city of Fort Worth and it would be very costly for others to replicate our gathering lines. And the rates of return that we generate from these investments and assets are very typical for a midstream provider.", "Likewise, our gathering lines have been in place for some time and thus the reserves behind them are now partially produced. To continue to produce such gas, Chesapeake and its creditors, if it ever came to that, would want and need to utilize our gathering lines to deliver gas to the markets. So, such gathering lines are very distinguishable from long-haul transportation service because the intra- and interstate pipeline initiate service after the gas has already pooled at marketable points. Producers then have many options to receive cash for their products other than transportation on any one particular interstate pipeline.", "If it did come to a bankruptcy, a producer can argue that it can reject certain types of contracts and we believe gathering contracts such as ours are not the type of contracts that would be rejected. But even if a gathering contract were allowed to be rejected, a producer and its creditors would continue to need the gathering service to be able to produce gas and create revenue. If a producer rejects the gathering contract in a bankruptcy, the gatherer will no longer be obligated to provide the gathering service.", "Furthermore, rejection of a contract is all or nothing. Therefore, the analysis of the risk of any producer's bankruptcy is best analyzed contract by contract and really understanding that the particulars of the services being provided and how unique those services are that are being provided.", "As any prudent midstream service provider would do, we have studied each of our Chesapeake contracts and considered the value of Chesapeake's reserves, our physical connection to their wells and their alternative options for delivering gas to market, and we believe that we understand much better than anyone the real value of our assets if it ever came to a bankruptcy process.", "But let me be very clear on this matter, we have great confidence in Chesapeake in their assets and more importantly, in their tremendous operating capabilities and management team. Thus far, they have continued to do all the right things in very difficult circumstances and we look forward to helping them be very successful for years and years to come and we have great confidence in their ability to do that. We will continue to find win-win solutions that align our interest and to support them where we can in their asset sales.", "And as you can see in the table on this slide, Williams' scope and scale of gathering in all of the key natural gas basins is significant. And there are significant non-Chesapeake working interests in basins as well that also give us confidence and the continued cash flows from these assets.", "So, overall, we'd just tell you we are very proud of our relationship with Chesapeake. We're very impressed with them and \u2013 but we also don't have our head in the sand and we are looking very closely to these alternatives. And we feel very strong about our position if it ever were to come to a bankruptcy.", "Moving on to slide four, this is just an overview here of some of the recent developments and what we see coming soon. First of all, I want to reiterate that the demand side of the natural gas market is really driving our capital investments and you can just see that as you look at some of these projects, the Transco Leidy expansion just came in and that \u2013 first part of that started up on December 8. And then we continue to bring segments on in-service through the month of December and now here in January, we are fully completed with all segments in service now for the Leidy Southeast expansion. Great work by the team under some difficult circumstances, but really great performance by the team that manage that project.", "The Transco Gulf Trace project, this is a project to serve the Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG facility. Construction is underway with a target in-service of first quarter. 2017. We'd just tell you it's nice to be able to be doing construction in more friendly environments like Louisiana and the teams did a great job of bringing that project board as well.", "The Transco Gulf Connector project, which is the new long-term contract we just announced for 475 million a day of new expansion service that will also serve Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Freeport LNG facilities, that would be in 2019.", "And then just a note here quickly on the Marcellus and Utica volumes. The real story going on in the Marcellus and Utica is that we are seeing both growth in available production. So, what do we mean by available production? We mean the production if there were markets available that could actually be flowing. We continue to see that grow behind our systems and we also saw significant price-related shut-ins in the quarter. So this bottleneck, if you will, continues to grow in size with available production growing up behind a very constrained outlet and lower-than-usual regional demand in the areas.", "But I think it's important to know that we now have over 33% of the gathered volumes in the area and this really leaves us with great exposure once the bottlenecks are cleared. And I think what's really important to note there is that we're not relying on drilling capital for those volumes. All we need is some of those bottlenecks to open up and we'll have volumes flowing without the need for a lot of additional drilling capital. And so, this is very different in most areas of the country where there's a lot of concerns about producers not having the capital to drill. In this area, it's just a matter of the infrastructure being built out in front of it.", "And then, finally, our Geismar plant. Really proud of the way the team operated the plant and we exceeded our production expectations for the quarter there and are off to a good start here in 1Q of 2015 as well there \u2013 or, sorry, 1Q of 2016 as well.", "Just looking forward some things that are going to drive us looking forward. The Canadian Offgas Processing business, the Horizon project that you've heard us talk about quite a bit. That plant is now the Fort McMurray plant, so that's the plant that actually extracts the liquids out of the offgas is now rolling and it has began extracting liquids, but that will be a process here over the next three weeks or so to get that up to full production.", "And then, finally, we've got to some remaining work at Redwater to be able to fractionate all those liquids and we expect that to be coming on in March. So a lot of new revenues that will show up there on WPZ as those volumes hit both the pipeline and the Redwater fractionators. And then I'll remind you that the margin side of that business is left at WMB at the Horizon facility upstream.", "As well our Kodiak tieback, this is a tieback for Devil's Tower platform, and that project is being brought online and has been in the testing phase here for the last couple of weeks and is just about to begin to really add some very significant cash flow here in the first quarter.", "And then, the Gunflint tieback, which we expect to come on now in the second quarter, which will be our first big tieback to the Gulfstar One project and this is \u2013 will also be contributing very substantial cash flow growth with very minimal additional capital investment on our part. We do expect the Gulfstar production to be a little bit higher in the first quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter due to some well workover work that was going on out there, and so we're excited to see some of the benefits of that work that will start to improve things here into the first quarter and beyond.", "Last year, we announced plans to increase the capacity on our Eastern interstate pipeline from 10.8 Bcf to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of 2017. And in fact, by 2017, we expect to double the capacity of the Transco system from its 2010 level. So once again, these projects just keep coming and we've got great transparency into our predictable growth and it provides clear evidence that Williams has a truly unique position in terms of our asset footprint, especially in challenging market times.", "Our backlog of project remains robust and the demand side project just keeps coming at us with amazing pace and consistency and, in particular, along the Transco system. These are fully contracted demand pull projects and we will continue to high-grade these opportunities as we balance constrained funding sources up against continued robust backlog. So, our issue is not a matter of backlog, we have plenty of great investment opportunity; it's really a matter of getting lower \u2013 better funding sources and low cost funding sources to supply all these opportunities. So, we're in a envious position of having plenty of opportunity and again just a matter of getting those funded appropriately.", "Moving on to slide five. So as we said before, much of the attention in the industry is focused on producer shut-ins and commodity prices. We remain focused on serving and capturing the growing demand for natural gas. This focus is especially important in the Northeast where we're working to unlock the tremendous value of the Marcellus and Utica areas by providing market access via the Constitution and Atlantic-Gulf projects. Our strategic remains intact and the underlying fundamentals of our business are strong despite reduced producer activities in the supply areas.", "And just a few weeks ago, we announced our revised business plan to address the realities of our current market environment while continuing to invest in our business. In addition to significantly lower operating expenses in 2016, the revised 2016 plan includes growth capital funding needs of around $2.1 billion, which is about $1 billion or 32% less than our previous plans.", "The plan includes $1.3 billion for Transco expansions and other interstate pipeline projects. And the non-interstate pipeline growth that's embedded here totals about $700 million, and this is primarily reflecting additional investments across our gathering and processing systems where capital spending for gathering and processing in 2016 will be limited to really new producer volumes, including mostly wells that are already drilled and completed, but that are waiting connecting infrastructure. So, as I said earlier, we're really not depending on a whole lot of drilling here in 2016; we're really just focused on connecting and getting volumes that are already connected flowing.", "Moving on to slide six here just to close out. First of all, the fourth quarter results certainly demonstrate the resilience of our fee-based assets. Approximately 93% of PZ's gross margin were from fee-based revenues. The continued growth in Atlantic-Gulf segment continue to be driven by great expansions on our Transco system, as well as our deepwater volumes.", "And sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes really was impressive; in fact, total operated volumes in this key region were up 8% as you compare the fourth quarter to the third quarter. While the total volumes in the regions, so not just ours, but looking at the total industry production, actually declined a little less than 1%. So again, total region declined a little less than 1%, but our volumes were actually up by 8%. So really continue to grow our market share in this very important region.", "Our 2016, WPZ business plan really did address the realities of our current market environment and continues our investments in growing the demand side of our business. Certainly, we continue to high-grade our opportunities and a lot of that capital is going towards really important demand-driven infrastructure projects that serve long-term natural gas needs of local distribution companies, electric power generation, LNG and industrial sources.", "And so, just to reiterate, this quarter's results and our continued strong backlog of projects are a direct reflection of our strategy to uniquely position Williams to connect the best natural gas supplies to the best markets regardless of significant market swings and cycles.", "And so, as we move to questions, I'd like to highlight what John mentioned in the opening. The Williams' Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer for the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015 and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams' stockholders.", "Beyond that, though, we're only discussing our fourth quarter and year-end results and we ask that you keep your questions focused on our results. We will not take questions related to the pending transaction between Williams and ETE or related matters, and we thank you in advance for your cooperation for that request.", "And so now, operator, let's please move on to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Christine Cho of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if we could start with any insights that you guys have from your talks with the rating agencies and your commitment to the investment grades rating at WPZ, given all the agencies had taken action before your press release detailing reduced CapEx. Any color on how they feel about your CapEx cut, deferrals, your Chesapeake exposure, your asset sales, et cetera? Also, if you could talk about where they would like to see your debt/EBITDA ratio to get to? I mean, are they still okay with that 5 times?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Christine, this is Don. Good morning. Great question. We've been in regular dialogue with S&P and the other agencies. And I really can't speak for the agencies, but I think we've had a very constructive conversation and I think they appreciate the strength of our business, as well as some of the challenges ahead, and we're continuing to work with them and look forward to their decision. And again, we're very much focused on maintaining that investment grade rating, but obviously it's their call.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. I guess in that context, you stated at least $1 billion of asset sales in the first half of 2016 in the original press release. What kind of asset sales are you assuming? And I'm curious to know if you started the process for this and what type of parties you're talking to. Is it utility, midstream guys, financial guys? And should we expect to see any announcements before the deal closes or do we need to see the deal closed first?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I would say that we're preparing for the asset sales. We've not launched anything as of this date, yet we're confident that we can sell the assets and generate the liquidity that we previously outlined kind of in the second quarter. But at the same time, we're not identifying the assets at this point. We don't think it's in our interest to do so. We have quite a few assets that we could in fact monetize, so we're going to keep our options open, but we remain confident in our ability to do so.", "The merger does not need to close. So we'll execute on that either before or after the merger, depending on the exact merger timing.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then, I just wanted to touch upon the bankruptcy comments that you guys had. Alan, you talked about with respect to a rejection, it's all or nothing. And so, I'm curious to know, let's say, the bankruptcy court says that these contracts cannot be rejected, does that mean legally, you guys aren't required to mark to market the rate at all or let go of the MVCs or is that debatable?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. No, that is right. It is everything. Those contracts are all-in-one and it's all the terms of the contract, so there isn't ability to cherry pick the terms the contract.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Alan, I'll start off on a bright note. Transco expansion projects, some puts and takes in the backlog, but it looks like, by and large, that looks like on track for a multi-year period. Would you care to contrast Transco's projects with others that are on the project list across the board and the peers in terms of likelihood of going ahead and maybe benefit on an incremental basis to Transco as some of those more heavily producer-backed projects that don't show up in 2016 and 2017?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think we really don't have those risks in our projects right now. They're fully contracted and they're very secured credit standing behind those contracts. So we really don't have that kind of risk in the projects that we are utilizing with Transco. And so there are a lot of producer-pushed projects out there with very different kind of credit rating standing behind them, but in our case, we feel very strong about the credit and the term standing behind our projects. And there's certainly great push to move ahead with those and a lot of volumes packed up behind those systems ready to flow if and when we get those projects completed.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "And this is looking into a crystal ball, but do you think there's any possibility of some incremental counterparties that are on projects that may not go forward that would eventually accrue to the Transco system?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, perhaps. The only thing I would say to that is there would have to be expansions likely because we have a really clear idea where all those volumes are going to come from that are supporting those projects that we have and they're completely sold out. So it would have to be in the form of expansions beyond what we have today.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Fair enough. On the gathering and processing CapEx more than cut in half, is there any incremental risk to or possibility to that $700 million getting cut further for 2016?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, to a certain degree. For instance, some of that capital is out in the Permian, and in that case, we're going off of the operators' indication on how much capital will be spent out there; operator being the operator of the midstream assets. Most of that's non-operator investment for us and so we're depending on both the producers and the midstream operator forecast of that and that continues to be a moving target in many basins.", "So I would say in those areas, those more oil-driven basins could be some movement down. I would say in the areas like in the Marcellus or the Utica, we're managing that very closely and trying to optimize the timing of the capital right in line with the opening of new projects coming out of the area. And so there's probably some room to optimize, if you will, and the way some of that capital until the projects are specifically coming on time. So, we could see a little bit of that slip, but a lot of that is already underway and the work is ongoing.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Actually, that's helpful color. And then just finally from me on that last point, Marcellus and Utica volumes. You said you saw some shut-ins fourth quarter. Any indication that those are coming back online with winter demand in the first quarter?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We saw a little bit pickup and we certainly saw interest from producers who shut in and were bringing back online. So we actually have seen some people taking advantage. We've seen some these cold weather surges.", "What you have to really remember about the demand in the Northeast there is it's driven by two things. First of all, its capacity to get out of the region and that's pretty fixed. In other words, those pipelines are completely full getting out of the region and so that doesn't move a whole lot. But what does move in a regional demand based on weather loads in the area where gas is consumed in the region. And so that'll be either driven by cold weather, which we've seen a little bit here in the first quarter, or it'll be driven by very hot weather in the summertime and those are the two things that will drive the variable. Until some of these projects \u2013 new projects come online, that will be what drives the volumes in the Northeast. There's plenty of gas ready to meet that demand as it opens up.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "All right. Thank you, Alan. Appreciate it.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Appreciate all the color on the Chesapeake contract. I guess I'm just wondering about \u2013 it seems like I'm sensing a tone change from you around your willingness to renegotiate the contract. I think you'd already done the one in the Haynesville. Does that now change your view there? And there's an argument out there that such as commodity prices that's pressuring Chesapeake it's also the above-market gathering contracts. I just love your thoughts there.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. No, our \u2013 I'm sorry if I gave you that impression. We continue to work with Chesapeake in areas to help in negotiating and I would say nothing has changed on that. Our relationship with them is very strong.", "And the concept of the rate \u2013 we keep hearing this above-market rate and I think what people need to remember there is that the rates get set based on the capital that we spent and the returns that are very normal returns in the market. And so, we hear this term above-market rates a lot of the time, but in fact, really the returns that we're generating are very normal. What's occurred that caused the rates to go higher in some areas is where the volumes haven't shown up, but we're still the asked return on our invested capital is very normal for the space.", "But certainly no indication \u2013 or no, I didn't mean to indicate that our tone with Chesapeake has changed. We're simply \u2013 and I want to make really clear on this, all we're trying to address is all the concerns that have been expressed by the investors and media, not necessarily our own. We've always kept an eye on the issue as we do with any big customer, but our relationship with Chesapeake and our confidence in them remains very high.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Appreciate that. Maybe just a couple of other ones from me on Chesapeake issue. What is the returns revenue or EBITDA you're earning right now in the Barnett, in the Haynesville and then can you give us a sense of the overall contribution from Chesapeake to your EBITDA?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We'd take on that first part in terms of our return. Yeah, those returns were set kind of in the mid-teen range on all of those assets and that's what we continue to try to seek out like in our renegotiations in the Haynesville and so forth. We continue to seek out that type of return there. So, that really hasn't changed.", "The overall contribution of Chesapeake to our EBITDA, I'll have Don maybe take that one.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I think it's around 20% plus or minus. It depends on the period, but somewhere in that zipcode. I think 18% was the most recent.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. That's helpful. And then lastly from me on the financing side, you did the Transco bond recently. Is that another tool that you think like you can use more, I hate to call it a stand-alone leverage at Transco, relative to other financing sources that are out there?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I think our plan is to keep Transco in the sweet spot for its rate-making purpose. So we are not inclined to put more leverage on Transco.", "Now, Transco has a lot of growth so, certainly, it'll naturally absorb some additional debt as it continues to build out its projects. But in terms of just adding leverage to Transco, that's not our plan.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. That's it from me. Thank you.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Becca Followill of the U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC", "Good morning. Few questions for you. One, can you quantify the lower OpEx that you're looking for the reduction in terms of dollars for 2016? And then the second one is on the contract that you recently renegotiated with a customer for lower rates in exchange for higher volumes. Are you looking at doing other of the \u2013 more of those with customers that are not Chesapeake?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Becca, I will take the second half of that and I'll let John take the first part of that. As to the contracts in any negotiation, that was a situation where the rate from a legacy cost of service contract was so high that there was no way the reserves in the area would ever be produced and so it was a matter of rate being even in excess of the price of gas. And so, this was a matter of actually getting the gas flowing and assuring ourselves that the gas would continue to flow in exchange for some additional volumes and additional dedication in the area.", "So, whenever we have opportunities like that that we can bring increment to our gas \u2013 or, sorry, our cash flows as we look on a long-term basis, we certainly will try to take advantage. And there are plenty of win-win opportunities out there to increase our cash flows to get gas flowing that's not flowing today. Obviously, we have to be cognizant of the fact because I mentioned earlier that there is only so much gas that's going to get out of the region. And so we want to maximize those revenues on our system because we realized that when Mcf starts flowing in one place, it likely means that it didn't come off a competitor system; it would come off of our own system. So we certainly are cognizant of that issue and the strength getting out of the basin.", "John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC", "On the cost question, Becca, we've not put an exact number out there, I guess, for significant cost production that we're committed to. We're already implementing some of those cost reductions. We'll continue to implement additional cost reductions prior to the merger date. And then, we would expect even more significant cost reductions to follow the merger.", "So the merger date is a variable in that, as well as our joint planning with the ETE team in terms of such cost reduction. So we're not prepared to put a number out there at this point, but we will as we get further along in the year.", "Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC", "Understand. Thank you. And then just to go back to the question on the rate reduction, are there producers \u2013 because we get these questions constantly, are the producers actively requesting rate reductions from you guys in order to help them out through this period?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Certainly that's the case, Becca, and I think what our decision is, is what benefit do we get out of that. Again, we have to look at it knowing that there's only a certain amount of gas that's going to get out of the region. And so, we have to determine what the benefit that they're willing to offer in exchange for us lowering the rate up against current prices in a way that provides the cash margin.", "So, we understand people's cash margins very well. Truly no secret in terms of what that looks like to producers because we get it from so many different people. And it really just boils down to who's got the best offer in terms of exchange for us in terms of us being incented to see their gas flows over somebody else's.", "Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC", "Got you. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Selman Akyol of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "First question I guess for Don. Going back to sort of the credit rating agencies discussion, you said you look forward to a decision. Can you say when you expect to get a decision from them?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I can't give you their timing. I think, again, you'll have to speak to the agencies on that. But again, we've been working collaboratively with them to provide the information that they need to make their rating decisions.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right. And then just in terms of the related shut-ins, just wondering if you could just put a quantity to that in terms of how much has been shut in on your system?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I'm going to ask Jim Scheel to chime in and give some specifics on that if he could, please.", "James E. Scheel - Senior VP-Northeast Gathering & Processing", "Sure, Selman. As we began the fourth quarter, we had just under 1 Bcf a day shut-in primarily, as we've already talked about, due to lower pricing coming out of the summer and some lack of takeaway capacity. As we begin the year, we probably have right at about 1.1 Bcf a day or perhaps a little bit more shut-in behind the system as we've seen producers continue to complete wells but throttle the production due to price. So it's kind of hard to know until we see a full flow, but we're estimating right at the 1.1 Bcf.", "And really just to put that in perspective, if that was all flowing, the Northeast would go from about 6 Bcf a day to 7 Bcf a day and our incremental EBITDA would probably increase by about $180 million to $900 million, overall.", "Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right. Thank you. That does it for me.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Sharon Lui of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning. You indicated, I guess, there are several projects slated for in-service during the first half of 2016. Can you just remind us what's the potential cash program for projects like the tie-ins?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I don't think we've provided \u2013 I'm looking at John here.", "John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC", "Yeah.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think, Sharon, we provided specifics on those, but I do think we've said that those are significant. And so you can look to the kind of revenues that we get off of facilities like Devil's Tower and Gulfstar One. And you can think about that from a volumetric standpoint as both the Kodiak tie-in that comes into Devil's Tower and the Gunflint tieback comes on to Gulfstar, but they're certainly very significant. Of course, just like any deepwater wells, they come on gangbusters and decline over time, but they will be fairly significant in terms of cash flow additions when they start up.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then, I guess just following up on Christine's question about discussions with the rating agencies and the distribution policy, just your latest thoughts on whether a distribution reduction would be an option you would take to defend the investment grade rating?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sharon, this is Don. We have a number of options. Obviously, we pointed at cost reductions, asset sales, potential partners on some of our projects to reduce capital needs and a variety of other tools. We certainly are mindful of the fact we've got significant cash flow that goes out in the form of distributions, but again we don't have any further guidance on that but that's always an option.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And maybe this question is for John. In terms of looking at Geismar, I mean ethylene prices still remain pretty depressed. Just wondering what's your outlook for the balance of the year in terms of ethylene and propylene prices.", "John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC", "Yeah. Thanks, Sharon, for the question. As we take a look forward, I think it's rather well-known in the industry that there's a rather large turnaround season ahead of us here in the second quarter. And so, on the ethylene side, we think that's going to be up favorable to margins during the second quarter.", "But then as we look at the ethylene industry overall, in North America this past year, we set an all-time new record for ethylene production. And of course, our ability to export ethylene and ethylene derivatives is somewhat yet limited by bagging and terminalling particularly in the polyethylene case. And so we would expect that the second half of the year on ethylene reverts back to margins more akin to what we're experiencing today.", "On the propylene side, likewise propylene refinery turnarounds are happening right around now. They get those done in expectation of gasoline production for the summer season basically. And so, we have a rather stable outlook on propylene at the moment through the rest of the year.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah. Hi. Just wanted to clarify \u2013 going back to Chesapeake and how things work in a bankruptcy scenario. We're just curious with the MVCs then, would those stay or would those go? Or are they separate from some of the contracts? I mean, any color you can provide on that would be helpful.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, sure. Just to be clear, those MVCs are part and parcel to the agreement. There's no separate agreement; it's all one agreement. And in a proceeding \u2013 any proceeding, the final decision there would be for the creditors to decide if they wanted to accept or reject the contract. And so that's how that would go. And it's all or none in terms of they don't get to again decide anything.", "So I know there's been a lot of talk about the MVCs being at risk, but that's somewhat \u2013 I'm not sure what's driven that assumption by the investor base, but that's not the way it works. And as well, the market-based rate issue, while that might occur during a short-term period, during the proceedings, there might be an ability to take something to market rates if all the other protections that we talked about were to fail. Then it would just be during the interim period prior to the settlement of the proceedings.", "John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. So, I mean as a practical matter, would there be the possibility to renegotiate those and then submit it to the court for approval? Or is it just literally simply it's all or none, take it or leave it?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. No, John. I think if there was a reason for us to negotiate, then, yes, that could be part of a settlement. But the decision really is to accept or reject. And really, our point is if the contract is rejected, then we no longer have an obligation to provide service. And because these assets are built uniquely for these reserves, the ability to duplicate these assets would be, from our vantage point anyway, in most of these cases just would not be feasible to build or duplicate all these facilities in these very heavily \u2013 particularly places like the Barnett where it's very heavily populated and very expensive to build in, especially when you've got less reserves than you started with to build the assets in the first place.", "So, anyway, it could come down to a negotiation if there was value to be shared between the parties in a better contract, but our point is just that there isn't any ability to just separate. If somebody accepts the contract, they accept the contract in its whole. And if they reject it, then they take the risk of not being able to get their product moved out of the basin.", "John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just following on the contracts that are up for renewal or renegotiation. So following an earlier question, I think it was Selman that was asking it and the answer was \u2013 $180 million to $900 million is the amount that I guess would be \u2013 I mean, is that a renegotiation or was that just the amount that's due to shut-in? So just for you to clarify on that.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Oh, sorry, this is on Jim Scheel's. No, I think I can clean that up. All that is \u2013 Jim was saying, if the existing shut-in gas that's already contracted that's sitting behind our systems today, because it doesn't have anywhere to go, it's constrained in terms of bottleneck. It's already connected to our systems and ready to flow, so there's no additional capital required by anybody, but what has to happen is the markets in the downstream long-haul have to open up. And if that were to open up, that's the amount of \u2013 that $180 million is the amount of incremental income that we would see, or EBITDA.", "John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "All right. That's helpful. And then just last question along those lines. In terms of contracts that are in current discussion or renegotiation, is there any kind of EBITDA-at-risk figure you can provide to us or how should we be thinking about that?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. No, we really \u2013 so far in our negotiations, we've been able to hold our EBITDA steady under these contracts. And, of course, that's extremely important to us so we haven't backed up in these negotiations. We haven't backed up our EBITDA that we're getting in the current environment. So that hasn't occurred and we wouldn't expect it to.", "John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And gentlemen, there are no further questions. At this time, I'd like to hand it back over to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Very good. Again, thank you all very much for joining us. Really pleased with the way the business continues to operate in this difficult commodity environment, and very excited about the amount of growth projects that are out in front of us that are consistent with our strategy of taking advantage of seeing these low price natural gas really develop a lot demand. And so, we're very excited about where we sit and we appreciate your interest in the company.

Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams and Williams Partners Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John D. Porter - Head-Investor Relations", "Yeah. Thanks, Keith. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily.", "Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions, and we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Central; and Jim Scheel leads the Northeast Gathering & Processing area.", "In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.", "There are a lot of calls today. So we're planning on keeping our call to about an hour. If we miss any of your questions, feel free to follow up with Investor Relations later on today.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're certainly glad to have you here this morning. And we've got quite a bit of information to go through, and we do have a tight timeline. So I'll try to move through this pretty quickly and then turn it over to Don for some comments, and I'll come back and close.", "So I'd like to start off today just telling you something I'm very proud of relative to Williams, and really that is how this organization has stuck together and despite a lot of the upstairs issues and a lot of the distractions has remained very focused on executing our strategy, which our entire team is very excited about and just couldn't be more proud of the way the organization has really rallied and is absolutely all in on executing what we think is by far the best strategy in the industry. And so this focus that we've had certainly showed up here in the second quarter and we continue to see some great execution on all these projects that we have coming to fruition and tremendous amount of work going on up and down the system right now, particularly, on the Transco system, as we expand that out to meet all the growing demands there.", "So I would tell you that as well in addition to the employee base, I would tell you very thankful for the board and their commitment and very active engaged board right now, working very hard, overseeing the execution of our plan and our strategy and very much appreciate their engagement as well.", "So the plan for today's call is to walk you through our strong second quarter results and then discuss our execution on key initiatives and growth projects. Don Chappel will discuss the immediate measures that we're implementing to enhance value, strengthen the WPZ credit profile and fund a significant portfolio of really big large scale fee-based projects and all while maintaining flexibility to review financial and operational plans.", "So we're going to \u2013 these measures, you'll see as we go through the DRIP program for Williams Partners. And as you've seen in our earnings release, we're also announcing a dividend reduction at Williams and the new level of our dividend will allow Williams to retain about $1.3 billion annually and that will be reinvested back into Williams Partners. So really think this is a great answer for bringing us the right cost of capital to go invest against all these great growth projects that we have as the natural gas market and the demand side continues to expand out.", "Moving on to slide two here, we'll talk about the quarter. As you'll recall, in the first quarter of the year, we launched several actions to address the realities that we had as we saw a lot slower growth going on in the key supply areas as the demand side was building out, but the production side really was starting to see some pretty reduced activity even in the best basins here in the nation.", "So, as a result of that, we really focused on two things that we talked about in the first quarter. One was our asset sales, and we talked about getting our asset sales done with in excess of $1 billion in asset sales, and we also talked about cost reductions. We made great progress on both of those in the quarter. First of all, we expect here in the third quarter now to finalize an agreement to sell the Canadian business, and the expected proceeds on that in excess of $1 billion, as we told you, and in addition to that, Williams Partners' share of that sale is expected to be in excess of $800 million.", "On the cost side, really terrific execution on the team's part here, and we went after those costs right at the end of the first quarter. We took some action. We continue to take action across the organization and showing up here pretty dramatically, here in the second quarter, with $55 million lower O&M and G&A expenses than we had in the second quarter of 2015. And I would tell you that's even on top of the growth in our business. And so we've certainly been adding assets and growing the business, and despite that we were able to bring our costs in. We continue to find opportunities to reduce costs further and so we're really excited about the way the organization has responded and the great progress on this front.", "And more importantly for our investors, we're pleased to deliver the adjusted EBITDA at WPZ of $1.065 billion. And this was about a 6% increase over the second quarter of last year, and this is the now fifth quarter in a row delivering adjusted EBITDA of more than $1 billion. And so, certainly, despite the challenging market conditions, our business of moving natural gas continues to expand, and we continue to take advantage of that.", "We also had strong quarterly performance in our distributable cash flow at WPZ, which came in at $737 million, which was up 5% from the same quarter last year. And very importantly, our cash distribution coverage was 1.02 here in the second quarter, which is exactly what it was in the first quarter of 2016 as well.", "So I mentioned back in May that Williams has delivered a strong \u2013 a long string of quarters with year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA. We used to call it segment profit plus DD&A. But if you look to that and compare it into the prior year's quarter, we now have 11 consecutive quarters where we've shown improvement in that. And that, of course, is despite a pretty significant decline in unit commodity margins over this period. Of course, that's been driven by our fee-based revenue growth and our ability to continue to control cost in this environment.", "So with that, let me highlight some of the strong performance delivered from the operating areas this quarter. I'd note that all five of our areas are showing year-to-date improvement and, however, here just starting with the quarter, you can see Atlantic Gulf actually came in a little bit lower than the second quarter of last year. But I would tell you this is really for good reason and according to plans as we had a month-long shutdown of the Gulfstar tie facility, which allowed us to get the Gunflint tieback made.", "That tieback was made \u2013 done very safely. We had over 1 million hour, man-hours of work, making that tie-in, and we had zero reportable incidents on that effort. So great job by the team getting that work done safely. And here, as we look into the third quarter, we're going to enjoy both the Tubular Bells facility coming back or Tubular Bells Field coming back on Gulfstar as well as Gunflint, and we also enjoyed Kodiak a bit for the quarter, but we'll see that come back here as well.", "Moving onto the Central and Northeast and West, really going to combine all three of these because it's really kind of the same story. Steady as she goes business and the improvements were primarily driven by the team's ability to go after costs during the period. So continued very, very well positioned as the natural gas market start to pull on these areas, but nice to see the growth at 5%, 8%, and 2% better in the Central, Northeast, and West, again, driven mostly by lower cost and volumes holding up very well despite the pressures on gas prices. So a great job of the teams continuing to operate low cost and in a safe manner.", "In the NGL & Petchem area, our second quarter GAAP results were affected by a held-for-sale non-cash impairment related to our Canadian assets, and we reported $419 million decrease in segment performance as measured by modified EBITDA.", "But as we look at the adjusted EBITDA, that actually increased by $47 million or a 142%, which reflected the higher fee-based revenues. That was a lot driven by the Horizon project coming on up in Canada, olefins margins and lower operating costs in this segment as well. Geismar actually saw a very strong operational production levels and we did have a little bit of lower ethylene prices during the quarter, but our sales volumes, you'll know, were quite a bit lower or lower than our production volumes if you get into the details there.", "And so we did hold back some inventory during the quarter as we expected the ethylene prices to improve in the third quarter due to a number of extended outages on turnarounds from a lot of the competing plants in the Gulf Coast. And we're fortunate enough to have called that right and we have seen a price improvement here in the third quarter. And of course, that benefit will show up here as we sell off some of that inventory from 2Q in 3Q.", "Moving on to slide four, every quarter we review a list of our key milestones and, for me and the leadership team as well, it's an opportunity to highlight how the teams across Williams are executing. And if you're a regular participant on these calls, you know we just keep adding milestones quarter-after-quarter. So let's take a quick look at the 2Q list. And I would tell you this list, as I said, just keeps expanding in terms of the number of opportunities off Transco.", "We did receive FERC approval for the Garden State Project and so this is to increase some new demand in New Jersey, the New York Bay Expansion, and that's an expansion right on top of our Rockaway Lateral last year, another expansion on that for $115 million a day, and we did receive FERC approval for that as well. Virginia Southside II which is serving a major new gas-fired power generation complex there in Virginia, and Virginia Southside I is in service. This is another expansion on that project as well already and we received FERC approval for that during the quarter.", "The Northeast Supply Enhancement, really exciting project, really big investment for us, and that's $400 million a day expansion that's going to continue to take on new gas demands up in the very far northern reaches of our system. And so, we did close a binding open season on that. That project's moving ahead, again a very large investment for us.", "And then in addition to that, we have a lot of projects that are ongoing. We have the Gulf Trace project that is under construction, and construction is going very well on that. That's mostly a Louisiana area project. We also expect here in the very near future FERC approval for the Dalton lateral. So that's a big lateral that goes from the southern part of Atlanta up to the very northern reaches of Georgia, and we expect to begin construction on that in the fourth quarter. So lots of new things going on here in terms of construction across all of these projects. And our cost reductions are ahead of plan as I mentioned earlier, and we're continuing to find even more ways to increase those cost savings.", "In terms of coming soon, things that will drive us here in the near term, happy to report that our Rock Springs facility, another expansion off of Transco to a power plant in Maryland. That was brought in service August 1. Most of that work was done, completed back in the second quarter, but per the contract, ready to go in service here now August 1 and is in service.", "On the Gunflint tieback as I mentioned, that's \u2013 really will drive our third quarter pretty substantially, and so we're excited about that. And so we also have, I would tell you, some other drivers here for the third quarter. We'll get a full quarter of Kodiak up and flowing. We also are enjoying the \u2013 some additional incremental volumes that came onto our system as a result of the Pascagoula plant outage, and so we'll see a nice improvement on influx of volumes into our Mobile Bay systems as well for that period. So a lot of great things that are coming together here for the third quarter.", "Moving on to slide five, this is just a look now at really the \u2013 some of the big investments that we've got going on and you can kind of see by year how those pile up. So a lot of what I just mentioned, but this kind of shows what it looks like in terms of cumulative capital that will be placed in service.", "And so, I think the really big takeaway that investors should have here is this is very clear and identifiable growth in our business that's coming from all these fully-contracted projects. So we've got a couple of billion dollars this year, a little over $3 billion next year, and about two-thirds, a little more than two-thirds of that is coming from these big regulated projects and they are going to really drive growth well beyond 2017.", "So, next I'm going to turn it over here to Don to talk about the new program, the new financing plans. But before I do, I just want to remind you, it really is important that our investors understand how critical the expansion of natural gas markets are to our strategy, and we are very confident that that's occurring, certainly all the projects that we've listed on Transco. But we think those are going to continue to come and are going to come on the backs of low-price natural gas and, ultimately, all of that demand pull is going to pull out of the great basins that we're exposed to on the supply side. So I would say for the next couple of years the growth is going to be coming largely from the demand side, but when that demand shows up the volumes have to flow behind that and we're extremely well positioned to capture that on the back end.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about our new financing plan.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Thanks, Alan, and good morning. I'll just run through the slide six fairly quickly. It hits a number of the points included in our press release. And again, these actions were designed to enhance value at both WPZ and WMB and strengthen the credit profile and maintain investment grade ratings at WPZ as well as fund the significant portfolio of fee-based growth projects at Williams Partners.", "It totals about $5 billion in the 2016-2017 timeframe with the vast majority of that being Transco related. So first, Williams announced that it planned to reinvest $1.7 billion in WPZ through 2017. That reinvestment is funded by retaining cash flow that was previously paid out in the form of a dividend.", "The dividend reduction totals $1.3 billion annually, a 69% reduction, and the new dividend level at $0.80 represents about a 3.5% yield in terms of where we've been trading here the last couple of days and we think that's a level we'll continue to attract investors that are interested in a meaningful dividend. WPZ will maintain its current $0.85 per quarter, or $3.40 annual, dividend through 2017 and then expect to resume some level of distribution growth in 2018.", "As I mentioned, we expect our actions to significantly improve the credit profile, again, with $1.3 billion of cash being retained by Williams and reinvested into WPZ. That is a very strong credit positive that we think the agencies and debt investors will take note of.", "The estimated growth capital \u2013 let me back up here a second, again, that will reduce the external funding needs for WPZ. It will enable deleveraging at both WMB and WPZ and really targeting having WPZ below 4.5 times by 2018 and, again, with a commitment to maintain those investment grade ratings at WPZ.", "And, again, I mentioned the $5 billion of growth capital, which is $1.9 billion in 2016 and about $3.1 billion in 2017, with 68% and 77% in 2016 and 2017 respectively, related to Transco. So we're delighted to have the ability to grow our Transco franchise anchored with demand payments with strong counterparties and we think that will add a lot of value over time.", "WPZ intends to fund the growth by a number of means here, as Alan mentioned. We plan to sell the Canadian assets during 2016, plan to sign and announce in the third quarter and close the transaction in the second half of this year with combined proceeds to PZ and MB totaling more than $1 billion and PZ share being more than $800 million. We're establishing a distribution reinvestment program, or DRIP program, that will be available for all common unitholders, and we're hopeful that we get some public participation in that. And Williams does plan to reinvest $1.7 billion into WPZ through 2017.", "The third quarter distribution that Williams receives will be reinvested in WPZ via a private placement transaction because the DRIP program is not going to be available quickly enough, and then the contributions or the reinvestment thereafter will be through the DRIP program.", "WPZ would also plan to access the public equity market to the extent it has a need through its ATM program or other means as well as access to public debt market, also as needed. And, again, to the extent that we get public participation in the DRIP program, that would reduce the need for ATM or other equity.", "I'll pause there and turn it back to Alan.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Great. Thank you, Don. And so just a few things to wrap up here real quick before we go to questions. Certainly, I don't think there's any argument around the industry that we hold the premier natural gas asset base in the nation and we see that continuing to deliver growing fee-based revenues. The fee-based revenues now is about 93% of WPZ's gross margin, and you're going to continue to see that grow. And so we're excited to see that, again, first on the demand side and then pulling the supply basins along with it.", "With the financial measures that we've announced, we'll be driving significant reinvestment at WPZ, and that's going to stabilize the investment grade ratings and improve the coverage at PZ as well. And so we certainly are on a path to continue delivering steady growing result for our investors. And I want to say once again before we close here just how pleased I am with our organization.", "I'd tell you the team really does understand our strategy, they understand what's critical to us, and really lots of energy around the organization right now excited about showing what we're made of and showing how we can deliver against this exciting strategy and plan and execute on this multi-billion-dollar project backlog that's going to continue to drive our growth, especially along our big interstate pipelines here for the next couple of years. And we believe that our natural gas focused strategy has positioned Williams as the company for long-term steady growth.", "And so with that, thank you again for joining us, and we'll move on to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll go first to Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the detail today. I wanted to start with the $250 million that MB will be buying. How should we think about the price at which WMB will be buying that and the private placement of the common unit? And is the parent primarily funding this with the $200 million, give or take, of proceeds, of its portion from the Canadian asset sale?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Christine, good morning. The discount is something we're not prepared to speak to today, but I would say it will be in the range of customary discounts. We think it will be attractive to WPZ. We're unable to talk about the DRIP program today because we would be getting ahead of our registration statement. So we'll have to be patient on that. And our intention would be to have a discount that is consistent with the discount that would be available to the public once the registration statement and the DRIP program are activated. As to the $250 million of cash, or the $200 million of cash in the current quarter, that would be funded from the WPZ distribution or the Canadian asset proceeds.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then the DRIP program, like you guys say, goes through 2017, how confident are you that this won't have to be extended, especially in the event Atlantic Sunrise is delayed from the late 2017 in-service date? Is this generally something you're comfortable with because the CapEx generally drops off in 2018? Just some thoughts there would be helpful.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Christine. First, I'll just say that, again, Atlantic Sunrise is currently moving along as planned, but if there were a delay, that would also significantly reduce the capital spend in those periods as well. So you'd see some reduction in DRIP program requirements or equity requirements just generally. As to 2018, we're not providing any kind of guidance on 2018 today, so again I'll ask that you be somewhat patient on that.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then, I guess if I was to go by what you said and continue to operate under the assumption that Atlantic Sunrise does come in on time, then it does look like you guys may have to rely on the ATM just given the big CapEx next year. And the WPZ cost of equity is still pretty high. A lot of your peers have gotten rid of the GP in some way, shape, or form, whether it's the parent buying in the LP or the LP buying in GP. Can we just get some updated thoughts from you guys on this trend and whether or not at some point you will have to evaluate the same in order to be competitive with these peers?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know what I would say today that I think we announced a series of actions today, but in terms of other potential actions, we always are looking at other possibilities, structure change or otherwise, and you've seen us take a number of actions in the past and we'll continue to evaluate the possibilities again as we continue to move forward. So I wouldn't rule anything out, but at the current time I'd focus on the actions we've taken and we really don't have any commentary really on anything else that we're looking at.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you for the color.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Thanks, Christine.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jean Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi, guys. Just a couple of quick ones. Can you provide an estimate of the EBITDA from the Canadian assets for sale? I know it's very sensitive to NGL prices, but a range would be helpful.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Jean, I don't think we have disclosed that. I can tell you that in the current environment that there's not a tremendous amount of cash flow there in the current environment with propane being so heavily depressed there in Canada. Of course, that was the purpose of the PDH project, was to take advantage of that, but it's not a meaningful amount of EBITDA here in 2016.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. And can you say how much CapEx you've put into the PDH plant so far?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "I don't think we've singled that out yet.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'm sorry, Jean, I don't think we've disclosed that, and we're right in the middle of that sales process or getting that finalized. So I'd prefer not to disclose that. Thank you.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. No, no problem. And then, as a follow-up, a number of news reports have come out that Chesapeake is close to selling their Barnett assets. Have you had any discussions with them about what it would mean for their midstream agreements there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would just say we're always working with Chesapeake on ways to improve our relationship with them, and certainly we're interested in trying to get the drill bit to work there in the Barnett, which would improve volume today we have those MVCs that protect our cash flows there, but certainly would like to see the drilling activity and development activity increase there. So we are working with Chesapeake, we always are working with Chesapeake on ways to improve that, but we're not in position to be able to disclose anything on that today.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. That's all for me. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.", "Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks and good morning. As you guys sort of think about the dividend in 2018, should we think about the potential rebasing as something that is gradual off of the $0.80 number or will you sort of have a hard rebasing at that point?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Danilo, I don't think we have much in the way of guidance there, but certainly several factors. WPZ expects to increase its distribution somewhat by 2018. Obviously, we're not quantifying that today. And then, secondly, over time we would expect the reinvestment to diminish or be eliminated and a combination of factors will be considered as Williams determines what its dividend will look like. So, again, really not in a position to provide any guidance on that today, but I think it'll be something that we look at all the factors and make a decision as we got closer to that time period.", "Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks. And just to clarify on your Canadian asset sales, are those proceeds after-tax?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Those are pre-tax proceeds. We do not expect a tax burden in light of the high tax basis on those assets.", "Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Last question for me. You guys realized a lot of cost savings during the quarter. Can you quantify how much you expect to realize here for the balance of the year and maybe also even through 2017?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, sure. Thank you for the question. We do think that the level that we have now is sustainable. These are not kind of one-time, these are more systemic kind of cost reductions. Our head count from the first of the year is down about 12% and our team has done a really great job on the supply chain side of things of lowering our costs there as well. So these are things we've worked hard to not just \u2013 not as simple as just head count reduction, but also process improvements across the organization. And we do think that we're reducing costs in a way that's sustainable. And we are looking for some things to simplify the organization looking forward as well. And so we're hopeful to continue to improve on the cost savings beyond what we have today as we get into 2017.", "Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "A couple of questions. I guess, the first one is kind of a multi-part question, but when you think about restarting the dividend in 2018, is there a net debt to EBITDA target on a consolidated basis that you have to achieve first, or do you just sort of think that the way you \u2013 if you're on the right glide path, that that would allow you to restart that?", "And then, secondly, is it only going to be dividend increase, or are you thinking about share buybacks? And then, finally, would you be interested in calling some of the WMB debt, or would there be premium issues and so forth? I was wondering if you can sort of talk about that in context together?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Yeah, a lot of questions there. I would say that we would like to, again, hold WPZ at investment grade stable levels. We would like Williams to be not more than two notches lower than that, and also have Williams credit profile strengthening as well such that Williams begins to come back to investment grade levels over a multi-year timeframe here as well.", "Having said that, I think we would certainly be looking at all of our options, but at this point, I would say that we would look at all the options, whether it's dividend, share buyback or debt reduction. But again, I think we'll have to see exactly what the facts and circumstances look like, what's the best use of capital as we approach 2018. I think right now we've got a pretty clear path and plan through 2017. But 2018, I think we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and really start to lay out too much until we get a little further down the road.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, and I realize you guys have been very busy and announced a lot today, but when you think about Geismar in terms of the options that you have for it right now, what is the appetite in the marketplace right now for a tolling arrangement? When I think about the amount of M&A that we've seen in the chemical sector, some of them seem to be short ethylene capacity. Do you see yourself signing a potentially longer term tolling arrangement with one of those guys or when you think about the M&A appetite that's out there for chem assets, do you think about possibly selling Geismar as well, too?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say that we certainly are exploring what the tolling market looks like out there. We've kind of done that almost piecemeal in the past, kind of one customer at a time and we are looking at doing more of a process. Really if you think about, there's really two groups that would be the counterparties of those tolling agreements. One would be the market. So the parties that are selling the ethylene and have that supply, and that's a fairly consolidated group on the river.", "And then on the other side of that you had a multitude of buyers that really are dependent on Williams as a merchant provider in that market. So that's the downstream derivative buyers. And so we really are trying to determine which party is the better counterparty for us on that between the supply side versus the market side of that. So I would say we've moved from doing that in a kind of \u2013 I wouldn't \u2013 in a piecemeal manner, one party at a time, to kind of looking at it in a more aggregated process, and so we will be pushing ahead on that for the balance of the year.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, finally, there was an earlier question about the Barnett and Chesapeake. It's my understanding that the recent activity in the Barnett is more about an oil target. Would that be a benefit to you longer term? I was wondering if you can sort of talk into context as to what the targets are there and why folks would be interested in potentially acquiring the asset?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I really couldn't help you too much. I think the window that's there is primarily a gas window that we're involved with, with Chesapeake and the acreage that we have. But there's just a lot of \u2013 if you think about how old a lot of those completions were versus modern technology today, there is a lot of improvements that don't require the kind of capital to drill, but just a lot of improvements that can be done with everything that the industry has learned about completions. And so we think there's some pretty low-cost incremental gas production to come out of the basin. And so we think putting ourselves in a position where we're helping encourage that is good for us long term. And so those are the kind of things that I think we would be looking for, for that basin.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you very much, guys.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Just on the CapEx guidance here, I just want to confirm, first of all, how much have you spent on Atlantic Sunrise, if anything? And then, do you have full completion of the project in your $3.1 billion through 2017?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, let's see, on the capital, I don't think we've disclosed that. So we have spent money, it always takes a lot of money upfront on a project like that, and we've been very successful on the right-of-way acquisition piece of that. And so that's where the permitting and right-of-way acquisitions where majority of those dollars will go, but team's done a terrific job on that front and so we're doing very well on that.", "In terms of the timing of the capital, certainly the $3 billion in 2017 includes Atlantic Sunrise. I will tell you that, as we've mentioned before, team is very focused on that 2017 in-service target. But I would tell from you a financial plan standpoint \u2013 I think this has perhaps brought some confusion, from a financial plan standpoint, we always give ourselves, on all of our projects, we give ourselves some room so that we're not expecting cash flows and we can absorb some delays if they do occur. So I would just say on the planning and the project management side, we are full bore into making that 17-date, and things are going well in that regard. But from a financial planning standpoint, we put a more conservative date in there for expected start-up.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. That makes sense. And then, I think, for Don, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks 4.5 times debt to EBITDA at WPZ in 2018. Can you just confirm does that have a full year of Atlantic Sunrise, is that sort of an exit rate type of metric, and do you think that's the number you need to get to, to stay IG with the agencies?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "I'd say \u2013 first, I'd say that I said less than 4.5 times. That would be an agency adjusted number, so it wouldn't be right off the books, but it'd be an agency adjusted number. It has a partial year of Atlantic Sunrise, I think as Alan mentioned. We build a contingency into our financial plan for potential delay in all of our projects. And we just wanted to be clear about that. So it's partial year that's included in our 2018 numbers.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. That makes sense. And then just in Northeast G&P, the volumes there, it looks like they're down sequentially. You've spoken, I think about price related shut-ins. I'm just wondering if you're still seeing that, and is it more a northeast Pennsylvania or it is now more widespread across the basin, what you're seeing there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'll ask Jim Scheel to chime in on that, please.", "James E. Scheel - Senior VP-Northeast Gathering & Processing", "Yeah. So right now we have about 700 million a day shut-in. And you're correct, the majority of that is in northeast PA, specifically in and around the Bradford area. As you can recall, our volumes are down somewhat, but you've got to remember this is a shoulder month where we really haven't had much cooling impact until the last month of the quarter.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Good morning, and congratulations.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Craig.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "So, Don or Alan, can you comment on the updated cash tax outlook at WMB over time with this updated plan? Also, any prospects that you envision as far as cash flows for the size of excess coverage at WPZ through 2017? And any thoughts about the combined range of potential public DRIP and ATM proceeds that you might look for through the end of 2017?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Craig, cash tax rate continues to be at or near zero for extended period of time in light of the heavy capital investment and significant NOL that we have. In terms of WPZ's cash flow and coverage, we've not put out a number on that. I think you can calculate that based off what we have put out. And, again, we've not defined the size of the public DRIP or ATM program. But again, I think given the data we have put out, I think you can probably come up with some pretty good estimates yourself.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Are we to anticipate some cash tax drag before the end of the decade?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "I think that's unlikely.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey. Good morning. It's Faisel from Citi. Just want to go back to some of the equity funding statements you made for WPZ. I understand that looks like it funds the equity portion of the capital program. I take it, Don, that the rest will be sort of funded with debt on the \u2013 incremental debt on the balance sheet?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Well, Faisel, I'd say, we have a pretty limited amount of debt in this plan. As you know, Transco issued $1 billion of debt back in January of 2016 when the market was not very attractive. But the amount of debt being issued in this plan is pretty modest. There are some debt retirements that are coming up. So we'll obviously be issuing debt to fund debt retirements. But beyond that, it's pretty limited given that we're in the process of delevering.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then, in terms of the distribution coverage, I know you're around one times. What do you think the right target for distribution coverage is? I mean, you still have some cyclical cash flows in the portfolio of assets and you've got some concentrated counterparty risk. I'm just wondering, what's the right coverage ratio at PZ and that is comfortable for you and the agencies?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "That's a great question. Again, I think it'll be a function of the amount of commodity price or other risk that we have in the portfolio. And I would say that it's somewhere going to be between 1 and 1.2 times. But these are general range of coverage that I would expect over time, again, depending on facts and circumstances, but obviously it could be a bit different from that.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And did the agencies get a chance to preview this plan, and does this take at least one or two of them off the negative watch do you think?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Well, we did preview it with three agencies and it will be up to them to determine their point of view.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then just on the \u2013 you guys used to publish your \u2013 sort of your sensitivity commodity prices. I just want to make sure that the historical sort of guidance you used to give us on the sensitivity is still sort of intact?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "I would say that \u2013 I don't know anything offhand that throws it off, but our volumes have changed somewhat since that date. So I wouldn't want to say that it's up-to-date, but I think directionally it's in the right direction. I think we'll look to provide some updates in the future date as to what those look like. But again, we've had some movement in volumes, so I wouldn't want to say that that's as precise as it used to be, but nonetheless I think it's still something that is useful.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think probably the main delta looking forward, of course, would be the Canadian asset sales because those are very commodity sensitive and so that would probably be the big change in your model looking forward.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Understood. Now, Alan, last question from me. On the corporate governance plans, as you go into sort of, I guess, a November proxy, what's the plan in terms of number of board seats and the sort of independent Chairman role? I mean, what's the plan from a corporate governance and sort of corporate structure perspective?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, sure. I would tell you we are out recruiting and going through the interview process. We've got Spencer Stuart helping us with that effort. And it's gone very well, very impressed with the kind of candidates that we've seen and that I'm very excited about, frankly.", "And so we are looking to add a few really great candidates in that regard, and I would say stay tuned on that. It's moving ahead pretty quickly. But we are anxious to hear if there's any other candidates that surface as part of the \u2013 from outside of the board, the Spencer Stuart effort. We're always anxious to hear that feedback as well. So again, things are going well. We're excited about adding the board today is very stable, very engaged, but as always we're looking to add to the quality of our board.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Any independent Chairman spot?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Today Kathleen Cooper is our Chairman, and would expect that to remain the case.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "A lot's been hit here, so apologize if these are sort of second-tier type questions, but just curious on a couple of things, Alan. First, I guess, the time profile of your appeal process on Energy Transfer, if there's anything you can tell us as a guidepost for that, when we might put it sort of formally behind us?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We're hoping to see that expedited, but would just say that it moves through the Delaware courts at a pace that \u2013 I would expect that it's going to drag out too terribly long, but I don't really have any specific dates for you on that. I would just remind people that the focus there is for the damages. And we certainly are \u2013 our outside counsel is certainly very focused on that. I would tell you the management team has got their head down to really execute on the plan before us, and so fully expect our outside legal team to be successful in going after those damages. But I would tell you the management team's focus is just head-on on the business before us.", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "Understood. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, just a final question for me. With regard to the MVC accruals that you make, are you asking the counterparties to post collateral for those? How does that process, I guess, work? And then, as it relates, how does \u2013 in your conversations, Don, I guess, previewing with the rating agencies, how did they think about those cash flows as it pertains to your leverage and the defense of IG down at WPZ? Thanks.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Chris, we do not get any credit support on those. They're contractually due, so the counterparties require to pay those. Obviously, in the event of a credit event, that's a different situation. But absent credit event, they're contractually due, and they have been paid timely every year. And we would expect those would continue to be paid to us in full and timely. So it's really not a worry, except in the event of a credit event. And in terms of the agencies, I think the agencies view it the same way so that they would view it as certain cash flows, except with an assumed credit event. So that would be some stress-testing around that.", "Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning. I'm just wondering if you could provide some more details on your underlying assumptions for 2017 in your financial planning, especially when you think, I guess, targeting that debt leverage of 4.5 times and below? Just wondering what are you expecting for 2017 commodity prices, as well as is there any anticipated deterioration in the Chesapeake cash flows?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Sharon, we're largely using strip prices, so I'd say something that's very much in line with where the current market is. And in terms of CHK cash flows, we're not expecting a significant amount of drilling activity from Chesapeake in light of the fact that they have a number of priorities for the use of their capital including some debt reduction. So again, I think we have what appears to be a fairly realistic plan at this point, and we'll see how things play out.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. But no change in terms of the gathering rate for the MVCs at this point?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "No.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then to achieve, I guess, the 4.5 times or below, are you assuming ATM equity or additional asset sales in 2017?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "We are assuming ATM equity, and the amount will be dependent upon the amount of public participation in the DRIP. But between public DRIP or public ATM equity, we are expecting to tap that. We are not planning any additional asset sales at this point, certainly to the extent that there were any, that certainly could reduce the needs in that area.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And just a question about 2017 growth CapEx, you provided guidance of $3.1 billion. The bulk of it is Transco spending, but just wondering if you can give some color on the other areas of investment for the remaining balance.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "I'd say it's Gathering & Processing assets throughout our system. I would say with the Northeast as a factor there just to meet growing production needs, particularly as this new pipeline capacity comes online, there's some gathering expansions that have to occur as well to fill those pipelines. So I think that's probably the biggest portion of that.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "And we also have in that \u2013 other than interstate, we also have some investments going on out in the Permian as well. So in the joint ventures out there as well as in some of our operated facilities in the Permian, there's quite a bit of committed expansion and capital going on in that area as well.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. And just I guess in terms of expected timing, when you would provide more details on 2017 guidance?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Well, we haven't determined that yet, Sharon, in terms of when we would provide more detail. Certainly, you can see on slide five of the package that we produced today, you can see the projects and the amount of capital we expect to be placed in service in 2017. So that can give you some idea of the amount of growth that we expect for 2017. But we haven't determined exactly when we would lay out guidance for the 2017 period.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Good morning. A couple of quick ones. The first, Don, what's the average return threshold across the projects in the backlog for next year? And I'm just curious, when you look at the current cost of equity, where you think the cost of equity is going to be as well as the current cost of debt, any opportunities to high grade or defer that capital commitment in order to alleviate some of the financing burden next year?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Darren, great question. Something we look at all the time. I'd say our pipes projects tend to be in the low-teens, un-levered returns. And we think the cost of capital for those is pretty low too from the standpoint if you were to really isolate that business and say what is the perfect cost of capital for that business. So I think you'd be looking at pretty low debt costs there and a pretty attractive equity cost as well I'd say. And I think that's exactly the kind of business that investors are pretty enthusiastic about and probably lowers our cost of capital overall.", "So we think all of those Transco projects are just really right down the sweet spot. So while we could lay off some capital there, it's not desirable, I think, from our perspective. The rest of the returns on some of those investments tend to be fairly high because they're incremental returns on existing asset bases. So, again, we'll continue to look at those and see if there's capital that is not earning a sufficient return or otherwise can be deferred or laid off. But at this point, this is the plan, but we'll continue to focus on that in an effort to maximize value creation opportunities for both PZ and Williams.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would just add to that. As you think about the returns on projects like Atlantic Sunrise, great project, great returns, but in addition to the returns we get on a particular project, something like Atlantic Sunrise pulls all the way through the system. So you heard Jim talk about the 700 million a day that we have shut-in up there as \u2013 and that capital is already there, the gathering system is already there. So to the degree we unlock those constraints and systems like that, we get a very high increment in cash flows because we would see the gathering volumes pick up there as well. So, really, those projects are really important to us in terms of incremental cash flow.", "Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "So, Alan, if you think about it in that context just meaning that those projects are sticky because they've got, if you will, more intrinsic returns, just based on how vertically integrated they are, if you balance that with your funding plan, how do you guys think about \u2013 and I know this is tough to answer, but how do you think about balancing the equity issuances that are needed through the ATM beyond WMB's investment in WPZ, and the headwind that leaning on that ATM could have on PZ's equity cost of capital, maybe challenging some of those returns?", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. No, we certainly look at it that way. And I think the way you are describing you should look at it, with just kind of on the incremental cost of capital is the right way to think about that, and that is the way we think about it. So I completely agree with that assessment. I would just tell you I think these projects are pretty powerful in terms of what they do for us going on the increment. And we have trimmed a lot of capital out of the plan. But I think as WPZ investors see the amount of coverage that we have and see the kind of growth that is out before WPZ with all those big capital investment, I think we'll see some very constructive positioning for the PZ units. And so I think that will be a positive. But, again, I think the kind of returns that we're talking about, are powerful and we'll overcome that over time.", "Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then last question for me. Don, Alan, in your eyes, what's more net present value accretive? Is it a meaningful leverage reduction in the near term where you can return to a larger dividend reset with a de-risked cash flow profile, or is it a more moderate dividend restatement and greater operational cash flow being reinvested in the business for theoretically greater returns like you just talked about over the long term?", "Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director", "Darren, I think we're comfortable with the plan that we laid out here today based on the facts and circumstances we have in front of us, and obviously we'll continue to look at the changing landscape, including how we're valued and the cost of capital and make decisions from that new baseline. But we're certainly very focused on the cost of capital, very interested in reducing spending where we don't see a good spread between the return on capital and cost of capital as well, but all consistent with supporting our franchises. So we'll continue to balance those points and try to find the path that we believe will create the greatest long-term value.", "Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Darren.", "Operator", "And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the Q&A portion of the call today. I'd like to return the program to Alan Armstrong for closing comments.", "Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well, great. Well, thank you all very much. Appreciate all the interest. We're really excited about the platform that we're sitting on here for growth and very excited about really moving this business to a much more predictable set of cash flows and continuing to execute on these projects that are just coming in one after another as we expand out the business, and then ultimately the pull-through that we'll get on our supply side. So we couldn't be more excited about strategy, very thankful for a very dedicated organization that's fired up about executing on the plan. And we appreciate your confidence and interest in Williams in the future. Thank you.", "Operator", "And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation.

(NYSE:WMB) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call May  4, 2017  9:30 AM ET", "Executives", "John Porter - Director of Investor Relations", "Alan Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Michael Dunn - Chief Operating Officer", "James Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P", "Rory Miller - Senior Vice President, Atlantic-Gulf", "Donald Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Walter Bennett - Senior Vice President, West", "Analysts", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors, LLC", "Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets", "Christopher Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC", "J.R. Weston - Raymond James Financial, Inc.", "Shneur Gershuni - UBS", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Operator", "Please standby, as we are about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams, Williams Partners First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Porter", "Thanks, Amy. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily.", "Joining us today is our CFO, Don Chappel; and our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn. We also have the leaders of our operating areas on as well.", "In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation material.", "So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Glad you could join us today. And I plan to keep my remarks pretty brief today to allow as much time as possible for your individual questions and also recognizing we have our Analyst Day coming up next week on May 11 in New York City.", "The first quarter of 2017 demonstrated the resilience of our business as we continued to show meaningful growth and stayed on track for our 2017 guidance, despite the impact of some significant third-party outages and production freeze-offs in the Rockies.", "Our natural gas focused strategy continues to be on the mark as we differentiate ourselves by delivering consistent and sustainable growth on the back of low-cost natural gas demand. Overall, I'm pleased with this quarter's progress. So let's get started on Slide 2 and take a look here at the first quarter.", "Starting with WPZ's GAAP results, we saw a sharp increase in net income due to higher investing income on the Permian for Marcellus transaction that we completed in the first quarter. Apart from the increase due to this transaction, our ongoing business performed very well, generating an increase in operating income of $141 million compared to the first quarter of 2016.", "Moving now to adjusted EBITDA and DCF, WPZ's adjusted EBITDA grew over 5% compared to the first quarter of 2016. This marks 14 consecutive quarters that we generated year-over-year growth in this measure.", "We delivered $752 million in DCF for the quarter, which also was up over the first quarter of 2016 and provided a strong coverage ratio at Williams Partners of 1.33. And now let's take a look at how each of the segments did versus last year.", "First of all, the Atlantic-Gulf delivered another solid quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $48 million or almost 12% over the first quarter of 2016, now reaching up to $453 million for the quarter. There were a couple of third-party incidents on adjacent pipelines near Paradis, Louisiana, and Corpus Christi, Texas, that did impact our results, although there was no direct damage to our facilities from these incidents. Both events affected volumes on our Discovery and Markham systems, respectively.", "Atlantic-Gulf, despite this, Atlantic-Gulf increased fee-based revenues by about $43 million for the quarter, and this increase was primarily driven by new projects that we brought online in 2016. And our Gulf Trace project was put in service during the first quarter of 2017, so again, really another great quarter here for Atlantic-Gulf.", "Let's move on to the West, which now includes the predictable Northwest Pipeline system and existing Rockies G&P assets to which we've now added the Conway and Overland Pass Pipeline, as well as large-scale gathering systems previously located within our Central Operating Area.", "The broad-based portfolio underpinning the West, along with a sharp focus on cost control, delivered stable first quarter adjusted EBITDA versus 2016. Overall, the West adjusted EBITDA came in within 3% of the first quarter 2016.", "We did see lower fee-based revenues, mainly as a result of contract changes and 21% lower volumes in the Barnett area. The Barnett field was impacted by really little to no spending on the production over the last year by our previous customers there. So we're excited to see the impact that the new operator in the area, Total, $40-million-plus annual investment will have in the restoration of this production.", "And they really are just now getting started on figuring out exactly the best places where to place those dollars. And so, we're really excited to work with them and increasing production there.", "Despite a mild winter throughout most of the U.S., though, the West experienced some extreme weather in January that caused widespread production freeze-offs in the Rockies. We have seen a pretty good rebound in volumes as things have thawed and several rigs have returned to the area. In fact, already our overall volumes in the West are tracking 2.4% higher than the average during the first quarter of 2017.", "On the other side of the coin, we experienced record throughput volumes on Northwest Pipeline, as a result of the cold weather in the West.", "To summarize, stable performance continues in the West with Barnett stabilization, recovery in the Rockies and some growth in areas like the Haynesville, Eagle Ford, Niobrara, and potentially, even the Wamsutter field. we look forward to as we get into 2017 and 2018.", "Now let's move on to the Northeast G&P, where year-over-year operated gathering volumes were up nearly 5%. And if you adjust for the sale of a couple of isolated gathering systems last year, they gathered about 90 million a day. Volume growth would have been closer to 6.5% on that same comparison.", "So overall, Northeast G&P adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared to the same period last year of - and so $227 million as increases in the Bradford, Susquehanna, Ohio River systems were largely offset by decreases in the Utica. And so overall, our mix of revenue shifted a bit where - to dry gas, where our total revenue per Mcf is a little bit lower than it is in those rich gas areas.", "We think our Utica production is currently at an inflection point to where we'll see growth in the volumes going forward. We're also seeing a pickup on well-connect request across most of the Northeast, as producers prepare for takeaway capacity coming online.", "And now, I'd like to make a few comments about our NGL & Petchem business. As you know, the streamlining of our operating areas, we've shifted certain assets from NGL Petchem to other segments. So the first quarter of 2017 results now just include the Geismar olefins plant and our propylene splitter near that same facility.", "The first quarter saw overall improvement in prices and margins for propylene and ethylene. These results were offset by lower production volumes, primarily due to an unexpected failure on the local utility provider system on March 12. This power failure caused a shutdown of our Geismar plant.", "Once the repairs were made, the plant was restarted here on April 18. So as a result, Geismar only contributed about $37 million of adjusted EBITDA for this first quarter of 2017. Overall, our NGL & Petchem Services segment reported adjusted EBITDA of about $49 million for the quarter.", "And now, let's move on and discuss some of the projects and operational developments for the first quarter. First of all, we brought Gulf Trace into service on time and under budget. It's one of the five key Transco pipeline system expansions that we expect to place in service during 2017. It even contributed fee-based revenues here in the first quarter of nearly $9 million.", "So as you know, the Gulf Trace serves the Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG export facility in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. A picture of that facility, in fact, is on the title slide of today's presentation. And in addition to Gulf Trace, we made significant progress on other projects as well.", "Construction on the Garden State project is now underway, and we started construction on the mainline facilities of the Atlantic Sunrise project. We're continuing to work on the remaining regulatory approvals for this critical piece of natural gas infrastructure. And just this week, we updated the final permitting data required for the PA DEP 102 state permit and the PA DEP 105 permit. And that update is actually in the process of being delivered as we speak.", "So great work on the team's part of getting all that new data pulled together and getting those permit applications updated.", "We submitted an application for a permit certification - sorry, or an application for a FERC certificate for our Northeast Supply Enhancement project, which is a nearly $1 billion fully contracted project that will increase the supply of natural gas to the New York City area by about 400 million a day.", "Natural gas demand on our systems continues to build. As evidence of this fact, we saw records on two of our major interstate pipeline systems, Transco and Northwest Pipeline during the quarter.", "We also experienced record gathering volumes in the Northeast G&P, where we achieved a quarterly gathering record of about 6.9 Bcf a day. This represented a 7.5% volume increase for our operated gathering volumes comparing the first quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2016, so really nice jump from the fourth quarter here on - in the Northeast volume.", "And we hit record natural gas liquid transportation volumes on our Overland Pass Pipeline system serving the Rockies. All of this occurred despite a relatively warm winter in many areas of the country and particularly in the Northeast.", "We also closed on the Permian for Marcellus transaction, bringing our Bradford Supply Hub average ownership to about 66% as we continue to increase our presence in this prolific supply area.", "In terms of increasing our focus on predictable fee-based revenues, we announced on April 17 the agreement to sell the Geismar olefin facility for $2.1 billion to NOVA Chemicals. This sale is expected to close this summer.", "I want to thank the team that's been working on the Geismar transaction and also the team that operates the plant for their persistence, diligence and their continued focus on safe operations. This transaction is one of the last remaining components of de-risking Williams' revenues from direct commodity exposure. After Geismar closes, around 97% of our gross margins will come from predictable fee-based sources.", "Among those predictable sources will be the new long-term supply and transportation agreement with NOVA that was highlighted in our April announcement of the Geismar sale.", "Williams Partners' subsidiaries will provide feedstock to the Geismar plant via our Bayou Ethane pipeline system in the Gulf Coast. And looking to the balance of the year, we expect to bring the Hillabee Phase 1 project and the Dalton system into service as planned in mid 2017.", "We anticipate that the New York Bay and Virginia Southside 2 projects will come online in the fourth quarter also as planned. It's certainly been a successful quarter on the execution front and we're really optimistic about what's coming in terms of growth projects.", "So before I wrap up, I want to remind everybody about our Analyst Day next Thursday, May 11, where you'll see that we're on a clear and predictable path to continue delivering leading EBITDA growth in our sector.", "We'll discuss in more detail the drivers that will allow us to continue delivering DCF growth while sustaining strong cash coverage and credit metrics. We'll also discuss how the financial repositioning we've executed will enable us to capture high quality fee-based growth opportunities that are going to be funded through a mix of low-cost debt and retained cash flow.", "And our operational leaders will be highlighting the significant opportunities ahead for Williams, and especially how our competitively advantaged asset-base is so well positioned to deliver sustained growth through high return organic investment opportunities that are now before us. I'm also looking forward to introducing our new Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn. He's already hit the ground and running, and he'll be presenting next week.", "So that concludes my prepared remarks. Now, I'd like to pass it over to the operator, so we can address your questions. Operator, let's take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operating Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. This is Charlie [ph] in for Jeremy. Just wanted to follow up on the Atlantic Sunrise, I know you said you're in the midst of getting the second permit - state-level permit. Were there any other requirements there? I thought I remember there being one from the Corps of Engineers.", "And then just a second separate question, just on the growth CapEx guidance, $2.1 billion to $2.8 billion. Can you just remind us, kind of what may cause us to hit the upper-end or lower-end of that guidance range?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, sure. I'm going to have Mike Dunn take that permitting question here in just a minute. On the capital piece, the primary variances there is the timing of the Atlantic Sunrise and how soon we're able to get started on that project. But as well some of the Northeast construction that - and the gathering system that feeds into that is a bit variable as to timing as well. So it's not really a question of how much in terms of projects really, it's just the matter of the timing of those projects. And, Mike, hope you'll take the question on Atlantic?", "Michael Dunn", "Sure. Thanks, Alan. Good morning. The Corps of Engineers, we do have a 404 permit update to provide to them and that will occur later this month. That's very similar to the PA DEP updates that we're providing to Pennsylvania. In that, we're just following up with additional information. And that should be a permit received from the Corps of Engineers shortly after that.", "We do expect permit receipts from both PA DEP and the Corps of Engineers in July, assuming everything goes well. But that's been a pretty large undertaking for our teams to make these updates, but very proud of their effort in getting those submitted this week as we anticipated.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thanks. And just one more real quick, shifting over to G&P volumes in the Northeast, just can you give a little more color on the Utica volumes that kind of caused that shift to more dry gas exposure?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, I'll may be have Jim Scheel hit that portion.", "James Scheel", "I think we've been pretty consistently talking about - Chesapeake has moved rigs out of the Utica, specifically the Cardinal wet gas area, over the course of the last couple of years. Alan referenced that we've kind of hit an inflection point with no drilling. We've seen natural declines that have caused us to drop from our high of about 1 Bcf a day to just under 700 Mcf as we go into the first quarter.", "We anticipate volumes ramping up. Chesapeake is moving in additional rigs. Some of that reduction, though on the wet-side has been offset by new drilling in the dry Utica. And we see that volume increasing.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Christine Cho from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Christine Cho", "Good morning, everyone.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Christine Cho", "I wanted to start in Marcellus. We've seen a competitor JV with a producer for some processing plants. And on your acreage, we've seen one producer acquire three or four of your customers, and can probably become somewhat sizable with respect to production. And they've also talked about wanting to be a partner in processing.", "Is this something that you'd be interested in? Some color on how you think about the strategy in the Northeast going forward. Like, how you evaluate whether or not to get an upfront volume commitment on your processing plants in exchange for acreage lease like we saw with the prior deal, that may cap your upside versus taking on maybe a little more risk in having more upside, especially given the deleveraging you've done to date?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, thank you, Christine. We're always happy to work with customers that have things to bring to the table. And we certainly have continued that effort in the OVM area, and really excited to see the kind of development that is going on. We're getting a tremendous amount of well-connect requests that are probably coming in a little faster than we thought. And so, we do think that processing capacity we have available in the OVM is very valuable. And so we want to make sure that we maximize the value of that in whatever transaction that we do.", "But, really excited to see all the activity, excited to see EQT out there, really getting active on some of that acreage that was somewhat fallow or especially underfunded, and so I think there's some real big promise coming into the Ohio River area, as a lot of new activity is occurring in that area.", "Christine Cho", "Okay. And then moving over to Barnett, there's been some talk about directing stack gas volumes to excess capacity that sits on Barnett plants. Could this be an opportunity for you or are there contractual or logistical impediments that would prevent you from doing this? Then, if you could actually remind us what the residue gas and NGL pipes are out at the back end of those plants, that would be great too.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, Christine, we don't have any processing capacity in the Barnett. All we have there is gathering, compression and a dehy. So, we don't have any processing facilities there in Barnett, so really not in a position to take advantage of any of that in the Barnett, if I understood your question correctly.", "Christine Cho", "Okay. And then last one for me. Have you disclosed how much capacity and how long the long-term contract is going to be with NOVA?", "Alan Armstrong", "No, we haven't. We haven't disclosed that as yet. We'll be providing some more detail around that at our Analyst Day coming up.", "Christine Cho", "Okay, what's the...", "Alan Armstrong", "I do think we've said - Christine, I do think we've said that it's for the full requirements of the plant.", "Christine Cho", "Okay.", "Alan Armstrong", "And that historically has been 50,000 to 55,000 barrels a day, depending on whether we're in ethane or propane or depending on if we're cracking all ethane or not.", "Christine Cho", "Okay. And what's the capacity of the line? It looks like you are doing an expansion that was supposed to take effect second half of this year.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, that's very dependent on where the - where the ethane is coming in. And remember, we also have ethane supply points coming in from our Baton Rouge frac, as well as - at Port Allen as well from our parity system as well. So we can actually pick up ethane from three different points to supply under that contract. And so - but the capacity is very dependent on where that production is coming in. But we did complete a pretty significant expansion earlier this year. And so, we're well positioned to supply the Mississippi River with ethane.", "Christine Cho", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next from Goldman Sachs, we have Ted Durbin. Please go ahead.", "Theodore Durbin", "Thanks. Maybe we can start with Northeast Supply Enhancement, that project; so $1 billion of CapEx. Are the returns sort of similar to what you guided to on some of your other projects? And then, just remind us of the in-service date there. I think it's 2020, but what - thinking about timing there.", "Alan Armstrong", "Rory, you want to take that?", "Rory Miller", "Yes, I would say the multiples - we are going to do a little bit - I think updating you in Analyst Day on the multiples of some of these historical projects that we've been doing. But I would say, this is kind of in that same sweet spot. It's been a good position for us to be in. We've been able to leverage our existing system. And so the returns have kind of stayed in that range for projects where we've had some brownfield scope to them.", "That - I think in terms of in-service, I thought that one was in 2020. I don't have it right in front of me. But that like we've been doing on all of our projects, the stated in-service dates are going to be more of a P90 [ph]. And, of course, our target in-service date we're going to be trying to beat that if we can.", "Theodore Durbin", "Great. And then on your other - your Southeastern Trail open season, maybe just - can you talk about what exactly you are doing there? It looks like the backhaul - how much capital associated there? And then how do we think about that relative to this sort of displacing existing contracts or are there actually a meaningful revenue uplift on Southeastern Trail?", "Rory Miller", "Yes, on Southeastern Trail, this would be a capacity that we're selling that would either be latent in the system itself, because it is flowing north to south, or we'll be adding new facilities to provide that capacity. We are right in the middle of the sausage-making [ph] right now on Southeastern Trail. We did have an open season. And although I'm not going to get into the details of that, I would tell you that the requests far exceeded what we have capability to offer.", "So we're going through the process doing all the technical work, trying to understand what's the most efficient way to expand the system and take advantage of some of that latent capacity. And then, we'll be generating rates, going back to the customers. Having iterative process to settle in on an actual capital size, capacity, and then get the deals closed. So we're probably right in the middle of that process. I don't think it's a week or two. It's, say, we're more at the midpoint in getting that sorted and settled.", "Theodore Durbin", "Got it, that's great. And then, if I could just ask one more. I think, Alan, you sort of alluded to this notion that you do have strong growth over a multi-year period. I guess, I'm wondering where your head is on providing multi-year guidance. I know you used to do that. You've kind of backed away from that. But kind of maybe even just a little bit of a preview of what we should look for at the Analyst Day next week?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, I think what you're going to see is particularly in - from each of the OA leads, you're going to see the drivers of growth and the leverage. For instance, the operating leverage we have in the Northeast and what volumes mean to us in terms of EBITDA there. You'll also see a little more portfolio of the kind of opportunities we're pursuing in - along Transco system.", "And then finally, you'll see some - in Don's presentation, you'll see some of the drivers of growth into 2018 as well. So we're not going to be providing guidance like we used to, but we are going to be putting some pretty specific terms out there on what those drivers are and give you a lot better opportunity to make your own assessment.", "Theodore Durbin", "Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll leave it at that.", "Alan Armstrong", "Okay. Thank you. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll hear next from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Faisel Khan", "Hi. Good morning. It's Faisel from Citi. Just a little more clarity on - hi, the Geismar feedstock agreement, are you doing anything different in that agreement than what you were doing before for Geismar? I'm trying to figure out if there is a net uplift to your cash flows from your logistics - provide a logistic contract versus what you were doing before?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, that's a really complicated answer to that, Faisel. But, let me just say that we did have - and before, we did have both the cost of operating the pipeline and we had revenues. A lot of that just showed up, if you will, and coming out of the margin of Geismar. So it's a little bit complicated when you think about trying to pull out the Geismar revenue.", "I will say, though, that we do expect a pretty modest uplift in revenues from that transaction as a result of it. So we'll provide a little more detail and color on that at Analyst Day, but it is a positive for us. And it will be showing up now as third-party fee-based revenue and dropping all the way to the bottom line, where previously it kind of would have been buried in that Geismar margin.", "Faisel Khan", "Okay, got it. And then on the balance sheet now with the sale sort of under way, what's your expectation for consolidated debt-to-EBITDA by the end of the year for the entire company?", "Alan Armstrong", "Don?", "Donald Chappel", "Faisel, we don't have an update for you today, but obviously, it's coming down. I think, we indicated that we would use the proceeds from the Geismar sale to pay off the $850 million term loan and prefund the CapEx that's still the plan. You can run the numbers. We'll provide some additional commentary next week, but we don't have any guidance update per se.", "Faisel Khan", "Okay. And then last question from me. Can you give us an update on all of the legal battles that are taking place, one with - [your first one] [ph] with Energy Transfer, how that - when do you expect sort of a decision or how's that going. And then also on Constitution, how is that appeal process sort of trending?", "Alan Armstrong", "Sure. First of all, on the ETE piece, there was a hearing around the process and discovery process on that a couple of weeks ago, I guess. And so that - in that, the judge came back and said he wanted to consider that a little further in terms of, what that discovery process, and so there's motions coming forward on that. So that wages on, if you will.", "On the Constitution piece, we continue to work with the administration on that, continue to feel good about that. And as well, the court process continues on Constitution as well. And so Constitution, we feel like is an upside to us, but we're optimistic that there's a lot of people, including the unions have been a big support for us on that, labor unions, who really want to see projects like that go forward.", "And of course, the state of New York's denial on the 401 certificate for Northern Access for National Fuel also turned the heat up a little bit on this issue as well, and so - which appears to be a pretty similar situation. And so I would say that the pressure is mounting on the issue, and you've got projects there that are both important to New England and to New York as well as important to jobs and getting some of the regulatory morass out of the way of getting the infrastructure built, all of which is a top priority for the administration.", "So, feel like we've got a lot of people on our side on that, and we're going to continue to push forward on it.", "Faisel Khan", "Okay. But there's no date on the appeal process, when that will conclude that for Constitution?", "Alan Armstrong", "No, there's not.", "Faisel Khan", "Okay, understood. Thank you.", "Alan Armstrong", "We are thinking it's in the not-too-distant future, though, so but if things go like we would expect them to.", "Faisel Khan", "Okay, understood. Thank you.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere", "Good morning.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Craig Shere", "Picking up on Faisel's questions around the long-term feedstock agreement using the pipeline heading into Geismar. If I understood, there was a possibility that pipeline might be sold as a part of the Geismar asset divestiture, could you talk through the thinking behind retaining the asset and signing a long-term agreement, and maybe its impacts from a tax standpoint and long-term accretion benefit towards Williams?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, it's certainly very positive for us. We're really excited about the transaction because it did allow us to obtain very reliable, long-term fee-based revenues out of the transaction. And so we're really excited about what that looks like and the terms of that contract. So we think that was a very smart transaction in that regard. There's really nothing much more complicated than that, frankly, about the transaction other than the fact that it allowed us to retain some fee-based revenue.", "We do have other customers on the system, and we think that system is extremely well positioned to continue to expand as our customers expand. And so we're really excited to be able to serve NOVA. And of course, they've got big plans for expansions in the Gulf Coast. And we want to be there and be a good reliable provider to them and grow with them.", "So I would say, it's really nothing more than continuing to have stable fee-based revenues, and taking and retaining a bit of that, if you will, out of the Geismar EBITDA.", "Craig Shere", "Do you see expansion upside on the pipeline system there within - announced maybe within the next couple of years? Or is that very hazy longer term?", "Alan Armstrong", "There are some opportunities as some of the projects expand there in Beaumont-Port Arthur area, but we don't have anything that we're planning to announce here in the near future.", "Craig Shere", "Okay. And one question on the quarterly impact from those third-party outages affecting discovery in Markham, what would you estimate the proportional EBITDA effect of that was?", "Alan Armstrong", "I don't know that we've disclosed that. I'll tell you more specifically what it amounted to, is it took quite a bit of volume out of Markham that gets fed up from some of the Eagle Ford volumes that gets fed by a competitor's pipeline into Markham. So it took some of the volumes out of Markham, some of the rich gas volumes coming into Markham.", "And on the Discovery system, even though it didn't impact our volumes, it actually shutdown the whole system for, I think, four, five days, six days. So we lost six days to discover in the quarter, which is pretty significant. And so - because it wasn't just the processing and fractionation facility, it took the whole facility - the whole system out for a bit.", "So anyway, great job by our team of helping the third-party there safely recover and getting our Discovery system. We were able to move some volumes around and keep some of our customer volumes flowing, but it certainly impact our revenues pretty significantly on Discovery in the quarter.", "Craig Shere", "Understood, looking forward to next week's Analyst Day.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great. Thank you. Good to see you, Craig. Thanks.", "Operator", "And from U.S. Capital Advisors, we have Becca Followill. Please go ahead.", "Becca Followill", "Good morning, guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Morning, Becca.", "Becca Followill", "On the Northeast Gathering, the unconsolidated volumes were up about 11% yet equity earnings were flat. Was that due to what you talked about, Alan, with the shift to dry gas versus wet gas and the lower margins? Or why don't we see a pickup in the equity earnings there?", "Alan Armstrong", "I'll ask Jim Schell maybe to take that. Do you follow that question?", "James Scheel", "Yes. I guess, just going in. We didn't really have a decline of 11%. We had some systems that were off. But overall, on our consolidated volume, from a - let me\u2026", "Becca Followill", "Well, actually, Jim, I said that its unconsolidated volumes were up 11% yet...", "James Scheel", "Oh, upward, eh?", "Becca Followill", "...yet equity earnings were flat. So why the disconnect?", "James Scheel", "Yes, again, that really goes back to the base story that we just talked about, which is the Utica volumes were down primarily, and those were offset by higher volumes in the dry gas areas, primarily around Susquehanna Supply Hub and Bradford. And so, those balanced out effectively from an EBITDA perspective, and we were able to overcome those volume declined on an EBITDA basis.", "Becca Followill", "Okay, thank you.", "Alan Armstrong", "Remember, Becca, the Barnett system shows up in that unconsolidated numbers, and so growth on Bradford.", "James Scheel", "The Bradford area.", "Michael Dunn", "Yes. And then, UEOM is the big Utica system that's in the unconsolidated that would be part of that lower Utica volume story.", "Becca Followill", "Okay. So it's the wet versus the dry gas margins then?", "James Scheel", "Yes, that's exactly right.", "Becca Followill", "And then on the West, you talked about a couple of things impacting you, one being weather in the West, talking about volumes being down 8% year-over-year, one was the West and the other was Barnett. Can you quantify how much of that was Barnett?", "Alan Armstrong", "I don't think, we're showing that level of detail what we did report, and I think, we'll follow that through, but we did show a 21% decline, as I mentioned in my comments, in the Barnett.", "Becca Followill", "Okay.", "Alan Armstrong", "So it's a pretty significant decline in the Barnett.", "Becca Followill", "Got you. Okay. That's all I needed. Thank you, guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thank you, Becca.", "Operator", "And from BMO Capital Markets, we do have Danilo Juvane. Please go ahead.", "Danilo Juvane", "Thank you, and good morning. Most of my questions have been hit, but I did have a couple of follow-ups. So on the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline, the second half starts on the mainland, have you quantified or will you quantify at the Analyst Day what that EBITDA impact will be?", "Alan Armstrong", "We have not given detail on that. I would say stay tuned for our Analyst Day, and we'll give you a little better idea there at the Analyst Day, kind of the full package on that.", "Danilo Juvane", "Thanks. I appreciate that. And secondly, on the West segment, there was, I think, a G&P contract restructure with a producer. Did that have anything to do with the shortfall relative to last year?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, again, the Barnett, it certainly did, because we were fixed on our MVC, based on what the cash we got paid last year. So that restructure in Barnett was the most significant. There was - so - of the restructure, that was the biggest [ph].", "Danilo Juvane", "Okay.", "Alan Armstrong", "And sorry, on - maybe I didn't understand your question. On land energy, we did have them reject a processing contract that we had in Opal as well, so it's a fairly low margin contract, but they [saw our planned input volumes of correctly] [ph] in the West.", "Danilo Juvane", "Okay. But to your point, the biggest driver was the Barnett restructuring?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, right.", "Danilo Juvane", "Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll now hear from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Christopher Sighinolfi", "Hey, Alan, good morning.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Christopher Sighinolfi", "Just had a couple of follow-ups. I appreciate all the color on the supply agreement to NOVA. It's helpful. I was just curious, given you cited that the 37-day outage in the quarter was attributable to a local utility provider issue, just curious, and maybe it's a moot point with the sale pending, but is there any recovery on that, if you believe the third party responsible for it?", "Alan Armstrong", "We wish, but no, there is not any avenue for recovery on that.", "Christopher Sighinolfi", "Okay. And then, second, just sort of more thematic, but I'm assuming this will be addressed at the Analyst Day. I know, we discussed it in the past, but just we appreciate any updated thought on, we hear a lot this earnings season and over the last several weeks and months about producer activities in sort of prolific shale plays that may have high associated gas cuts coming with them.", "And just what that might mean for domestic natural gas supply demand and in turn, what that might mean for Transco expansion opportunities into the Southeast Gulf Coast markets.", "I'm just curious if that is a legitimate concern for sort of your legacy avenue of growth? Or I guess, if you could speak at all about sort of the appetite for the next tranche of expansions beyond those that we know. Is there any change in counterparties view on what they've been asking you guys to construct for them given that change in producer activity? Or is it consistent with what you've been experiencing to date?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. No, I think people - if you're thinking about - if you're a buyer of natural gas, if you're a big LDC, you're converting over to gas off of coal or if you're building an industrial facility, likely, if you're in that pathway, you really want to connect to something that's a long-term low cost supply.", "And so, we continue to see that dependence and people really looking at those low cost supplies as something that they would much prefer to connect with, either through long-term gas purchase contracts that we've seen quite a bit of where a producer knows what they can produce and the cost they can produce at.", "I think if that's the business you're in, you really want to be focused on something that's not at the whims of oil prices in terms of development. And so, I think that what we're seeing is a very consistent theme, which is people continuing to focus on the very low cost resources and being able to contract through for those for their long-term dependence on that fuel.", "So I'd say things remain very healthy there, and we continue to see a lot of demand. As Rory pointed out on our Southeastern Trails, we're kind of sometimes shocked by the degree of demand that we're seeing in trying to get gas out of these very low cost resources into these growing markets.", "Christopher Sighinolfi", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the color this morning, and look forward to next week.", "Alan Armstrong", "Excellent. Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "From Raymond James, we have J.R. Weston.", "J.R. Weston", "Hi, good morning. You mentioned during the prepared commentary that positive weather impact on the Northwest Pipeline's throughput for the quarter. Just wondering how to think about the progression there for the rest of the year?", "And then, I think in the 4Q materials, there's kind of some mention of some longer-dated projects up in that region. Just wondering, if there is any type of update there.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, sure. I'll take that first, and then, I'm going to turn that second part of that to Walt. But on the first, the good news, the bad news on these fully contracted pipelines, there is just not that much variability, did see a little bit of uplift in IT revenues on Northwest Pipeline, but when you have these fully contracted pipelines like Transco, Northwest and Gulfstream, you just don't see much movement from quarter to quarter other than a little bit of IT revenues, because they're fully sold out versus some of the pipelines - some of the other interstate pipelines you see that are more dependent on actual volumes flowing.", "And so, our volumes are up, which is healthy, because it says that there is demand growing consistent with what ultimately leads to expansions. But in terms of what the revenues we take in, it really doesn't move all that much, as you can see looking at history.", "And Walt, maybe you'll take the question on the longer lead projects.", "Walter Bennett", "Sure. Thanks for the question. In terms of projects on Northwest Pipeline, we do have two projects that we're pursuing right now with our customers that are increasing lateral capacity to serve them, and we're going to give some more detail around that on Analyst Day. But that will be a little bit of an uptick as those get billed in terms of increment lateral fees, and that has really essentially optimized all the capacity on the existing mainline capacity in Northwest Pipeline.", "And so, beyond that, what we see is that, as additional demand comes on then we're going to be also looking at working with our customers on increasing mainline capacity on Northwest, which will be a good uptick in revenue on Northwest. And we'll be providing some more color around that on Analyst Day.", "J.R. Weston", "Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. I guess, just one more for me kind of switching gears quite a bit. But just with the Geismar transaction announced now, and then with all the other positive steps that you made over the last year or two, I was just kind of wondering what else is going into the equation moving forward, even just anything kind of from a thought process perspective, as you're looking at the dividend, the distribution growth outlook and especially at WMB, where the guided range is a little wider fairway at 10% to 15%?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. Well, obviously, as we continue to execute well, that would move us towards the upper end ultimately on that, as we continue to execute well. But I think in terms of the question around what we do with excess cash, certainly, the first thing we've talked about is taking down the revolver debt at WMB. That's really about the only thing we can easily take out in terms of debt at WMB and well on our way to doing that.", "But beyond that, we'll determine when we come to that point, and we've got that down, then we'll determine what we think the very best use of that cash is from a shareholder perspective. And so that will be a consideration towards the back end of the year likely.", "J.R. Weston", "Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thank you.", "Alan Armstrong", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And from UBS, we do have Shneur Gershuni. Please go ahead.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Not bad. Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions. And I think they're kind of a bit of follow-ups. For starters - and I think Chris kind of touched on this a little bit here, but when you've got the amount of gas that's coming out of the Permian Basin, and sort of starting to impact spreads and so forth, how do we think about the competitive nature of the Marcellus, which needs to obviously move gas down there?", "Do you think basis does contract and presents an opportunity? Or is there a risk that that step up that we're all hoping for doesn't materialize, because of all the production downstream? When I look at spreads further out, it looks like it does contract, but I'm kind of interested in kind of your thoughts about it.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. I think certainly, with all the new pipeline capacity that's underway and systems like ours that are fully contracted, the pipeline capacity is getting built. As you'll see in our presentation next week, there's also a lot of power gen demand coming on for the Northeast as well, right, within the circle of pain, if you will, where people are trying to take advantage of all that low cost supply in the power generation market. So we think very positive things in terms of demand for the Northeast is coming.", "And I think, as I mentioned earlier, I think the big long-term gas demands really want to try to take advantage of the low cost - big low-cost supplies. And even if you get out on the outer end of ranges that I've seen of around 5 Bcf a day of incremental growth through 2021, it's just not near enough to really stay up - from the Permian - it's just not near enough to stay up with the kind of demand growth that we're seeing in the balance.", "And so, we'll hit that next week in some detail, but I would just say that the kind of demand we're seeing come on is really going to take a big low cost gas resource like the Marcellus and the Utica that people can count on that production being there through the valleys and peaks that tend to occur in the oil business. So we think the Marcellus and Utica certainly established itself as the supply basin for a lot of this incremental demand, and it's really the only one that can come on with that kind of scale.", "Shneur Gershuni", "That definitely makes sense. And then, you completed some offshore investments last year. Just wondering, if you can sort of give us a sense of how they're running at this stage, right now. Is there a further ramp? Just any color on how we think about how they're doing and where they're going at this stage.", "Alan Armstrong", "Rory, you want to take that?", "Rory Miller", "Yes, I'll take that. Maybe starting with our Keathley Canyon Connector, that facility is running fully loaded. The South Hadrian gas field and Lucius are making up most of the volumes in there. But it continues to run fully loaded and our downstream plant at Larose is running right at nameplate capacity, so great performance there.", "I would say over in the Eastern Gulf, some other noteworthy projects that we've had over the last couple of years are our Gulfstar project. And I also would characterize that as a bit of a slow start. The operator had some challenges - downhole challenges, but some subsea or a downhole valve litigation that was all part of that.", "But the fields actually, the Tubular Bells field and then the tieback that we made at Gunflint, those are really starting to line out and produce nicely. In fact, a couple of days ago, we hit 50,000 barrels a day through the facility. It's been averaging a little bit below that, but it's performing very well. I would say this year, it's really hitting its stride, performing better than it did last year.", "The other thing, I'll mention, we had a tieback to our old Devils Tower bar with a field called Kodiak that was a one well tieback. And they recently recompleted into another zone, so it's being co-mingled. And they almost doubled production out of that well, so really good performance over in the Eastern Gulf. Of course, there are always declines, but I feel like this year, the operations have - not only on our side, but on the producers side has kind of hit their stride, and we think that's pretty solid.", "Shneur Gershuni", "Cool. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate the color and look forward to further update next week.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great. Thanks, Shneur.", "Operator", "And we do hear from Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. And he's next.", "Brandon Blossman", "Hey, guys.", "Alan Armstrong", "Good morning.", "Brandon Blossman", "A couple of quick ones. One, hearing some producer - renew producer interest in Powder River Basin development, any thoughts in terms of trajectory for you guys going forward there?", "Alan Armstrong", "I'm sure, Walt, you want to hit that.", "Walter Bennett", "Sure. Yes. We have seen renewed interest in that area on our Jackalope system. And this year, this has been included in some of the guidance and some of the public statements, but - and anticipate a number of wells coming on in that area with some two or three rigs that are going to be working that hadn't been in the area previously, and also exploring some new formations, [suffix, the turner department] [ph]. So that brings some optimism to that area, and we're looking forward to seeing the results of those wells. And hopefully, we'll have a strong growth trajectory from there.", "Brandon Blossman", "Well, thank you on that. And then, broader picture. So Gulf Trace, under budget, any thoughts about where we are today and expectations for the future in terms of pipe or labor costs inflation?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, good question. I would say on our major projects that we have right now, we're under construction. And some of the big projects like the NESE project that Rory talked about earlier, pretty unique labor set there, because you're right in very heavily congested area and you're in some of - quite a bit of that work is actually in Raritan Bay in offshore.", "So pretty unique contractor set that will be on that project. But overall, I would say our team has done a really good job of anticipating a lot of increase in construction and have done a good job of getting out in front of that in terms of contracting. So feel pretty comfortable there right now in terms of how we're positioned, but certainly, we could see some pressure in the large diameter market as some of these big projects like Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast Pipeline start - and Rover start to take hold.", "Brandon Blossman", "Perfect.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Porter", "Thanks, Alicia. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our CFO, Don Chappel; and our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn.", "In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconciled with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.", "So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan Armstrong", "Great. Well thank you, John and welcome everyone. I'm going to keep my remarks fairly brief this morning so we can move quickly to your questions. I'd like to start by thanking those of you who attended our recent Analyst Day event. It really was great to reengage with a lot of folks and to layout our solid plans for Williams in the course we've chartered to deliver on this low-risk, sustainable growth and a very focused and clear strategy that we continue to execute against.", "I was also pleased to introduce our new COO, Micheal Dunn, at Analyst Day. He's really hit the ground running and is making a big impact on our operations through his commitment to execution and accountability across the organization. Within Micheal's organization, we recently announced the appointment of Frank Ferazzi as Senior Vice President of Atlantic-Gulf. And Frank replaces Rory Miller, who announced his retirement earlier this year. And of course, Frank's previous role was running our Eastern Interstate. So we've got a nice continuity there of leadership in that area.", "More recently, we've added some - another key player to our leadership team. Chad Zamarin came onboard as Senior Vice President of Corporate Development in late June. And Chad joined us from Cheniere and is focused squarely on the opportunities and larger strategic initiatives that we can drive from an enterprise level. So really excited to have Chad join us here and his energy level and he's got a lot of wood to chop and he's getting right after it. So excited about the new energy we've got here at the senior leadership team.", "We're also pleased with our efforts to drive cost out of the business, continually improve our project execution and we've made some strides on further improving our operational safety metrics.", "On July 6, we completed the sale of Geismar to NOVA Chemicals. That sale, along with the sale of the Canadian assets last year, removed a significant amount of commodity risk from our business, as you're well aware. And we now stand at around 97% of our gross margins coming from predictable fee-based sources that are aligned with natural gas volumes. This move also allows us to streamline the support services around the organization, as we really have narrowed our lines of business and we continue to grow scale within these fewer lines of business. So a lot of opportunity that we're seeing to really get focused on the natural gas transmission gathering and processing side of the business and getting some of those business that were more ancillary to that really does allow us to narrow the services that we provide around the organization.", "We also - we did use a portion of the proceeds in the quarter to pay - sorry, just more recently here, to pay off our $850 million term loan. And of course further strengthening our balance sheet which we've made tremendous progress on here in the last 12 months. The team executing on the Geismar sale did a great job and I really want to recognize their tremendous efforts; really excited about the way that transaction was executed by our team.", "We're also crisply executing on our 2017 project commitments. You'll remember, we talked about our key 5 projects that are coming online in 2017. Of course, that was Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase I, Dalton, New York Bay and the Virginia Southside II project. We're chipping away at all these important projects. As you know, Gulf Trace came into service in the first quarter. And Hillabee Phase I which provides all of the supply for Sabal Trail, came online in early July. And then just this week on August 1, the Dalton capacity was placed in service to serve northern Georgia markets from supply points at the northern end of Transco. So really an exciting project there in that we're really starting to now provide capacity moving for the northern end into these growing southeast markets. And so more of those to come. But really excited to see that project come along - come online.", "Our line of sight of the future growth is evident as we target the second half of '17. And the in-service dates coming up for Virginia Southside II, New York Bay and also, we'll get Garden State Phase I in this year as well, it looks like.", "So in summary, if you kind of think about the $1.4 billion roughly in projects that we were going to be placing in service - in full-service, about 20% of that came on in the first half of '17. And now another roughly 55% in this July/August time frame. And then of course, the balance of that will be in the second half of '17. So great job by our teams. That is a lot of work that's been going on to execute on that with plenty of resistance in a lot of these areas, but the team's doing a great job of executing in the face of that.", "So let's look at the results for the second quarter of '17 now. We met or exceeded our business performance expectations in all 3 remaining businesses. And although the results were somewhat offset by Geismar's continued outage and lower margins, in fact, the go-forward business which excludes the NGL & Petchem, was up 6.6% over 2Q of '16 on an adjusted EBITDA basis.", "As you probably know, we will not have any continued operations or assets to be reported in the NGL-Petchem sector other than what will come through in the 3 - third quarter here as we wrapped up the closing for Geismar in third quarter. So really, the go-forward, you'll see those 3 business units and just kind of the tailings of the NGL & Petchem business there.", "Looking at - looking first at our GAAP results. WPZ delivered $320 million in net income in the second quarter. And once again, we demonstrated the long term benefits of our strategy as we delivered year-over-year growth on our adjusted EBITDA measure for now the 15th consecutive quarter. So a very nice drum beat we've got going there and we've got confidence in being able to continue that for many quarters to come. WPZ's adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion was a $39 million increase over '16, primarily due to increased fee-based revenues and an increase in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures. Distributable cash flow for the quarter was $698 million which was down over the second quarter of '16, primarily from the planned removal of $58 million in noncash deferred revenue amortization associated with our fourth quarter 2016 contract, where we restructured the Barnett Shale and some of the Mid-Continent region business as well. This is nothing new. We mentioned this reduction on our last quarter's call as well. But just to remind you, that amortization is flowing through our EBITDA, but we remove it on the DCF.", "Importantly, the WPZ coverage for the quarter came in at 1.22 and this puts us at 1.27 for the year-to-date. The cash retained due to this healthy coverage supports further investment in our leading growth portfolio.", "So now we'll take a look at each of our segments. We'll start with the Atlantic-Gulf, where continued strong performance, coupled with expected growth for the balance of the year, gives us confidence we'll achieve our prior guidance on both adjusted EBITDA and DCF. And our adjusted EBITDA for Atlantic-Gulf came in at $462 million, an increase of around $94 million or almost 26% over the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an $88 million higher fee-based revenues coming from increased volumes through our Gulfstar One due to the Gunflint tie-back which happened in the third quarter of last year and stronger volumes from Tubular Bells and of course other Transco expansions that just keep coming online and into service and the steady drumbeat of those projects. This really is another proof point of our ability to deliver predictable, sustained growth from markets along Transco and further demonstration of our leading position out in the Gulf.", "In the West, gathered volumes were up approximately 4% versus the first quarter of 2017 after we adjusted for the Marcellus for Permian transaction. So after taking the DBJV impact out of there, that gives you that 4%. The seasonal issues experienced in the first quarter this year have lifted and we continue to place a sharp focus on cost and operational discipline throughout our Western operations which now includes the central - what was previously the central area as well.", "For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA came in at $372 million, down versus 2Q of '16, primarily due to the Barnett and Niobrara contract restructures; and the Niobrara, that contract restructure really just affected how we record revenues in the Niobrara and in the DBJV sale and our lower volumes in that area. The declines were partially offset by a $14 million reduction in O&M and SG&A expenses. So really proud of the way the team continues to really push on the cost in the West.", "And now going over to Northeast G&P, where volumes increased in our Susquehanna and Ohio River Systems but declined on our rich Utica systems compared to 2Q '16. We talked last quarter about being at an inflection point on the Utica volume increases and we continue to expect a pick-up through the rest of the year. Specifically, we've seen pretty dramatic declines in the West - in the wet Utica, sorry, over the last 5 quarters, but expect the Chesapeake rigs to move back in and begin to offset previous declines later this year and into 2018. So quite a bit of movement going on within the Northeast and even within the Utica zone. But I'll remind you, relative to the wet Utica that while we have confidence in the wet Utica volumes coming back here as we're seeing the activity picking up. If they don't return, our fees would increase because those wet Utica volumes are under a cost-of-service agreement. And so, even though it's starting from a much smaller base, we have already seen strong and expected growth in the dry Utica. So remember, we have 2 basic systems there. We have the cardinal system that takes in the wet Utica volumes and then we have what we call - refer to as our flint system; that is the dry Utica. The dry Utica has been - has seen some really fast growth going on, but it's from a much smaller base. And - but the wet Utica has not had the benefits of any drilling for a long time. So it's pretty interesting to watch, in these basins, where in some areas we're still enjoying DUCs. And in an area like the wet Utica, we're really seeing what the raw decline really would look like. And I would tell you, I think that is an interesting macro picture for people to pay attention to.", "It's also important to remember that infrastructure constraints continue to limit the Northeast volume growth. And certainly, we're anxious to see a lot of these big projects come on, because we really think that's going to unlock a tremendous amount of growth. But we do see here in the third quarter, we've seen some pretty soft pricing in the third quarter. And certainly, that could have some short term impact and really cap the growth in our volumes here in the short term. But overall, for the second quarter, Northeast adjusted EBITDA increased $26 million compared to the same period last year. Increased Bradford ownership resulting from the DBJV sale primarily drove the increase, with Marcellus volume growth offset by rich volume declines we talked about earlier. Fee-based revenues remained relatively stable through the period.", "I'd also like to just comment, kind of a little more forward-looking on this. Our teams are having great success on the commercial front which I would tell you is following from a great operational performance in terms of reliability in the Northeast. And we're really excited to see what the next 12 months holds for this area. That is poised to grow rapidly. And I would tell you, it's looking like we may be able to pick up more than our market share of that growth as we look forward, given the great performance by our teams up there.", "As we go now to NGL & Petchem Services. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was affected by the unplanned downtime at Geismar in the March to April timeframe. We discussed on last quarter's call as well as a modest reduction in per-unit margins due to price movements on those products there. The Geismar transaction, as I mentioned, closed on July 6. So there's no gain on the sale in this quarter's result. But we expect a $1.1 billion gain to be recorded in the third quarter.", "So now let's move on to the next slide and take a quick look at our year-to-date results. We delivered GAAP net income of $954 million with adjusted EBITDA of over $2.2 billion, up about 4.5% compared to the same period in 2016. The year-to-date 2017 segment results generally reflect the same drivers we saw in the second quarter. The only exceptions - primary exceptions I would point out there is the typical seasonal issues that we see on big systems like Transco, where we have short term firm that we sell as well as interruptible volumes that flow on those system, relatively small compared to Transco, but we do see some fluctuation there. That is very typical and you can go back and look at any quarters - previous first quarter and second quarter and you'll see that movement. And also, our West volumes which we were pleased to see rebound from the first quarter after some freeze-offs in the Western operations.", "Coverage at WPZ came in at 1.27 on the back of 1.45 billion in DCF. And this solid coverage which excludes the $116 million revenue amortization, continues to grow and provide solid coverage that we can reinvest.", "So now let's look at some of our executional highlights for the second quarter. I've already touched on the first couple of projects here. And obviously, the Geismar sale was significant. But another area I'd like to emphasize is our growth in the Gulf. It's important to remember the strong competitive position of Atlantic-Gulf's offshore assets which really showed up here in the second quarter and some new volumes and some new business that we contracted that came on. And we continue to make progress on Atlantic Sunrise, where construction continues on the mainline facilities and we will see early mainline service revenues this September.", "Assuming timely regulatory approvals, we expect to hit our target in-service date of mid-2018. And with respect to completing the entire project, the long lead item is the greenfield compressor station work. As we've discussed in the past, the majority of the takeaway capacity could be available once the pipeline is in service, even if the greenfield compression isn't in place. And so that's really going to be a big game changer in the area as we bring on these - what we refer to as the Central Penn Line in the area. And in fact, we're in the final phases of permitting for the Central Penn Line and - which is all in Pennsylvania. And our team continues to work cooperatively with PDEP, with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and other agencies. I would tell you, we've got a very good relationship there. And we have worked hard to meet their very stringent and careful requirements. I would tell you, PDEP's being extremely cautious, as you would expect, in the environment they're operating in. But we found them to be very professional and diligent in their efforts.", "For all of our projects and operations, we try to differentiate Williams from our competitors in the way we listen to our landowners and the public and work hard to understand their concerns as well as the regulators. And we think over time, this trust that we continue to build pays dividends as our pipelines are going to be there for a very long time and we understand that and we go into it with that attitude.", "In fact, we just finished a public comment period in a round of public hearings for Atlantic Sunrise in Pennsylvania, in which a tremendous number of people stood up to support our project, including people from labor unions, business, manufacturing as well as local elected officials. To be sure, there is some opposition to the project, as you've picked up in the media. But we know the majority of Pennsylvanians understand how important natural gas takeaway capacity is to the future of the common welfare.", "In addition to our project - or progress on Atlantic Sunrise in 2017 Transco projects, as we've discussed, our Northeast Supply Enhancement project is progressing as expected as well. And in the West, we expect to place two gathering expansions in service for this year at the Wamsutter and Haynesville spaces. So nice example of high incremental returns in those areas where we've got a very strong presence already. And so nice to see some increased volumes to be coming on in those areas.", "Our Northeast G&P team is also working hard to place expansions in service by year end that will allow Cabot to meet its commitment to Atlantic Sunrise and other new takeaway arrangements that they have reported on.", "So as I wrap up, I'd emphasize, we're pleased with where we're here in mid-2017. And especially on our project execution, our solid performance and focus on execution this year positions us very well going into '18. And especially with the high incremental return projects we have coming down the pipe, in both the Northeast and now the Haynesville and Wamsutter Fields, we're able to fund our growth within a very comfortable credit metric along with our retained cash flow. Though in general, I would tell you, the U.S. really has a tremendous competitive advantage because of our abundant low-cost natural gas supply. Williams' advantaged position between these abundant supplies and growing natural gas demand is continuing to deliver tremendous growth prospects with better-than-industry-average returns. Our employees across the country are very passionate about driving value and building Williams for the future and doing it the right way.", "And on a personal note, I'm really pleased with the significant contributions of our new leaders and - are making here, as we continue creating low-risk, predictable growth for our shareholders. So with that, I thank you and we'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Jean Salisbury of Bernstein.", "Jean Salisbury", "Can just remind us of the major permits to watch for, for Atlantic Sunrise to be on time for Phase 1 and Phase 2?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, sure. I'll have Micheal Dunn take that for you.", "Micheal Dunn", "Good morning. Right now, we're looking at 3 primary permits to finalize the permitting process. One is the 404 permit that the Corps of Engineers is processing. And the other 2 are from PDEP or for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Those are 102, 105 permits as they're designated. All of these are water-related type permits and we've obviously finished all the public comment periods for all of these. And we do expect these permits to be in-hand in August and that would allow us to start construction certainly thereafter. So what will happen after we received those permits is, we would go back to the FERC and ask for a notice to proceed. And at that point, we would be able to begin construction on the project.", "Jean Salisbury", "Okay. And that's kind of a 1-for-1 delay, I guess. So if that gets delayed by 2 weeks, then construction start would get delayed by 2 weeks, basically?", "Micheal Dunn", "Well, yes. It would be a day-for-day delay. But we're pretty optimistic we're going to receive those permits here in the month of August. And FERC has been pretty generous in turning around notice to proceed requests for the industry fairly quickly. So we would expect to be able to start construction shortly thereafter.", "Jean Salisbury", "Great. And then, as a follow-up. As I'm sure you're aware, there have been a lot of rigs added in the Haynesville since the beginning of the year which should lead to volumes in the back half. You now get fixed fee on that, right? I'm wondering if the ramp has been more than what you expected in your guidance and kind of more than the minimum that you agreed with Chesapeake a couple years ago?", "Alan Armstrong", "They're a little bit ahead. But part of that obligations they had was a certain number of wells turn in line. I would say what's been surprising to us is not the number but really the performance that they've had on those wells, that they've continued to do better and better on. We do have a new piece of capacity coming on, on what's called our Springridge system. And so that'll add about 150 million a day of capacity. And it is needed, because there are volumes stacking up behind that. So we're excited to be turning that on here in the very near future. And that will unleash some volumes in that area. So yes, we're enjoying growth there and excited to see some of the well performance in that area.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs.", "Theodore Durbin", "I appreciate the update on Southeastern Trail. I just wonder if you can give a little more sense of how much capacity you're marketing there, the type of capital you might be deploying, what kind of returns you're looking at on that project, please?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. I would say, still yet to be determined. As we've reported in the past, we got some very valuable capacity there, a lot of demand for it from the market. And we want to make sure that we get the very best investments around that. So I would say, we remain excited. We haven't pinned that down. We do have a binding open season that's going to be closing here as we speak. But we're going to make sure that we get the absolute optimum value out of that, because that capacity southbound - that incremental capacity southbound within our main line or brownfield, if you will, is extremely valuable. And we want to make sure we get whatever other strategic benefits might come with that. And so that's what we're working on. So I would say, very optimistic there. But remain - we're going to be patient in making sure that we get the very best alternatives out of that last easy expansion that we have coming south there.", "Theodore Durbin", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, you saw an uptick in the West. Maybe I just missed the comments on your gathering volumes, sort of second quarter versus first quarter. I was wondering if you can give us a little more sense of the drivers there that are sort of offsetting what has been more of a declining area than a growing area?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, sure. Mostly I would tell you it was just recovery from some of the production and freeze-offs in general. But for instance, in the Barnett, we're starting to see and this is more recent, but we're starting to see Total. Remember, they had a roughly $40 million a year obligation for drilling dollars in the area. There were kind of late to get started on that just because they had a lot of issues to deal with as they took over as operator. But I'd say, they're really starting to get after that and we're starting to see some improvement from their investments there. So typically, Barnett has been a pretty heavy decline area and we're starting to see that be arrested. Mike, I don't know what other comments you might think to...", "Micheal Dunn", "Well, I would say, across the board, there were improvements in most of those franchise areas in the West, pretty significant in Eagle Ford, Haynesville and also the Southwest Wyoming. So we recovered from the problems we had, obviously, in Southwest Wyoming over the winter and saw a pretty good uptick there.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.", "Charles Barber", "This is Charlie on for Jeremy. Just one clarification on the Petchem segment. So there will be just that first week that Geismar was still technically - before it was finally sold in that first week of July? And then, the RGB Splitter, that was sold, is that correct?", "Alan Armstrong", "That is correct. I think that closed June 30, so that won't even be in the third quarter.", "Charles Barber", "Okay, great. And then, just the maintenance CapEx. Obviously below the guidance. Just trying to understand on kind of cadence for 3Q and 4Q, similar step up that we saw in 1Q and 2Q, to kind of hit? Or is there - I mean, any reason why you would come in below that $500 million guidance?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, I would say, we have a lot of work to do and it's somewhat dependent on our ability to get to that. But we'll be pushing hard to get that done. And so, I think, probably the best pattern probably to look at is previous year's patterns. I think, that's probably a pretty good indicator of the cadence that we have that's driven by both weather and loads on our systems. Said another way, we're - we have so much load on our systems typically that we have to be careful when we take them off line to be able to do the work. So those patterns are pretty well fixed and really wouldn't expect anything very different in terms of percentage per quarter that we're spending in there. So I'd say, it's probably the best guidepost to look at.", "Donald Chappel", "This is Don Chappel. Just to clarify on NGL-Petchem. You'll see, I think, as Alan mentioned, 6 days of operations at Geismar. You'll see the expected gain on the sale that we disclosed, an estimate of $1.1 billion. And then you'll see any other, I'll call it, miscellaneous cleanup kind of changes in reserves, things like that, that relate to that segment that'll dribble in a bit over time. But really, from an operating standpoint, it's really only 6 days of operation of Geismar. The gain on sale and then just, I'll call it, a dribbling, if you will, of any other adjustments or costs or revenues that might dribble through there.", "Charles Barber", "Great. And then, just real quick, lastly. The - during the Analyst Day, you mentioned, within the Atlantic-Gulf segment, the couple of projects that were in negotiations. Just any update there? I believe there was one that you touched on earlier. But I just - curious on the remainder of those.", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, we're not quite ready to announce anything on those. So lots of expansion work going on. But - or development work going on. But I'd say, on the Transco system, it's pretty complex right now. A lot of opportunities that we're pursuing, but coupled with Southeastern Trail, there's - we're having to, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're really trying to make sure we're optimizing, because we understand how valuable these tranches of capacity are.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co.", "Colton Bean", "I appreciate the comments on Atlantic Sunrise and that there's still a few moving pieces to nail down there. But I think on Q1, you kind of referenced the variance in CapEx guidance as largely attributable to Sunrise timing. So then, maybe a better sense of how that progresses through the back half of the year. Can you guys refine that range at all?", "Alan Armstrong", "Well, I would say, we're probably, given kind of where the timing's working out, we'll probably wind up closer to midpoint of that rather than the low end or the high end of it. Because we're - the high end would've had us already under major construction. And the midpoint is about kind of what we're expecting and it looks like that's going to come out. So I would say, kind of the midpoint is probably a pretty good indicator right now.", "Colton Bean", "Okay. And then, on the West segment, so you mentioned the reversal of freeze-offs on the gathering side. We didn't necessarily see that for processing, so is there also a bit of a mix shift going on there in terms of rebounding volumes on the dry gas basins and maybe more of a flatter trajectory for rich gas?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, yes. We did have some shifts in the - at our Opal facility there. We had Ultra, where we reformed the contracts there. And then, on LINN Energy, they rejected a contract that we had. That also showed up in the first quarter. But they rejected a contract that we had out there. We're looking at being able to pick up some volumes in the area. But that really was a change, though. So one shifting from fee to commodity risk and the other was we actually lost the volumes there at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Timm Schneider of Evercore.", "Timm Schneider", "My question, I guess, is a bit more longer term strategic. Specifically, if I look at your business model, right, you have, obviously, the natural gas pipelines which are, I'd say, best in breed; then you have the Gulf of Mexico and Rockies or West Gathering and Processing. As you look at your gross CapEx portfolio, I mean, the majority of that is centered around Transco. But kind of, over the next - and it's not near term, but over the next 3, 4, 5 years, what's beyond Transco? Or do you actually think Transco's going to be the pillar going forward here as well? Or is there other things that you guys are looking at in the portfolio? Basically, it's kind of like, everybody looks at Williams in the context of, \"Hey, maybe they're a takeout target.\" I'm kind of thinking of it the other way around. Is there anything that you guys are interested in?", "Alan Armstrong", "Timm, thanks for the question. I would just say, we're very excited about the strategy that we have and opportunities that are coming along. We're really working to be the best operator in this space, in this strategy. And I would say, we're working extremely hard as a team to not just be good in the space, but great. And we think, as we continue to execute over time that, that's going to open up opportunities for us to continue to expand in our strategy. But I would say, it is blocking and tackling first and we remain extremely focused on that. And we have so much opportunity, as you mentioned, we have so much opportunity here that's right in front of us that we're really narrowing our focus on delivering on that. But certainly, we're paying attention to long term trends and where we need to be next. And I think, we've always done a good job strategically of positioning ourselves in the right place and we'll continue to do that. So - but I would say, there's a pretty intense focus right now on delivering what we have, because there's so much value to be created just delivering on what's right in front of us right now.", "Micheal Dunn", "Timm, I would add, if you go back to our Analyst Day, we talked a lot about the Northeast, where we have an opportunity to increase our revenues up there fairly significantly with less capital infusion into that, just because of the backbone systems that we've already built up in that area up there. So that's one of the areas that we talked about a lot at Analyst Day that we have great opportunities going forward.", "Timm Schneider", "Got it. And I guess, let me ask one follow-up on that. And I know the focus really has been - and you guys have done a tremendous job on this, kind of shifting toward - at the Mantle, that fee or that take-or-pay business model on the gas pipeline side. But would you be categorically opposed to looking at gathering and processing assets, if they have the right structure, right? So it's not commodity price exposure, maybe more fee-based, minimum volume commitments, stuff like that?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, no. We're not at all opposed if it's the right risk-adjusted return. We think we're very good in that space and we think we're a good operator in that space and have a lot of talents and capabilities. So yes, we'll certainly continue there. I would say that, even within the gathering and processing space in particular, it gets pretty hard to match the quality of our cash flows given our contracts and the growth opportunity that we have around some of our business. And so, I would tell you, anytime we're going to look at anything, it's going to be a mix of quality of cash flows. We've got a pretty highbrow mix of cash flows that I think's pretty hard to compete with, both in the current and in the forward-looking.", "Timm Schneider", "Got it. And lastly, I mean, if I look at your geographic footprint, are you guys kind of happy with the basins you're in right now? Or is there anything else that you'd like to be in? And obviously, there I'm kind of hinting at - you guys don't really have - you guys sold some stuff in the Permian. No scale there. Is - did we kind of - is it too late to get in there at this point in a big way? Or is there still some opportunities, if they were available?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, I would just say, first of all, we do have some pretty significant acreage dedication in the Permian that we think could be significant as the play develops. But as we've mentioned, we really don't have all of the vertical integration that a lot of the big players have in there. And frankly, we're not - we don't - we're not interested in paying the kind of multiples that have been getting paid to get in there, because you're not just betting - I mean, there's no upside left when you pay those kind of multiples. And so, I would say, we've seen that as pretty pricey.", "But we certainly are taking a look at it as it could impact gas volumes. We have a lot to offer being the Transco system and being able to distribute those volumes to market.", "And so we'll continue to keep an eye on any opportunity there and certainly see both the Mexico markets and the LNG markets along the Gulf Coast as something that we're well-positioned to serve and - however we can use our assets to gain competitive advantage towards those alternatives, we're certainly going to be having an eye to. But I would just say, I - there's a lot of well-hill players in that basin. And I think, our - the question we have is, how do we use our skill sets to help take care of some of those volumes. But I think, going head-to-head on the gathering and processing - upstream gathering and processing out there is - looks pretty pricey right now.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers.", "Craig Shere", "Just looking for a little more color around what governs the potential time gap between the greenfield Central Penn Line for Atlantic Sunrise being in service and the compressor station? And if I recall from Analyst Day, the pickup, when you - the month of revenue pickup when the compressor's online is about $11 million a month. Is that correct?", "Alan Armstrong", "I'm going to turn that to Micheal Dunn here.", "Phillip Wright", "So let's start with what we hope to put in service this fall with some main line facilities that we have underway right now. So we would expect to start seeing some revenue you heard Alan talk about earlier from that, in the September time frame. And that's really reversals of our compressor stations on the Transco main line as well as one greenfield - sorry, one brownfield compressor addition at one of our existing stations. That does not get us capacity all the way back into the Northeast PA basin, though.", "So what we would anticipate, once we get the Central Penn Line completed and that would be about 2 months or so ahead of the greenfield compression in the Central Penn Line. So we would have 2 months there of about 1.2 Bcf a day of capacity that would come out of the basin there that would certainly create an outlet for our customers up there. And then ultimately, the compression coming on line puts us at about 1.7 Bcf a day. So assuming that we get a construction start date this fall, we think it's about a 10-month construction for the entire project. Optimistically, we could get the pipelines in service a few months before that on the greenfield and be able to put about 1.2 Bcf a day in service on that project.", "Craig Shere", "Okay. So it's really just logistics and construction? There isn't a separate regulatory permitting issue related to the compression?", "Micheal Dunn", "No. No, there's not. I mean, ultimately, we go to FERC in a few weeks once we get the 102 and 105 permits from Pennsylvania, the 404 for the Corps. We asked for a notice to proceed for the entire project. It's just the timing of the schedule, it just takes longer to build a greenfield compressor stations than it does the greenfield pipeline.", "Craig Shere", "Understood. And then, any more color around what's going on at Constitution?", "Alan Armstrong", "I would just say, we continue to expect something coming out of the Second Circuit there. But I would tell you, we were very encouraged by the D.C. circuit ruling on Millennium. And then, basically telling the - that the New York DC had waived and that they should go to the FERC for their permit. That was very instructive, I would say, relative to Constitution. And so we're excited about that. We continue to work with the staff in the White House to move things along, because we think they have the rights to move things along on that project. So it remains a two-pronged approach. But I would tell you that the last month or so here has been encouraging in terms of how the court ruled on the Millennium project and the attention that that's gotten in - within the White House staff. So anyway, just continuing to push on that. Nothing moves very fast on that front. But continue to be encouraged by what we're seeing there.", "Craig Shere", "Could you still see potential favorable 2017 announcements?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, my patience has been strained, obviously, as long as we've been pushing on that. But yes, I would expect to see some action here in '17 still. So I feel pretty good. Now we've got a lot of work to do to then get the system installed and get through all of the very final permitting issues. But remember, we already have our certificate from FERC from that. And so, I think, the political environment is ripe and I think we either get some help from the courts which there's some probability, but it's a little bit unusual for a court to overrule an agency like that. But we think we've got a very good case in that regard. But I'd probably say, I'm more optimistic about the pathway through both the core and the FERC to gain approval with the White House's assistance on that.", "Craig Shere", "Great. And last question, Don, I just want to confirm for the third quarter, there's going to be no cash tax drag relating to that Geismar sale up at the C Corp, is that correct?", "Donald Chappel", "Craig, we do not expect a cash tax drag related to the Geismar sale. There could be a modest amount, but right now, it's expected to be 0 or a very modest amount.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.", "Christine Cho", "I just have one question. We've seen some consolidation among producers in the Northeast. It's pretty fragmented up there. So I'm sure we'll continue to see some consolidation as well as acreage changing hands. There's also a whole bunch of producer-sponsored MLPs on the gathering side. Are you seeing any initial signs of any of these guys wanting to monetize? And then, separately, what do we - what do you think we need to see for the opportunity for some of your partners wanting to get out of the JVs they're in with you on? Are we waiting for pipeline capacity on the gas and NGL side to come on? Or is there any other gating items that we should be aware about?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, Christine, good morning and thanks for the good question. Yes, I think the consolidation is well underway. I think that EQT and Sclotterbeck really, I think, onto a path that's important in terms of being a low-cost manufacturer in the basin and they certainly have, with the Rice transaction, would have a tremendous position up there. And I think, we'll continue to see that, where people are really focused on those areas, on the one hand. On the other hand, I would tell you, in some areas, there's just so much remaining drilling locations. For instance, for companies like Cabot, they just have so many remaining locations within the large acreage position they do have that they've got plenty of scale to execute at a low cost in the area.", "So I guess, I would say, I do think we'll continue to see consolidation, but maybe for varying reasons up there. On the Midstream side, I do think that we'll continue to see consolidation as well. As you point out rightly, there's a lot of private equity that's had money up there and it's probably getting a little stale and a little ripe, because they've been in those positions for quite a while. And typically, the way they're rewarded is, the management teams have them anxious to get out at some point in time and it's certainly usually inside of 5 years. So I do think, there's going to be some pressure up there. But I think, there's probably just deltas and bid-ask right now between people's expectations and what the market might allow for. And I'd say, we're just in the process of seeing those bid-ask spreads close in on themselves.", "So that's kind of how we'd describe that. But I definitely think that we'll see some shift going on up there just like we always do in big, fast growing basins. There's a lot of people to start with and then, the big players tend to consolidate because they've got the right scale, they've got the right cost structure and they've got the right market outlets. And those tend to drive the volumes to those systems. So I think, we'll continue to see some pretty sizable consolidation here in the next 18 months in the Northeast.", "Christine Cho", "And as a follow-up, when I kind of think about the Northeast, obviously you talked about Cabot. Your gathering should benefit when Atlantic Sunrise comes on. In Southwest PA, do you think the bigger bottleneck is gas pipeline capacity that needs to come on for you guys to see your volumes increase? Or do you think it's more NGL takeaway, like Mariner East?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes, the NGL takeaway issue is more an issue of price, right? Because you can clear your barrels. It's a matter of what you get for them by getting them out of there. Versus on the gas side, it's an absolute issue because there's no alternative other than the gas pipeline. But of course you have rail and trucking to get liquids out of there. So I do think the price improvement on NGLs will be welcome to the basin. And that could have some impact. But I clearly think, the biggest issue right now is on gas takeaway, because it's a point of diminishing return on the gas. If you turn any new gas on, not only does that gas get underpriced, you just put price pressure on the other gas that you have in the basin. And so it's a very constrained and finite point in terms of getting gas out of the basin. And so I think, to answer your question, I think gas is probably more important than the liquids.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Eric Genco, Citi.", "Eric Genco", "I was just wondering, on Constitution, I'm just trying to remember, if you were to get a Millennium-type decision, how long would it take to put the pipe into service? And can you remind us if there's some seasonal issues? And what type of barriers would be to starting construction and birds nesting, et cetera?", "Alan Armstrong", "Yes. Mike, you want to take that?", "Micheal Dunn", "Yes. So right now, we would anticipate the earliest we can get that project in is early 2019, so probably second quarter 2019. And there are quite a few windows. But backing into an opportunity to get released this fall, that would put us in the first half of 2019. For an in-service date.", "Eric Genco", "Okay. And then, in terms of the cost savings in the West, it was pretty impressive. I just wanted to ask, where do you think you are in terms of like what inning? And if could you expand a little more there? And do you think there's more to come in that segment? Or maybe other areas? And just, how that's been going for you?", "Micheal Dunn", "I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?", "Alan Armstrong", "Mike, the question was on cost savings in the West and whether we're - should expect to see a continuation of that improvement.", "Micheal Dunn", "Yes, thanks for that question. Our team's doing a great job out there taking cost out of their business. And I think, we will continue to seek those opportunities and find opportunities to continue to take costs, not just out of the West business, but the rest of the business where it makes sense. And there's still opportunities there. We have a lot of consolidation, for example, in our measurement systems that - where we had the legacy Access and the legacy Williams measurement systems, for example, that we're consolidating. And we'll be able to continue to take costs out of the business in that fashion. So there's opportunities just like that all across our business. And certainly in West, we'll continue to do that.", "Eric Genco", "That's great. And final one for me, I just wanted to ask if you've had any recent conversation with the rating agencies? Or if you have any plans to kind of, post the Geismar sale - I realize it was announced a while ago, but just didn't know what the schedule was there.", "Micheal Dunn", "We're in regular conversation with the agencies. So yes, we update our model and discussions with them and obviously that's a major milestone. So we'll continue those conversations. What they do with it, who knows. But we think our credit is improving steadily and we're hopeful that they'll agree.", "Operator", "That is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.", "Alan Armstrong", "Okay. Well, great. Well, thank you. Very excited about the quarter and excited about how we're positioned here for the next 12 months and got a lot of exciting things ahead of us continuing to come on. So I appreciate your continued interest in the company and hope you have a great day. Thank you. Bye.", "Operator", "That does conclude our conference for today.

Kania - Wolfe Research LLC", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams and Williams Partners Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn; and our CFO, John Chandler.", "In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.", "And so with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thank you, John, and welcome everyone. I want to begin by introducing John Chandler to this call as our new CFO. He joined Williams in September and he's no stranger to many of you obviously. John enjoyed a long tenure at Magellan as CFO and he actually went to Magellan whom we spun it out from Williams. We're very pleased to be welcoming John back to Williams and you'll hear more from John later this morning. Of course, John is replacing Don Chappel who's retired from Williams, and I want to thank Don for all of his contributions to the company and we certainly wish him well in his retirement.", "As for the quarter, I'd like to start by thanking the team for another strong quarter of fee-based revenue growth driven by the project execution front as we continue to bring projects into service, on-time, and within our budgets. Importantly, we also continue to win meaningful new business which will keep our project execution teams busy for many years to come. The large scale advantage positions we've established continue to generate growth as evidenced by our strong results, with the year-to-date adjusted EBITDA up versus year-to-date 2016 despite the sale of over $3 billion of assets that generated $110 million of EBITDA in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the impact of two hurricanes that shut-in volumes from offshore producers. We substantially reduced our direct exposure to commodities. And as a result, our current business' steady growth is both predictable and transparent as it is being driven by consistent fee-based revenue growth under long-term contracts.", "Our strategic focus on natural gas volumes continues to deliver results. So far in 2017, we placed four of our Big 5 Transco expansion projects into service, including Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, the Dalton Expansion, and the New York Bay Expansion; with the fifth of the Big 5, the Virginia Southside II project, expected to be placed in service during the fourth quarter of this year. The incremental capacity from our fully contracted Transco expansion projects going in service so far this year reflects a 25% increase in Transco's design capacity. And year-to-date, Transco's transportation revenues have increased $74 million, a 7% increase over last year, and this is even though most of those 17 projects are being placed into service in the last half of this year.", "So along with our successful project execution, I'm also pleased with how we've strengthened our balance sheet and credit profile, significantly reducing our debt and lowering our overhead expenses. In fact, year-to-date, in 2017 Williams Partners has reduced long-term debt by $2 billion and increased cash by over $1 billion. This reduced debt level and increased cash balance has positioned us to self-fund our attractive slate of growth projects using cash on hand, retained operating cash flow and debt without the need to issue public equity all while maintaining solid investment grade credit metrics and coverage. At the corporate level, WMB has paid down $372 million in debt, and total adjusted overhead expenses have been reduced by about $40 million when compared to the same period in 2016 as we were able to realize overhead reduction in several ways, including moving from five operating areas to three and closing the Oklahoma City office in June of this year.", "So let's look at the results for the third quarter of 2017, and looking at the GAAP results first. WPZ delivered $259 million in net income in the third quarter of 2017, and WPZ's adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion. Our current business segments, the Atlantic-Gulf, the West, and the Northeast G&P \u2013 so those assets that we've retained, the businesses we've retained \u2013 combined to increase our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter by about $13 million. However, the full WPZ comparison shows a decrease in our third quarter adjusted EBITDA results versus third quarter of 2016 of $88 million. Of course, this was driven primarily by the absence of over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA contributed from the NGL and Petchem segments earlier, and of course these were sold by the partnership and this included the Geismar Olefins plant which we sold in July of this year, the associated RGP Splitter that we sold in June of this year, and our former Canadian businesses that were sold in September 2016.", "I would add here that our third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increase from our current businesses includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $8 million from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and contract restructures that lowered the West area results. So those are both contract restructures that we did in the Barnett as well as in the Niobrara area. So we're about to roll out of those or the periods of comparison of those, but those certainly had impacts on the West.", "Looking to DCF for the third quarter of 2017, Williams Partners generated $669 million in DCF compared with $795 million in DCF for the third quarter of 2016. In addition to the unfavorable change related to the big asset sales, the DCF for third quarter of 2017 has been reduced by $59 million for the removal of non-cash deferred revenue amortizations that were associated with the fourth quarter of 2016 contract restructuring in the Barnett Shale in the Mid-Continent region. So we mentioned this reduction in last quarter's call as well, partially offsetting the unfavorable changes with a $37 million decrease in interest expense. Importantly, WPZ coverage for the quarter came in at 1.17 and puts us at 1.24 year-to-date. The cash retained due to this healthy coverage supports further investment in our high-return growth CapEx portfolio.", "So now we'll take a look at each of our segments, starting here with the Atlantic-Gulf. The adjusted EBITDA for the Atlantic-Gulf came in at $431 million, a $3 million decrease from the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year comparisons were impacted by the short-term benefit we had in Q3 of last year where we were gathering and processing gas for a competitor's Pascagoula plant, and so that we had a big lift in the third quarter of last year as you all remember where we pointed out. And in addition to that, in the third quarter we had impact from both Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.", "Transco's growth projects contributed $46 million in fee-based revenues incremental, so a very good top line quarter here for Transco, partially offsetting the increased fee-based revenues with increased O&M expenses associated with Transco's required integrity and pipeline maintenance programs. These increased expenses are something we've been expecting and planning for. But I would say, due to timing of work and invoices, the expenses were slightly more concentrated here in the third quarter as usual. So overall, for the year, we're on plan and certainly within our expectations as we provided guidance there, but we did have it pretty lumpy here in the third quarter. A lot of that is just because we have the ability during this part of the year, right before we've got lines tied up for winter service, we've got a period that we can get in and go and get a lot of that work done, and we certainly got a lot of that done here in the third quarter.", "So now turning to the West. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA came in at $426 million, down by $7 million versus third quarter of 2016. Fee-based revenues were down on an adjusted basis primarily due to contract restructures. And also, EBITDA from JV's was lower due to the Delaware Basin joint venture sale from the first quarter. So recall, in the first quarter of this year we sold our interest in a Delaware Basin JV to Western Gas. The structural impacts were partially offset by continued tight O&M and SG&A expenses, and so really proud of the team continuing to put a lot of pressure on our overhead costs and our own direct O&M costs in the West.", "Some good news I would tell you for the West, we did see increased volume sequentially. So when we look at the West, gathered volumes up 5% versus 2Q of 2017. You'll recall in 2Q we said we expected to see things turning that way as we were starting to see volumes come back mostly due to the strong volume growth we saw in basins like the Haynesville system, and we are seeing the big volumes in the Haynesville coming on out there and we're seeing this continue in the fourth quarter. I'll provide a little more on that just a moment.", "Now looking to the Northeast. Overall, for the third quarter, our Northeast adjusted EBITDA increased $26 million compared to the same period last year. The current year benefited from higher proportional EBITDA from our Bradford County JV. Our Northeast volumes were up over 0.5 Bcf a day, a growth rate of over 8% in looking at 3Q of 2017 to 3Q of 2016 on all these operated systems. So this overall gathering growth was driven by both the Bradford Supply Hub and the Susquehanna Supply Hub growth. This growth was partially offset by lower Utica volumes. But again, just like we've talked about a little bit in the West, we were pleased to see the Utica volumes begin to turnaround, with sequential growth from 2Q of this year. And I would just note on that. Most of that turnaround in the Utica is actually on our Flint system which serves the dry Utica.", "So now, let's look at year-to-date and take a look at what happened in our year-to-date results. In spite of the hurricanes and the removal of $110 million from our NGL-Petchem EBITDA, Williams Partners still delivered year-to-date GAAP net income of $1.21 billion and we delivered adjusted EBITDA year-to-date of $3.32 billion, an $8 million improvement from the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to increased fee-based revenues, increased commodity margins, and an increase in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures and lower overhead expenses. Adjusted EBITDA from the retained businesses was up $118 million versus the same nine months in 2016 for our retained businesses, and so that is from the Atlantic-Gulf, West and Northeast G&P. So noisy as we got some of these asset sales coming out here on the year-to-date numbers, but overall really pleased to see the way our retained businesses are performing. Year-to-date coverage of WPZ is now 1.24, on the back of $2.1 billion in DCF. And this very solid coverage excludes the $175 million of EBITDA that is revenue amortization associated with the Barnett and Mid-Continent restructuring. So just to remind you on that, we include that earnings in the \u2013 obviously, in the EBITDA calculation, we included it in earnings but we pull that out of DCF.", "So now let's look at some of our recent achievements as we continue to build long-term sustainable growth in the business. Several of our recent achievements contributed directly to our performance this quarter, including two more of our five planned 2017 Transco expansions placed in service during the quarter; those would be Hillabee and Dalton. And on Atlantic Sunrise, we started construction and have already placed a portion of Atlantic Sunrise into early service on September 1 of this year, providing about 400,000 dekatherms a day of firm transportation service on Transco's existing mainline facilities, and of course that serve delivery points as far south as Choctaw County, Alabama. So we're really excited to be starting to see the Transco system turn around and be able to deliver volumes to the south. And I can tell you, that's very much needed as we're seeing a lot of demand growth occur in the southeast on our system.", "We are seeing exciting spurt of growth in the Haynesville. In August, we placed into service additional CO2 treating capacity. And as a result of customer activity and our increased treating capacity, volumes on the Haynesville system grew to 1.45 Bcf a day here in late October, and we now expect to see volume growth of over 30% this year in the Haynesville, making it our fastest growing basin this year across the Williams assets.", "Also, as many of you know, we also recently won new acreage dedications from Southwestern in West Virginia, and we agreed to provide up to 660 MMcf a day of processing capacity. And by the end of the third quarter, we were already processing an incremental 100 MMcf a day of Marcellus wet gas from this new dedication. And with the addition of this 100 MMcf a day, the exit rate for our 3Q 2017 OVM processing was approximately 540 MMcf a day, and Southwestern is rapidly growing their wet Marcellus volumes on this dedicated acreage, and we're really thrilled to have the opportunity to help them maximize the value of this prolific acreage. We've got a great relationship with Southwestern and the teams are working very well to maximize the value of that acreage.", "We also enjoyed significant achievements that we expect to contribute adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. The Transco New York Bay Expansion project was placed in service here on October 9, and this was the fourth of our five Transco planned expansion projects. Transco continue to push new expansion opportunities forward as well, receiving a favorable environmental assessment on the Gulf Connector Project and applying for a FERC certificate for Rivervale South to Market, a new fully contracted 190 MMcf a day Transco expansion to New York and New Jersey markets. It's just another project that is supplying both power demand and replacing fuel oil with cleaner and more affordable natural gas in that region.", "And now let's look at what's coming soon. Our commitment to continued growth is highlighted on this slide. Again, Virginia Southside II is our fifth Transco expansion project this year, and so we're really excited to see that conclude and looking forward to that coming on some time here in the fourth quarter. We placed Phase 1 of the Garden State Project in service in September as well. That's kind of a little bit of a bonus project on top of the five, and we will be placing that full project into service in the second quarter of next year. So that project is going well too.", "We briefly touched on our Southeastern Trail Project last quarter. We were pleased with the results of a successful binding open season. However, we are pursuing an even more strategic opportunity that will serve those open season customers and provide a strategic expansion that will serve the broader industry with direct connection of low-cost reserves to these growing demand centers. So we certainly heard from the market that they needed the additional supplies, and we're trying to utilize that demand to make even more strategic expansions. So certainly not going to step over the top of the great opportunity we have there, but we are taking our time here to make sure that we make the very most we can out of that very valuable southbound expansion capacity on Transco.", "In the Northeast, our big Susquehanna Supply Hub expansion remains on schedule, with an expected in-service date in late 2017. This expansion done for Cabot should drive higher volumes in Susquehanna, even ahead of the Atlantic Sunrise project. And this area just keeps on delivering growth, and we are already planning the next big expansion for this area.", "In Wyoming, we were able to bring more volumes on to our Wamsutter system after placing our Chain Lake compressor station into service in October. And this is another project that was done on-time, and actually this one under budget to meet the growing demand of a key customer there in the Washakie Basin. And we're already exploring additional expansion opportunities for Chain Lake with two other customers in the region, and this is really an interesting area where we're seeing an emerging new play be developed in an old field in that area that was originally completed with vertical completions and a real opportunity up there now for horizontal application to that area.", "With regard to guidance, our guidance for 2017 EBITDA and DCF remains firm, as does our previous distribution and dividend growth rate. We plan to announce our 2018 financial guidance with our fourth quarter 2017 financial results, and of course that will be in the first part of 2018. So as I wrap up, I'd emphasize we're pleased with the execution and our clear line of sight on long-term steady growth. After substantially reducing our direct exposure to commodities, our current business' steady growth is being driven by consistent fee-based revenue growth via long-term contracts, and we expect 2018 and 2019 to be exciting years as we finally see the bottlenecks in the Northeast clear to let the value of our long-term strategy be realized both in the Northeast and on our Atlantic-Gulf systems. So really pleased with the way things are looking right now in that area. And then finally I want to, again, thank Don Chappel for his great work at Williams and I wish him well in retirement, and I welcome John Chandler to this call as our CFO.", "And with that, I thank you very much and we'll turn it over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And our first question comes from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Good morning. The deal with Southwestern was much more incremental volume in that area than what I had originally modeled. Without getting into too much customer details, can you speak to whether you expect tariffs on that contract to be generally in the range of your existing tariffs there or if you had to take a material reduction to get the deal done?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Good question, Jean. I would tell you that the pricing on that was pretty similar to our earlier pricing. I think the area that we did provide some incentive on was for the Utica volumes. But we do have a great service offer up there and we certainly offered that because we have existing capacity there with OVM. So I would just tell you we're very pleased with the pricing on that and provides us a very high incremental return in that area. Having said that, of course we've invested a lot of money in the first place up there so you would expect those higher returns. So overall, I think we priced it about like we expected. It's just that we've got so much latent capacity to use there, that we've got a big incremental initial cash flows that come off of that business as a result of the available capacity we have in the area.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "That makes sense. So in terms of the EBITDA per Mcf range, it's sort of similar to what you had said at the Analyst Day?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yes. No change. That is a positive impact of what we showed there at Analyst Day.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Great, and that makes sense. And then as a follow-up. I know you probably can't comment too much more on Southeastern Trail. But is the way to think about it, that you have enough commitments for the low end of your volume options on the project and in what you're working on, is incremental volumes that maybe would go further on the system as well?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Maybe another way to think about it, I would just say we have a very attractive project that just utilizes the capacity on the system, and one that certainly rivals any other project that we have on the system from a return standpoint. But we really want to make sure, because there's very limited amount of that very precious capacity coming south, and the more capacity we do the more expensive it gets, and so it's kind of a reverse economies of scale on that just because it requires more and more capital investment as we expand that capacity. And so we want to make sure that we're getting everything we can out of that investment, including strategic benefits that would include connections to low-cost reserves. And so a great work by the team. We're really working well with a number of players on that. I would tell you I'm pretty optimistic, but the good news is we have the Southeastern Trail project if we choose to go forward with that. That is in hand and we're prepared to do that if we can't get the other deals done on a timely enough basis.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. That makes sense. So if you choose to do a larger volume project that would have higher costs, that you need to charge the same tariff to everyone, is that the balance that you're working on?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "No. It's a little more complex than that, but that's probably about as far as I want to go with it.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. No, it's fair. Thanks a lot. That's all for me.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Good morning.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Don, good luck in retirement. John, welcome aboard.", "John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I wanted to start off with the O&M. It seems like there was a bit of an uptick this quarter in the Northeast and in the Atlantic. And I just wanted to see if there was anything to this, if this is one-time in nature or seasonal or is this kind of a new run rate. Any color you can share there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Let me turn that to our COO, Michael Dunn.", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. First in the Northeast, a part of that was the true-up of a tax issue, and so I wouldn't say that that was obviously a run rate issue. But the majority of that Northeast was a portion of that as well as some additional work that we were doing for landslide mitigation that's not typical, and that's pretty lumpy work depending on when we see something we need to go out there and fix. So that's really what drove the issues in the Northeast.", "On the Atlantic-Gulf, and specifically on Transco, Alan touched on that earlier in his comment in regard to our integrity work that's underway there, and typically we see those costs every year rise in the third quarter because that's our opportunity to get the work done. And like a lot of our peers in the industry as well as our customer companies, there's a lot of integrity work underway across the U.S. on the natural gas infrastructure, and a lot of that's driven by either the regulations or the records reviews that a lot of companies are doing. And once you find issues within your records, and a lot of these pipes are quite old, and when you research those records you find that maybe you need to go out and do some hydro tests at some areas where you're not certain of the records covering the entire area where it was originally hydro tested.", "And so we've taken on a lot of that work this year and we would expect to see more of that work next year as we continue to go through those records as well as just our ongoing integrity management programs that we're undertaking across the assets. And that's really what we're seeing on the Transco system. I would say that quarter three is typically our higher quarter for spend, and you certainly can't extrapolate that across four quarters of a year to come up with an annualized number. It's pretty difficult if you look at our history, higher than third quarter.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "That's helpful. Thanks for that. And I just wanted to touch base on the Central Penn Line a little bit more. And any more thoughts or details you can provide around timing and if that could be something that comes online sooner or later or just any other details as far as that kind of mid-2018 in service I think you've talked about.", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. We're really pleased right now that we've started construction on the Central Penn Line, which is the key greenfield infrastructure for Atlantic Sunrise, and we are targeting at mid-2018 for completion of the work on that pipeline as well as our compressor stations. And I will tell you that obviously weather is a big factor there with the winter construction for the pipeline and compressor station, but we're off to a good start so far and we're still targeting, as far as our project teams are concerned, a mid-2018 in service date for the completion of the work. And then we'll be commissioning activities that occur after the mechanical completion of pipelines as well as the compressor stations. So as you are probably well aware, we typically risk-adjust the revenues that you would see coming through in our forecast. But right now, we're marching forward for a mid-2018 in service date for the facilities that we have underway right now.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "That's helpful. Thanks. And then just one last one. I was curious on your thoughts in what you're seeing with Northeast basis differentials and specifically some of the commentary we've been hearing from some of the producers regarding a potential volume curtailment given these tough differentials. Any thoughts you could share there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. We certainly did see some degree of curtailment like we often do during the shoulder months, and prices certainly were very depressed because there was very little local load. So if you think about what drives the volumes inside the circle, if you will, or within that region, the weather pattern was very mild there, and so very little local load there this third quarter which will obviously put a lot of pressure on basis. I think in addition to that, we had a lot of people building up reserve and expecting Rover to be on schedule, on-time, and that's hard to plan for when it moved as dramatically back as it did. So you probably had a lot of capital investment ahead of that that was too late to turn it back. So we probably had a little more production, a little more gas-on-gas competition, without any real exit from the area, just kind of moved the circle out a little bit but not really in each market.", "And so I think that it's going to take some of the projects that Colombia has and then ultimately Atlantic Sunrise, and of course finally when Rover gets in the first quarter, gets out into some new markets, to really see that ease. However, we always see here in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, if we get some normalized weather, we will see the basis differential flatten out just because the local load will be coming on. And in addition to that, I would say we are seeing some new power plant load that'll be coming on next year. And so those are all positive things that are moving us forward towards better basis differential, but certainly the third quarter is pretty painful and we did see some volume shut-ins on our systems.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "That's all very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thanks. First question is just coming back to the Atlantic Sunrise and the Central Penn Line now that you've gotten into construction a bit. I wonder if you can fine-tune your CapEx assumptions. We've thought of this as around $2.6 billion I think on a gross basis. Is that a good number for the project?", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. We still are holding at that number. We obviously keep some contingency within our project forecast to remedy any situations or issues that arise during construction. But we believe that's still a pretty good number.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. And then I know you're just starting to get this in service. But as you think about the 42-inch line I believe, is there an ability to increase the capacity beyond the 1.7 Bcf a day that you've put in there, and what are your thoughts on doing that as you see the demand to get out of the basin?", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "You know, as usual, we'll wait and see if there are enough demand for projects. We do have some other projects we're looking at as well, expanding out of the basin, and so I think it is a little bit to be determined. So if you think about other projects like Constitution, probably be determined, that'll probably be the next expansion. And so I think people would kind of wait and see on that. We also have another couple of other projects that we haven't provided any announcement on that we're working on, that could serve to get volumes out of the basin as well. So I'd say those probably go first and, as you know, we get the existing project we're working on built before we talk about expansions on another one, and so that's where we stand today. But in terms of its expandability, certainly physically there is expansion opportunity on the system.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. So that's helpful. And then I'd love a little bit more color please on the West. You mentioned the Haynesville really picking up and sounds like momentum into the fourth quarter. Is that the main driver of that 5% increase in volumes? And then how do we think about, call it, unit economics I guess if the Haynesville is where you're going to see an uptick as we move into 2018. Would that be positive or negative to your overall unit margins there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Great question. I would say in the West that the Haynesville is probably just slightly above our average on unit margins against all of our other West gathering business. And so it's a very attractive basin for us to see growth, especially at the level it's been growing, so that's very positive. The other part of your question was other areas. I think we had five of our western areas that we saw sequential growth in, and so we are seeing some turnaround in some of those areas. I would say the areas that probably we would expect to see growth \u2013 have the most impact would probably be the Haynesville, the Eagle Ford, and the Wamsutter area, particularly as we get into 2018 on Wamsutter because there's a lot of activity going on in that basin that will turn that around as well. So but I think that's probably about the best explanation I can give you on that. So overall though, I think as we mentioned last quarter, we were seeing some of those areas bottom out and start to turn around, and that's exactly what happened.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. Very helpful. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please go ahead.", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Good morning. I just wanted to check on the Geismar supply contracts. It's a little bit tough to parse out through the financials. Should we look for that to start up kind of on July 6 with the commencement or the closing of the sale? And if so, can you guys quantify what the impact was there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "I do not have that number for you. I think you can call Brett or John to get a little more detail on that. But you are correct, that that actual contract would've started there upon the sale of that asset. So, but bottom line, that plant is running well and we're serving with ethane volumes. Obviously a choppy quarter because of the hurricane, and we did have some impact on a couple of our pump stations on that system due to the hurricane. But overall, the relationship with NOVA is going very well and we're providing them a lot of ethane.", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. And I think you just alluded to kind of the 2018-plus outlook. But just in terms of the quarter-over-quarter step up on the processing side of things, was there a particular basin that really resulted in that, whether it's Niobrara, Piceance or was that more of a general uplift across the systems?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Well, yeah. You named two of the areas that saw some of that uplift. And as well as I mentioned, looking broader, OVM obviously saw a pretty good step up as well as the Southwestern volumes got added during the third quarter.", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. So for the Western segment processing volumes, mostly those two in terms of Piceance...?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, Piceance. We also saw WPX volumes in the San Juan Basin lift up a little bit as well. So we also saw some positive processing business from WPX as volumes raising in the San Juan Basin as well, so pretty well across the board. We saw a pretty good movement. Probably the one area that we didn't see much increase was in the Southwest Wyoming area, which is at our Opal facility.", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Great. All right. Thanks for that. I think I'll leave it there.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Good morning.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "I was just wondering if we can sort of talk \u2013 I realize you haven't put out a 2018 guidance and so forth. But I was wondering if you can sort of talk about the board discussions with respect to returning capital to shareholders? You get to a point where your leverage gets in line to be able to do so. And I was wondering if you're looking at dividend increases at WMB or are you also considering potentially buybacks of WMB or even WPZ?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Let me have John Chandler take that, Shneur.", "John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "I think the answer is, yes. I mean, we obviously are generating today around $100 million of excess cash at WMB above our dividend. And as we look forward, we have about $300 million, I think, or $400 million on a revolver, so we'll continue to pay that down over the next several quarters. And then as we look towards our dividend growth in the future and the excess cash we'll have at the WMB level, I think our guidance is the same that we've given in the past that, yeah, we'll look towards buying in WPZ units, even perhaps co-investing in projects if those opportunities existed or buying in WMB or a dividend increase. With all of those things, I think are on the table. We haven't carved any of those out. We, of course, are watching tax code changes too, and we don't expect that to happen until quite a distance in the future as we think about dividend increases. So that would kind of, I think, control what we did on the dividend front, but I don't think we've ruled out any of those options that you mentioned.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Cool. And then just as a quick follow-up question. Do you guys see an opportunity to expand Overland Pass either on a small scale with pumps or something much larger in scale?", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. There's a lot of new production coming on both in our Wamsutter area, in the Niobrara, both the Wyoming and DJ portion of the Niobrara, and of course the Bakken volumes that ONEOK gathers as well. So a lot of incremental demand for NGL capacity out of the area. And if you add to that an expectation of the ethane market and demand market growing, and expecting them to have to pull on ethane from these regions that today, while they have ethane recovery capability, there's not ethane takeaway capacity out of the area because the NGL lines are full. I think all of that leads to some expansion in the area, and certainly Overland Pass is very well-positioned to capture that expansion. So yes, a lot of activity going on on that front, and I think a lot of people are a bit surprised by the amount of volumes that are showing up coming out of these areas.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color, guys.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, everyone. I actually just want to start with some clarification questions. In the West, all of the wet areas, with the exception of Opal, contributed to the increase in processing volumes?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Well, I think we were talking earlier \u2013 Christine, we were talking sequentially.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Right, sequentially.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Let us provide some detail for you on that, Christine. I think the bottom line, we did see the Piceance pick up, we have seen the Niobrara picking up. And looking at kind of beginning of the quarter and to end of the quarter, the pretty dramatic increase in the Northeast as we mentioned. I realize your question is just to the West. But, really, I think the majority of the increases in the West were pretty moderate in terms of processing volume, and that's with the exception of the Southwest Wyoming area.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then with the compressor station coming on in Wyoming and the opportunities to work with two other producers as you mentioned during prepared remarks, should we think that the G&P volumes here, like in the Rockies area, is going to continue to increase or is it just going to maybe stabilize decline so that it's flat? How should we think about that?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Well if you're talking about overall West volumes, so maybe just narrowing it to the Wamsutter area, we certainly expect some increase going into 2018 there and, importantly, a lot of liquids volumes on both the condensate side, which we gather, as well as the gas and NGL side; there'll be quite a bit of growth there. If you broaden that question to the overall West, then I do think that we'll continue to see volume growth in the Haynesville even though we're going to get up on limitations of our capacity there pretty quickly in the Haynesville. We'll be looking for expansion opportunities on top of that. We're going to see the Eagle Ford continue to grow, and we are seeing growth in the Piceance as well and the Niobrara. Of course, that is offset by places like the Barnett and the Mid-Continent and, to a lesser degree, probably continued decline in the San Juan Basin as well. So I think that's the picture I would offer you there. But overall I mean, the Haynesville volume growth is very impressive. I wouldn't expect to see another 30% growth next year just because we're going to be so tapped out on capacity on our side, but we would expect growth from 2017 to 2018.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then I don't know if there's much more you could provide. But on the Southwestern deal, can you just give some background on how did that came together? Was that a little bit of a competitive process or did one of you approach the other? And can you give us an idea of how many more opportunities like that are still available?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Well we already have a very extensive relationship with Southwestern there because recall that was \u2013 a lot of that acreage was former Chesapeake acreage, and so we were already gathering a lot of that acreage but we weren't processing it. And so because recall Access didn't have a processing arm, and so that gas was gathered into competitors' processing systems. And so our relationship with Southwestern that we've been working on, where we reform contracts out there and made them much more attractive contracts than what they had under the former Access-Chesapeake arrangement that we announced earlier in the year, I would say started that relationship off on the right foot. We also provide services to Southwestern up in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and we've been very successful there helping them find excess capacity in that area as well. So I would tell you, our teams have worked really hard. They have a very dependable and reliable relationship with Southwestern, and I would say they form some contracts that are very aligned to both parties' interest. But it really spurred off of the fact that we had the opportunity to serve them and serve them well on the gathering side already is really what enabled that relationship to expand.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then just last question. Overland Pass. Can you remind us what the contract structure is there? Is that just based on a nomination basis?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "You mean in terms of who gets curtailed and who doesn't?", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Right. I just couldn't remember, like, when you guys started up that pipeline, if it was underpinned by some, like, level of MVCs or is it...?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "No. It's a tariff contract, and so it has FERC tariffs on it. And it has discounted rates from the original dedications that both ONEOK and Williams enjoy. In terms of the way the capacity is allocated, it looks back to prior periods to establish your allocation. So basically build allocation capacity with your flow rates, and so whoever's been in it the longest with the most volumes and the longest has the capacity allocation.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just a few follow-up questions to what has already been asked. First on Overland Pass, my recollection was that to expand that system you wouldn't really need pumps. It would be a loop of the pipeline because of how the pipeline is geographically located. Is that correct?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Generally, that is correct, Danilo. That's right. There's a little bit but there's very little available. It's running pretty full already.", "Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Do you have a sense, Alan, for what the investment opportunities could be for an expansion?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "We haven't put that out there. And I would tell you, there's a variety of options that our teams are pursuing right now. But it's a sizable investment but we haven't put a number out there on that.", "Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "And to the extent that that would go forward here, you would still be able to self fund your pro rata share with that growth?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yes.", "Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. And as a follow-up, I guess an extension of that question. Financially, you seem to have a lot of optionality here. Shneur I think asked a question with respect to capital allocation. Beyond considering a dividend increase or buybacks, what are you guys thinking with respect to M&A?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "I would just say we've got such a great portfolio right now of high-return investment opportunities, that anything we do has got to compete with that. And so I think we've got our heads down very focused on developing the business that we do have. I would say that in areas like the Northeast, there is a lot of value in the consolidation of some of the joint ventures in the Northeast and we continue to look at that as we have for quite some time, I would say. And we continue to have a bid-ask spread between us and the various partners up there. But ultimately, I think that's something that we would certainly like to see happen but we're going to be very disciplined in what that CapEx investment is. But I'd say that that is very right in terms of that happening. You've got motivated sellers and certainly a lot of value in consolidation on our side, particularly in terms of the reduction of capital investment required to serve the growing volumes in the area.", "Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you so much. Those are my questions.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thank you, Danilo.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning. Just as a clarification. You talk about the buybacks and such, and you mentioned during your comments that you're generating enough cash, you don't see yourself needing to access the equity markets. I know that's been the case for 2017. Is that something you foresee continuing into 2018 and beyond or is that too much of a stretch for right now?", "Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "No, that is exactly \u2013 and previously we've said for the next several years. But I can tell you, and looking at our long range planning, we don't see a need for that. So we think we've got a growth rate that's very sustainable with the combination of both retained capital and debt capacity while maintaining some strong credit mix. So feeling very good about the capitalization right now and continuing to fund the growth that we have in front of us.", "Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. And if I think about spending in terms of next year, and I recognize you may not want to give too much detail, but we've got basically the remainder of Atlantic Sunrise, we may see a start up of some of the Northeast supply enhancement CapEx I would guess \u2013 that's another big project \u2013 and then you had talked in the Analyst Day slides about a potential $500 million of annual growth capital in the Northeast. With the agreement with Southwestern Energy, is that something in the $500 million range next year do you think? And how does that fall out? Is there a sense that you can give us as far as maybe a dip in CapEx or how that looks going into 2018?", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "We're not providing guidance on that. But I would just tell you what we provided at Analyst Day, both in terms of those continued opportunities as well as the opportunities in the Northeast, continue to be pretty in line with what we're seeing in terms of growth opportunities for the future, so kind of steady as she goes and no big surprises there. I will tell you that we're in a very nice position to be allocating to the very best capital opportunities, and we're maintaining very high returns as a result of that. And so we do have a whole lot of opportunities, but we're being pretty disciplined about what we're investing in.", "Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "And then I guess lastly, I guess in the timeline, and maybe this is just sort of a theoretical question, but you mentioned about next year and how you're thinking about tax reform and how that could impact some of your decisions. At some point, do you reach a point where you say okay, we can wait on Washington and see how they come out with tax reform or are there options at some point in terms of a timeline where you say we might want to take an action and we don't necessarily want to wait for full clarification from Washington on tax reform?", "John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "No. I think in all cases, using tax code today and the amount of capital spend that we've got, we've got a fairly long window still, a period that we don't view that we'll have cash taxes at WMB. So I think we've got a long period that we can kind of wait to see this unfold. So hopefully that answers \u2013 we're not motivated to do anything quickly on that front.", "Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Shere Craig (sic) [Craig Shere] with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Good morning, Craig.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Alan, you've talked about a number of incremental growth opportunities kind of in line with Analyst Day. Are you still saying in total with what's already disclosed and what is kind of out there on the horizon and the aggregates of 7 times EBITDA multiple on all the pending projects out, say, through the end of the decade?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yes. I would say the returns that we've talked about on Transco, in that range, and as well the very high incremental return I'm always quick to point out in the Northeast because we can't forget about the capital we had to invest to get those opportunities. But that is continuing to be the case in these regions where we have very strong competitive advantages. So I don't really see that changing at all right now.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. And can you comment on the potential size and timing of additional West segment Wamsutter system expansion?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. I would say the Chain Lake expansion that we did was relatively small; I think it was right around $50 million. And so I would tell you the plans are getting bigger out there for some of the players out there. Their appetites are getting pretty big, and so we're watching that very closely and we're beginning to plan alternatives with the producers out there in the area. So I do think there's going to be continued investments of probably that size and larger as we expand the facility. But remember, we have a very large condensate handling business there already that can handle a lot of that, but we also have a lot of latent capacity at our Wamsutter processing plant. So just like in the Northeast where we've got these higher incremental returns, we're enjoying the same kind of thing in the Northeast because we have that latent capacity sitting there at our Echo Springs processing complex.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "I know you all asked the FERC to kind of take some proactive steps on Constitution. Any updates there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Continued great work by our team. Chad Zamarin, who has been heading up our efforts there with the federal agencies, has had some very productive meetings and continuing to push the ball forward on that. And so I would just say stay tuned. It's a pure upside to our plan, but we're encouraged by some of the commentary that we've got coming out of there. But still a relatively long put when you're having to fight a state as hard as we're going to have to fight that state to win that battle. So plenty of fight left in this dog and I think we're well-positioned for what we've got. We will have a fight I suspect.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "In terms of timing to see how some of these steps kind of unfold, are you thinking that by first quarter we could have more substantive detail?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yes, I think that's a realistic timing if not before to know kind of the next step there anyway.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. And last question. Can you speak to the impact across your system from the recognizing of extremely nominal direct commodity exposures? But there's been much stronger propane pricing and we're hearing word of ethane recovery just starting to kick in in the fourth quarter here. Can you speak to the impacts of those across your system?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Sure. On the propane pricing, I would say that we do have some pretty attractive hedges in place here for the fourth quarter, and we've got a little bit going into the first quarter, propanes and some of our heavies. So I think we've got pretty good margins coming through on that. But as you know, it's just gotten to be such a relatively small piece of our overall business, that's not all that big. On the ethane front, I think we have about 50,000 barrels a day that we could be recovering that is not unrecovered. But as I mentioned earlier, some of that is back behind pipelines that are constrained like Overland Pass. Some of it is not, however, in the Gulf Coast, and so we could see some pull through. In fact we are seeing some ethane recovery but I think the margin will just be as high as it needs to get to pull the ethane in until we see ethane get really short, which I think we could see, and then it's going to have to drive a margin high enough to pull in and build capacity on things like Overland Pass for those barrels.", "So I suspect that's going to take a little bit for the market to really realize it's going to have to pay up for that ethane before it comes on. So we'd expect some to and fro in the ethane market as it tries to grab more capacity or more productive capacity. So some exposure but I would say we've got hedges on kind of in the mid-80 range on propanes here in the fourth quarter that will dampen some of that dollar of propane that you've seen it spike up to here and there.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. And just a final follow-on to that. More fundamentally from a volumetric standpoint, subject of course to the debottlenecking process in the Northeast, are you starting to see increasing interest from producer customers in the wet gas Utica and Marcellus areas that could kind of feed that very long-term opportunity discussed at Analyst Day?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yes. I think the areas that we're seeing right now that's most focused on is the dry Marcellus, the dry Utica, and the wet Marcellus. But probably I would say in order of economics right now because of the NGL whip that you mentioned just a while ago, we're seeing a lot of push into the wet Marcellus right now. And of course, the dry Marcellus is just such a terrific resource up in the Northeast, that we're going to continue to see that area grab any kind of capacity it can just because the margins are so high on that. I would say the one area that we've seen pull back a little bit is the rich Utica or the wet Utica is the one area we've seen pull back a little bit relative to the other opportunities.", "Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.", "Great. Appreciate the color.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on I guess the Southwestern contract. It sounds like you're using existing infrastructure to meet that contract right now. But do you think there is a potential to add, I guess, additional processing or frac capacity to meet that contract as volumes ramp?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "I'm going have Michael Dunn take that one, Sharon.", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Good morning. At our Oak Grove facility, we currently have one TXP unit there and a portion of a second one that was built a while back, so we have latent capacity in the first one that will be filled and we do think that TXP-2 will be under construction sometime next year as well to handle that capacity. So there is some incremental CapEx there but a portion of that's already been spent with the portion that was already built, so I would see certainly some capital expenditures contributed to that effort. There's still capacity in some of our frac there, so I think we're okay for now on that in that regard, but certainly would expect to see some processing capacity expansion at Oak Grove next year.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And TXP-2, is that another 200 MMcf?", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Volume? Yes.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And just for the quarter, it looks like Northeast's CapEx ramped up pretty significantly sequentially. Was there a specific project tied to that spending?", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. That's primarily some of the work we're doing for Southwestern with the agreement we had earlier this year. But the majority of it is for the Genesis expansion up in Northeast Pennsylvania to support Cabot in regard to their production coming online next year. So we would expect that that ramps up obviously in the fourth quarter this year as well. Just finishing up that work. We've got a couple of compressor stations under construction there as well as some pipeline interconnects and pipeline systems being built to support that expansion.", "Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Sharon.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Alex S. Kania - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Good morning. I guess this question is in regard to the West and related to the asset impairment I guess for the 10-Q. There is some discussion on a potential sale of some kind of assets in that segment. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on that?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "John, would you take that one?", "John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Sure. I don't think we'd contemplate selling anything right now. We were approached I guess I should say on some assets in that market that made us look at some type curves again and re-evaluate the value of those Mid-Con assets. One comment I do want to make in that the write-down was a $1 billion write-down, but our estimate of fair value has not changed materially quarter-to-quarter for those assets. Those assets were actually written up, the book value of those assets were written up back in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe when we acquired the Access assets. Got it at a very different pricing environment, and of course that's materially changed today. So actually, during the quarter our fair value estimates for these assets have changed very insignificantly. What has changed is the overall view of undiscounted cash flows, and they fell a little bit below our carrying value that the assets carried on for our books, which made us write them down to fair value. So I just want to make it clear. We don't have a change of view relative to the assets for the quarter that they changed by $1 billion.", "Alex S. Kania - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay.", "John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "At the end (01:04:30) cash flow. It's just happen to fall below that book value during the quarter.", "Alex S. Kania - Wolfe Research LLC", "Great. That makes sense. Thanks.", "John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the program back over to Alan.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks everybody for the great questions. Really excited to see the kind of top line growth we saw this quarter from our retained businesses and very excited about the growth opportunities that are in front of us right now, and look forward to a strong fourth quarter here as well as we continue to see the projects that we've been putting online continue to contribute.

Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners Fourth Quarter 2017 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including a slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn; and our CFO, John Chandler.", "In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also, included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.", "And so, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Great. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, John. First of all, I'll just say these are going to be a little longer comments than usual, just because there are a lot of issues that we want to discuss this morning, so I'm going to jump right in.", "I'm going to begin by saying how pleased I am with the organization's strong execution in 2017. A lot of notable achievements. We safely, and in timely manner, delivered on Transco's Big 5 projects, which was Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, Dalton, New York Bay, and the Virginia Southside II. And we exceed the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA, and actually exceeded the top end of the range for distributable cash flow and cash coverage ratios. And finally, we were able to bring CapEx spending in slightly below the midpoint of the range.", "Our teams achieved these impressive results, which include improvement in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA for both the fourth quarter and the full-year 2017 despite the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Nate, and while executing crisply on $2.3 billion in asset sales. And if you go back to September 2016, it's actually $3.3 billion in asset sales.", "As you'll recall, a strong foundation was laid with the financial repositioning we executed in January of 2017, which positioned the company to fund our attractive slate of fully contracted, large-scale expansion projects without the need to access public equity markets for projects included in our current forecast. And now, we're providing further insight into 2018 where we look forward to a full-year revenue contribution from our Big 5, as well as contributions from our Atlantic Sunrise project, when it is placed online later this year, along with the associated growth in the Northeast gathering volumes upstream of that.", "We are as excited as ever about our opportunities across the asset base, which we see driving continued growth for 2019 and beyond. And so, for today's relatively long call, we're going to hit a recap of our performance for fourth quarter and full-year 2017; we're going to hit the 2018 financial guidance; and we're going to take a brief look at the types of opportunities we see driving our growth into 2019 and beyond. And just to remind you, we are planning an Analyst Day event in May, where we'll dive deeper into our growth drivers for the future.", "But, for now, let's move on to slide 2 and review the fourth quarter. So, according to our GAAP results, which included some large onetime events related to the recent federal income tax reform, Williams' C-Corp level reported fourth quarter net income of more than $1.6 billion, a $1.7 billion improvement from fourth quarter 2016. This large improvement was driven primarily by the re-measurement of Williams' deferred tax liabilities to reflect anticipated lower future tax payments. And this resulted in a $1.9 billion gain at the GAAP level.", "But it's not quite that simple when it comes to the impact of Tax Reform, as we also had to take a $713 million non-cash charge at WPZ related to Tax Reform for Transco and Northwest Pipeline. I'll go further into the Tax Reform impact on the regulated pipelines a bit later. But for now, I'll just say that, generally speaking, we had to book an estimated regulatory liability of $713 million for possible future impacts on our cost-of-service rates, resulting from this Tax Reform bill.", "Even though this is a big number, it's likely to only affect our future actual cost-of-service rate case calculations by relatively small annual amounts, as it gets spread over a period that could be 20 years or more and is one of the many variables that impacts the ultimate rates that we charge for our max rate tariff service. To that point, given higher integrity expenses and maintenance capital expenses at Transco, we still expect to file a rate increase on our cost-of-service rates, even after taking into account the effect of this change in the tax liability.", "So let's move to the performance of the business in the fourth quarter, where WPZ's adjusted EBITDA was up $84 million, or 8% when you exclude the NGL/Petchem businesses that we've sold. This increase was driven mostly by our more than $100 million increase in fee-based revenues. These came primarily in the Atlantic-Gulf and our West segments.", "And with that, let's move on to slide 3 to look at the full year of 2017. So even for the full year, those large fourth quarter Tax Reform related items played a key role for the GAAP results. But there were a few other drivers, including about $1.3 billion in gains we had on the Geismar and Permian JV sales.", "And then looking at adjusted EBITDA, WPZ was up over $200 million or about 5% versus 2016 when you exclude the former NGL/Petchem businesses that we sold.", "You can see in the graph where all three of the segments show improvement for the full year. Atlantic-Gulf saw increased adjusted EBITDA driven by the Transco expansion projects and increased volumes in the Eastern Gulf, partially offset by higher O&M expenses, as we continue to do quite a bit of asset integrity work and hydro testing on the main lines along the Transco system.", "For the full year of 2017, results for the West benefited from lower cost. Growth in basins like the Haynesville and higher commodity margins, that were partially offset by the loss of results from the sell and trade of our DBJV trade with Western Gas and Anadarko.", "And the Northeast realized added benefits from the growth in the Bradford area with increased ownership from the various Bradford County systems that came with that trade I just mentioned. Positive results on our Susquehanna and Ohio River systems were offset by lower volumes in the rich Utica and our non-operated interest in the UEOM joint venture. So up there in the rich Utica area, we continue to see declines in that area. And as you'll recall, we own both a rich gas gathering system and then we own a 62% interest in a non-operated interest in UEOM up there.", "In the Northeast, we've consistently spoken of 2017 and 2018 as transitional years for Northeast volumes. During 2017, we started to see step changes in takeaway capacity in the Southwest part of the play that are beginning to unlock the growth potential of these unmatched natural gas reserves. And of course, we've also seen a lift in NGL prices in that area that's really spurred a lot of drilling in the Southwestern part, in the rich part of the Marcellus play.", "Moving on here to slide 4. Here, we've recapped some of our recent achievements as we continue to build long-term sustainable growth in the business. It certainly was an impressive quarter and full year for the Transco team. The Big 5 projects that we've referenced many times added approximately 25% pipeline capacity to Transco, which is saying something given the size of Transco to start with. The final two of the Big 5 projects, New York Bay and Virginia Southside, were placed into service as planned in the fourth quarter.", "Also in the fourth quarter, our West team saw higher volumes in 8 of the 10 gathering franchises, led by continued growth in the Haynesville.", "In the Northeast, our exit rate gathering volumes were up 600 million a day or 9% over 2016, as the debottlenecking of the Northeast is just getting started. And a portion of this volume growth is contributing to higher utilization of our Ohio Valley midstream processing capacity, where we now expect to expand that facility by an additional 400 million a day supported by strong customer volume commitments and driven by this continued rich Marcellus drilling activity.", "We've already seen the impact of the five major projects this year, which added over 2.8 Bcf a day of new capacity. And this was really on \u2013 these projects are demand-driven projects on Transco. And this new capacity enabled Transco to set one-day and three-day delivery records in January. All of this is before we realized the benefits of the most significant expansion in Transco's history, the Atlantic Sunrise project, which continues to make great progress.", "We have been dealt a challenging winter on the Atlantic Sunrise project. But a tremendous effort by our team managing the many contractors involved has kept this project on track, and importantly, in compliance with the many environmental regulations controls required up there.", "Certainly been no easy task for the team. But today, we are greater than 30% complete on the pipeline segment, and importantly, greater than 40% complete on the compressor station. So difficult winter conditions up there, but team's really been working it hard, and importantly, as I mentioned, really paying attention to the permitting requirements that are on us up there.", "We are targeting a July start-up for the mainline portion, with the greenfield compression likely taking a few months longer than that. Our LNG-related story continues as well, as the Gulf Connector has begun construction. And we're targeting the first quarter of 2019 for the in-service date for this 475 million a day addition to our Gulf Coast LNG delivery system.", "So we really have built out quite a delivery system along the Gulf Coast, being able to serve all the growing LNG. And Gulf Connector will be the second big addition to that.", "We also made the FERC certificate application on Gateway, a project that recently moved from the potential project list to full execution. And we continue to look at the potential to enhance Southeastern Trail.", "I'll remind everyone that we do have a binding shipper commitment that make a very attractive project for us on a standalone basis. But we are hoping to combine this with other customer needs to make another very significant large scale and strategic expansion on Transco that would be right on the heels of the Atlantic Sunrise expansion.", "Turning to the West. You may remember we spoke about the Chain Lake expansion in Wyoming during our third quarter call. Today, I'm pleased to update that we placed an additional Chain Lake expansion project into service in January, as we continue to add volumes on our Wamsutter system in Wyoming. So all in all, a great quarter with significant accomplishments across a variety of fronts.", "And with that let's move on to slide 5. I'm not going to spend too long on this slide, but it's an important and notable wrap-up reference regarding our 2017 performance versus guidance. All good news here with beats on all our key performance metrics and great progress on our leverage metrics as well. We continue to deliver not only on our operational metrics, but on our financial objectives as well.", "One thing I'd like to note here relative to debt, you can see our actual net debt to adjusted EBITDA came in well below the guidance. And on PZ, it came in about 3.5x, and on WMB at about 4.4x, which you can see is well below what we were targeting. You need to add about 0.3 or 0.4 to the actual number when estimating the rating agency calculation. And if you do that, this gets you up to about a 3.85 ratio on PZ and about a 4.75 at WMB on a consolidated basis.", "So just to be clear on that, we're excited about that, and certainly, we achieved better than we were hoping to for the year. But I would just remind you that we will see that creep up a bit here in 2018 as spending wraps up on Atlantic Sunrise, ahead of the full cash flow coming on. And then we expect that to come right back down as those cash flows come on.", "So overall, really great news on the credit metrics. And we'll continue to drive our strength in our balance sheet.", "Now, let's move on to slide 6 and take a look at our 2018 financial guidance. There will likely be some surprise at our adjusted EBITDA range, which has a midpoint of $4.55 billion, but as we'll see on the next slide, our year-to-year comparison on guidance has recently been hit by about $150 million of unusual noncash items that are driven by how regulatory accounting practices treat the new lower taxes and new GAAP revenue recognition standards that were applied to some amortized cash flows. Neither of these items impacts actual cash we will receive from customers in 2018. So, I want to stress that this really is driven by these accounting practices.", "Our base businesses look set to deliver guidance of about $4.7 billion prior to these items, which is a $300 million increase or about 7% on an apples-to-apples basis. So, what's this $150 million of noncash items about? Well, first of all, the new GAAP revenue recognition rules require us to spread out some of our deferred revenue for contracts that we've already received payment on over about 10 years longer than the old rules, and that dropped the 2018 adjusted EBITDA by about $120 million. And then, we also saw about $30 million in 2018 Tax Reform impact. Most of that comes on to Northwest Pipeline via regulatory accounting charges due to the Tax Reform, even though the revenues we receive from our customers won't change during this current rate cycle.", "Again, we'll look at the bridge on the next slide. Moving to DCF, we have a range of $2.9 million to $3.2 billion, and the midpoint of the range represents an 8% growth over 2017. Our dividend and distribution growth rates, related cash coverage, and leverage metrics are all consistent with the guidance we provided this time last year. And now, a year later out, we believe these growth rates will continue as we look out over the next two years. You will also note more specificity on the timing of growth through the year.", "At WPZ, we expect to increase distributions each quarter, so those will be quarterly raises. While at WMB, we expect to raise the dividend on just an annual basis. So, once each year. So, to be clear on that front, we'll be recommending a 13% dividend increase to be paid in March to the WMB board here in the near future with the same dividend level being recommended for June, September, and December, resulting in this 13% increase at WMB, which comes in slightly above the midpoint from our guided growth rate last year. We expect the WPZ raise to be right in the middle of the range of that 5% to 7% range that we talked about last year.", "We expect to maintain strong coverage at both WPZ and WMB, and the leverage metrics will remain at healthy levels, although we do expect the levels, as I've just mentioned, to rise a little bit as we spend on Atlantic Sunrise here in the near term. Coverage at WMB of approximately $100 million per quarter will be used to continue paying down the WMB revolver here in the first part of the year, and we continue to evaluate the best use of that excess cash flow at WMB post the revolver paydown, which will come in the second half of the year.", "So, let's take a closer look at that build-up for 2018 adjusted EBITDA now on slide 7. First of all, begin with the big pieces. By virtue of our sell of the Geismar olefins facility in July of 2017, you can see the $72 million step down there. That's just the EBITDA that was associated with that business. We expect a solid $300 million increase from our continuing businesses, with significant growth driven by Transco's expansion projects, partially offset by the loss of the Hadrian volumes on Discovery.", "We also expect strong growth in volumes and EBITDA out of our Northeast G&P business. Susquehanna Supply Hub is poised to make significant contributions as expansion work currently underway will wrap up in the first quarter. The end service of Atlantic Sunrise will lead to significant volume growth at both Susquehanna and Bradford County systems, but we are not counting on this until the later part of 2018. And recently, executed contracts combined with new business, we are currently finalizing will contribute to very strong Ohio River Supply Hub growth.", "The continued growth in our business and asset integrity work is leading to modestly higher operating expenses in 2018, as you can see. So, wrapping that up, $300 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is approximately a 7% growth rate year-over-year when comparing results from the continuing businesses leads us to about a $4.7 billion what would be EBITDA before the impacts of these non-cash new GAAP revenue recognition and Tax Reform impacts.", "As I discussed earlier, the key impact of the new accounting standard was to spread out the recognition of the prepayments we received in 2016 associated with Barnett and Mid-Con contract restructuring. If you recall, those were on gathering contracts that we had with Chesapeake that now primarily are Total contracts and reducing revenue recognized in 2018 and 2019, but increasing revenue recognized beyond 2019 versus what we expected on the old accounting standard.", "If you'll recall, it really was just driven by the fact that the period of the MVC was the period that we were amortizing that period over the new accounting standards require us to smooth that out over the entire life of the contract, not just the period that had the MVC impact. The impact on 2018 is about $120 million, less revenue being recognized under the current standard than we would have recognized operating under the old standard", "We want to get in the habit of providing multi-year guidance, however, we do expect an even stronger level of growth in 2019, particularly in Northeast G&P, and of course, on Transco. Given the timing around Atlantic Sunrise and the significance of that project as well as other projects we brought on in 2017 and 18, we thought it would be helpful to give you at least a glimpse here into what we expect coming off of Transco into 2019.", "So, let's move on to slide 8 and take a closer look at how Transco's adjusted EBITDA is growing over the next couple of years. So, here, as we dive deeper into what is going on with Transco, it's clear growth in Transco will be driven by negotiated rate expansion projects, and there is strong growth coming in the future. Let's begin with the impact of a full year of revenue from the 2017 Big 5 projects. Note that in 2017, we only had $140 million partial year impact of the Big 5 projects that were placed in service during the year. And in 2018, on top of that $140 million, we'll see an incremental $110 million.", "In 2017, we did have a significant step up in expenses, primarily due to necessary pipeline integrity and maintenance programs. We placed a high priority on safe operations and on proper maintenance and the cost of what you see coming through in our results in 2017. In 2018, you can see the full $250 million impact of the Big 5 when you add the $140 million partial year and $110 million \u2013 sorry, that was in 2019. And you also begin to see the impact of Atlantic Sunrise and Garden State here in 2018 with a partial-year contribution of $140 million after going into service in 2018. We also expect a big increase in Transco during 2019. So, as you can see here, these are some of the drivers. First of all, the effect of a full-year revenue from Atlantic Sunrise is captured here, as you see full-year impact of $425 million in EBITDA, resulting from a $285 million increase in 2019 on top of the $140 million contribution in 2018.", "And finally, as I mentioned earlier, Transco is also working on its next rate case. And I know there's a lot \u2013 high interest in this topic particularly with the recently enacted Tax Reform law. So, I wanted to talk you through what we think that process might look like as well. First, I want everyone to understand that the negotiated rate contracts Transco has are not subject to change with this rate case. Tax Reform will have no impact on these contracts. Those are firm fixed contracts and both parties agree on a fixed rate on front end for the term of those contracts.", "Most of our major expansions are covered by negotiated rate contracts. And in fact, by the time Atlantic Sunrise is in service, we expect Transco to be comprised of roughly 50% negotiated rates and 50% cost-of-service-based rates. It's the cost-of-service-based rates that are subject to changes with each of Transco's rate cases. Second, from a timing standpoint, we expect to make our initial rate filing in August, and we expect the revenue impact of new cost-of-service rates to be primarily a 2019 event.", "And then third, I want to discuss the factors that affect the actual value of a new cost-of-service rate. Certainly, operating expenses are intended to be recovered in the cost-of-service rates. So, for example, the increased expenses that we've been incurring on Transco from pipeline integrity and reliability improvements will be accounted for and recovered in our next round of cost-of-service rates. I would tell you that we've continued to have a lot of work to be done in this to keep the system safe. And so, you do see that cost continuing here for some time. Also, the maintenance capital spent on Transco goes directly into the rate base, and Transco will earn a return on that capital. So, these items would work to push our cost-of-service rates up from where they stand today.", "The Tax Reform Act has also generated lower corporate tax rates, which will also be a factor. There are two primary ways that the lower corporate tax rates will impact the pipeline's rates. First is simply the lower cost that lower tax rates represent the provision in our rates for current and future taxes will be lower and now that the corporate tax rates decreased, so that's kind of a forward-looking piece.", "The second impact is represented in the non-cash regulatory charge and related regulatory liability, which you saw when we discussed the fourth quarter results earlier in the call. This liability represents an estimate of the value that will be returned to shippers to account for the deferred portion of income tax provisions that we've collected in the past on Transco's rates. This liability will be amortized off of Transco's books and realized by cost-of-service shippers over an extended period of time, which could be as long as 20 years or even more.", "So, the rate making process on Transco for the cost-of-service contracts will likely be in negotiation that takes all of these factors into consideration as we jointly determine the fair cost-of-service rates for our max rate tariffs. So, in summary, taking all of these items into account, along with other impacts to the cost-of-service model, Transco does still expect to file for an increased cost-of-service rate in our upcoming August 2018 rate filing.", "So, now, moving on to slide 9. As we've shown, we have impressive growth in the next couple of years, largely from long-term fully contracted and fixed rate demand charges on a regulated pipeline, and the expected pull-through under our existing gathering contracts. Beyond these near-term growth drivers, our natural gas focused strategy and competitively positioned assets will likely capture even more growth in 2019 and beyond.", "And it's important to remember that Transco's fully contracted growth doesn't end with Atlantic Sunrise. And, in fact, we have a committed backlog of seven fully contracted projects that will go into service in 2019 and beyond, currently led by our largest of these, the Northeast Supply Enhancement project with commitments on that project mostly from subsidiaries of National Grid. We've applied for the FERC certificate and the FERC is currently working on the environmental impact statement. We are targeting a late 2019 in-service date for the project. But consistent with past practice, we include some additional time when forecasting revenue and EBITDA growth into our future business plans.", "Beyond this fully committed projects, I want to update you on the large portfolio of potential interstate transmission opportunities we are pursuing. At our 2017 Analyst Day, we discussed approximately 20 projects, which we were pursuing at that time. Since that time, 3 of these 20 projects have moved out of this bucket and moved from potential to customer committed. So, we've made great progress on those projects. Rivervale South to Market. And the Gateway project moved into full execution with FERC certificate application filed. And the Southeastern Trail project now has binding customer commitment, as I mentioned earlier. But new opportunities continue to emerge. And, in fact, the potential project list has now been backfill and now stands at over 20 projects.", "Moving to the Northeast Pipeline infrastructure build-out, we'll continue to unleash the power of the gas reserves in the Marcellus and the Utica. Based on our customer commitments and new activity, we now expect to expand our Ohio Valley Midstream processing capacity, which I'll remind you includes the Fort Beeler processing facility or complex as well as the Oak Grove complex. And we expect that combined capacity to increase by 400 million a day, which will take us up to over 1.1 Bcf a day on that processing complex.", "We also have discussions underway for a sixth major expansion of the Susquehanna Supply Hub. And in addition, we expect to complete the fifth expansion this quarter. So, a lot of that's already online, but we do have one remaining compressor station and a few loops we're putting online there. But really impressive how the Susquehanna Supply Hub and our work with both Cabot and Southwestern continues to expand our volumes up here.", "In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we also are seeing great growth opportunities, especially in 2020 and beyond. First of all, modifications to our Eastern Gulf assets to serve the new dedicated volumes from Shell's major Norphlet play are under construction, and so we're well underway with that. And just to remind you, we've been installing a lot of those facilities, and Shell has been reimbursing us for those. And so, we're really excited about seeing the impact of that, that'll come on likely in 2020.", "We're also very excited about our recent announcements from Shell on their Whale prospect and Chevron on their Ballymore prospect. Here, a few weeks ago, both these major prospects got announced. And just to kind of pin that down a little closer for you, the Whale prospect is within 15 miles of our Perdido oil and gas export pipeline, which come up onto Shell's Perdido facility. And the Ballymore prospect is within 3 miles of Chevron's Blind Faith platform, where our Mountaineer oil pipeline and our Canyon Chief gas pipeline already served Chevron in these areas.", "So, we do expect both of these major discoveries to drive significant free cash flows increases in 2020 and beyond. And finds such as Ballymore and Whale are clear indications that Deepwater developments remain highly commercial. And Williams is in the absolute right spot in both the Eastern and Western Gulf to benefit.", "And drilling activity in Wyoming is going to continue to drive growth in our gathering and processing volumes in both the Wamsutter and the Niobrara field. In fact, right on the heels of the two Chain Lake expansions I mentioned earlier, now comes another expansion opportunity in the Wamsutter for an additional customer in this emerging play. So, we continue to see a lot of activity going on out here in the Wamsutter field.", "We also continue to see volume growth in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville. And this activity demonstrates the value of our strategy to be in the right spots, in the best basins, and to be a large-scale competitive player in whatever basins we're in.", "We see very attractive long-run return on capital from our Western gathering and processing footprint. And that return on invested capital will be extended by the latest round of this customer activity.", "So now, I'll wrap it up here. Williams is committed to executing the plans that we've laid for our shareholders and customers and to expanding our business in a manner that generates sustainable shareholder value. The result of strong execution in 2017 included generating healthy cash coverage that supports investments in our attractive portfolio of growth projects, while significantly strengthening our balance sheet.", "Williams realized a $3.3 billion reduction in consolidated net debt during the year. And through disciplined capital investing, we drove an important improvement in our return on capital employed, which has become really a key focus not just from the management team, but obviously that was driven by the board. And I would tell you that that's become front and center in our decisions as we look at our business.", "And as we do look ahead to our plans to expand the business, I want to reiterate that Williams has achieved full self-funding. We do not need to issue any public equity at WMB or at PZ to fund our stated forecasted capital projects through our full planning horizon. We're able to do this while maintaining a strong balance sheet and leverage metrics and healthy coverage of both WPZ distributions and WMB dividends.", "WMB shareholders are now positioned to benefit from a $1.9 billion reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which will manifest itself through an extended period of cash tax deferral. Williams does not expect to be a cash federal income tax payer through at least 2021, and this could be potentially longer of course, depending on our future capital spending opportunities. And we'll experience much lower taxes being paid when that deferral period does ultimately end.", "So we're excited about where we are with the company today. We're excited about where we're going. We think we are extremely well-positioned financially. We've got the operating capabilities that we need. And strategically, we think we're positioned better than anybody in the space when it comes to taking advantage of these low-cost natural gas reserves that continue to expand and grow demand in our both U.S. and international markets.", "So I thank you for your time today. And with that I'll turn it over to the operator for our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Good morning.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Want to start off with Northeast gathering and processing there. And the O&M had stepped up a bit quarter-over-quarter there. I was wondering if you could dive in a bit more on some of the drivers there. And also just expanding on the segment, in general, if you could just refresh us as far as activity rig count in your area and kind of what gives you the confidence as far as the growth into 2018.", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Good morning. This is Michael Dunn. I'll take that question. In regard to the expenses in the Northeast, I will tell you, from an enterprise perspective, let's talk about that first. We look at improvements in our operating margin across the entire enterprise in each one of our operating areas. And we drill that down to the franchise level within each one of those operating areas. So we have set goals for the organization to improve those targets on our operating margin.", "In the Northeast specifically, obviously, we're seeing significant growth up there. We're adding a number of facilities, whether it be compression or pipeline facilities that includes additional employees but additional operating costs that come along with that, whether they be electric power for our facilities as well as the costs that go along with that. So we're seeing really strong growth in our revenues up there. And correspondingly, with that growth, we're seeing increase in our cost.", "Specifically in the Northeast, we saw the new compression facilities that came online, our new employees. I mentioned the additional electric cost. But we also had emergent work in West Virginia, dealing with longwall coal mines that are underground coal mines that we actually have to go out and mitigate the pipelines that are above those coal mines, so that we don't have any operational issues. So we target those, and we typically know where those are going to occur. And we work with the coal mine companies to mitigate that. But that does increase our expense there. And also avoidance of impacts from land movement in primarily West Virginia.", "We did have some emergent overhauls at our Fort Beeler facility as well that were unanticipated that increased our costs there. We did have a pension lump sum settlement too, that obviously is adjusted out of our GAAP earnings, but \u2013 our GAAP numbers, but those obviously affected us there. That actually lowers our costs going forward in the future but had a onetime impact on our business.", "So I would say, in the Northeast specifically, we are seeing a lot of growth and it is driving costs higher. And we do have expansions under way, not only in the Susquehanna Supply Hub, Bradford costs are increasing.", "But in the Ohio River Supply Hub, with our Oak Grove expansion that we're working on there as we speak, we'll see cost increasing there as those facilities come on line as well next year.", "So growth is driving cost higher, but certainly we're watching very closely operating margin associated with each one of those franchises. And we've had set goals established for our teams to meet or beat their objectives there.", "When it comes to rig counts, we are seeing a lot of improvement there. In many of these areas, the producers are anticipating the online of Atlantic Sunrise. And correspondingly, we're seeing a lot of drilling activity in anticipation of Atlantic Sunrise coming on. But the additional takeaway capacity that's been generated by third parties in the Marcellus, we also are benefiting from that as well.", "So we're seeing a lot of production growth that's anticipated, especially in some of the wet plays that we're associated with. And that's driving a lot of additional business for us, as I indicated. And our Oak Grove expansion is a great example of that.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. And maybe just touching on Southwestern to build on there, if you could just update us there as far as how the ramp progressed during the quarter and how you see that kind of going into 2018?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Maybe just \u2013 this is Alan. I'll just add a little bit there. First of all, in the Southwest Marcellus area, Southwestern's been very active there. And just to remind you, we signed a contract with them last year.", "And the way that contract works, they basically inform us ahead of time when they intend to bring on new volumes. And as they do that, our capacity that we make available for them on the processing expand and their minimum volume commitment to expand, to stand behind those investments that we make. And we have seen them increasing those requests for service, which drive that up, and so a lot going on there.", "I would tell you that there's quite a bit of activity right now going on, connecting a lot of their pads. So I think they've been very successful out there. And we're thrilled to have them as a customer out there. And they continue to improve. So feeling good about that relationship.", "We also as you know have expanded our relationship with EQT in the Ohio River \u2013 Valley Midstream area. And they are being very active in driving some of the growth that we're seeing there at Ohio Valley Midstream as well.", "So finally seeing some real pull-through as the acreage out there has gotten into the right hands. And it's great acreage and was held by various counterparties. But the consolidation we're seeing out here in and around our acreage is really starting to drive a lot of activity and growth.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got you. Great. And just one last one, Discovery, I was wondering if you could provide a bit more color there and kind of your outlook and kind of ability to kind of redeploy or get more business there.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Sure. So just to kind of remind people there, the Hadrian field, which was a large gas-only field that came across Anadarko's Lucius platform, but it was an Exxon-operated field, Hadrian was.", "Two very large wells that were producing \u2013 I think they got up to almost 400 million a day of production off those two wells of dry gas that came across that platform. I'm not going to get into Exxon's business there, but we've seen that production decline off dramatically. And we don't right now expect that production to come back on line here for 2018. And so, they'll have to decide what they're going to do with those reserves.", "But, right now, we don't expect that to come back on anytime soon. That was about roughly, I think, in terms of impact to our expected 2018 numbers, it was about $95 million in terms of reduction of what we would have \u2013 or I should say definitely in terms of what we saw in 2017, it was reduction from 2017 to 2018 by that amount. That's net to our interest. We own 60% of the Discovery system.", "Lots of other prospects out there in the area. And frankly, we were running completely full on that system, both on the processing side and on the Keathley Canyon Connector, which is that line that goes up to the Lucius platform. But there are some very large RFPs that we're bidding on right now. So, we don't expect anything of that kind of significance to backfill that here in 2018. But there's a tremendous amount of prospects there in the Keathley Canyon area that were \u2013 gas takeaway solution for that area. So, we would expect to win that business. So, short term, negative; long term, Discovery, as always, is positioned in a great spot.", "Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "That's very helpful. I'll pause there. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Good morning. I think you've said before that after Atlantic Sunrise comes on line, Chesapeake will be down to 10% of your EBITDA. I wanted to make sure that, that's about right? And as a follow-up, would you be willing to comment on your next one or two largest customers? Are they E&Ps or utilities, and kind of roughly what share of EBITDA they are?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Well, let's see. First of all, on the Chesapeake front, yes, I think your 10% number is fairly accurate as we move forward here. I would say, obviously, that's dependent on asset sales that Chesapeake continues to execute on. And so, with additional asset sales, that might drop lower.", "In terms of our largest customers, I would tell you, it's quite a mix there. Certainly, Cabot's been running up fast on that list with all the great business that we have within there in Susquehanna Supply Hub and then \u2013 and Atlantic Sunrise comes on. So, I think that's really going to drive that. But if you look below that, you'll start to see a lot of the big utility customers that we have on the Transco system.", "So, anyway, I think that's probably the right way to think about that. Obviously, Southwestern is emerging but not anywhere near yet, where we see Cabot as an E&P customer.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Got it. That's really helpful.", "John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Alan, you got anything to add to that?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "No. I think that's great. That's right.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. That's really helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, a number of the Marcellus E&Ps are now discussing living within cash flow at least over the next couple of years, I guess. Has that impacted your growth outlook, or is it fair to think that the Northeast Marcellus is somewhat immune from that just because it's so takeaway-constrained?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. I think, obviously, we stay very close to Cabot. And they've done a great job and been very disciplined, and, as you know, continue to build a lot of cash on their side. So, I think they will just continue to generate more cash as new markets open up, too. It's pretty remarkable to me to see what they've been able to do in such a very low price environment that they've been exposed to. And so, I think they are capable of operating in a very low price environment and continue to generate cash flow. So, as for Cabot, I would say that I think in terms of the moving down to the Bradford area, obviously, great reserves there as well, and that area is going to benefit from much better markets as well.", "And then, finally, in the Southwest Marcellus area, obviously, these higher NGL prices that producers have been experiencing in that area really driving cash flows for folks there. But I think, right now, we're seeing an intense focus by the players that are really beginning to consolidate these basins. EQT is probably the biggest example of that, but their ability to generate returns on even low prices, I think, is going to continue to drive the kind of growth. Frankly, we're better off as a gatherer. We're better off if that growth doesn't come in huge spikes that comes in a steady growth pattern, because it means less capital investment per free cash flow for us.", "So, we're pretty pleased with the current rate of growth that we're seeing. And it's right in line with what we laid out last year in our Analyst Day as we look (48:27) pro forma that we rolled out at the Analyst Day last year. We're pretty well staying right in line with that. And that's going to drive a lot of value for us if it continues on that trajectory.", "Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Perfect. That answers my question. Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Christine Cho of Barclays.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone. I wanted to start off in the West. The volumes are good. Can you just remind us if the Haynesville contracts are higher margin than the other G&P areas in this section?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "No. I mean, the rates there, as you'll recall, we renegotiated those rates several years ago and we exchanged a lower rate for drilling obligations from Chesapeake. And we combined those two systems out there. So, I would say, our rates out there today are in line with the market. In terms of the operating margin that we have out there, it's probably in line. I think the benefit we have out there right now, Christine, is that we had quite a bit of capacity already built. So, you'll recall, we did a little expansion back in August of last year.", "But, overall, we've got the capacity sitting there, and these pads are pretty well built out, so we're not having to spend a lot of well connect capital. And our operating costs continue to be pretty low for the area, just because the systems already built out. And so, that's the kind of advantage you have when a system comes back, and you've already got the capacity built out for it. So, I think that's that margin that you're seeing.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I actually didn't mean relative to like market. I meant relative to the other areas in the West segment. So, are the Haynesville rates higher than, like your Niobrara, your Rockies, et cetera?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "No, they are not. But again, it's very dependent on the total services that we are offering. And so, what I was getting at there was that we've already had these operating systems up and running. And once they're a little more mature, we're able to really put pressure on our costs as opposed to when we're in a growing mode and we're having to add people and quickly bring volumes up. So, I would just say, because the Haynesville has been operating for quite some, our unit operating costs, they're pretty mature. So, if you wanted to get down to operating margin percentage there, it's probably pretty good on that basis.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then I wanted to go to your slide 8 in the presentation. The $425 million full-year contribution from Atlantic Sunrise and Garden State, I just wanted to clarify if these are gross or net numbers to you, as I think Atlantic Sunrise is consolidated in your financials, but the non-controlling interest line is below the adjusted EBITDA.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. No, you are correct. That is the gross number.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And do you have like a net...", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "That is what goes into EBITDA, and then there'll be a minority interest deduction number.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then, lastly, WPX sold their San Juan acreage. And just wanted to see what kind of impact you expect to see from that, if any, and to confirm that the contracts will transfer over to the new owners.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. First of all, we haven't seen the contract shift yet, so obviously, we'll take a look at that as we do in situation like that. We've been able \u2013 always able to work with our customers to deal with credit issues, which obviously is the primary issue in any kind of exchange like that, but I would \u2013 so, too early to tell you on that. We haven't concluded that.", "I would say that we're continuing to see the acreage fall into the right hands, and it's very much a positive for us when we see acreage shifting around like this because, as you know, WPX has a lot of high-return investment opportunity in the Permian that is going to keep them busy for a long time. And so, moving this over to somebody who will bring the cost of capital that it needs in the Mancos oil play there is a positive thing. And we're really seeing that throughout the West. So, we just continue to see properties falling into the right hands, and we think that's a real positive for us.", "Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you so much.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Christine.", "Operator", "And from Goldman Sachs, we turn next to Ted Durbin.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thanks. On the Transco rate case, I wonder if you can quantify what kind of rate increase you might be looking for? Are we talking in sort of the double digits in percentage terms, or maybe said another way, how much do you think you're under earning on your cost-of-service rates right now in Transco?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Ted, I would just tell you, that will be determined when we get done with the test period or base period, and so \u2013 that we're forming those rates, and when we get done, I think that ends here in May, I think, and that'll form the basis for that rate in August. But I would tell you, the numbers on Transco are big and it takes a lot (54:00) direction to move those rates very much. So, don't expect any major shifts in that rate one way or the other.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. That makes sense. And then, as we think about the O&M increases you've had in the Atlantic-Gulf segment, you talked about Transco and the higher maintenance capital we've had, should we think about what we're looking at in 2018 as a good run rate, or should we see a step up or step down as we look ahead into 2019? You've had your maintenance capital numbers stepped up decently well here in the guidance versus where you've run the last couple of years. Just talk about run rate operating costs, particularly around Transco, please.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Ted, thanks for the question. First of all, you could draw the conclusion \u2013 without seeing the details, you could draw the conclusion that our expansions are really driving a lot of that cost, and that's just not the case really. The cost is being increased as we go through the process of doing things that you might consider to some people would look like maintenance capital, but by the details of the rules (55:16) are not maintenance capital.", "So, for instance, doing hydro testing on pipeline and doing repairs, all of that, it winds up in expense. We have a lot of that to do on the Transco system. And certainly, because we operate in such highly populated areas, we are going to spend the money to make sure our pipes are safe. And so, that kind of cost, even though some might consider that maintenance of the system is really what's been driving our cost up here recently. And we've got a lot more work to do on that front. So, those costs will continue for quite some time as we do that.", "Now, the thing that's difficult about that is predicting what that cost is actually going to be, because when you hydro test the line, if you do see problems, you're having to forecast the rate of repair required, if you will, when you do either the internal inspection, testing, or the hydro testing, either one, you'd have to estimate what your rate of repair is, so that just becomes an estimate. And until you actually run the test, then you really don't know what your repair requirements are going to be.", "So, that becomes a little bit difficult to predict, much more difficult than just ongoing operating expenses of keeping a compressor station running or keeping the right of ways maintained and the measurement systems maintained on the pipeline. So, hopefully, that helps you understand, but I think bottom line is we've got high costs that are related to bringing the \u2013 making sure we've maintained the system adequately, and that will continue for some time here.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's great. And then last one from me, just on CapEx guidance. $2.7 billion total, $1.7 billion at Transco, can you just bridge us what goes into that $1 billion difference? Is it more the Northeast and some of the OVM spending you talked about at the Deepwater? Kind of a little more color on where that $1 billion is coming out of?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Sure. First of all, as I mentioned, like the Norphlet project we're doing for Shell on the Deepwater, that's included in capital. But if you really got down to seeing the sources and uses, you'd see that being reimbursed even though we count that as capital. So, some of that is reimbursed capital that would show up as capital spending, but in fact, it gets reimbursed. And so, that's about maybe 20% or so of that 15% maybe.", "And then, in the Northeast, a lot of growth going on, and with the sixth expansion that I talked about in the Northeast as well as a build-out of the Ohio expanding the processing capacity in the Ohio Valley Midstream area. And then out West, the Wamsutter area is the primary driver for growth out West, as we continue to expand those systems. And I would tell you that probably the next area that we'll be looking to need to expand will probably be the Niobrara with the growth that's going on there.", "So, that probably will wind up being more of a 2019 issue perhaps, but maybe start spending on that. So, that's really driving most of it is actually in all three areas. The largest of those right now though is the Northeast in both the Susquehanna County area as well the Ohio Valley Midstream area.", "Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Perfect. I'll leave it at that. Thank you very much.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Ted.", "Operator", "And up next is Shneur Gershuni from UBS.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys. Maybe we can start off with the balance sheet and expectations on return of capital going forward. If I recall, when you did the restructuring early last year, you sort of seemed that there was a goal to reduce leverage by about $5 billion. You did the equity issuances, you've had some asset sales, and EBITDA seems to be recovering and so forth. Was wondering how far away we are until the agencies would view the consolidated entity as IG? And then, what your expectations are for returning cash flow with respect to WMB getting close to paying off its revolver in the second half of this year?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. I'll take the last part of that. And I'll let John Chandler take the first part in terms of the balance sheet piece of that and the rating agencies. On the return of cash flow, I would just say, lots of different opportunities for WMB. We are excited about adding value to our shareholders with that excess cash flow. But as we've said previously, we're going to be looking for the best opportunity. And so, that can come in a lot of different forms. As you know, it's not a similar debate to Williams.", "But I would say, one of the areas that is also attractive is WMB making singular investments in new project opportunities as WMB is an opportunity as the opportunity slate for Williams continues to grow. That's not everything obviously, because we don't want to make things so convoluted between what's owned by MB and PZ, but we will certainly look for that, given how many really highly attractive projects we've got out there. And then, of course, the continued dividend raise obviously is a place to go with incremental cash. So, lots of opportunities on that front. And I would just tell you we'll see what the market looks like six months from now in terms of when we're up against that. So, stay tuned, but I'd tell you we're excited about using that capital to drive additional value for WMB shareholders.", "And, John, if you'll take maybe the question on the balance sheet.", "John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, sure. So, as we exited 2017, WMB had about $270 million outstanding on its revolver, and we're generating around $100 million of excess cash flow every quarter at WMB after it makes its dividends. So, we'll continue to pay that revolver down. And that obviously puts us in the third quarter or fourth quarter when the revolver's gone, which will further bring our leverage down. But again, as Alan pointed out earlier in the call, with the spending on Atlantic Sunrise and the various other projects, our leverage will tick up somewhat as we get to the end of 2018, and then once we get the full benefit of Atlantic Sunrise will come back down again.", "And so, as I think about investment grade and as a consolidated entity with the $4 billion in debt that's up at WMB, I think we need \u2013 and when we talk about investment grade, when we say investment grade, we're really talking about mid-level investment grade, not BBB- but a solid BBB ratio. We think we need to be in the, probably, 4.5 to 4.75 times zip code of debt to EBITDA. And it's depending on when the rating agencies give us kind of full credit for Atlantic Sunrise, but I think in the early part of 2019, we can make a pretty strong argument about that.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. And as a follow-up question, you were talking about the Northeast earlier in response to a question talking about how Cabot is able to operate in the low-cost environment. And there were some other questions about how bottlenecked the Northeast is. But at the same time, Mariner East 2 is expected to come on line, Rover is expected to come on line, and so forth.", "In your conversations with E&P companies, how much do the IRRs for them to drill change as a result of these projects coming online? And once that hits, does that accelerate the opportunity for you to achieve what you outlined at the Investor Day about potentially investing $1 billion of capital in the Northeast at a 2.5 times EBITDA multiple?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Great question. I would just, say, Shneur, that the one thing that's a bit complex around that obviously is who has long-haul capacity that they hold or don't hold.", "And so I think that will tend to drive whether somebody is being very opportunistic in very short term and just drilling when the pricing is there. Obviously, they can turn these areas when the infrastructure is already in place, and they've got a pad sitting there, they can turn incremental production on very quickly when the pricing opportunity exposes itself.", "I think we're going to see more of that as the capacity gets built out. But I do think it's very dependent on if you've got long-haul capacity that you are constantly filling or you have a gas purchase contract for a good price that you can depend on. You can be more of an ongoing and less reactive mode, if you're a producer in that situation, versus if you're one that's just sitting, waiting for a price peak and hitting that.", "I think what we're seeing through the consolidation in the basin is more of the former example. I think previously, we had a lot of the latter example. And the big consolidators in the basin are making long-term commitments to either NGL takeaway or gas takeaway, as you mentioned, and that is going to position them for long-term drilling and is going to make their variable price point very different than somebody that doesn't have that takeaway capacity.", "And so I think we are certainly continuing to see expansion going. I think people are getting better and better at getting their cost down on the reserves. And so I think that's pretty promising for the Northeast in terms of volumes.", "I also think though there has been a pretty strong delineation, because people have got such a strong portfolio of opportunity that it's going to be awhile before people get to the lesser acreage. And by that, I mean the lower return acreage. I think it's going to be a while before people get to that, because there's such a great inventory of the very strong acreage in both Susquehanna and Bradford County in the Northeast, and then of course, in West Virginia and for our Southwest Pennsylvania for the rich Marcellus.", "So I'd say, feeling pretty optimistic. But I do think, to answer your question, it's very dependent on what it produces, a long-haul takeaway or their gas purchase contracts are out of the area as to how steady their drilling is going to be.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Final question. With respect to the Gulf of Mexico, and I understand there's the discovery dispute and so forth, but it seems like producers, and I believe you mentioned Shell, seem to be adding capital into the Gulf of Mexico, talking about tiebacks profitable at $40 oil. Do you see this as an emerging opportunity for Williams going forward? Just kind of wondering if it's a one-off or if it's something that we should be thinking about across the Gulf of Mexico.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. I would tell you, we happen to be in the right spots. And so that's the good news in that we've got on top of the prospects that we talked about today, there's a lot of other opportunities that are emerging and quite a few large RFPs that we're responding to for big infrastructure development in the area.", "So I would say we have seen a resurgence. I don't think that it ever quite went away the way people thought it did in terms of the opportunity, because folks like Shell don't just turn on a dime on these kind of things. They've got a long-term commitment to the area. And they've been sitting on that well prospect for quite some time.", "But they've got to make sure there's room in the infrastructure, both on their platform and in our pipelines to get that gas and oil out of there. And so that's kind of what you're seeing managed.", "I think people are trying to lessen their big capital commitments and trying to utilize existing infrastructure as much as possible. And I think that's really the shift that we've seen. And I think you'll continue to see that, because if you can use an existing platform and you're not having to put billions of dollars in new infrastructure in, you can be pretty responsive to oil and gas prices. And I think that's what we'll continue to see out in this play.", "Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color today.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thanks, Shneur.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Morning. Just wanted to follow up in the conversation around Northeast producers. So I agree in the consideration of pipeline capacity, but it seems like at least in the near term, there's been some consideration that producers may pull off volumes from local hubs relative to actually adding new production over the 2018 and maybe into 2019. So just wanted to get a sense of how you guys were thinking about that as you formulate your forecast for the Northeast?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah, well, I would say that we look at what requests come in from our producers to actually formulate our forecast. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, a lot of those come with obligations. So when a producer says that they want to increase their volumes or their capacity on our system, that comes with an obligation that stands behind that.", "So obviously, they've given that good thought and \u2013 before they make those kind of commitments. But that's basically what we generate our forecast off of. I would say, we have very little speculative drilling built into our forecast (1:09:35) off of that.", "But I would say, as we look into 2019, first, 2018 is strong with I think about a 13% increase from the fourth quarter to fourth quarter, so exit rate to exit rate. And so that's very identified right now in terms of where that volume's coming from.", "And as we look into 2019, we're seeing a similar pull-through. But again, so many of our contracts are either cost of service, which requires long-term planning, or minimum volume commitment-backed contracts. That's really what's driving our forecast.", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Okay. Helpful. And then just to circle back to the West segment. So it looks like you're up about $250 million (1:10:28) in the gathering piece. So you mentioned the Haynesville, but then 8 of the other 10 \u2013 or I guess eight of the other nine were also up. Can you just frame, I mean, what the magnitude was? Was there any meaningful contributors there or predominately Haynesville?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Haynesville was the biggest I think behind that probably on a percentage basis. (1:10:51)", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "On a percentage basis, we saw pretty significant increase in the Niobrara. Although it's a smaller number, it's a big increase we saw. As we mentioned, the Haynesville and even some improvement in the Anadarko, though across the board, saw pretty good improvement across all of those. The Eagle Ford was up almost double digits there as well, so.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. I think on an order of magnitude, I think, Haynesville and Eagle Ford were the two biggest drivers. But on a percentage basis, the Niobrara was pretty strong. And I would tell you, given the current activity, we expect that to continue to be a pretty strong percentage driver, even though on an absolute basis it doesn't have that much impact.", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Got it. Okay. And just a final question here on maintenance. So relatively light versus 2017 guide. Is that tied at all to your conversation around the O&M spend and some of that transition from what you would consider maintenance CapEx to the operating expense line? Or just came in lower than expected?", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Well, I would say \u2013 this is Michael Dunn again. I'd say, it came in lower than expected across the board, really across all of our franchises. We anticipated some work that actually wouldn't likely shift into 2018 from the appearance of a lot of it. Was just a lot of that work that was in process, but just didn't get completed in the fourth quarter. So we are seeing some of that shift into 2018, which is not \u2013 that's pretty typical, I would say, as to what we see where we do have a shift at the end of the year in some of that work that we just don't get completed, and it shifts into the future year.", "But we really thought across all of our franchises where we had work that was anticipated to be completed, and we just didn't get it finished.", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Okay. So with 2018 being flat versus the 2017 guide, implications that 2018 would have actually been down but some of that slipped to this year?", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "No. I wouldn't characterize it that way. In fact, we're seeing 2018 slightly ahead of where we've anticipated 2017 to come out. We're seeing a lot of work, as we indicated earlier, in our Transco system, but not only on the expense side, but on the maintenance CapEx side as well for integrity and reliability projects.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "So, yeah, to be clear we are expecting an increase in maintenance capital from 2017 to 2018.", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "But the guides are effectively flat? $500 million both years?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "We came in below that $500 million in 2017. So, I think, we came in at $440 million...", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Yeah. That's correct.", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "That's right.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "...in 2017.", "John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "So, I think one thing when you look to our guidance for 2018, we widened our distributable cash flow guidance, in part, because of trying to really fine tune around maintenance capital spending. I think the last couple of years, if you look at our performance versus our guidance, we come in below the guidance and it's just a matter of how much work you can get done. And typically we don't know that till we get towards the end of the year. So, we widened the guidance a little bit to reflect that.", "Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Yes. All right. Well, thank you, guys.", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And from Citi, our next call comes from Eric Genco.", "Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Morning. I was just hoping to drill in maybe a little bit on the excess coverage at WMB and the shareholder return question. Is it fair to characterize it and say, if you got 1.36 excess coverage there that your first priority after you're done with the leverage pay down is would be projects that you needed to avoid, public equity issuance and other entity? But then is it basically \u2013 as people are sort of anticipating the potential for a consolidation of the two entities is it just a matter of looking at WMB's NAV versus its ownership of PZ? And if that is at a discount, should we assume that WMB buybacks move up the pecking order in terms of what you would like to do with that capital?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. All of that. There's, obviously, a lot of things to consider there. But, as you know, the Tax Reform, of course, pushes out the date by which we would be a cash tax payer at WMB, which is obviously one of the benefits of getting that tax stuff up (1:15:24) first. And secondly, ultimately, the tax rate that we're paying just got lowered as well. So, I would just say that, that driver is somewhat lessened as a result of Tax Reform bill as we look out there.", "So, John?", "John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "No. I think you're \u2013 I mean, obviously, and Alan alluded to this earlier. When we get to that point, we'll be making a relative return decision and if WMB appears undervalued, maybe we buy back WMB shares. If WPZ seems undervalued, maybe we buy back WPZ shares or maybe we co-invest in projects. Generally, as it relates to the buy-in of the partnership, now that the Tax Reform is understood, once our leverage gets right, I think, just generally, as it relates to that entity, I think we'll have to take a look at how the MLP space is doing in general.", "I think MLP is a tool to race capital over the long term if that market were strong, I think we'd have to ask, do we want to make it go away or not. And if the space is kind of just trending sideways, like \u2013 I mean, it's a little bit improved now, but generally trending sideways, then, you have to (1:16:32) leave it outstanding. So, I think it's a bigger picture than just that. I think it's a question about the strength of the space when we get there.", "Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then, shifting gears on \u2013 and just a bigger picture-type question on Northeast. If Constitution were to never happen in some of these other pipes that are there, how do we think about the multiyear outlook for Northeast G&P? Because for the longest time and even now, we're waiting for Constitution to come on to basically debottleneck Susquehanna Supply Hub, and I believe, Bradford, to some extent. But if you don't get Constitution or some of these other things, are there other opportunities, or do we sit back and say, the volume increase from, call it, 4Q 2017 to 4Q 2020 in those areas is pretty much limited to Atlantic Sunrise's capacity?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. Great question. First of all, I would just say, we have other projects ultimately. And, of course, we have a project called Diamond East, which follows our Leidy route and the expansion of our Leidy route. A lot of recent interest in that project. So, that expands capacity into Zone 6 in a pretty meaningful way as one alternative.", "And then, additionally, ultimately, we have some expansion capability on Atlantic Sunrise. So, I would just say, if the folks in New England area want to continue to buy their gas from Russia, they can, and the folks in the south will benefit from that. So, that looks like that's \u2013 what that's going to continue to be is lower-cost gas supplies for the growing industries in the south.", "And so, we'll see on Constitution. I think in the grand scheme of things, it's an important \u2013 it's not that big in terms of total volume takeaway from the area. It is important, I think, in terms of determining if the Trump administration's going to be successful in pushing for infrastructure development. And so, we remain very committed to that. But I would tell you in the grand scheme of things, the market takeaway, there's plenty of market growing to the south. And we were very well-positioned to be able to get that gas there through either expansions of Atlantic Sunrise or Diamond East, as I just mentioned.", "Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James.", "Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Just a quick one for me. When you think about the EBITDA buildup, not just for 2018 but going into 2019 as well, and you think about it more on an EBITDA per Mcf basis, can you just help us understand how much of that buildup and progression is Atlantic Sunrise line contributions into the Susquehanna and Bradford systems in addition to Garden State versus maybe just more aggregate takeaway capacity alleviating basis pressure in the basin? And then, into 2019, how do we think about the construct of that EBITDA buildup versus what could be rising O&M expenses again?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Darren, make sure I heard that correctly. First of all, last quarter out on the buildup, the cost buildup that you see there in 2018 certainly would carry \u2013 that cost increase would certainly carry into 2019, but not a whole lot of incremental costs associated with bringing those projects online. So, as I mentioned earlier, it's more going to be driven by the maintenance work. And that step-up that you see in the prior year will carry in to the 2019 period as well. So, I think that answers that part.", "If would you try again on \u2013 I didn't quite understand the basis differential question.", "Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Well, I'm just trying to figure out, like if you look at the gathering capacity in Northeast Pennsylvania, it's probably pushing at this point for you guys 6 Bcf a day. So, I'm trying to figure out as you guys kind of progress on that EBITDA per Mcf ramp that was laid out at the Analyst Day, obviously, incremental takeaway capacity by you guys and your competitors out of the basin is going to alleviate basis pressure.", "Based on your footprint, you're going to get your natural market share with regard to a step-up in volume, based on just easy capacity utilization. So, I'm trying to figure out how much of it is driven by the basis uplift and incremental volume across your assets versus what you guys are adding on a fully-contracted basis such that the EBITDA per Mcf could shift a little bit.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. Thank you. Yeah, so, I would say, first of all, we do think that there is a lot more growth out of the area than, just for instance, Atlantic Sunrise and/or potentially Diamond East. We think obviously, if you're to look at Cabot's slide and all the different market and gas purchase contracts that they've done with power plants in the area, they've got a nice step-up coming from that. And so, I would say, they've been pretty smart on that.", "But I also would remind people that as these big takeaway projects come out of the Southwest part of the Marcellus or Mountain Valley, Atlantic Coast, as those come online and get attached to growing markets there, that will pool gas off of systems that serve the Northeast today that are in serving that local market. So, even the Northeast PA will gain some benefit from that takeaway capacity to the Southwest because you'll just see volumes start to be supplied from the Northeast rather than the Southwest on a local \u2013 in both power plant basis and local use.", "But in terms of our EBITDA margin, and what we're expecting in pull-up there, most of it is just coming \u2013 we have fixed the contract, and the EBITDA margin is just coming from our cost remaining relatively flat plus a mix of a higher portion of our volume coming from places like Ohio Valley Midstream, where we have a much higher margin per Mcf basis. And so, those are the two main drivers for us. But as I mentioned earlier, in terms of our volume forecast, it's pretty well driven by detailed plans that we have with \u2013 in fact, it is driven by detailed plans that we have with our producing customers right now, as we build out those systems and their obligations stand behind that.", "So, I would say, at least for the next couple of years, we have a very good read on what we expect those volumes to do. We have won some new business and are winning some new business in the Southwest area that will increase our processing volumes in the Southwest that would have been over and above our earlier forecast. But for the most part, our forecasts are just driven by our existing gathering contracts and the plans that we have with those producers today. And that, by itself, is driving that EBITDA margin uplift, if you will, that we spoke about at last Analyst Day.", "Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey, guys. It's Cory (1:24:15) filling in for Chris. And thanks so much for taking time, so much extra time to answer all of our questions. Just two really quick ones for me. The first one is just want to make sure we heard the Transco timeline correctly. So, that on slide 8, that $140 million walk from 2017 to 2018, that assumes July and service of compressor. And you said a few months after that, it would be the greenfield pipe portion that would start contributing?", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Right. Yeah. I can take a little bit of more filler on that. Right now, we're anticipating and targeting that our contractors are going to be mechanically complete on the pipeline portion in July. And mechanical completion means just that, the contractors are finished with their work and then commissioning begins with our teams.", "And with the compressor stations mechanically complete, the time between mechanical completion and in-service when you can commission those compressor stations takes a bit longer. There's just a lot more process, because you have to go through on the compressor stations to complete your commissioning activities, where it's a lot quicker on the pipeline systems. You're really just commissioning the valves and meter stations on the pipeline, but much more complicated on the compressor station.", "So, the compressor stations lag a few months there although their percentage completion right now is leapfrogging the pipeline. The commissioning process takes a bit longer with the compressor stations. So, that's why you see a little bit of a lag there on the compressor stations beyond the pipelines being mechanically complete.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then, I'm assuming this was done on purpose, but there's no way you can bifurcate Atlantic Sunrise and Garden State for us, can you?", "Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "As far as a revenue impact, EBITDA impact, the contribution, yeah?", "Unknown Speaker", "Yeah. That EBITDA, that $140 million split. I don't know if you can for us.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Yeah. I tell you what, why don't you call our IR team, and they can give you some detail. I think we have provided some information previously that'll help you on that.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. And then just last one from us is \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this, but the cadence of the dividend and distribution growth in 2018, the quarterly for PZ, the annual for MB, was that new?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Well, we've talked about the increase \u2013 the new piece that we laid out today was saying that we were just going to go ahead and just do annual increases on WMB versus quarterly distribution increases. So, that is new. The percentage of annual increase is staying the same, but the annual versus quarterly distinction is new.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. And just out of curiosity, the motivation for the difference there?", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "I would just say, first of all, I think the MLP space is used to the quarterly raise and the quarterly distributions. And I would say, large more utility-like C-Corps are more annual raisers, and so we were just pretty well staying in line with what we see really out of the more pure market for WMB. And so, that's really the driver on.", "Unknown Speaker", "Understood. All right. Thanks so much again for the time, guys.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Thank you. Okay. Go ahead.", "Operator", "I apologize. This concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Armstrong, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.", "Great. Thank you. Lots of great questions. Thank you, all. Appreciate all the attention to the business. Really, well-positioned as we go forward here. I think the low gas prices that we're seeing particularly in the forward market are just evidence of the people's confidence in our ability to utilize and get low-priced gas out of the ground. We think it's a really positive thing for us, both on the LNG development and those markets as well as the development on gas fired generation, and I think we'll see some of that this summer, that demand start to pick up as well.", "So, really excited about how the fundamentals are supporting our business and especially pleased with the continued improvement in executions on our projects by our teams all across the Williams system.
