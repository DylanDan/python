Our first quarter results were an excellent start to 2017. We saw a continuation of many of the positive trends we have seen over the last several quarters. Our after tax operating income per share excluding after tax realized investment gains and losses and the impact of the guaranty fund assessment was $1.02. That is a record high for us and a strong increase of 8.5% relative to the year ago quarter. ", "This currently exceeds our full year expectation for growth of 3% to 6%. This strong performance was well balanced throughout our business segments with particularly strong results in Unum U.S. and Colonial Life as premium growth and benefits experience remain favorable. Our Unum UK results were up slightly relative to our expectation this quarter as our benefit results experienced some claim volatility. I would note that our UK business continues to maintain a high level of profitability and operating return on equity. ", "Finally we saw stable results in our Closed Block operations. I believe that we have proven our ability to consistently produce strong results during these uneven business conditions and that we remain very well positioned in our markets. We enter 2017 with great momentum and a strong focus on the disciplined execution of our customer focused business plan. I believe our first quarter results are a continuation of that trend. In addition our strategy has kept us in step with the changes occurring in the employee benefits markets and are soul focus in this space is increasingly an advantage for us. ", "An example has been that as the market shifted more and more towards employee engagement and shared funding our business model has kept pace. Also the scale of our business is increasingly an advantage. It enables us to have a depth of data in the pricing of new business, scaled operations in the administration of our in-force business, and industry leading management of claims. And finally the strength of our combined Unum U.S., Unum UK, and Colonial Life distribution systems provide unique reach into the broker and business to business benefits marketplace. Allowing us to effectively serve employer groups of all sizes and industries and this is translating to our results. ", "So let me give a little more context from what we saw in the quarter. Starting with the top line, our growth remains very good. Adjusted for foreign exchange our recent reinsurance arrangement we saw our core premiums grow almost 6%. Unum U.S. and Colonial Life continued their momentum with solid mid single-digit premium growth for the first quarter combined with good persistency. Sales were solid as well in the first quarter with Unum U.S. and Unum UK increasing double-digits and Colonial Life keeping pace with just over 7% growth. Overall it was a great start. ", "For the overall return perspective, our profit margins remain very strong in our core business segments with operating return on equity for each of our core businesses above 15%. We believe this illustrates a disciplined approach we take to the fundamentals of our business for pricing and underwriting of new business cases to the management of our ongoing business relationships. This continues to produce a good balance between solid top line growth and strong profit margins. ", "These growth trends and strong profit margins across our business line continue to generate capital and free cash flow. For the first quarter we generated approximately $180 million in after tax specialty [ph] operating income. Our risk capital levels and holding company cash position finished the quarter in excellent shape. As a result we continued to have substantial flexibility to fund the growth in our business and continue to invest at our core operations to enhance our position in the employee benefits market. We also continue as we have done for several years to repurchase our shares and look to increase our dividend which we have historically addressed in our board meeting. ", "So in summary it was a very good start to the year. Market conditions continue to present some challenges but I believe that our focus on disciplined execution of our business plans to serve the needs of employers and employees we will serve our shareholders well. We remain optimistic that our actions to position Unum for a long-term sustainable growth will produce benefits for years to come. So with those highlights and excellent quarter I\u2019ll ask Jack to discuss our first quarter results in greater detail. Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "Thank you Rick and good morning everyone. Rick provided a high level overview of our first quarter results and I will now provide a more in-depth view of the things we're seeing in our businesses. First of all it was an outstanding quarter for Unum overall. Our after tax operating income per share of $1.02 is an increase of 8.5% over the year ago quarter. We continued to be pleased with the strong balance we're experiencing between the operational performance drivers of our EPS growth and the capital management drivers. Our after tax operating income increased 5.3% to $236.1 million for the first quarter while our share repurchase activity contributed 3.2% to our after tax operating income per share growth relative to last year. ", "Similar to last quarter our growth in before tax operating income was led by our Unum U.S. segment which produce operating income for the first quarter of 239.1 million, an increase of 10.7% over last year. Each of our Unum U.S. business lines performed well. Group disability had an outstanding quarter once again with before tax operating income of 88.7 million, an increase of approximately 26% relative to last year. ", "The earnings growth was primarily driven by a strong improvement in the benefit ratio from 80.6% in the first quarter of 2016 to 76.6% in this quarter. This benefit ratio includes the 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate for new claim incurrals that we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and it's within the 76% to 79% range that we communicated to you in the December Investor Meeting. ", "This quarter's improvement was primarily driven by favorable incidence trends in the group LTD product line, lower presence rates in the group STD product line, and the cumulative benefit of rate increases on renewals over the past several quarters. Group disability premium income growth was 0.7% over the year ago quarter. The group Life and AD&D lines produced another steady solid quarter with operating income of 56 million in the first quarter, an increase of 1.1% over the year ago quarter. Premium income increased 4.7% over the year ago quarter and the benefit ratio was steady at 71.9% in the quarter compared to 71.5% last year. Underlying risk results were generally consistent with our expectations but we did experience a slight higher average claim size in the AD&D product line. ", "The supplemental and voluntary lines continued to perform well and generated a substantial contribution to our earnings with the forecast operating income of 94.4 million, an increase of about 5% over the year ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remained very favorable increasing 11.2% in the quarter compared to last year. I will remind you that we executed a reinsurance transaction in the individual disability line in the fourth quarter. This transaction lowered revenues by about 25 million which was offset by a reduction in the sum of benefits, commissions, and expenses of about 25 million. ", "It caused a slight elevation of the benefit ratio but it had no material impact on the operating income of the line. Our voluntary benefits business continues to grow with premium income increasing 6% for the first quarter while the benefit ratio improved to 42.2% in the first quarter compared to 43.8% a year ago. In addition the recent acquisition of Starmount contributed 41.5 million in dental and vision premium income to the supplemental and voluntary lines. ", "Sales increased by 11% for Unum U.S. in the first quarter. Driving this growth was our voluntary benefits line which increased 17% in the first quarter. The addition of the dental and vision product line also benefited our sales this quarter and we continue to see good acceptance in the market and strong core activity from these new product offerings. Our group sales declined 4.7% this quarter relative to last year with higher short term disability sales offset by declines in group long-term visibility and group life. We're very pleased that we continue to see strong growth in our voluntary benefits offerings both for Unum U.S. which focuses on the larger case broker market and Colonial Life which tends to focus on the smaller case market as well as the public sector market. ", "The growth we are experiencing as a result of our approach to the VB market over the past several years continues to diversify our business and provide us with a strong and consistent source of earnings growth. Even UK had a tougher quarter where the before tax operating income was lower than the year ago quarter and slightly under our expectations. For the first quarter 2017 operating income was 21.4 million pounds sterling compared to 23.5 million pounds in the year ago quarter. Our premium income grew by 0.6% in the first quarter on local currency continuing the trend we saw in 2016 of a lack of growth in the in-force block. This is widely driven by economic uncertainties brought on by Brexit. ", "Our benefits experienced overall was off from last year with a benefit ratio of 71.4% for the first quarter compared to 67.9% in the year ago quarter. Approximately 2% of the increase from the benefit ratio was driven by the inflation linked benefit which was offset by higher net investment income. A higher average size of new claim incurrals in the group long-term disability line also contributed to the increase while our group -- business were generally favorable compared to a year ago. ", "In response to low interest rates in the UK we also lowered our discount rate for new claims by 80 basis points which we expect to continue to pressure year-over-year earnings growth for the remainder of the year. As Rick mentioned in his opening remarks, while the Unum UK results were slightly below our expectation this business continues to produce very good profit margins and the operating return on equity was slightly under 16% for the quarter. The exchange rate remains a pressure point with an exchange rate of 1.24 for the first quarter consistent with the fourth quarter 2016 but below the year ago first quarter of 1.43. Our outlook for this year assumes an exchange rate of 1.25, we expect this to continue to impact our reported results in 2017.", "Sales in Unum UK remained strong increasing 24.2% over the year ago quarter on a local currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by the success in the large case market. Persistency was lower in the first quarter at 84.5% compared to 85.6% a year ago but was in line with our expectations for the year and reflects our renewed efforts on in-force cases. ", "Colonial Life once again delivered a strong and consistent results. In fact we had record quarterly operating income of 82.4 million, an increase of 6.5% over last year. Premium income growth continues at a healthy pace increasing 6.6% for the quarter driven by the good sales momentum we produced over the past several years. Our benefits experience remain generally in line with our recent trends as well as our expectations with the benefit ratio of 50.8% for the first quarter compared to 50.9% in the year ago quarter. ", "In addition the momentum we\u2019ve seen in our sales trends for Colonial Life remain positive with an increase of 7.2% for the first quarter. This is especially strong when you consider that the year ago first quarter sales growth was 16%. This increase was primarily driven by growth in the core commercial market which increased by 13.2% relative to the year ago quarter. We also saw a very good balance with new account sales increasing 3.2% in the quarter while existing account sales grew by 8.9%. Persistency for Colonial Life remained stable at 78.5%. ", "Finally for the Closed Block, operating income was 31.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 33.7 million in the year ago quarter. In the individual disability line the interest adjusted loss ratio was 83.6% in the quarter compared to 84% in the year ago quarter. This slight year-over-year improvement was primarily the result of lower new playing incidents and favorable mortality experience. For the long-term care line the interest adjusted loss ratio was 88.6% for the first quarter compared to the year ago ratio of 88.9%. This slight improvement was primarily driven by favorable mortality experience. Importantly the long-term care benefit ratio remains within our expected range of 85% to 90%. ", "Overall we continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re seeing in managing the long-term care block. Our claims experience has remained generally in line with our assumption since the end of 2014 when we updated our reserve assumptions to reflect our current view of the business. We are also making good progress on rate increase approvals on our in-force business. This past quarter we received several rate increase approvals and though they tended to be in smaller states we're tracking very well relative to the rate increase assumptions we\u2019ve factored into our reserves. Our reserve assumptions only factored in rate increases request related to our 2014 program. We also discounted our assumptions for what we thought we would realistically receive from state insurance departments. We\u2019ve not factored in any benefit from rate increases that we expect to file forward in the future. In addition the landing spot continues to be viewed favorably by regulators and policy holders who are favoring this option in their elections. ", "As for interest rates and new money yields we once again exceeded our new money yields objective of 5% this quarter. Since our reserve adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2014, we have consistently exceeded this target giving us incremental margin in our reserves. All of these business trends have again resulted in excellent statutory income for the company. After tax statutory operating income for the first quarter was 180.1 million. Well, this is slight decline relative to the first quarter a year ago when we exclude the guaranty fund assessment our statutory income was 193.5 million, a 5% increase over last year and an excellent start to the year. ", "As we discussed with you, statutory results drive capital strength and free cash flow generation. We finished the first quarter with a weighted average risk based capital ratio of our traditional U.S. insurance companies in excess of 390%. Our holding company cash position excluding amounts committed for subsidiary contributions totaled 648 million at quarter end, higher than our year-end 2016 total of 594 million. ", "Our capital position and cash generation capability are source of great strength for the company. It provides us tremendous financial flexibility in our pursuit of optimizing the value of the company for our shareholders. Part of that flexibility shows up on our capital deployment strategy. By the first quarter we again repurchased 100 million of our shares consistent with the trend of the past several quarters and in line with our outlook for the year. ", "Quickly looking at investments results, interest rates were improved in the early part of the first quarter which allowed us to meet or exceed our assumptions for new yields. Although interest rates have softened somewhat since March, they are still significantly higher than last year particularly at the long end of the yield curve. So to wrap up, as we outlined for you in our Investor Meeting back in December, we continue to expect our after tax operating income per share for 2017 to grow within a range of 3% to 6%. Keeping in mind that our starting point is now $3.88 per share reflecting the reporting of the amortization of prior period actual gains or losses on our pension plan as an operating item in our corporate segment. ", "While our growth of 8.5% in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, it's still too early in the year to make any adjustments to our outlook. However, I am very pleased with our results for the quarter and the momentum I see in our business. We are executing very well on our strategies which remain focused on growing our core business in a disciplined manner to help us maintain strong profit margins and cash flow. This focus has served us well with shareholders in the past and we believe we will continue to do so in the future. ", "Now I will turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments. ", "Rick McKenney", "Great, thank you Jack. I will also reiterate how pleased I am with our first quarter. Additionally I remain very pleased not only with the financial position of the company that Jack described but also the strategic position in the Employee Benefits market space. So now we will move on to your questions, and I will ask Tiffany to begin the question-and-answer session. Tiffany?", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Let's take our first question from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. ", "Humphrey Lee", "Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Looking at the voluntary benefit sales in the Unum U.S. being very strong in the quarter, I was just wondering if you can provide some color in terms of why -- what's driving the strong sales in voluntary benefits? ", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Humphrey. I will ask for voluntary benefit sales both in Unum U.S. and in Colonial Life to Mike specific to the Unum U.S. ", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks and good morning Humphrey. Good strong sales quarter and it's important because for the Unum U.S. brokerage voluntary sales 1Q is our typically biggest sales quarter of the year. So it was good to see a strong result. I'd say the long-term story is unchanged which is just a gradual but continued shift from employer towards employee choice and funding. And so we've worked hard to make investments in the product portfolio, distribution, and enrolment capabilities as Rick mentioned to keep pace with that. I would say within the quarter it is actually broad based. We saw a good new number of new clients come on board from a voluntary benefit stand point as well as a strong reenrollment activity with existing clients. I would say at the large end of the market we had some success. That can be a little bit volatile, that probably elevated the result a bit in the quarter but feel really good about the fundamental strength of the business.", "Rick McKenney", "It's great, let me turn it back to Tim Arnold too, I think the Colonial Life had a good quarter as well and it continues series of good quarters. So Tim you want to\u2026", "Tim Arnold", "Yeah, Humphrey, thank you for the question. We think there are a number of reasons driving the strong consistent performance that I would point to the unique capabilities that our agency distribution system offers. As I think Jack or Rick said earlier we have the ability to work on our business to business perspective and through brokers serving both the commercial and the public sector marketplaces. Last year's results were up 16%, it was driven very heavily by strong success in large case and public sector. This year our results were more heavily driven by success in the core markets. So we feel great about our ability to serve effectively all of the various markets in the U.S. Thanks Humphrey. ", "Humphrey Lee", "Alright, and then just another question so, obviously one of your big competitor has announced that they're looking to strategic alternatives for the employee benefits business, has that announcement created any impact on the marketplace in terms of competition or pricing? Can you just kind of in general terms talk about the current competitive landscape?", "Rick McKenney", "I will let Jack talk about the competitive landscape?", "Jack McGarry", "Sure, thanks Humphrey. So, generally our policy isn\u2019t to comment on any specific transaction that may or may not be in the marketplace but maybe to take your question more generally and talk about competitive trends. The group insurance market in particular remains a very competitive marketplace with a number of carriers I think looking to take some share. I think we -- I wouldn't call it abnormally competitive though, I\u2019d say probably the one place that stands out is what we would term the middle market. So that I think employers between 200 and 2000 employees. We have seen over the last couple of years carriers that typically play in the small end of the market look to move up as well as some carriers that play at the very high end of the market look to move down. They sort of all converge in the middle market and it's gotten a little bit choppy there. But on balance I'd say it's a pretty typically competitive market and we see plenty of opportunities to find ways to distinguish ourselves and grow over time. ", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with Citi. ", "Suneet Kamath", "Thanks, good morning and I want to swing to the UK for a second, just want to get some more color in terms of what's going on there. I acknowledge that profitability remains quite strong but just some questions in terms of what you're seeing there and if there needs to be some pricing actions taken to address some of the higher claims and group disability?", "Rick McKenney", "Peter do you want to take that?", "Peter O'Donnell", "Yes, thanks very much Suneet. So, as Jack mentioned Q1 saw an higher severity for our good claims than we would expect. And you will see the discount rate coming through. Now, we didn't have the discount rate factored into our guidance. We are putting rate through to sort of counter that. So the question is, what's happening with severity? So we have analyzed this and whilst its above expectations its within a reasonable range of expectations. So our inter protection severity in the first quarter of 2017 was about 10% above the mean over the last 17 quarters. The last time we saw it at this level was around quarter four 2013 and during these 17 quarters, on three quarters we've been about 10% below that mean. So when we have analyzed it we've also looked at by type, by industry, by scheme size, and we see no discernible trends at this stage. So we're just marking this down to volatility. We would expect over a number of quarters to see that come back but it is all watch area obviously. ", "Suneet Kamath", "Got it and then maybe shifting to group LTD in the U.S. I mean obviously very strong results in the quarter. Just want to get a sense if was there some favorable volatility that helped you guys or I should be thinking about this maybe being a new base in terms of projecting going forward?", "Rick McKenney", "Mike, do you want to take it?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes sure do, it was a good quarter from a loss ratio perspective in group disability. But right within that range that we talked about 76% to 79% at Investor Day, I\u2019d say we probably are a bit lower in the range than we would have anticipated and that was on the back of favorable submitted new claim incidents but not abnormally. So, the big drivers, recoveries, offsets and long term disability are rock solid and right in line with expectation. ", "Suneet Kamath", "Alright, great, thanks. ", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks Suneet. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Nadel with Credit Suisse. ", "John Nadel ", "Hey, good morning everybody. A couple of questions; one, just on group life and disability sales in the U.S. maybe Mike you can comment on what if anything you're seeing in terms of a change or increase in the competitive environment there given the modest, I get that it's modest and it's not your biggest sales quarter but modest decline?", "Mike Simonds", "Sure John, absolutely and good morning. I agree that we're seeing pressure particularly in the core insurance market in that mid component of course. Of course everything under 2000 employees in the mid markets has proven to be pretty challenging. We're as you know going to stay disciplined, we're going to right business when we can do so at a long term sustainable level. But if I look at both groups life and group disability sales, I really think there's two slightly different stories. In the large end of the market as you know that's by nature a volatile kind of result quarter-to-quarter. And as I sort of look at the dynamics in that market and look at what we have in the pipeline I feel optimistic about that business. I feel optimistic about the quarter as well but it's probably a bit more of a watch area given the competitive environment. ", "John Nadel ", "Okay, thank you. And then Jack I was hoping you could sort of give us an update on what if anything you guys are pursuing strategically transaction wise structurally as it relates to the long-term care block, looks like obviously results this quarter were pretty stable and rate increase filings continue to go through but because I know you had touched on the idea of trying to wall off this business into a separate legal entity, any further progress there in terms of at least the thoughts, I know it'll take some time? ", "Jack McGarry", "I guess my comment would be that we start off all the alternatives I think and events just suggested some other ones around what we could do with the long-term care block, we're actively pursuing the reasonable alternatives. None of them are easy, none of them are basically things we can do alone. But we do work with our regulator where we are happy with the progress we're making. But again it's going to be a long-term process. ", "John Nadel ", "Yeah understood, and then last one Rick just -- I wouldn't ever ask you to comment on a specific acquisition opportunity but I am curious given some of the news off late how you think about size of a transaction that you think Unum could be willing to undertake, if you have -- if you really decided that a target was a strategic fit, how you think about financing something larger than just with cash on hand? ", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks John, the answer is lot speculative in terms of really saying or commenting on any market rumors out there. I would say M&A is a part of our overall strategy. You have seen us do a couple of smaller transactions here and couple that fit very well strategically. As we think about how things will play in the markets but we will make sure that we do so in a disciplined way. It has got to fit both strategically, it's got to be something that we do very well and then we'll look at the other means such as financing. Jack, maybe you could talk a little bit about M&A though it is one piece of our capital deployment strategy and how that fits might be helpful. ", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, and John we've always been active in the M&A market. We closed on two properties over the last two years. Both were dental and vision properties, kind of strategic properties for us. But we maintain the same view of our capital plans. The first thing we do is look to invest in our ongoing businesses and grow organically. The second priority is around mergers and acquisitions. We do believe with the strength of our free cash flow generation, the fact that where we repurchasing 400 million of shares a year and as we've talked about we think our free cash flow generation with a strong statutory results, we thought of late is on an improving trend. We could handle a reasonably sized acquisition with where we are. But it would have to be, it would have to meet our goals. ", "We're going to continue to be disciplined in the acquisition arena, we're going to continue to look at acquisitions versus the very safe option of repurchasing our shares. We continue to think our shares are good value in the marketplace. We continue to believe we have upside as a company and so it would need to be more attractive than us in order to do that. The third thing we look at is our dividend and maintaining our -- paying our dividend we have increased the dividend pretty consistently over time. You know I think we'll continue to look strongly at that as an opportunity to deploy capital and then finally share repurchases is the final option if mergers and acquisitions and other things don't stop share repurchase but it's been very effective for us. It has contributed to earnings per share growth. And it's been a good return for our investment over time. ", "Rick McKenney", "So hopefully it is -- we\u2019re not going to hit -- we\u2019re not going to pinpoint what we're going to do or how are we going to do it but I think hopefully you get a sense from Jack's comments and mine that we have a great capital generation, good operating businesses. We have a lot of choices, a lot of financial flexibility but we will do, we'll deploy those as Jack talked about in a very disciplined way with a lot of thought going through that and how it fits with our overall franchise.", "John Nadel ", "Yeah, I really appreciate the commentary. Thank you so much. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Seth Weiss with Bank of America.", "Seth Weiss", "Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch on premium growth in U.S. group disability and I guess to the U.S. as a whole sort of in line with the trends you set out at the guidance call but good disability looks like it suffered as we saw a little bit of a tick down in persistency. Could you just comment on these lower persistency levels and the lower premium growth we saw year-over-year, is this sort of a new normal or is it more of a temporary phenomenon given the recent pricing actions you have taken?", "Mike Simonds", "Hey Seth its Mike, I\u2019ll take it. Appreciate the question. You are correct, persistency dropped by about a point but I think it's important to keep in mind that that's from a historical high that we've enjoyed over the last couple of years and in the high 80's across both groups segments. We feel really good about where we're situated and the care we're taking of our clients that they're staying with us at that rate. But that tick down in persistency paired with relatively flat sales year as we stayed disciplined on the new pricing front combined to put a little bit of downward pressure on the group disability earned premium line for sure. ", "Like I said I am optimistic on the new sales front as we sort of look forward into the pipeline. So I don't expect the premium trends to change dramatically. I think the mid-term outlook is a positive for some improvement there and I do think it is important to take one step back to and maybe look at the business in total. It is very good to see such strong both sales in our premium growth and voluntary benefits. It's really exciting to see the early days momentum in the dental and vision benefits business. And if you take all those lines together sales were actually up 11% in the quarter which is really encouraging and we're generating solid earned premium consistent with the optimism and the long-term growth story here. ", "Seth Weiss", "And then just to that point in terms of, I missed a little bit more of the house keeping question but the 2017 outlook for the total U.S. business is 3% to 5% premium growth, does that take into account the new contribution from dental and also the reinsurance transaction or should I try to strip out those changes and think about this more of an apples to apples basis when I think about that 3% to 5% premium growth outlook?", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks Seth, its net both those so you don't have to strip them out. It includes them.", "Seth Weiss", "Great, thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Sean Dargan", "Thanks and good morning. Jack, I just wanted to follow up on the uses of cash. At the NAIC, your spring meeting, there was an update around the RBC factors for investments and designations are going to increase to 19 categories from 6. I'm wondering if you've done any work internally about thinking what this is going to mean to your RBC and if you're going to have to retain some cash to prepare for this?", "Jack McGarry", "Yeah, so this has been around for a while. We\u2019re certainly contemplating it. Actually its less impactful to us because we have a really strong balance between our C1 and C3 risk and our C2 risk. So we\u2019re a liability driven company which makes that less impactful. Its easily absorbed within our cash plans with the exceptional statutory earnings we are generating. Feel very comfortable with cash. We\u2019re also at the high end of our range at 375% to 400% risk based capital. We don't think this will be a significant hit to that risk based capital and so we\u2019re well prepared to absorb that. ", "Sean Dargan", "Got it, great. And then you and many of your competitors were assessed for the Penn Treaty guaranty fund. I'm just wondering if this serves as a wakeup call to regulators when you're asking for rate increases on the LTC in-forces, has this I guess drawn greater attention to the fact that the carrier do need to get rate increased? ", "Rick McKenney", "Actually I will let Steve Zabel talk about that. ", "Steve Zabel", "Yeah, great, good question. I would tell you that the Penn Treaty discussion has been ongoing for years really at the regulatory level. So I think most of the regulators have been aware of the issue. They have become much more educated around long-term care in general. I think over the last years and that has kind of made it better for the carriers to have a discussion with them. So I don't think the liquidation itself is going to generate much change in the environment. But I do think it's influenced over the past years and continuing to do that. ", "Sean Dargan", "Okay, thank you. ", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Sean. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Eric Bass from Autonomous Research. ", "Eric Bass", "Hi, thank you. So over the past several quarters you certainly had favorable underwriting experience but the whole industry is also pretty good at their underwriting results in U.S. So I was just wondering do you think this is a function of the improving economy or recent hard market pricing or some other factor? And then Mike you touched on that a little bit earlier but just given the strong margins do you see risk that people do become more aggressive and pushing for growth? ", "Rick McKenney", "Good question Eric, Mike do you want to take that. ", "Mike Simonds", "Yeah, sure Eric, actually really good question. And I think it's a story that's actually both are true. So if you break down what trends have done particularly in group visibility we have seen favorable new claims submission incidence and I suspect that some of that is a stronger economy and something that's felt industry wide. I would say though that when we look at things like the recovery trends and the offset levels that we've been able to maintain that we feel pretty good that those are standout type performances. So I feel good about that. I think in general we will hire margins across the industry feed more aggressive competition, I think to a degree but frankly we talked about in fourth quarter. We've been able to successfully price for the current interest rate environment. Feel really good about the risk trends. So the degree of new price increases that we have to put in the market frankly is lower than we've had to coming into a new year. And so we suspect that on a relative basis we will be similarly situated to where we've been in years past. ", "Eric Bass", "Got it and as interest rates rise would it be right to think that initially that will help your returns and that there will be a lag before people start to factor that into pricing? ", "Steve Zabel", "Yeah, I think that's a fair assumption. It takes some time for that to burn in. Actually you think about how much new money we're putting out relative to the portfolio overall, it's going to take -- it took some time on the downside, it will certainly take time should interest rates rise. But yes, over time we would see that as a tailwind. ", "Eric Bass", "Okay, thank you. ", "Jack McGarry", "Actually can I make a comment going back to Seth's question on long-term care and Penn Treaty. I think it's worth noting, Penn Treaty has been on rather long time among insurance commissioners in the rate increase discussion. What will be new about Penn Treaty is the premium tax offsets that you get for the assessments. So this is going to bring the long-term care issue front and center on state treasuries and Governors. And I think that may have a different kind of an impact of gaining support at the higher levels of state government for doing something about the long-term care issue. ", "Rick McKenney", "You actually can do that Jack. Time for the next question. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI. ", "Thomas Gallagher", "Good morning, just a follow up on the competitive environment in group. I guess if we look at both the sales and the persistency, both pretty good results but a little bit softer than where they've been. Just given how high the margins have been in that business should we be thinking in the next couple of years that you'd be lowering prices at all because I assume, just taking the midpoint of your range on group LTD in the high 70's that, that would imply like a very high ROE, if we kind of overlay that kind of result. So where I guess it's long winded way of asking like where is pricing now and where do you see that going, I assume it's no longer hardening and the question is would you consider trading better growth for giving up some margin going forward because it does look like you have some room here from an ROE standpoint? ", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks Tom, yeah it is Mike. Appreciate the question and I think you went to a productive place which is the returns on the business are really strong and they're in line with what our expectations would be for group insurance. So we are probably more in a mode of maintaining those returns versus looking to expand those. And I think that does present the opportunity for us on a relative basis and the market continue to focus on growth. I do think there's a constant, it's important to keep in mind there's constant work in your renewal program that even on average the block overall is performing. We're always working through the inventory of clients and looking at where each individual client's risk is performing. So there's always going to be that work that happens and it's sort of a critical component that's been successful in this business. But in sum total I think you're accurate, we're at or right within the range of targeted margins and don't see the need to further expand that. ", "Thomas Gallagher", "Got you, so holding the line on pricing from this point forward would be a good outcome for you?", "Mike Simonds", "We\u2019ll watch closely what the risk trends are. So if risk trends are favorable over a sustained period of time that we get comfortable and certainly we will adjust pricing to maintain margins and be sure that we're delivering strong value to the customer?", "Thomas Gallagher", "Okay and then Jack just back on long-term care, any consideration on buying cash flow hedges. I know you've had some those had rolled rates had gotten real low, we've gotten a bit higher or is that something that you're contemplating?", "Jack McGarry", "You know it's certainly something we keep track of that. We would think about doing it at some point. I don't think we're at a place right now where we are enticed to put on hedges and lock in the current interest rate environment. I think there is a lot of speculation around things that could happen, that could drive interest rates higher. Certainly the tax plans, the infrastructure spend, the fact that the Fed needs to reduce its balance sheet over the long-term so if we thought it was an opportune moment we would, I don't think we think currently it is. ", "Thomas Gallagher", "Okay, thanks. ", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Tom.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Hi, good morning. First just a question on long-term care and if there's been a change in the reviews on reserve adequacy I think you\u2019ve said in the past that if given where rates were and given your success in getting price hikes you don't feel the need to potentially take a charge this year on long-term care. So, just considering the fact that rates are a little bit lower so far this year has your view on that changed at all?", "Jack McGarry", "I mean rates are a little bit lower, remarkably the third year it has bounced back up to right around that 3% range. And so that's off less than the tenure is. The first quarter as we said we exceeded our 5% target. We continue -- as a result we continue to build margin in our asset base and build margin in our reserves. I would view our position as having a lot of flexibility as to when and how much of a long-term care charge we may take. I don't think there's anything pressuring us at the moment to take a charge in 2017. But again we're going to look at it holistically around how we manage the block and what we think is in best interests of shareholders.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay and then you entered the medical stop loss market a little while ago so what was behind that decision and what do you think you bring to the market and then also like what sort of a long term potential do you see in this business down the road like a few years out?", "Jack McGarry", "Jimmy, thanks for bringing it up. I think medical stop loss has been a string of things we've looked at and how we leverage our capabilities, what we do very well including our distribution system and medical stop falls in that line. Mike you want to talk a little bit more about it, we've just got some press releases out there and we're looking forward to getting deep into the market.", "Mike Simonds", "Sure, absolutely. So we looked at it and said it's a growing market, we like the trends I think. What we would bring to bare is a very good distribution into the brokerage market that distributes medical stop loss as well as a strong brand around service. Over time we are acquiring the ability to risk manage in that business starting with some strong partners as we enter the market in the latter half of this year. While I do not see it at all as a substantial contributor to our financial results in the current calendar year and likely well into next year we think it's a really good long-term play. It\u2019s a way to leverage assets that we have. And while not the primary reason for entry, one of the other big advantages of being in that business is the decision the client makes around self funding their health insurance and putting stop loss in place. It happened early when they're devising their overall benefit strategy. So it puts us in a very favorable position to help the consultative around products and services we can wrap around those health care decisions. So we're looking forward to it being a good healthy business for us over the long-term. ", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay, thank you. ", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Jimmy.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead. ", "Ryan Krueger", "Hey, good morning. I had a question about Unum U.S. expenses, the expense ratio came down 70 basis points in the quarter which has continued strong recent trend. Do you view this kind of level of expenses or expense ratio in the first quarter as sustainable for the rest of the year?", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks Ryan, appreciate the question, its Mike. Yeah, I would say we have a little bit of timing in the expense numbers sort of bounce around a little bit but I think the important thing to keep in mind is the longer term trend which is good consistent gradual decrease in that operating expense ratio. A lot of that contributed to buy efforts across the enterprise. We put centers of excellence in place, that multi products and business units are using. We're getting great scale. Rick highlighted strong growth in voluntary. A lot of what we do to bring voluntary and market-to-market happens in one place for the enterprise and then it is taken out through different brands and channels and moves like that I think has helped us. And importantly while we are focused on being good stewards of those resources we're actually increasing the investments that we're putting into our business around new products coming to market under both Unum brand U.S. and UK and in Colonial Life as well as new technology capabilities particularly around enrollment and benefit administration. ", "Ryan Krueger", "Thanks and then on long-term care, when did you model the 2014 rate increase program to be complete and can you give us a sense on a cumulative basis how the rate increases have come in relative to your modeled expectation so far?", "Steve Zabel", "Yeah, this is Steve, thanks for the question. I would say the way to think about it is it was modeled out over several years and as you might expect you're going to get probably majority or significant part of that kind of early on within the first two to three years. But with some states there is a caps on the approval limits and those types of things. So those will be modeled out over more years. I guess what I would tell you just overall what we're still on track with what we put in our initial assessment within the gap reserve in 2014 and still really good about being able to achieve that level of rate increase. ", "Ryan Krueger", "I guess, part of my reason for the question was when since you haven\u2019t modeled any further rate increases in your reserves path for the 2014 program, I guess when you\u2019d be potentially in place to put in a new round of requests?", "Steve Zabel", "You know that\u2019s hard to say. I think we just continue to monitor the experience that we have in the block and clearly it has to be actually justified to go back to the states and so it's just something we'll continue to monitor and so have no plans at this point. ", "Jack McGarry", "You know Ryan, that independent decisions to -- because we're still working on prior rate increases doesn't stop you from filing new ones. ", "Ryan Krueger", "That's it, got it. Okay, great, thank you. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. ", "Yaron Kinar", "Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So first of all I want to go back a second to group disability and life in the U.S. So sales persistence your both a little bit weaker than maybe I would have expected. Are they also -- are you seeing greater competitive pressure than you had sought when you would have looked at the year ahead initially and when you provided the initial guidance or was this pressure already baked into numbers and you basically figured that the pressures in that core business would be offset by supplemental and voluntary?", "Mike Simonds", "Thank you Yaron, its Mike, appreciate the question. Couple of things so first, I hope everyone keeps in mind first quarter while not an inconsequential quarter, is not the most critical as we get the year under way. So there is lot of ground to cover between now and the end of 2017. I think the guidance we laid out at the end of last year of 8% to 10% sales growth is still the best guidance for us. We have an outstanding group of sales and client managers out there in the market, really strong partnerships from underwriting. And I do -- like I said I feel optimistic about the pipeline as it comes together. Did we anticipate a less competitive market I wouldn't necessarily say that. I'd say probably the one place there that I've mentioned previously on the call is that middle market which is proving a little bit more competitive and choppy than I maybe I would have anticipated. But I still am quite optimistic about the balance of the year.", "Yaron Kinar", "Got it, thank you. And then also had a question on your whole core liquidity levels which seemed very strong and certainly higher than any level I've seen in recent years. Is that a timing issue or does that go back to our I guess the previous conversations around strategic flexibility?", "Jack McGarry", "You know actually it is not a timing issue, it's real. We have been building holding company liquidity. That's going to continue because of the strength of our statutory earnings. Dividends from our subsidiaries this year are based on statutory earnings last year and we had record statutory earnings last year. So we expect that to continue to build over time. We are exercising prudence with it particularly this year because there's a bunch of things going on. You have tax reform if the corporate tax rates were significantly lowered, that would be great for us long-term. But you would have deferred tax asset impact resulting from that. We're still working on our long-term care block. We don\u2019t want to be caught short on capital should the opportunity to do something with that arise. So there is some things out there that make sense to be a little more prudent but I think largely I would not expect significant change in actions during 2017. But we realize that is going to continue to build and so our expectation is we'll come out with kind of some renewed comments on our capital plans at the end of 2017 at our Investor Day. ", "Yaron Kinar", "Great, I appreciate the answers, thank you. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. ", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you, good morning. On the \u2013 business any updates on recruiting trends if we do have a little stronger job market, how does that impact your potential recruitment there?", "Tim Arnold", "Hey Mark, thank you for the questions. This is Tim. Our recruiting is right on plan, it\u2019s like a little bit ahead of plan for the first quarter. We feel great about early second quarter results with recruiting but more importantly we're seeing strong sales from those new reps. So it's not just about bodies in the billing it's about their effectiveness and we see increasing effectiveness from that group. ", "Mark Hughes", "And then I believe you have touched on this earlier but your natural growth, your most recent sense in terms of payroll trends, hires, wages are you seeing any uptick there?", "Mike Simonds", "Hi Mark, its Mike. I would say not an uptick actually pretty consistent, little bit of a tail wind if anything while we've seen pretty consistent wage increases over the last several quarters. It has been maybe a tick or two drop in the new job growth but it's not usually consequential. ", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue.", "Tom White", "Great, I think we're getting up on time as well. Thanks everybody for taking time to join us this morning. We look forward to seeing many of you at various investor meetings over the next several weeks and operator that now completes our first quarter 2017 earnings call.

Today's event is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White.", "Thomas White", "Great. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call for Unum.", "Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and our subsequently filed Form 10-Q.

Also, I'll remind you that statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website also in the Investors section.", "So participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, our President and CEO; and Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO; as well as -- as well as the CEOs of our business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum US.; Peter O'donnell for Unum UK; Randy Horn for Colonial Life; and Jack McGarry for the Closed Block.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results and the strong close that we have for the year. Operating earnings per share, which excludes investment gains and losses, as well as certain pension and reserve adjustments, increased 3.7% to $0.85 per share, bringing full year operating earnings to $3.32 per share, an increase of 5.4% for the year, which is towards the upper end of both our plans and the outlook we had provided the Street at the start of the year. Importantly too, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, which I continue to believe is a strong measure of enterprise growth, increased 9.4% year-over-year to $32.32 per share, which is slightly above the 8.6% compound annual growth rate that we achieved in 2009.", "Now let me touch on a few specific items before turning things over to Rick. First, we continued to generate strong results within our ongoing businesses, Unum US, Colonial and Unum UK.", "Unum US had another strong quarter, driven again by favorable risk results across all of our business lines. For the fourth quarter and for the full year, each of our Unum US business lines reported improved benefit ratios, a result of our long-standing focus on disciplined underwriting, pricing and risk selection, sometimes at the expense of top line growth.", "Colonial Life also delivered solid operating results with a stable -- with stable risk results and sound expense management driving another good quarter for this business.", "And lastly, Unum UK continued to show solid margin improvement driven in large part by our aggressive group wide repricing and repositioning actions. Overall, these ongoing business segments are generating consistent solid margins, with an operating return on equity of 14.7% for the fourth quarter and 14.2% for the full year.", "Secondly, the results of our Closed Block remained steady and were in line with our expectations again this quarter. The loss ratio in the long-term care line improved this quarter, and we continue to make good progress in our ongoing repricing initiatives in this line. There's still more work to be done, but I am encouraged by the work that our new team has done to bring greater focus and attention to this business.", "Third, following on some improving sales trends that emerged from the third quarter, we saw strong sales growth in both of our U.S. operations in the fourth quarter. In Unum US, total sales increased by 5%, with especially strong results in our small and midsize employer markets, which are employers with under 2,000 employees. Group sales in these segments grew by 9.4% over last year, and our voluntary sales in these segments grew by 24%. We also saw a strong improvement in sales at Colonial, increasing 10.4% for the fourth quarter, which is up substantially from the levels we are seeing earlier in the year. We saw a generally good balance in our sales results, but that -- led by strong results in the midsized segment of that market, which are employers with 100 to 1,000 employees. Our commercial sector sales at Colonial grew 12.3%. We in the industry are still experiencing some challenges in the very small end of the market, but even there, there were signs of improvement in the quarter.", "Lastly, our Unum UK sales declined 9.4% in local currency this quarter. Much of that decline though was attributable to tougher comparisons in the larger case market, and our group life sales were even, as you know, raising prices.", "Next, moving to investments. Our investment results continued to be strong, particularly the credit quality of our portfolio. Interest rates and investment yields remain a challenge, with improving treasury yields in the fourth quarter mostly negated by tighter investments spreads. We have continued to -- maintain our investment quality standards and are continuing to adjust our prices in those products that are most interest-rate sensitive.", "And finally, we closed the year on a very strong capital position. We estimate that our RBC ratio finished 2013 just above 400%, and our holding company liquidity position finished the year at $514 million, both well within or exceeding the outlook we provided for the year. I might add that these year end capital levels incorporate the completion of the redomestication of our Bermuda-based captive, which was not contemplated when we initially provided our 2013 outlook in December 2012. Even with this, we have retained significant financial flexibility and in the quarter repurchased $50 million of stock, bringing our total for the year to $319 million, and Rick will have more on this in just a few moments.", "So to summarize, we are pleased with the overall results we saw in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2013. As I discussed at our outlook meeting in December, we believe that we are in good businesses and markets, and we are well positioned to continue to deliver solid results in our ongoing businesses in 2014. We are also -- we also remain intensely focused on actively managing our Closed Block segment, both the operations and capital investment in this business. And our solid financial foundation continues to give us significant financial flexibility to invest in our businesses and return capital to our shareholders, all of which I'm confident will continue to allow us to create value.", "Now I'll turn things over to Rick for a review of our operating results. Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned in his comments, for the fourth quarter, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.85, which is up 3.7% from last year. This brings our growth in operating EPS for the full year to 5.5%. It's a good conclusion to the year where we expected 0% to 6% going into it.", "Looking first at Unum US, operating earnings increased year-over-year, driven by good experience in the group life and the AD&D line and the supplemental and voluntary lines. Group life and AD&D produced very good results this quarter, with operating income increasing by 13% to $62 million. The benefit ratio was improved in the quarter at 70%, reflecting favorable underlying experience. Also, the supplemental and voluntary line reported operating income of $85.8 million for the quarter, up from $83.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Here, too, the benefit ratios for the primary lines of business were also slightly improved from the year-ago results due to more favorable risk experience.", "Turning to our group disability business, we did see lower operating earnings, but this was driven primarily by a reduced level of miscellaneous investment income, which was about $7 million lower year-over-year. The item to focus on is that the risk results in group disability remains quite strong, but the benefit ratio declined to 83.2% this quarter from 84.5% a year ago, as the underlying experience showed stable to lower overall claim incidents and continued favorable claim recovery performance. This has been a positive trend we have seen over several quarters. Overall, it was a good quarter for the Unum US segment overall, with operating ROE for the segment at 13.7% and good momentum going into 2014.", "Moving to Unum UK. Operating earnings were GBP 22.2 million for the fourth quarter, improved from both the year-ago quarter, which was GBP 21.8 million, and up from the third quarter, which was GBP 20.1 million. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are seeing with our UK business, particularly with the repricing and repositioning of the group life business. The operating ROE for the U.K. has improved to 14% for the full year 2013. We still see room for improvement and we are encouraged by the direction of this business. In the fourth quarter, the Unum UK benefit ratio improved to 73% from 76% in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was largely driven by improved performance and margins in our group life line of business. Risk experience was slightly weaker in our group disability line, reflecting slightly higher claim incidents. But overall, I'm pleased with the momentum we're seeing as we go into 2014.", "Colonial Life continues to produce solid, steady results, with operating income at $69.4 million for the fourth quarter. The benefit ratio was stable at 52.4% for the quarter as we experienced favorable risk results in the life product line, which offset some volatility in the cancer and critical illness and accident, sickness and disability product lines. Overall, the underlying profitability of this business continues to be excellent, with an operating ROE for the full year of 16.5%.", "And finally, the Closed Block generated operating income in the fourth quarter of $26.8 million, consistent with our expectations for the segment. The improvement in the interest-adjusted benefit ratio for the LTC line was primarily driven by a lower level of new claim incidents. The increase in the interest-adjusted benefit ratio for the Closed disability block was largely attributable to a slight reduction in the claim reserve discount rate, which did not impact the bottom line.", "I'd like to now move into a discussion of our sales and growth trends. The positive sales momentum that we began to see in the third quarter following the sluggish first half continued into the fourth quarter. We were quite pleased with the sales results we saw in the quarter in our U.S. operations. Beginning with Unum US, total sales increased by 5% in the quarter. The challenges we experienced earlier in the year from the political environment and disruption in certain sectors from health care reform implementation seem to be lessening but are still having some impact in the very small end of the market. Persistency for our primary U.S. business lines remain well within our expectations, but did decline slightly year-over-year. Overall premium growth for Unum US was up 1.4% for the full year. And similarly, our 2014 outlook calls for premium growth for Unum US in the 0% to 2% range.", "In the U.K., sales were down 9% this quarter in local currency. Persistency in the disability line remained relatively stable at approximately 82% for 2013. However, persistency in the UK group life line continued to reflect the pricing actions that we're implementing. And what we have seen is that the lapses are skewed to more poorly performing cases. Also taking into account the group life reinsurance implemented at the beginning of 2013, our UK premium income was down 19% for the full year.", "Our outlook for 2014 is for premium growth of 0% to 2%, with some improvement in persistency in the group life business and overall sales growth for Unum UK in the 4% to 7% range.", "Finally at Colonial Life, we saw a very strong sales for the quarter, an increase of 10.4%, which brought the full year sales growth to 1.6%. Persistency declined slightly for our major business lines, but premium income increased by 3.2% for the full year. Our outlook for premium growth and for Colonial Life in 2014 calls for growth to again be in the 2% to 4% range.", "Having covered our operating trends, I'd like to now review the 2 reserve adjustments we reported in the fourth quarter, beginning with the reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits. You've probably seen over the last several years discussion with regards to the use of the Social Security Death Master File and how insurers are using it. During 2012 and 2013, we began proactively addressing the use of the Death Master File to identify life insurance claims for death within the current year so that we can identify and pay owners of unclaimed life insurance proceeds. In 2013, we also looked at using the Death Master File to search for our potential claims from previous years. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed our assessment of benefits, which we estimate will be paid under this initiative and established additional reserves of $95.5 million for the payment of these benefits. Our earnings release details the allocation of these reserves by our various life insurance business lines with Unum US and Colonial Life.", "The second reserve adjustment is a reduction of reserves related to the group life waiver of premium benefit. Again, for some background, within our Unum US segment, we offer group life insurance coverage, which often includes provision for waiver of premium if one becomes disabled. The group life waiver premium benefit provides for continuation of life insurance coverage when an insurer is no longer paying premium because the employee is not actively at work due to disability. Our emerging experience and that which continues to emerge within the industry, indicate an increase in life expectancies, and at the same time, reflects an improvement in claim recovery rates, which also lessen the likelihood of payment of a death benefit while the insurer is disabled. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed a review of our assumptions and modified our mortality and claim recovery assumptions, which resulted in a reduction of claim reserves of $85 million.", "Touching now on the investment portfolio. The credit quality of our portfolio remains in excellent shape, and the watch list of potential problems continues to be quite low. In the fourth quarter, we saw treasury rates rise, however, that was largely negated by a continuing tightening of corporate credit spreads. So all in all, it continues to be a difficult investing environment, certainly better than this time last year, but we expect to see continued gradual pressure on our portfolio yields. As we have said before, we're not stretching our quality standards to reach for yields, but are working on careful asset selection while adjusting pricing on our liability to reflect the current environment.", "Moving on to an update on capital management. Our statutory operating results continued to be strong. This quarter was impacted by the unclaimed death benefit reserve adjustment. But for 2013, after-tax operating earnings as of this item for our traditional U.S. subsidiaries was $680 million, consistent with our capital generation model. The underlying trend of solid statutory operating earnings remains very much intact. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies was estimated at 405%, above the upper end of our target range of 375% to 400%. And holding company cash and marketable securities was $514 million at year end.", "2013 was an active year on the capital deployment front. We bought back $319 million of stock, including $50 million in the fourth quarter, and raised the dividend by 12%. We also did some things that position us well for the future. This would include freezing the qualified pension plan, which is now in an overfunded position, and the redomestication of our Bermuda sub back to a U.S. domiciliary. This was all done while meeting or beating our capital targets we laid out at the beginning of the year.", "And finally, our 2014 outlook for growth in operating earnings per share is a range of 5% to 10%. No change from our outlook meeting back in December, and many of the results of the quarter reaffirm these views.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments. Tom?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. Before we move to your questions, I'll close by reiterating how pleased we are with our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013. We have good momentum going into 2014 with our ongoing focus on continuing to profitably grow our business through disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management, along with equivalent to maintaining sound risk management and managing our investments and capital; capital that we will continue to use wisely to support our business and return to our shareholders.", "Now this completes our prepared remarks. And operator, let's please move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Mark Hughes of SunTrust.", "Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Can you give us an update on your exchange strategy, how many exchanges you may be on, and then maybe some discussion about how many other providers you might be competing with, how your pricing strategy, how you're approaching this distribution.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Be happy to, Mark. Maybe I'll ask Mike to sort of lead that discussion. But certainly, obviously, Colonial is also part of that too because both businesses are certainly are connected to that whole developing area. But Mike?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Thanks, Tom. Activity and interest in the private exchange market, which I assume you're referring to, continues to increase. But I'd have to say that actual volume of business that's coming through still remains relatively small to date. And the last -- so I think about it as regardless of the pace for the absolute level of adoption that it ends up occurring with our product line on private exchanges, actually, we feel pretty well positioned for a couple of reasons. The first is we've got about 40 plus connections into the benefit administration and enrollment technology platforms that are now forming the basis for the majority of private exchanges. So having put those in place over the last 3 or 4 years, we've actually gotten a good head start. So to your specific question, there's probably about 0.5 dozen to 1 dozen exchanges that we're either on or in the process of getting on.", "A couple of important points. First, in each of those cases, the employer remains heavily involved in selecting the carrier and the types of benefit choices they're making available to their employees. That's important to us. And then, second, and to your question, the product forms and pricing parameters that we're using actually look very similar to what we've got through more standard channels. So we feel good about our ability to manage that risk on a go-forward basis.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Randy, would you like to add anything further to that? Because again, I know we're working -- both businesses are working closely on strategy and implementation.", "Randall C. Horn", "Yes, sure, Tom. We -- first of all, I want to emphasize we are looking at this from an enterprise perspective. So my team is working very closely with Mike's on this in terms of looking at potential partners. A lot of activity, as Mike said, out there, but we are collectively being very selective, very strategic and looking at exchange partnerships. We have somewhere in 0.5 dozen to 1 dozen range actively underway right now. But again, it has to align strategically with our distribution and service strategies. I want to emphasize also, as Mike said, that we are staying very connected to the employer. And the employer's going to be making the selection of carriers and coverages. So again, a lot of activity. We think flexibility is the key. But we feel like we're well positioned in that area going forward.", "Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And then a quick follow-up, Randy. On the Colonial commercial, a nice increase. Why is that looking so much more active lately?", "Randall C. Horn", "Well, I think it really is kind of a process, Mark, where we've been building momentum throughout the year, so really saw some good results in that 50 lives up to 1,000 lives segment in the third quarter. So really, it's just getting good results from the work we've been doing all year. Our field force is very active. I think things are loosening up a little bit at this point. In terms of the Affordable Care Act and implementation there, still some pressure in the very small end of the market, under 50 lives. But again, we're seeing things open up, a lot of interest in voluntary benefits. And I think a general awareness that voluntary benefits fit very well into longer-term benefit strategies.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First, on just your comfort with long-term care reserves, obviously, you took the charge a few years ago in fourth quarter of '11. And at the time, I think you'd assumed that rates would be stable for about 3 years or so and then begin to go higher, but in fact, they haven't. So maybe talk about how you think about your long-term care reserves if rates are close to these levels around at year end this year. And secondly, on persistency in most business lines declined. I'm wondering whether that's because of price hikes you're trying to implement? Or is it just that activity is picking up and more business is being put to bed overall in the market?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, do you want to pick up on the long-term care piece first?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure happy to do that, Jimmy. I think when you look at -- one, we're just coming out of year end in terms of looking at the overall reserves, and so I think that's a marker we'd put out there. We talked oftentimes about interest rates and how we're managing through that across all of our business lines, including long-term care. There is pressure in that line. And if I took you back to 2011 when we first made those comments around interest rates, we talked about the horizon we'd have and the pressures we've seen out there. I think today, we've actually done probably better than we anticipated at that time, but those pressures are out there and real. And I think that what you see in the market today is reflective of that. But I'll also tell you that, I think, when you look at long-term care reserves and as we look forward, there are multiple aspects that we need to look at in that product line, both on some of the things that might be pressures. And you mentioned interest rates, as well as the things that we're doing from an operational perspective to actually mitigate that. And the biggest thing there is, is price increases. Jack, you want to make any comments around the operations in LTC and what we're accomplishing there?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes, so we continue to focus on the operations. We've actually strengthened the claims management process in long-term care, had a very successful year, which you saw are in kind of the steady loss ratio for the year. In addition, we've had great success on rate increase strategies. We're ahead of the goals we set for ourselves in the QTD when we set it up, in particular, that strong results on the group long-term care side, which is important because those premiums go on for a lot longer. And so getting an increase on the group side actually worked more to us over the long haul than getting individual. So we've made progress on the operational fronts and we're continuing to make progress. We'll be filing additional rate increases both on the individual side as well as the group side and are optimistic about our chances of continued growth there.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And Jimmy on your persistency question, frankly, the answer differs a little bit by business and by product within business. Maybe what we'll do is just go around the horn a little bit and each ask -- each business had to speak to it. But Mike, you want to talk at first on the persistency trends in the quarter?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Absolutely. So we saw persistencies in the high 8s, which, in an absolute sense, actually, we're pretty comfortable with. It did come down 1 point or 2 depending on the product line for Unum US from a 90% plus level. I'd say that was abnormally high. And it's a little bit the same -- different sides of the same cords -- coin where we saw a slow -- sales slowdown in the market, that hurt us a bit early in the year from a sales point of view. But it helped us from a persistency point of view as business was moving less frequently, played to our advantage in the renewal program. But if we look at it, persistency in the high 8s to us feels very good. As we look at our renewal inventory headed into next year, we feel good about maintaining to slightly improving that level. And I think, maybe the last point is, importantly, the business that is coming off the books is at substantially lower margins in the business that we're retaining. So in aggregate, we feel pretty good about it.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And maybe, Randy, just to pick up on the persistency trends in your business.", "Randall C. Horn", "Yes, okay. We're continuing to see generally very stable persistency in all of our product segments. It's kind of staying in that high 70s, 79% plus to 80% range, ticked down just a little bit in the fourth quarter, but nothing we're concerned about. Again, very stable by each product segment.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And I think lastly, Peter, I think, you have probably the most do with some repricing actions. And maybe just speak a little bit of how that's affected some of your persistency, especially in group life.", "Peter G. O'donnell", "Thanks very much, Tom. Yes, I would sort of put the persistency into 2 different categories. So I think on income protection, our persistency was bang in line, actually, a little bit better than we expected. We got the rate we wanted. We got the persistency we wanted, and that's gone pretty much almost spot on to plan. On group life, it's a different story. We had more to do on the discipline we had to apply there. What we've done is actually we've outperformed on rates, so we've done better than expected on rates. But our persistency hasn't quite made where we wanted it to get it to. But we have lost the schemes that were most poorly performing, and the competition has picked those up, pick up at the rates that they were going in the marketplace.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And the U.K. book, about 2/3 is repriced as of right now?", "Peter G. O'donnell", "I would say that's about right. I would say the income protection book is pretty much there. The group life book is about 2/3 priced.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Erik Bass of Citigroup.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment for voluntary benefits, particularly as more insurers are focused on the voluntary opportunity and are introducing new products?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Do that, actually, again -- maybe lead us off actually, Randy, as it relates to the things you're seeing your marketplace. And Mike, if could pick up a little bit what we're seeing in the Unum US marketplace.", "Randall C. Horn", "Sure. Good morning, Erik. Very dynamic marketplace without question. There is a lot of competition, a lot of new entrants into the voluntary space. But that just tells us it's important to stay more focused than ever, which we're doing on our core segments. And we just keep introducing the right types of product updates and new product introductions. Our pricing stays very stable. We're not changing that to try to meet competition or buy share. I want to assure you of that. So again, very, very dynamic market, a lot of competitive intensity. But still a lot of opportunity, especially in that smaller end of the market and not nearly as much competition there. So outlook in general is very positive, again, due to growth in the overall voluntary space, and we like our chances in our target segments.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Mike?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "I would echo Randy's comments and you'll see that reflected in the numbers. So in the core market for us, we saw voluntary benefits sales up over 20% in the quarter. I think, importantly for Unum US, we're seeing 33% to 40% depending on the size segment of all our new voluntary customers coming in on top of an existing or new group insurance client relationships. So we feel like that's a unique position that we've got on the -- got in the market and it's helping us with what Randy said is an increasingly competitive market. We do feel though that the outlook is good. And as health continues to change and deductibles continue to go up, that creates the need and the demand for a number of these voluntary products, which is a trend that I think is here for the long term.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And Erik, if I can just add one little piece to this, as you know, we certainly, like everybody, we worry about competition coming into marketplaces, and certainly, we do have some very strong competitors in our market today, and certainly, new entrants into our market. I'll just remind you, we made a commitment to really accelerate our development of this business 5 or 6 years ago and put significant resources into everything from product to distribution to communication tools that I think you're beginning -- you're seeing some of the benefit of that now. So again, not that we don't want to ignore the focus of increased potential in this segment, but we've also been at this for a while too. And we -- as I said, we built some pretty good infrastructure and capabilities in both Unum US and in Colonial. And yes, the reason we chose to focus more energy here back 5 or 6 years ago is we saw the movement from a defined benefit to a defined contribution world, which has very much has played itself out, and so a lot of our focus has been around a theme which has really played itself out and I think it plays to the strength of this company.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And I guess to follow up on that last point. As you're seeing more plan sponsors shift to a defined contribution model offering benefits, how does that affect how Unum has to think about both winning employer benefits contracts but also marketing its products to consumers?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Mike, why don't you take that up? Because again, we spend a lot of time thinking about that. The focus throughout the company is because of what you just said and we believe strongly that, that is the case. That needs to be a much greater focus on understanding consumer and consumer tendencies both buying and why they don't buy actually. And so we're playing that out in both of our U.S. businesses. And Mike, you want to speak a little bit to that.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, the 2 points I'd make are, it actually calls for more active engagement with employers. So when you have a simple DB or employer-funded plan, it can be of more of a transactional business, particularly in the core. As you move to defined contribution, you involve the employee. It means you've got to have stronger relationships. So we've made pretty big investments in our client management team to make sure we're actively consulting with employers on how to design each plan, how to put the right resources in place to educate and handle enrollment. And a big piece of that is what Tom was referring to, which is investments that we've made on understanding consumers in the different segments, putting together product packages and hitting price points that play through those various groups of consumers. So that's probably the biggest stream of investments that we're making is in those enrollment, education and consumer capabilities. I think we're starting to see some of the benefits of that.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "I'll just add one more piece. So the other part of it is too -- and this is, again, where we can -- we have 2 avenues to get to those customers. We're also investing very heavily in that benefit communication and enrollment capability. Because obviously, the more the consumer is being asked to make choice and make decisions for themselves as opposed the employer making them for them, that's an important part of our deliverable too. And so that's actually one of the key things that differentiate, I think, both of our voluntary efforts in the marketplace from some of the new competitors that have come into the market.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Suneet Kamath of UBS.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So I just wanted to follow on a similar line of questioning as it relates to exchanges. I guess in the past on these calls, from time to time, you've talked about the more traditional health insurance companies being more aggressive in terms of price in group life, group disability, et cetera. And as we start to think about the role exchanges may play in group life, group disability, and maybe voluntary benefits, I guess I'm trying to figure out, is there a risk that we might start to see some of the health insurance companies try to bundle a lot of these products on the exchanges and maybe offer a discount to customers or something like that in order to get demand and essentially take some of the business away from companies that don't have sort of a bundled approach?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Mike, you want to take the lead on that one?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Sure. I think there's always a risk that -- you got a new technology or new distribution platform that you want to stay close to and understand a couple of things. First, it's easy to go quickly to how could this displace current distribution channels. So I think it's important to note that in the lines we're in, it's a very underpenetrated market. So today, our industry is only getting to about a coverage level if you take income protection of about 1 out of every 3 workers. So as exchanges come on and they enable you to get to different parts of the working population, I think about hourly workers, I think about part-time workers, those are largely new opportunities and are growth opportunities for us. So there is an interesting angle around overall industry growth through some of these exchange platforms. But to your specific question around health carriers, I think what we're working to do is be part of the major exchanges as they come up, including those that are coming up through health insurers. So we've got a well-established partnership with UnitedHealthcare, for instance, and staying close to developments on that front is a big part of our strategy. If you think about the group and voluntary benefits between Colonial Life and Unum, you've got major market players in major share. And so as exchanges are being constructed, they're looking to the industry leaders to be a part, and that puts us in pretty good stead.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Understood. I guess, I'm just trying to -- and I know we're learning about these exchanges more and more each day. And so, if we don't know the answer to this, then that's fine. But is there anything that prevents a health insurance company, let's say, from just offering a bundled product that does everything, right, health insurance, group life, group disability, voluntary benefits and sort of -- because of volume discounts or something like that, essentially can undercut pricing in the market because they make it up on volume? I just don't know if that's even possible on these exchanges.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, good question. So first thing I'd say is health carriers have always done that. And now, we're talking about a consumer frontier and, but we've been at the employer frontier over several decades. And yes, there is always an interesting sort of bundling story on the health care front. But specialist carriers like us have been very successful in pointing out a superior value proposition. I think, the second point is having a big database that includes a lot of information about how different employees buy and helping to sort of also shape the offering on the front end, but also managed the risk on the back end is a big advantage. So while you could sort of simply discount, if you don't have a good line of sight to okay, for this type of an employer with this type of employee base, you're going to have a hard time. I think, building the right product combinations and managing the risk on the back end.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And Mike -- if I can add to what Mike just said. I think, if you look back to history, there's been time and again discussions of bundling. As Mike said, even today before the exchanges were developed, group carriers -- group health carriers on occasion were getting into the market very aggressively, trying to come in market with in many -- in retrospect, very underpriced offerings to their customers with a set of bundled products, and it just doesn't work actually. And so not that we don't worry about those things, when we think about the competitive landscape. It's obviously a changing competitive landscape. I think you've heard us talk about this on previous calls. We do believe, we need to have a plan for how we've actually connect with the exchanges. As both Mike and Randy mentioned, we certainly do have plans for those. But we also can't ignore the fact that this is probably is not going to substantially change the landscape for distribution, how we communicate with employers and the individual employees. And if it does we're in a good spot, but also we don't want to miss the fact, as Mike said, there's an awful lot of good connections we have right now into the marketplace through distributors, through employers. And frankly, those conversations are continuing businesses as usual, and there's not a fundamental shift actually in how that business is being done. If there is, I think, we're going to be in a good spot. But also, I wouldn't overplay the fact that this is going to be a dramatic change in how things are done in the next several years.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it, that's helpful. Just wondering if you can just shift gears to capital, maybe for Rick, just reviewing your 2014 outlook specifically around RBC. Can you just remind me, why the expected RBC ratio in 2014, is expected to come down versus 2013? I think, you actually were a little bit above the high end of the range you provided at Investor Day. And then second, you have mentioned that you've done some creative things in terms of capital deployment, in terms of pension plan, UPIL, et cetera. Are there any other big sort of ticket items that you might consider for 2014 that might compete with share buybacks?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. The -- In terms of the RBC coming down, I wouldn't pay too much attention to that. We've kind of been stable in our outlook of 375 to 400 over the last several years and that's our outlook for 2014. We actually outperformed a little bit. I think, this year with some better statutory results than we had going into the year. So we we're kind of still in that range, not much to read into that. I think at 375 to 400, we feel very good about the overall RBC position. But with regards to new items coming out there, it's a dynamic world. And I would have told you going into last year some of the things that we did, were not necessarily on the docket and similar to this year, and we're going to react to that, including the amount of share repurchase, we've got a range out there of $300 million to $600 million, and it means that we'll be nimble with whatever the market is giving to us. So we're going to be flexible on that front. The good news is, we do expect a significant amount of capital generation, and we will have opportunities to react to whatever environment, we see.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "You reminded us in your end of year presentation that, that the Closed Block remains an important user of capital, and it's really depressing the ROE of the entire Unum group. Could you give us an update on the following: and we'll talk about the -- whether there's going to be a long-term -- or several analysts, myself included, have talked about whether there's going to be a long-term care reserve increase. What about looking at this from another perspective? Is there a possibility at this point of either releasing capital in any way from this business or enjoying somehow, notwithstanding it being in the Closed Block, a sharp increase in earnings from there?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, you want to start that one? And we'll get Jack involved as well in that response.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, sure. I think, when you look at the -- Eric, when you look at the Closed Block, I think, those points you mentioned around how it will evolve over time, I think are very good ones in terms of how we build the block, how Jack and team are managing it without stealing much of his thunder in terms of -- as those opportunities provide themselves to relive capital, similar to the way we did with our disability block going back several years. And we want to make sure that we are positioned, structured and ready to take advantage of those opportunities, where we can extract capital from this block. I will tell you that we don't see that right now. And as you look out over maybe the next couple of years, probably don't see it. But Jack is definitely positioning the team to be ready for that.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Jack?", "John F. McGarry", "And so, UPIL being redomesticated was a good example of taking our first step and positioning that. We -- the block is still very immature. It's a young block, particularly on the group side. Results are -- can go up and down, I would say. And I think, we would be cautious, given the long-term nature of the block before we would take steps to recognize, I think, fluctuations in earnings or release capital in the block. But also the industry is maturing. So interest rates are getting steadier, more predictable. People are getting more comfortable with the reserve. So it's not happening today, but we're hopeful over the next 3 to 5 years as interest in the variable annuity block intensifies, that makes it over into the long-term care block as well. So we're going to position ourselves that if the capital markets ever do open up for long-term care, we'll be in a position to take advantage of it.", "Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And just as a follow-up on the long-term care, and speaking in terms of a timetable for whether an action would be taken if any is taken, back -- as I recall, back at the end of 2011, when you add to this, I guess, it was the individual business following your exit from the group insurance business, you were making the points as I recall that, while you had a large block, the number of policyholders on claim was relatively small. The number of policyholders in later duration of claims was even smaller still. And therefore, concerns about the credibility of your data, you turned to I guess, it was a newly released study of the Society of Actuaries to help you set reserves. Now, 3 years later, have things changed materially? Do you have many more people on claims that the data is credible? Or to put it differently, as you assess the adequacy of your reserves, do you still need to look to the outside to understand the opening outlook?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Jack, want to give -- pick up on that because I think, you touched on just very, very earlier. but a little more detail on just so the status of our in-force block.", "John F. McGarry", "The number of people on claims with us has been pretty steady actually. It's increased modestly. It's not expected to increase rapidly, over time, high-single-digit kind of increases annually. And a part of that is because old people go on claims. They have high mortality. There is younger people on claim who recover. So we will see steady growth in the claim block. We don't expect to see dramatic growth. We act different than most carriers because we have a big group business. Most of our lives are on the group side. They tend to be much younger. The average age is still under 50 on the group side. And so, we would expect to have a much smaller claim block relative to number of lives insured in the amount of premium we collect than people have written in the older age. And that gets back to that this is going to be a long run, that it's going to be around for a long time. It's going to grow gradually. We don't expect dramatic things to happen at that ages, and we're preparing for that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Finkelstein of Evercore.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Two quick ones. Incidence trends in group disability, how do they compare to kind of normalized levels? How do they compare to precrisis levels?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Let me take that and Mike can add on to that. I think that's a good topic, I think from the incidence levels, so we have a little bit of claims of that actually come in and then claims that ultimately get paid and I think that, that paid side has actually been fairly steady over the -- even throughout the crisis. That's one of the things that we saw is that -- where they actually went through to a paid status was actually fairly steady, probably elevated, slightly through that period of time has probably coming down slightly through this period of time. And I think that's a trend line we like the looks of.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, just to build on, quickly, I'd say the fundamentals of the business are strong. So whether it's paid incidents, which is steady then modestly improved recoveries offsets, those are in very good shape. In the quarter, we had volatility and miscellaneous income but as we sort of think about the business on a go-forward basis on the pricing trajectory, I think, we're in good shape.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Rick, the New York company, any changes in asset adequacy provisions?", "Richard P. McKenney", "No. In the fourth quarter, we went through and actually did not raise any cash flow testing reserves that we have done in the last several quarters. So we think that, that's achieved. Though which was driven primarily in previous years from interest rates, and that's achieved stability around that, so we didn't put anything up in the fourth quarter.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, last quick one. Is if you look at statutory earnings for the quarter, you add back the social security database matching, you actually add back a little bit of an adjustment you made that is kind of is offset at UPIL. Stat earnings are actually pretty strong in the quarter. And I guess, I'm curious if there's anything that was phenomenalistic in that number, or whether, we should be thinking about that as a trend-able number? I know, you talked about kind of the year being kind of in a normalized level at $680 million. But the fourth quarter, if you make those adjustments, were pretty good.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "I think -- Mark, I think, you're exactly right. The fourth quarter was very good and when you adjust for those 2 things. And it reflects many of our comments, which are the risk results across the board are actually looking pretty good and that would generate stronger statutory earnings at the same time. So we're happy with the fourth quarter levels. I think, if you pull out those 2 items, we're -- we actually get up over 700 million for the year, which is moving up faster than we probably expected at the beginning of the year and certainly helps our capital generation model.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "But there's nothing in that number that's going the other direction that we should be thinking through other than maybe just some seasonality?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "No, nothing that I would highlight.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Wanted to see if you guys can talk about what products you're currently offering on the exchanges in the large national brokers? And then of those products, which are the ones that seem to be selling the most? And recognizing, we are still in the early stages here, which is trying to get a sense of the product offerings.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Tom, I would reiterate, we're talking about small volumes that have come through to date. What we've seen most prominently is actually simple employee-funded things like group short-term disability offer on a voluntary basis, group term life insurance on a voluntary basis. To be honest with you, participation has been quite different depending on the employer and the situation. And just another reason to stay close to it as it evolves and I think, volumes pick up here over the course of 2014.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then, you guys, to be certain, you guys don't have a dental or vision product offering on the large national exchanges?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "We do not on the large national exchanges. But we rolled out over the course of 2013, dental as part of a bundled package using a partner. So we're taking that into our core market. And to the extent that an exchange partner's looking for that, we have gotten it on a private label basis.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then as your sense at the I mean, the dental and vision of those kind of the products that at least in the early stages seem to be leading the exchanges at least in conversations you guys are having with some of those brokers?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, those are always of interest. But no, I wouldn't sort of signal that there is a dramatic difference from a basic term life insurance or short-term disability that those sort of all kind of all fit into a similar package.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then Tom, maybe as follow-up to Suneet question on voluntary as well. Curious if you think, we could see kind of some of the big maybe managed-care players that may or may not already have voluntary capabilities, look to make acquisitions. Or do you think, it will kind of look to build out platforms on their own?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes, Chris, it's hard to say. I think, to start with what [indiscernible], lets face it, there's a lot of focus on voluntary for good reason. This is the direction of the marketplace, as I said earlier. This is a place, where we stake the claim out 5 or 6 years ago to make a much more significant commitment to this business. And it's certainly been, and we've been rewarded for doing so. It's also -- it is -- it's a little early to figure out what strategically is going to happen as the results for this, you sense that even with our exchange discussions. It's not real clear, how powerful or important its distribution channel exchanges are going to be. So all kind of struggling with a bit of a new world in trying to figure out, whether what's changed and what's not changed, because it may very well be that some things simply haven't changed. And just on the M&A front, I'd say Rick, it's safe to say, there's not a lot of voluntary businesses that are out there actually. And so, I think more likely than not, when people get in this business, they tend to actually have to build from within, develop relationships with some of the enrollment firms or some of the technology firms that have connections into those exchanges, because there just simply isn't a lot of M&A activity in this marketplace at all. We'll continue to be very active looking at things, but most of these things just don't fit that particular bill. But I don't...", "Richard P. McKenney", "Those that are in the voluntary space today are looking to get bigger. And so, I think that's a dynamic that we see across the board. And so, even if there was a desire to acquire in that front, they'd find scarce opportunities.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And Chris, it might not seem as sexy, but I think, Mike mentioned it, we are actually looking at partnerships. Actually UnitedHealthcare is obviously one. But I do think in addition to people starting businesses, people looking to buy business, of which there aren't many, we're also going to see maybe more partnership link ups that happen as a result of some of these things that are happening in the marketplace. And I think, we crossed that cultural barrier frankly, because that often is not what companies like us in our industry do. But we're in a different spot right now. We developed, as Mike said, relationships on the dental front. We developed relationships with one of the largest health care companies in the country. And I think the partnership angle is also going to be the place you are going to see us continue to play, I think, as we kind of find people who have looked at this marketplace, concluded the cost of entry is too high, need to have it somewhere in their mix of products that they offer their customers, and we can be a very viable partner in a venture like that.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then one last quick one for Rick. you mentioned the pension plan, the funded status there, the freezing of it. Have you explored any other strategies, risk transfer or any other risk management on the block?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. So when we look at our pension plan, Chris, I think that those options are out there and available to us. So we set out there with a, as I mentioned, a slightly overfunded position. And we'll have to look at other ways that we want to de-risk that over time, but nothing on the docket today.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "We'll go to Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Wanted to come back to Rick. The -- just following up on Finkelstein's question about the strong sort of core stat earnings. And if you run rate that, just considering, you're not -- top line's flattish overall, it would appear that, that would pave the way for a pretty strong capital return here, all things equal. And so, if we take the $50 million buyback in 4Q, I assume that was low just because you were dealing with the redom, et cetera. Can we assume a significant pickup in the pace of buybacks here just considering the stat earnings visibility?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, Tom. This is Rick. I don't know if I'd put that one for one in terms of that. But I think, I'd reiterate what both you and Mark have said is that stat run rate is higher to the tune of almost $100 million faster than we thought it would be going into that. So that gives us a lot of flexibility to do different things. Once we have that, we have choices to make around how we redeploy that capital. Share repurchase has been one of the bigger ones that we've used over the last several years. I think, you're right in saying the $50 million in the fourth quarter had a couple of factors that weighed into it. One, we are going through a lot of restructuring with UPIL, et cetera. And so, the second piece, I put into that is we're also dealing with the share price that was a lot higher. As you look at this quarter and where we are, our share price has come down as the market has. Our capital generation has been good. And I think that we feel well situated for a share repurchase as part of our overall capital deployment this year, which puts us back in the $300 million to $600 million range. But it's still early in the year, and we'll see how that plays out. But share repurchase will be part of our plans.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And so no leaning toward low end, high end just in terms of what you know today?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I wouldn't give that to you yet, Tom. But it's only because we're just starting the year and we've been blocked out. And so, we'll start buying back stock when our windows open back up.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a related follow-up. Is another potential use -- and I think, you've already commented on long-term care and that kind of is what it is. But the other thing I've been looking into is just IDI and whether or not that might be another use, just considering I think that's just more of an interest rate issue as opposed to any claims issue. But is that particularly, I think, it's Northwind, which is the larger Closed Block of IDI. Is that a potential use or need for capital if you look out over the next year or 2?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes, Tom. On the IDI block, the Closed Block, I would say to take you back, we haven't really talked as much about it lately because as we structured that block and as we've seen how that's return over the last 7 years since we went into the Northwind structure, it's actually done quite well through a pretty rough period of time. It still continues to look that way, so I don't foresee anything that will cause us to put capital into that. One of the things you might be looking at is in the fourth quarter, we had some miscellaneous income that came in that area. As opposed to letting that flow through, we actually increased reserves for a similar amount, but that's a onetime thing. When you look at interest rates specifically, what we've got in that block is, primarily the cash flows that are coming off of our portfolio are paying claims. So there really isn't any interest rate risk. It's a very well-managed book. You might get the stray item that happens around miscellaneous income. But by no means does that denote that we wouldn't have a capital -- capital call as a result of that.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, you guys don't disclose it anymore on legal entity basis, you give a consolidated statutory numbers. But previously, you had showed Northwind legal entity results in that last quarter, I believe, had lost money. Can you comment on what that did this quarter, whether it's breakeven, lost money, quantum of either?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I can -- actually can't comment on that. I'd tell you it has been volatile. But there is nothing in the results, and I don't have it in front of me. But I think, there's nothing in our results this quarter, which has been or anything that I see challenging within the IDI Closed Block.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "If you step back actually look at Northwind over longer time horizon. I mean, we are what, we paid off roughly half of the outstanding debt associated with Northwind. The cash flows from that block have actually, when you look at it over that period of time, have come in remarkably close to what those expectations were. So again, I just ask us to step back from time to time and look that over that period of time. Its actually, that transactions performed pretty much in line with what we expected.", "Richard P. McKenney", "And we can see volatility quarter-to-quarter. But I think, the bigger things is that over the long term, it's performing as expected.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And again, just to reiterate, that's not a business or not a legal entity that you would expect to be a call on capital over the next few years?", "Richard P. McKenney", "That's correct. And actually, Tom pulled it up. It actually made $10 million this quarter. So you're going to see a little bit of volatility around that, but I think it's fine.", "Operator", "We'll go to Ryan Krueger of Dowling & Partners.", "Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "I just have a quick one. When we look at the Closed Block segment, the $2.7 billion of GAAP allocated equity, how much of that is long-term care versus IDI at this point?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Tom?", "Thomas White", "Ryan, this is Tom White. Roughly, of the $2.7 billion, round numbers, is about $1.3 billion for the closed disability block, $1.3 billion for long-term care, and the rest is a collection of other smaller runoff businesses.", "Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "Okay, great. And on the long-term care piece specifically, as the block ages and reserves increase over time as a result, should we expect the allocated equity to grow? Or how should we look at that?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Jack?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes. I mean, I would expect as reserves grow, the allocated equities are going to grow. So it will mature. It should be funded out of the premiums that the reserve piece. So there is a little bit of a bubble yet to come.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "I think going on the overall block I think, is as that's happening, the disability block as it continues to shrink down, the shrinking and there's capital being released as a result of that. I think you should said, Jack, when you take the 2 together at least for a couple years, it's probably more of an increase as a block. But we're getting to that point, where actually it starts to then flatten out at that point.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John Nadel of Sterne Agee.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "So just wanted to come back to this idea of statutory earnings being in the slightly elevated pace, and maybe get at it a little bit more differently. Fourth quarter, I think, we've seen from just about every group insurance type company so far that results on the underwriting side have been pretty favorable. On an overall basis, especially if you just sort of strip out the Closed Block and look at your ongoing businesses, on an overall basis, was fourth quarter for Unum better than a seasonal typical seasonal good result?", "Richard P. McKenney", "John, this is Rick. If you think about this quarter, we actually had a good fourth quarter last year. And we can have good fourth quarters, so I don't know if I'd take that. I look at it more from a full year basis was actually quite strong. And we saw a little bit of the seasonality improvement in fourth quarter. We did last year as well, but I'm focused more on the full year type numbers.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes, okay. So on a full year basis again, just to clarify, so maybe a little bit to the good on the underwriting side on a full year basis", "Richard P. McKenney", "I think that's right. I think, we have been saying consistently all year long, we are seeing good underwriting results across all of our businesses.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And then just wanted to think about this. Obviously, you pointed out lower miscellaneous investment income in the disability line in the U.S. On an overall company sort of consolidated investment income basis, was miscellaneous income or maybe net investment income overall, was it low, in line, maybe slightly above? Can you characterize that?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, I think, it was actually right in line, John. I think that it actually reported a little bit higher, but we mentioned the Closed Block and how some of that went straight to reserve. So if you net that out, we're kind of tracking right in line with what we usually get on average.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Perfect and then, last one for you is just. Obviously, so much to learn over the next whatever, the next intermediate term around health care exchanges, how the market shifts a little bit. I'm interested, you guys obviously have a great brand in the sort of broker space. Is there -- are you seeing any reason to invest in branding more from a retail perspective as you look at the opportunity and getting closer to the individual employee?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Actually, John, let me ask both Mike and Randy to speak to that. But I think as you heard us talk even on call this morning, one of the things that we've began in a quite some time ago was really much, much better understanding of the consumer -- what drives consumer behaviors and things like that. And from which, then we can make informed decisions but I think about what you just said. And maybe Mike, just talk a little bit how that's relating to Unum US? And as I said Randy, just talk a little bit how that's relating to our Colonial Life operation?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Sure, I like to say that a lots of play out, where we sit today, we look at it and say we see the employer very much involved and their advisers. So I think, you rightly call out the Unum an Colonial Life brand is strong with the distribution. Also strong with employers and professional benefits decision-makers, so that remains a strategic advantage for us. And then if we stack up investments that we can make, certainly brand at a consumer level as an investment that we can make, but actually, we're prioritizing investments in product and capability over that. So as we sort of think about was the next dollar and where is it going to go and where is the best return, we feel quite strongly that having better technology, better education and better product, which is where we are making the majority of investments is still the best ROI for us.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Randy, would you like to add anything to that, Randy?", "Randall C. Horn", "Yes, Tom. I just I'd emphasize what Mike said about the employers still being in the driver's seat. So our promotional and advertising efforts are going to stay focused at that employer decision-maker. But that being said, there is going to be more branding type emphasis at the consumer level as time goes forward. We're in the process of kind of refreshing our brand here at Colonial life at the present time. And we'll be emphasizing that more strongly in the marketplace going forward.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "I think, with this point, we have time I think, Tom, for one more question.", "Operator", "We'll go to Yaron Kinar of Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Question on the holdco liquidity. I think that last year going into 2013, the target was 1x to 2x interest and dividends. And it seems like the $500 million target for this year comes in or below the top end of that range. So curious as to what drove that lower.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "When we look at the holdco liquidity of $514 million, where we ended the year, we actually were in the $500 million to $800 million range. So we're actually within the range as we look at it going into last year. A couple of things to think about with holdco liquidity. One is, we talked in the past about 1x to 2x coverage, and that includes all cash uses, dividends as well as interest payments. And as we look at it now, one of the things that we did last year, which was we put on a credit facility as well for $400 million. so we have significant amounts of liquidity, that which sits in cash and that which is untapped in our credit facilities as well. So I think that probably is fine to drift down below that 2x, although, we can of look at that as part of our overall sources in terms of when we think about capital deployment. So you'll see that fluctuate. And I think the plan we put out there for next year would actually be in a similar range of that $500 million to $800 million.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then is there some sort of rule of thumb you could offer as to how to think of possible margin impact of decreasing retention rates and maybe higher sales?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Not quickly.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Not quickly, yes.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "It's a broad question.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. I mean, we obviously, throughout all our businesses, participation rates and voluntary plans, Mike, I think around here is incredibly important. So we look at it very carefully, but I'm sure sure if there is a good rule of thumb actually on that.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, I think in general, we look at, if the question is persistency versus new sales trade-up, what we'd say is that -- on persistency, where we've seen a point or two deterioration of the margins of that are significantly below the block, so it actually has, not a dampening, but an actually increase in the profitability of that block of business. And in terms of the new business coming on, we're pretty disciplined about the levels that we bring it on. So I wouldn't anticipate material changes in margin based on the mix between those 2 factors at least in group insurance for our business.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And I would just add to, I think, we spend an awful lot of time on persistency. Because obviously part of the challenge is to obtain a new customer. But actually frankly, most importantly is keeping the right customers. And so, when Mike talked and Randy talked about the investments we've made in sales and services and infrastructures and people and training and things like that -- which by the way, we've been through some significant amounts with both of those organizations already this year. A big reason to do so is because is not just getting the sale, but actually the more we can keep business, that's incredibly important part of our ability to generate margins and consistency of our financial performance going forward. So that's very prominent, but there's just no rule of thumb unfortunately, I am afraid, that we can share.", "Thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. And we look forward to seeing many of you at our various upcoming investor conferences and events over the next several weeks. And this will complete our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call.

Tom?", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Tom and good morning. I'll start my comments this morning with just a few observations on the fourth quarter and then Tom White will then review our operating results for the quarter and Rick McKenney will follow up with some of his comments on the quarter including a review of our capital management and investment portfolio results.", "In the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of many of the positive operates and financial trends of the past several quarters and frankly was a very solid year for this company, especially given the difficult economic and business environment. And let me touch on a few highlights I'd like bring your attention.", "First, excluding the net realized after-tax investment gains and losses, we reported $0.66 per share in operating income for the fourth quarter, ahead of last year's fourth quarter of $0.63 per share. The operating earnings of our core operations increased 10%, driven in large part by an 11% increase in operating results in Unum U.S., but also with solid performance in Unum U.K. and Colonial Life. The soft economy and ongoing high levels of unemployment continue to put pressure on our ability to grow the top line, but our risk experience across all of our businesses has remained general stable.", "Second, while our overall sales results for the quarter were below our long-term expectations, we did see some positive trends this quarter. For Unum U.S., fourth quarter 2009 core market sales were down 1%, but for the full year actually grew 8%, a strong achievement driven by increased sales to new customers which offset weaker sales results to our existing customer base.", "Additionally in Unum U.S., we saw a strong pickup in voluntary benefit sales which increased 13% in the fourth quarter. Sales in Unum U.K. remain strong as we continued to benefit from the exit of a competitor in that market and sales at Colonial grew at 4% in the fourth quarter and 1% for the full year, a solid result in Colonial's marketplace.", "Generally speaking, many of the same trends we saw in the first three quarters of 2009 continued in the fourth quarter. The premium income under pressure across all of our businesses as employers are reluctant to add new benefits in this environment and in many cases are reducing employment levels. While we have within very successful in adding new customers, it's only partially offset the pressure felt by the lack of growth within our existing customers.", "Third, the investment portfolio continues to perform well and whereas in the investment quality continues to remain very high. Our net realized investment losses are manageable and Rick McKenney will cover this in more detail in a moment.", "And finally, we continue to build significant financial strength and flexibility. Again, Rick will provide greater detail on our capital position, but we are comfortable -- but we comfortably exceeded our 2009 targets for holding company capital and risk based capital and we are well on our way to meeting our 2010 targets.", "In summary, I feel very good about our fourth quarter results and our position as we move into 2010. Our core operating segments continue to perform well and are generally meeting our expectations. The strong risk results and the margins we are producing reflect our emphasis on disciplined pricing underwriting a risk selection and position us well for profitable growth as the overall economy improves.", "Sales momentum in our targeted markets remains generally positive. Our strong value proposition and broader way of product reported by our commitment to service is serving us well in the marketplace. While the economic and competitive conditions may continue to adversely impact premium growth, we will remain disciplined and will not stretch for growth.", "Our investment portfolio continues to remain in excellent shape. And finally, with our strong balance sheet and excess capital position, we have significant financial flexibility which we continue to believe is a valuable asset, especially in today's economic environment.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Tom White who will provide an overview of our operating results for the quarter. Tom?", "Tom White", "Thank you, Tom. Net income for the fourth quarter was $199.4 million or $0.60 per diluted common share compared to net income of 41.8 million or $0.13 per diluted common share last year.", "Included in the results for the fourth quarter of '09 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $18.9 million or $0.06 per diluted common share compared to losses of $167.6 million or $0.50 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter 2008. These amounts include the change in fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified co-insurance arrangement which resulted in a fourth quarter 2009 realized after-tax investment gain of compared to a $120.1 million after-tax loss in the year-ago quarter.", "Net realized after-tax investment losses related to sales and write-offs of investments were $41.6 million in the fourth quarter of '09 compared to $47.5 million in the year-ago quarter. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $218.3 million for the quarter or $0.66 per diluted common share compared to 209.4 million or $0.63 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.", "Now moving to the operating results. In total, the Unum U.S. operating income increased 11.2% to $203 million in the fourth quarter. Within Unum U.S., the group disability line reported another strong quarter with income up 22% to $72.6 million.", "We continued to see improvement in the benefit ratio which declined to 84.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 88.7% in the year-ago quarter and 85.3% in the third quarter this year. A number of factors continue to drive this improvement including favorable business mix shift, net favorable claims experience and ongoing adherence to pricing discipline.", "Premium income declined 6% in the quarter reflecting in large part the impact of today's high level of unemployment on the natural growth of our business. The Unum U.S. Group Life and AD&D line operating income in this line declined to $47.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $50.3 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by lower premium income which declined by 2.6% and a slightly higher expense ratio. This quarter's been fit ratio of 69.9% was stable compared to the 70% benefit ratio in year-ago quarter.", "The Unum U.S. supplemental and voluntary business lines fourth quarter income was strong growing 14% to $82.7 million, all three primary business lines, that is the individual disability recently issued, the long-term Caroline and the voluntary benefits line had year-over-year improvement in operating income.", "Reported sales on a fully insured basis for Unum U.S. declined by 2.8% in aggregate. As Tom highlighted, core market sales for our group lines, which are LTD, STD, Group Life and AD&D combined, declined by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, but for full year 2009 sales in the core market increased by 8%.", "Sales in the large case market for these lines declined 7.7% in the fourth quarter, but grew by 1.2% for the full year. So, the mix of core market to large case sales in 2009 is 68% in the core market and 32% in the large case market.", "The supplemental and voluntary lines reported a combined sales decline of 2.6%. The voluntary benefits line had improved sales this quarter, increasing 12.6% over a year ago, with particularly strong sales in the under 2000, life segment of the market where VB sales increased 20% in the fourth quarter.", "Moving to Unum U.K, operating income in this segment increased 12.3%, to $61.3 million in the fourth quarter. The strengthening of the British pound provided a benefit to this quarter's result, as income in local currency increased by 8.7%. The underlying operating performance in the U.K. remains very healthy, with before tax operating margin of 34% in the fourth quarter and 36% for the full year.", "The benefit ratio in Unum U.K. declined to 59.6% in the fourth quarter, from 63% a year ago. New claim incidents trends and claim recovery performance in the group long-term disability line were generally favorable relative to a year ago, while risk experienced in the Group Life line were slightly worse.", "Fourth quarter sales remained very strong increasing 48% in local currency, as we benefit from the exit of a competitor in the U.K. group risk market. Looking into 2010, this benefit will not persist as the majority of that available business has been placed and we expect to see more challenging sales comparisons again next year in 2010.", "Our Colonial Life, concluding our core operations, Colonial Life finished a strong year with growth in fourth quarter operating income of 3%, to $68.3 million. Premium income in Colonial Life grew 3.3%, while the benefit ratio of 48.5% this quarter was slightly elevated compared to the benefit ratio of 48.3% a year ago.", "Sales at Colonial Life continued to be encouraging, despite the difficult economy and business environment, increasing 3.7% in the fourth quarter and 1.1% for full year 2009.", "Many of the same trends we have discussed with you throughout 2009 continue this quarter, with strong new account growth of 17.9% in the fourth quarter, compared to a year ago.", "We also saw favorable sales growth of 15% this quarter in the public sector, an important market for Colonial Life which contributes about a quarter of its sales. Recruiting continues to remain strong, with growth in new rep contracts, up 36% this quarter and 32% for full year 2009.", "And finally, average weekly producers increased by 7.9% in the quarter, compared to a year ago. Moving to the individual disability close block segments, operating income here was $5.8 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $7.1 million a year ago.", "The interest adjusted loss ratio was stable at 81.6% this quarter, compared to 82.6% a year ago and also 81.6% in the third quarter of '09. Premium income declined by 8.3% and net investment income declined by 3.4%.", "Finally, the corporate and other segment reported an operating loss of $16.6 million, compared to a loss of $400,000 in the year-ago quarter.", "Expenses are higher in this segment, reflecting approximately $10 million of incremental quarterly pension costs. Interest expense increased to $31.1 million in the fourth quarter of '09, compared to $26.9 million a year ago, reflecting the debt issue from late September.", "So with that review of our operating results, I'll turn to Rick McKenney for a further analysis of this quarter's results, Rick.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, John. As you can see, consistency remains a key theme to our fourth quarter results.", "I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss key drivers of this quarter's results and also provide an update on our investment portfolio and capital position. First, steady risk experience across our major lines of business continues to be the primary driver of our strong operating performance.", "We commented in the third quarter that we saw a slightly higher level of volatility in claim incidents in our U.S. group disability line. Claim incidents continue to be slightly volatile in the fourth quarter but less so in this quarter relative to the third quarter.", "We continued to experience favorable net claims recovery results which, along with the ongoing shift in the mix of business, resulted in further improvement in the benefit ratio this quarter. We anticipate that the benefit ratio in this line will begin to level out in 2010, with further long-term improvement, primarily coming from mix shift changes.", "Over the past four years, since the implementation of many changes to our claims management processes, the benefit ratio has declined over 9 percentage points. While at the same time, our customer satisfaction ratings have also improved materially.", "In the U.K, risk results were also generally in line with our expectations. Our fourth quarter claim experience for group long-term disability was in line with the incidents and recovery trends of the third quarter. However, Group Life experience was slightly worse than prior quarter results.", "We believe this quarter's risk results are more indicative of the trends we'll see in 2010 than the extraordinary favorable results we experienced in the first half of 2009.", "Colonial Life's risk results also remain in line with our projections with favorable results in the accident, sickness and disability lines, offset by slightly higher claim experience in the life and cancer and critical illness lines. The overall benefit ratio for the segment came in at 48.5%.", "Turning to our top line performance, we described the challenges faced in today's environment of high unemployment and ongoing market competition to grow our top line. These trends remained evident in the fourth quarter and provided meaningful headwinds to each of our businesses. For example, we estimate that the natural growth of our Unum U.S. inforce business, that is the premium growth we normally generate from customer growth, salary increases and benefit plan enhancements, resulted in over a 3% decline in our block in 2009, compared to the expected growth of 2 to 3% we typically experience in a more normal economic environment.", "The impacted premium income in our group lines by this actually impacted premium income in our group lines, by approximately $200 million in 2009. This will turn with the economy and improved employment levels. I'm encouraged as well by our new account growth and generally stable persistency trends which bode well for resumed top line growth as economic conditions turn more favorable.", "I'm also encouraged by the improvement we saw in Unum U.K. with fourth quarter premium income rebounding from decline we experienced in the third quarter and this was the first sequential quarter improvement in premium income we've seen in the past six quarters. The recent increased sales activity and firming up persistency in 2009 has helped stabilize our in-force premium.", "Thirdly, our investment portfolio remained strong again this quarter, reflecting the ongoing rally in the fixed income markets both in terms of spreads and improvement in default trends. For reference, the spread on Barclays U.S. investment grade credit index is tightened further to 157 basis points in December from 198 basis points at September 30th. This tightening was offset by widening of the U.S. ten year Treasury rate by 53 basis points.", "The net unrealized gain position on our fixed maturities securities portfolio reflects these movements and with $2 billion at year end 2009 compared to $2.2 billion at September 30. With this stability in the investment portfolio, the company's book value per share was similarly stable.", "Book value per share was $25.62 at December 30th 2009, a sequential increase of 3% from September 30th and 33% higher than a year ago. In the fourth quarter our reported net realized investment losses excluding the embedded derivative gain of $20.7 million after tax totaled $42 million after tax.", "This after-tax realized loss this quarter compares to 19.4 million in the third quarter and 47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The losses this quarter were primarily related to impairments on certain holdings of securities in the financial institution sector.", "As we look forward, we expect a level of reported net realized investment losses to improve as unrealized losses on credits on our watch list has dropped by 85%. One area that continues to receive more attention in the world around us is exposure to commercial real estate and mortgage loans. First of all, we have no CMBS exposure and our commercial mortgage loans currently total $1.4 billion or around 3% of our investment portfolio.", "At year end 2009 we had one delinquent loan with a book value of $2 million two foreclosed properties where we expect to fully recoup our principal. We only had nine loans maturing this year and in fact we only average $30 million of loan maturities per year for the next four years. Our current loan to value ratio is approximately 69% and our portfolio is well diversified with respect to geographic distribution and property type and our underwriting standards have remained conservative.", "We're confident that our portfolio is well positioned and that any losses we may incur will be manageable. When turning to our capital position the solid investment performance and good risk results not only produced strong GAAP earnings this quarter, it also generates strong statutory earnings in our traditional U.S. life insurance companies.", "Fourth quarter 2009 after-tax stat operating earnings were 246.6 million which brings our full year after-tax operating earnings to over 740 million. These strong results which also reflect some inter-company dividends are outlined in our statistical supplement and drive very positive momentum in our capital management metrics and overall financial strength and flexibility.", "As a result of this strong earnings profile we estimate that our year end RBC for our traditional U.S. life companies, traditional life subsidiaries was 382%. Looking ahead, we continue to expect to manage our RBC ratio during 2010 within a range of 375 to 400%.", "Holding company capital finished the year $915 million, ahead of our expectations and leverage at year end 2009 was 20.5%. We have no debt maturing in 2010 and with a small contribution our pension underfunding is down to $77 million.", "You can see from these results that Unum's financial and cay capital positions remain very strong. As we discussed with you at our investor meeting back in November, we've had a conservative stance regarding deploying our excess capital specifically through share repurchases.", "We do recognize the cost of maintaining this posture and continue to reflect on the environment and its contribution to making these decisions. To be more specific, the primary factors that will influence our thinking include macro level impacts such as our assessment of general economic and business conditions in the U.S. and the U.K. and the investment environment and potential impacts on our portfolio.", "We'll also take into account the outlook for our businesses which include the level of our statutory earnings and free cash flow and finally, we will evaluate our ongoing capital levels including RBC and holding company capital.", "We feel well situated beginning 2010 and we will monitor these factors as we move through the year. All in, it was another very good quarter for the company with solid operating performance and further strengthening of our financial platform and flexibility.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. I think as we all shared with you this morning we're certainly very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results and I'm especially, Rick \u2013 I\u2019m extremely proud of the work our people have done to help us deliver these results.", "Profitably growing our top line remains challenge for us in this environment, I am encouraged by the underlying trends we're seeing in new customer account growth and persistency both of which bode well for presumption of premium growth as better employment conditions emerge.", "While top line growth is important, I can assure you that we will remain disciplined in our pricing and underwriting to protect the margins that we worked so hard to restore over the past year.", "It is comments Rick outlined several factors that will drive our capital management strategy and the potential redeployment of our excess capital. While general economic and regulatory conditions remain uncertain, our fourth quarter results were certainly very strong relative to these factors.", "Our risk experience and operating trends remain strong, our statutory earnings are historically high level. Our year end RBC of 382% and holding company capital position of $915 million are comfortably within our projected levels for yearend 2010 and our watch list of potential problem credits has declined significantly in 2009 which is again why we choose so good about the things that we can control.", "A final comment before we go to your tune to your questions. With respect to our outlook, we continue to expect operating earnings growth for 2010 within our previous expectations of growth of 4 to 6%. I would direct you to our investor meeting presentation of November for additional detail on our business segment outlook.", "This completes our formal comments and operator let's move to question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) We'll go ahead and take our first question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thank you very much. Good morning.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "The core group sales have been very strong for the full year, little bit of a deceleration in the fourth quarter. Anything notable there, little more competition as to why you might have slowed a bit?", "Tom Watjen", "Sure, Mark. Let me ask Kevin to take that one.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Good morning.", "Kevin McCarthy", "You recall that during the first half of the year, our sales were up considerably and I think generally speaking the rest of the industry was down. In fact, through the third quarter where we also reported that disability and life sales were flat to down whereas ours were up. So we expected an increase in price competition during the fourth quarter and in fact we saw it beginning in the third quarter and stretching into the fourth quarter. Average price levels looked like they were going down in the market and I think that affected our core sales a lot during the fourth quarter.", "Nevertheless, I think we had a pretty strong quarter. We had a strong full year. We're positioned very well I think for 2010. Our business mix is running well. Customer satisfaction ratings are high. And I would expect that as the economy recovers also upgrades in benefits or what we call MBOC, our new business on old accounts will also I think improve in the latter half of 2010 and that lagged significantly all during 2009 including during the fourth quarter. So for the most part, I think we're in a good place.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay. And then the uptick in the colonial cancer claims, was that a frequency issue or was that a pricing issue? Is that -- are you seeing it across most cancer policies?", "Tom Watjen", "Tom White, you want to take that one?", "Tom White", "Yeah. Mark, it's Tom White. It's really kind of embedded in some older policies that we have there and we've initiated some pricing actions to address that.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Colin Devine with Citi Investment Research.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "Good morning.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Colin.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "Well, I guess I'll put Kevin on the spot a little bit to talk about where we stand with simply Unum, you were kind of quiet on it this quarter and how that roll-out is going. And then I guess Tom, the other question now with the mix shift having sort of played itself out, probably taken about as much out of expenses as you can. Where else is growth going to come from for Unum beyond just a rebound in the economy? You talked about perhaps getting into some other products. That was going on and on about how successful dental's been for them in the group business and they seem to be competing with you side-by-side. Is it time now to talk about product expansion and that's obviously simply Unum but perhaps some other products and using capital to accelerate that?", "Tom Watjen", "Kevin, first one on the Simply Unum roll-out.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Good morning, Collin. Simply Unum is going very, very well for us. During the course of the year, we had good and steady progress in terms of growing account acquisitions through simply Unum. I think something like a quarter of our under 500 life business was put on that platform in the group business and more than a third of our core VB business was put on that platform. As we look at that business strategy with Simply Unum, a primary element of it is to provide increased purchasing -- pricing flexibility for employers by combining employer paid in a pre-pay coverages. And we saw a significant increase during the course of 2009 in package sales involving both group and voluntary benefits. And I think that strategy seems to be playing out well for us.", "During the fourth quarter, we introduced an expansion of our offering there where we provide additional funding flexibility and group disability for the packages of employer and employee funding. We test marketed that in four offices and had outstanding results in those four offices. We'll be rolling that enhancement out during the first quarter of 2010. So good solid steady progress in the core market in terms of new account acquisition through our Simply Unum platform.", "Tom Watjen", "And Colin, if I could pick up on your second question, then I'll ask the business heads to embellish a little bit but your question is really about where the growth is going to come from. As I look back at 2009, I'm especially pleased to see that we've actually across all of our businesses had very good new account growth. So the good news is your value proposition, our product deliverables, our people, those sorts of things are leading us to build additional customer relationships across each of our businesses and certainly, we could use an uplift in the employment picture to help get some of that natural growth back into the system. But certainly from my point of view, I'm very, very encouraged by the ability to attract new business in this environment without compromising any of our risk or those sorts of disciplines. Kevin, you talked about Simply Unum. I think it's safe to say in Unum U.S., for example, there are other initiatives under way, some of which have a little bit of product extension point of perspective to it. But I think there's good growth in things we're doing just in the normal course.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Thanks Tom. During the course of the year, let me just reflect quickly on 2009. Our new group account growth, the premium growth was 20% for the year. Our new core VB growth in premium was 18% for the year. So in our strategic growth areas, I think we're doing pretty well. Most of our lag in sales in total sales was reflected really more in two key areas. One as I mentioned earlier, so-called MBOC, upgrade in benefits which were down significantly for the year. In group they were down 19%. That can sometimes account for 25% to a third in our overall sales. And so that decline shows up in the overall sales picture. We would expect that to recover during 2010. And then our other declines in sales were more reflective of lines of business that we are being extremely cautious with, those lines being individual disability income, in this economy and also long-term care.", "So in terms of growth, I think as we look forward, growth's going to come from our business strategy. It's going to come from core group. It's going to come from packages with voluntary benefits. It's going to come from a recovery in MBOC and then as the economy recovers on the top line earned premium, we also should start to see an elimination of the drag that we had from lack of normal growth in 2009.", "Tom Watjen", "If I could shift, actually, Randy, maybe speak to Colonial. Let me just say that I think for Colonial, one of the great growth segments for us as Tom mentioned in this comment is the public sector. I think public sector sales were up almost 12% for the full year. So again, we are seeing growth in the existing businesses and I think Randy your new account growth was up about 13% for the year. But anything you want to add to that. We don't need to get too far a field for us to really see growth from your business, maybe it's more laser like focus around those areas that I mentioned.", "Randy Horn", "Yeah. That's exactly right. Tom, we still feel very optimistic about our conventional value proposition, packaging our individual products with our enrollment and benefits communication capabilities, primary focus on growth. Collin, as we discussed in the past is around growing our agency system and developing them more effectively. We've had very strong trends in all those areas over the last couple of years. Our new rep recruiting level was up over 30% again in 2009 and that's two back-to-back years growing our agency system at that level. We continue to see good strong production from those new reps.", "As Tom pointed out, very strong new account growth. Average weekly producers is growing close to 8% in the fourth quarter of 2009. So, we're very encouraged about the opportunity and just think we need to stay focused on growing distribution, stay focused on our core commercial market and public sector whereas Tom said we've seen very, very good growth there. So with a little help from the economy, we think there's great opportunity out there for us.", "Tom Watjen", "Lastly, Collin, just Unum U.K., very much I think Susan, similar sort of approach, staying the course. We are seeing obviously some hyper growth that comes from a competitor exiting the marketplace. But even beyond that there's a lot of focus on repositioning a couple of products in some of the services. You may want to speak to that.", "Susan Ring", "Yeah. Sure, Tom. You're right. We did benefit from the exit of ex-AEGON across the 2009 and that gave us an increase in our sales results of over 40% versus last year. But even if you exclude that, our sales growth versus 2008 came in just slightly under 10%. And so we did to see good results and certainly to the key sales drivers showed improvements in terms of close rates, case counts and average premiums. And similar to Kevin's story where we didn't see sales growth come through with regards to upsell to our existing clients so due to economic reasons and we were sort of falling short on that.", "In terms of growth for 2010 and beyond, we're really looking to deepen and widen the penetration and as our products across the market and also within employers, seven out of -- one in seven employees are covered by our products and so we still have to widen the penetration. We've got a great opportunity to do that. And the ways in which we'll do that, we're making changes to our existing offering and what we have to offer currently is really right at the forefront of the market. We want to make sure that we stay that way. So we're refreshing our group long-term disability offering during the first half of this year and we have, again, plans to revamp and refresh and relaunch our Group Life offering. We did that during the course of 2009 and that showed some nice, strong improvements this year as a result.", "We also have some technology changes to support our small to medium case proposition which we think will provide us with further opportunity. We have a new focus segmentation model and there are some new segments that we're working on developing a new proposition for where we again have identified some good opportunities and we have a customer segmentation model to help us target new employers.", "And in addition to that, you've raised a question about Simply Unum and as you know we've been working on a new proposition to launch to the U.K. market to really take advantage of that platform and roll that out so that we're able to target new segments and that's very much on track for launching during the course of this year. I think those, Tom, are the primary areas of the U.K.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "Okay.", "Tom Watjen", "And Colin, if I could just close. I think, hopefully you sense from the businesses, whereas we certainly would love to see the economic environment improve, especially around employment. We're certainly doing a lot of things within our businesses and things that we know and can control to ensure we continue to grow and build our presence in the market place.", "Staying disciplined, staying with the things we know. I'd say there are a couple things that maybe fall in the category which is product extensions but that's not really the primary focus. The primary focus is continuing to drive home some of the things we've been talking about the last couple of years.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "Thanks. And just a quick follow-up, do you expect to be able to recommend to the Board a dividend increase this year?", "Tom Watjen", "Well, if could step back. I think as you know, we feel very fortunate, Colin to be in a position to have the excess capital that we have. And as you know, very few, or any actually other companies in our industry are in the position that we're in. If you look back to the pattern of behavior that we as a company have exhibited over the last couple of years with the Board, as you know in 2008 we had a share repurchase.", "Last year, we raised the dividend by 10%. So, those are all happening at times when the vast majority in our industry really pulled back from those kinds of commitments and so. I guess that you have that sort of context, they think about the question you just raised. As I mentioned in my comments, we feel very good about the operating performance in the business.", "There continue to be some uneconomic and regulatory uncertainties out there. So we're not going to be held to a time frame but I think we know there's a cost to continue to have excess capital like we do and hopefully, again, our behavior and our actions in the past show that we recognize that we've got to put capital back in the hands of our shareholders and we'll do it, when we feel we've got, the things are lined up properly.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "Thanks a lot, Tom.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to dig on the Colonial sales a little bit more. There's a trend here where sales seem to be better last several quarters relative to your largest competitor. And I guess when Randy Horn was talking, it seemed like the agency focus there was maybe the key. So, just too curious to explore that a little bit more and also to get the kind of agent recruiting number for the fourth quarter specifically?", "Tom Watjen", "Randy Horn, you want to take Randy's question.", "Randy Horn", "Sure, Tom. Hi, Randy. Yeah, just going from the back of that question, our new agent recruiting was up 36% in the fourth quarter, up over 32% for the year and that's on top of a 30% plus increase in 2008. So we've had very consistent focus and great results in terms of agent recruiting.", "We're working very hard to develop those new people effectively. That's led to opening of a lot of new accounts. Randy, again in the fourth quarter, we were up almost 18% in terms of the number of new accounts. We're seeing some excellent results there. We had some headwinds early in the year, really going through the first three quarters, actually, in terms of selling new products to existing cases.", "We saw some improvement in that in the fourth quarter and actually moved into positive territory in terms of that NBOC number and again, I just see, I wanted to mention public sector as well, Randy. I think Tom mentioned we were up almost 15% in our public sector sales, excellent results in the educator market, for example.", "So, I think it's just overall a result of good focus, growth in our agency system and continuing to develop those new people effectively.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. That's helpful. But there hasn't been -- there's been no change in your product or pricing or anything like that?", "Randy Horn", "No. No. There has not been any significant. We continue to refurbish our product portfolio. We did release a new critical illness product in the second half of 2009 and that's been very successful but no significant change in our pricing levels.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. And then just one other clean-up item, if I could. I think Rick had mentioned that the benefit ratio for the fourth quarter would be more reflective for Unum U.K. of what we're going to see in 2010. The seasonality in the fourth quarter is a little high in the U.K. So, was it more like the second half '09 benefit ratio we should think about or was it that fourth quarter number?", "Rick McKenney", "I think it's more the fourth quarter number. I think when you look at the first half, certainly we're much better. Third quarter we talked about at some length, some one time effects going into that number. So I think fourth quarter is fine to launch off.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you.", "Randy Horn", "Thank you, Randy.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Hi. Thanks.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Jimmy.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Good morning. It seems like your commentary on market conditions and pricing is a little bit more cautious than it was even in the last quarter and earlier last year, but wondering if Kevin has some thoughts on this.", "And secondly, not trying to pin you in terms of timing but just on capital deployment, you mentioned $915 million of holding company capital, strong RBC. What are you looking to see in terms of either your own results or the macro environment before you start deploying some of this capital either towards buybacks or something else?", "And then just in terms of timing, how long would you have to see a stable environment for you to start taking some action?", "Tom Watjen", "Kevin, you want to take the question, market place sort of question up?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yeah. Thanks Tom. Good morning, Jimmy. As I mentioned during the first half of last year, we were significantly ahead. I think a lot of our competitors were significantly behind. We expected that to correct itself to some degree during the second half of the year. Especially with the more aggressive competitor pricing actions and as many of our competitors sort of settled down on some of their balance sheet issues.", "And that's exactly what we saw in the second half of the year. We saw our competitors defending their in force business much more aggressively, making therefore share capture more difficult. We saw pricing levels go down. In fact during the fourth quarter, year-to-date to the third quarter, our closing ratio on sales was up year-over-year.", "And during the fourth quarter, our closing ratio in comparison to fourth quarter '08 was down 17%. We didn't change our pricing levels and we didn't change our sales goals and sales objectives but we did just maintain discipline and diligence around underwriting pricing levels during the fourth quarter and I think that showed up in the comparison in the sales results in the fourth quarter.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay.", "Tom Watjen", "Rick, you want to take up the follow-on question that Jimmy raised around capital.", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah. I'll be happy to. This is Rick McKenney. With regard to the share repurchase, if you look at capital deployment in general, first you have to start back with the fact that we are in a very fortunate position with the excess capital that we do have. We have had a conservative stance if you look at what the world look like over the last years. I think we are not rushing to return our free capital to shareholders too quickly, it was the right answer when we talked to investors in November.", "And it's still the right answer. I would say from a trend perspective, two things really have improved. The world around us does seem a little bit better, although far from healed and our capital does continue to build, so.", "We will factor those trends in with our Board of Directors, when we discuss with them and continue to discuss with them when we will redeploy capital if we don't have other uses for it. Whether it's through dividend, as Tom talked about, M&A or through share repurchase.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Darin Arita with Deutsche Bank.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Darin.", "Darin Arita \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. I guess just as I think about the RBC ratio being at 382 and it's already within your year-end target of 375 to 400, would that mean that your holding company liquidity should end the year around the high end or above that high end of the target range of 1 to $1.3 billion?", "Tom Watjen", "Kevin, you want to take that one?", "Kevin McCarthy", "I think that's fair assumption as we continue to generate statutory earnings within the company and start to push our RBC levels up towards the top of the range. As you mentioned, we're in that range today. That free cash will go to the holding company and should continue to build. Looking at our statutory earnings over the last couple years and will give you a sense of our expectation as we'll continue to generate strong earnings and capital.", "Darin Arita \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "All right. That helps. And in terms of the U.K., the life sales have been strong but I think you mentioned, Susan, even that even ex-AEGON, the sales were up and was just wondering kind of what's driving that? I know you mentioned the Group Life market had been very competitive in the past.", "Tom Watjen", "Susan, you want to take that?", "Susan Ring", "Yeah. Sure, absolutely. I mean, we have reorganized and changed the focus with regard to our sales force so we made quite a lot of change there's. We changed the components and really we focused on all of or different product lines and so as I mentioned close rates have improved right across sort of our products, group products and case count improved to gain right across the board and average premiums are up so really we've been focused on all products, not just Group Life. And we've made some good, positive results and so we've just been very targeted, very focused and worked on relationships where we have very strong relationships across the market and as mentioned, there is some new areas that we intend to progress for 2010 and such as some bigger segments, we've identified three where we don't quite have the penetration and support that we would expect to. But we have very closely with our distribution partners and we've got results pretty much across the board.", "Darin Arita \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "All right. Thank you.", "Susan Ring", "Does that answer your question?", "Darin Arita \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes. That was very helpful.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Darin.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Tom.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I guess I'd like to start on capital and just may be how strategically you're thinking about it. The -- when I look at importance of ratings for your business, I think you've clearly shown you can operate pretty successfully with where you are. Is there truly consideration right now for continuing to harvest capital, potentially getting upgrades and seeing an impact on your growth rate from that angle? Is that really in the mix right now? Or is it truly just -- are you just wanting to make sure the economic environment clears before you start getting more proactive? Because I'm just looking at the absolute levels and just wondering at what point do you have to start pulling the trigger? Is it when excess capital's 20% of your market cap? Because I think it is getting to pretty extreme levels right now. So anyway, that's my first question.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Tom, let me start and then I'll ask may be Rick and Tom to pick up. Your last point, we feel the same way. We recognize the wholesome nature of our capital position right now is starting to get to the point where right from the starting more and more questions are going to be asked about what we want to do it. I think as Rick said in his comments, what we do want to do is just be very careful. We still believe it's an incredibly valuable asset to have excess capital these days and has we want to be different things when we will be considerations for. We want to be very thoughtful about that and some of those considerations are things that are outside the operating sort of purview if you look at company and thus the environment is something we have to factor in. Obviously the rating agencies, Tom Watjen are certainly going to be part of that too. I don't know if you want to touch on where we are with the rating agencies that\u2019s only the consideration. I didn\u2019t want to make at selling for driving consideration.", "Rick McKenney", "Yes. It's Rich. Thanks, Tom. It's not really a driving consideration at all. Just kind of where we are in terms of discussions with rating agencies, we had with two of the agencies we had annual reviews kind of at the back end with 2009. With the other two we'll wait probably until sometime in April or May to have annual review meetings and certainly every quarter it's our practice the week before we report the earnings to go through the results with the rating agencies so they see what's going on in there.", "Yeah, this time of year, we tend to kind of fine-tune our business plan. We fine-tune our capital management plan and that's something that we'll be presenting to them. It's clearly a little frustrating from our perspective. We think we've posted some very strong results. The ratings at this point we don't think necessarily reflect that. There's not a whole lot we can do about it other than continue to operate the business the way we have and continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and a substantial amount of flexibility and ultimately that will come through in higher ratings. But I think you raise a great point in that we have operated very well with these ratings. If you think back over the last five years, I think we had only had one ratings upgrade which is S&P a couple years ago and it really -- it's not a significant headwind to sales or our perception in the marketplace right now.", "Tom Watjen", "And also, just maybe Tom add too, even though certainly as we've said to the group before in previous calls, we want to continue to keep our eyes open for acquisitions that fit within the framework of the things we're looking at. I also don't want to think, we're not warehousing capital for those sorts of things. We certainly take that -- we've got obviously as I said before substantial amounts of excess capital. The environment and the factors that we can control as well as the ones on the outside that we can't control and are in such a position that we can make another step towards continuing to return capital to shareholders as we've done the last two years.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got it. That's helpful. Couple of other questions. One is, can you comment a bit on how we should be thinking about your margin of safety and reserves, vis-a-vis discount rate. Obviously, low interest rates and lack of ability to get good yield on new money is a headwind but can you update us as to what that margin looks like and I don't know if you can give us any perspective on new money discount rate versus in force and what those levels are.", "Tom Watjen", "Tom White, you want to pick that up?", "Tom White", "Sure. Just a few numbers about where we are and the numbers I'll quote are for our Unum U.S. LTD business. Keep in mind, we look at this on every different line of business by company and by line of business so there are a lot of different portfolios that we manage because they're different cash flow characteristics and duration characteristics. But just focusing in on one for Unum U.S. LTD, we have a 92 -- we currently have a 92 bases sis point margin between the portfolio yield and the aggregate discount rate on the claims. And that's made up of a portfolio yield of 6.74% currently and the aggregate discount rate is a 5.82%.", "Now, for new claims that come in, we use a much lower discount rate when we set up those reserves. Now, we don't disclose what that is, because it is part of our pricing formula and we don't like to talk about assumptions that go into our pricing formula. So that's where we stand today. I'll note that in the third quarter, that margin was 91 basis points. So we expanded by 1 basis point over that period of time.", "Now, the way we manage it is to really look at it over a much longer period of time because that 92 basis points is good to know at this point but what's more interesting to us is what is it going to look like over the next handful of years, given a bunch of different interest rate scenarios and I went back and I looked three years ago, if you just took a snapshot of fourth quarter of '06, we had a 66 basis point margin. And what happened over those three years is that our portfolio yield expanded by 5 basis points, so we took advantage of a few opportunities in the market when rates were up and corporate spreads widened out, so we got a 5 basis point expansion in the portfolio yield but a 21 basis point expansion in that discount rate.", "So I think -- so what happened is it went from a 6.03% down to a 5.82% and I think that gives you an indication that for new claims that came in over that period of time, we were using a much lower discount rate and so those things will move gradually over time. We feel very, very good about where we're positioned right now. Certainly, we would love to see a higher interest rate environment. That would be beneficial to us but given that margin that we have right now, it will take a very long time for it to eat into that margin in a substantial way and as it does, then, at that point when we look at making some -- small adjustments quarter-to-quarter, which really wouldn't have much impact in the market.", "Tom Watjen", "Tom, just two things to add to that. I think that 92 is in relation to a target we have of 50 to 60. The other thing is that's on roughly 6 or $7 billion of long duration assets. And we have roughly, what about $50 million of new money we put to work each quarter.", "Tom White", "Yeah. It just doesn't move that much from quarter-to-quarter. Because as Tom said, you've got roughly a $7 billion reserve base, probably six or seven year duration on it. And at most, we're probably investing a couple $100 million a year of new money in there. So it just takes a long time to move those numbers.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And just one follow-up. So it's fair to say that even if interest rates remain where they are today even go a little bit lower, you've got a lot of cushion. There may be earnings pressure and that's a separate issue. But in terms of balance sheet being strong or not, you have a lot of margin for interest rates to decline before it would become a balance sheet issue?", "Tom White", "Exactly right. And you contrast this to back in 2002. One of the reserve charges that hit us was because that margin was a lot lower, it was 20 basis points or so. And went through a lot of defaults in the investment portfolio and sold off a lot of high yield. Had had a significant hit to the portfolio yield and that's what led to a reserve charge at that time. And that's one of the lessons learned coming out of that experience, so again, today a 92 basis point margin, which just doesn't move very much because of the cash flow characteristics. And again, we feel very, very good about where we are. We would rather have a higher interest rate environment but we're well protected in today's interest rate environment.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yeah. Thanks.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Tom.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Hey, good morning, everybody. A lot of my questions have been asked and answered. So I guess, I'll ask you this question and I want to begin by saying I'm definitely not asking you to highlight any specific competitors. I'm just more interested in sort of the state of the environment. And so I'll ask it this way, what's the most aggressive behavior -- given it's such a difficult sales environment and companies really, I think insurance carriers are largely really trying hard to keep business on the books. What's the most aggressive behavior you're seeing from competition for new sales? I mean, just how far out on the limb are some companies going to either retain business or to obtain new clients?", "Tom Watjen", "To use your comment, we'll just see how far on a limb Kevin wants to go actually on that one actually, John.", "Kevin McCarthy", "I'd love to name some competitors, but I won't.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "That's okay. Listen, I think we all know who they are.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Well, we see a couple of different kinds of behaviors. We see incredible discounting rates. Over the years, I've spoken other members of my team have spoken, we talked about sort of the and other carriers have spoken as well at those kind of conferences about just the degree of volatility that exists in pricing levels and underwriting performance company-to-company during the course of a given year. You can see rates be off by 25, 35, 45% sometimes.", "So that's one kind of behavior that you see. And I think a lot of times you see it on what I'll call quote important accounts, an account where either it has a name brand in the large case business or in the mid-sized business market you see it because acquiring that one mid-sized case can make up for missing on a lot of small cases. So you'll see that kind of behavior.", "The other thing, I'd say is just the extended rate guarantees. In this economic environment, I'm sure I'm not the only one who would say that's not a great idea but nevertheless we see it, we've seen 4, 5 even 7 year rate guarantee open up because the 10 cases. So that kind of behavior is not a great long-term proposition and we're not going there.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "And when you and Kevin, when you're talking about sort of 25 to 45% rate discrepancies from one bidder to the next or four to seven year rate guarantees, is this I mean, is this current?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes. That's pretty current. Yes, that's fourth quarter current.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'll follow-up with you guys offline on some more sort of modeling oriented stuff but thank you very much.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, John.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Thank you, John.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Sean Dargan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Thank you.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Sean.", "Sean Dargan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Tom Watjen, just said that you're not warehousing capital for potential acquisitions, but given the nature of the competitiveness out there now and perhaps the more challenging return outlook going forward. Do you sense that any competitors maybe looking to exit the business? I know at your Investor Day, you said it didn't seem like anyone was ready to sell?", "Tom Watjen", "Yeah. Sean, I don't think we've seen any changes in that but I would ask Rick who was maybe a little more closely involved in that to comment.", "Rick McKenney", "I think that's exactly right. I think it probably has trended the other way where people are enjoying their group businesses today and things that are close to what we do, strong results we've seen today we're very proud of. But I think others have seen good results as well and so I think that trend continues.", "Sean Dargan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thank you. That's all.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Sean.", "Tom White", "I think let's just do a time check. I'm just trying to one more\u2026", "Rick McKenney", "I think we'll have time for one more question.", "Tom Watjen", "Okay. Thank you. Operator, one more question.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Mark Finkelstein with Macquarie.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Snuck in there. I guess kind of some follow-ups here. Knowing profitability is a lot more important than top line. I guess just, Kevin, you did give an outlook at the Investor Day of flat top line in the U.S. Given cautionary language, I guess do you still feel comfortable with that assumption?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yeah. The flat top line an earned premium number, now we do think we're going to in the 9 to 11% range in terms of sales. Flat top line is basically driven by the economy and the fact that we've got abnormal growth lag and that of course we had also NBOC sales lag during 2009 that will show up as an earned premium drag in 2010.", "So but otherwise, I think things are looking pretty positive. Our sales momentum is strong in the core market and our voluntary benefits. I said earlier that, I'm hopeful that NBOC and even normal growth will recover maybe in the latter half of 2010. Our customer satisfaction ratings are terrific. And I think across the board, all the metrics are sort of lining up positively for us going into 2011 and 2012. But 2010, I think we have to stick with flat sort of reasonable assumption.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Okay. I guess, don't if you adjust this already or not, but is there anything you can say about I guess the key first quarter sales activity?", "Kevin McCarthy", "No. It's a little too early to talk much about first quarter. Most organizations are in spend when in January to sort of -- they're trying to get a good start into the new year but they're also trying to make sure they close out effectively all the paperwork that's necessary for the fourth quarter. I would say in the in force business that early signs in terms of renewal and persistency are better than our expectations and that bodes well for the year.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Okay. Maybe just in thinking about where you're losing business and you're talking about somewhat irrational pricing environment. You're making the comment others are making similar comments, frankly. I guess some really interested, when you look at business that you're losing and you try to reverse engineer the pricing that competitors are coming in just putting terms to the side. I mean, what is your feel for where this business is actually being written at on the stuff that you're loose?", "Kevin McCarthy", "I mean, I think that's a tough question to answer. It varies by markets -- the size and when you get into mid-sized and larger, experience rating and how each company looked at their own reserve level, how much credibility they give to past experience versus forward-looking assumptions and that's over the lot. When you get into the smaller size market, we're talking about manual rate I think a lot of it has to do with how each company views their target market segment based on their own -- block experience. I just think it bounces around all over the place. There's no simple answer to that question, Mark.", "Tom Watjen", "And Kevin was mentioning too that even though the focus has been on the competitive dynamics for the fourth quarter, this historically has been a cyclical business. Where there is always somebody in doing things and frankly, it's very hard to analyze it. It's quite frankly irrational behavior but this is not unique obviously its where getting a little bit heavier dose with some of the dynamics you talked about, but referred to that.", "Kevin McCarthy", "I mean if you things about, I'll just use large case for example, we always talk about volatility in large case business. But impossible to sort of do quarter-over-quarter kind of comparisons in large case for the full year for example, in large case I think our sales were up 1% maybe or basic flat last year, yet -- quarter-by-quarter we had a terrific second quarter and not as terrific, performance in other course. That's because we're pretty disciplined about our pricing. And so we got our shots and sometimes we see pricing levels that we think we can sustain and manage risk at and sometimes we don't.", "In that kind of behavior in the large case market I think reflects itself but it's muted of course when you look at sort of the total marketplace. But you always as I think Tom said get competitors looking at their overall sales results and sometimes being more aggressive for a short period of time and that kind of volatility has been in the business as long as I've been in it.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Mark. Well, thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. We certainly know we didn't get to everyone's questions but hopefully in either follow-on calls or other things that we can do so. We also look forward to seeing many of you at the various industry conferences and investor events that will take place over the several weeks. And this completes the fourth quarter 2009 earnings call.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference.

This call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom White, Head of Investor Relations for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter 2007 analyst and investor conference call for Unum Group. As we get started, I want to remind you that today's remarks will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are located in the sections titled \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs. Our SEC filings including our Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs can be found in the \"Investor Information\" section on our website at www.unum.com.", "Take note that today... the statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found on our website in the \"Investor Information\" section.", "As you know, yesterday afternoon Unum Group reported earnings for the fourth quarter 2007. Net income in the quarter was $160.5 million or $0.44 per diluted common share compared to net income of $276.1 million or $0.80 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter 2006. Included in these results for the fourth quarter of '07 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $16.5 million or $0.05 per diluted common share. These losses were driven by the DIG B36 accounting, which resulted in a fourth quarter after-tax investment loss of $23.3 million. Excluding this DIG B36 accounting impact, net realized after-tax investment gains were $6.8 million in the fourth quarter.  Also in the fourth quarter of '07 we recorded after-tax debt extinguishment cost of $36.1 million or $0.10 per diluted common share related to our fourth quarter debt repurchases, which were executed as a part of our capital redeployment initiative. Adjusting for these two items, income on an after-tax basis was $213.1 million for the quarter or $0.59 per diluted common share.", "On this call this morning are Tom Watjen, President and CEO of Unum Groups, the heads of our three major business segments, Kevin McCarthy, Susan Ring, and Randy Horn, as well as Bob Greving, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Actuary.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom Watjen.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Tom and good morning. You wouldn't be surprised to hear me say that I'm very pleased with the accomplishments of this company over the course of 2007, and certainly our results for the fourth quarter, I think reflects the merits, the good work, and a continuation of themes and actions we're building over the last several years.  In the fourth quarter, excluding net revised investment losses and debt extinguishment cost, we reported earnings of $0.59 a share, which is 13% higher than the $0.52 reported in the fourth quarter of 2006 and ahead of the consensus estimate  of $0.54.", "Our before tax operating earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 increased by 16% with strong risk results across the company. We closed the year with record annual earnings in both Unum UK and Colonial and had very, very strong performance in Unum US, where we saw continued improvement in our group disability line of business, as well as strong performance across most of the other lines of business.  Core markets sales trends were strong across all of our business segments, including Unum US, Unum UK, and Colonial. Let me give you, for instance, our case count for 2006 saw strong growth across all those businesses.", "In Unum US, our group disability case count grew 7% in 2007, our group life case count grew 12% in 2007, our Colonial case count grew 11% in 2007 and our UK case count grew 16% in 2007. So, again strong performance in our core markets across all of our businesses. We continued to remain disciplined in the large case markets as we still seek fairly aggressive pricing actions in certain segments of the market.  You'll also note in the quarter too we actually saw some expenses increase, but as we go to the details of those expense increases, I think you'll find that much of those were either specific one-off expenses in the quarter or in fact, in many cases, investments that we are making in the business to assure ourselves that we're positioned well to profitably continue to growth the business in the future and Tom will have more to say on that in just a few moments.", "I have to say, I'm also extremely pleased with our overall investment results. Obviously, this is a very, very challenging investment environment. Our investment income continues to be very strong and through the efforts of our investment professionals, I believe our portfolio was very well positioned in this obviously unsettled times we have today. And again Tom will have more to say on that in just a moment.", "I mentioned earlier that we are making investments in the business, even though we're very pleased obviously with the results in the quarter and the trends that we saw over the course of 2007, we recognize that we have a tremendous opportunity to continue to grow our business and requires investment in all three of our businesses. Simply Unum, our comprehensive product and service offerings in our Unum US business has been launched on a limited basis and we're pleased\u2026 and we're very pleased actually with the initial market acceptance. We are continuing it to roll out in the early months of 2008 and are excited about its potential.", "Colonial has launched a new branding program to complement the corporate marketing efforts we launched a year ago. We believe this investment will help to accelerate long-term growth in sales and [inaudible]. And in the UK, we\u2019ve also continued to pursue a number of new products and service offerings, which include over the long-term evaluating the voluntary benefit marketplace opportunities in the UK.", "As you know, with our third quarter announcement of earnings, we also announced our strategy to capital management, which obviously is going to play an increasingly visible role in creating shareholder value for this company. Let me touch briefly on a few items related to our capital management initiatives.", "Our first priority remains to maintain sufficient managerial flexibility to support our operations in both good and bad times, while also positioning for improvements in our credit ratings and of course responding to opportunities in the marketplace. While the US economy certainly appears to be at a weaker position, we closed the year in a very strong capital position and have a great deal of financial flexibility.", "Our traditional US life insurance company ended the year with a risk based capital ratio of 344%, substantially higher than our 300% target. Our leverage, excluding the non-recourse debt in capital of Tailwind and Northwind Holdings finished the year at 21.4%, well below our 25% target.", "Our holdings company liquidity was slightly in excess of $1 billion, well above our target to cover one year's... one year of fixed charges plus a cushion for business and economic volatility.", "Given the strength of our capital position and the progress we have made in redeploying the capital, following our securitization and frankly despite the challenging business environment, we fully intend to proceed with our previously announced share repurchase as soon as possible.", "Now, let me also spend a few minutes on each of the businesses because those can tend to get lost in a quarter like this, but again as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we had strong performance across all three of our businesses. And let me start with Unum US.", "Our pre-tax operating earnings for Unum US increased by 23%, with strong performance across most of our product lines. A lot of the attention is given to our group disability line of business, again we saw some good improvement there with the continuation of solid claim improvements in the quarter. The group disability benefit ratio for the quarter was 91.5%, down another 60 basis points from the third quarter and 250 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2006. The benefit ratio was within our guidance range of 90% to 92% for the fourth quarter and we remain confident that reducing the benefit ratio to the 88% to 89% range by the end of 2008 or early 2009 time frame is a realistic objective.", "We also enjoyed strong results across the other product lines, including our group life and accidental death and dismemberment line, where pre-tax income increased 30% and the supplemental and voluntary lines of business, where earnings grew 20%.", "While sales declined approximately 8% in total for the fourth quarter of 2007, there is a lot of very, very encouraging trends. Our core market sales, which again, just to remind you, this is sales to employers with less than 2000 lives, our core market sales were actually very strong, increasing 20% and at this point represents 65% of our total group sales, which again is a very important point as you think about the mix of business shift that has happened to this company.", "Large case sales activity continued to be challenging and we tend to remain disciplined and selective in our pursuit of this business. We had good momentum in our voluntary benefit line of business, with sales actually increasing over 14% for the fourth quarter and in our individual disability recently issued sales, which were lower in the fourth quarter\u2026 from for the fourth quarter of '06, but actually increased a very respectable 8% for the full-year of 2007.", "Premium persistency in our group lines was lower in 2007 than in 2006, but that was primarily driven by the loss of aggressively priced large case business. Case persistency, however, remained generally stable, reflecting the stability of our clock of core market business. Kevin McCarthy is available to give you more detail on our results, as well as any trends that we are seeing in the marketplace.", "Now, let me shift to Unum UK, where pre-tax earnings of... where we reported pre-tax earnings of $85 million for the fourth quarter or a 4% increase over the fourth quarter of 2006. This completes a record year of earnings for Unum UK. We continued to see very strong risk results with the benefit ratio of 60.8% in the quarter and 59.3% for the full year. Fourth quarter sales were lower in part due to a difficult sales comparison with last year when we benefited from accelerated sales from a legislative change involving employees' retirement age. Excluding the sales from this legislative change, sales for Unum UK increased 12% for the fourth quarter, again a very respectable result. Susan Ring is available to address any questions you may have on what we are seeing in UK market.", "And last but not least Colonial. Colonial actually reported 16% increase in pre-tax operating earnings of $58.8 million, which again also raps up a record year for that business in 2007. Results continued to reflect positive benefit experienced across all of our major product lines. Expenses were higher than normal this quarter as we invested in Colonial's new branding launch, an action which is designed to help improve our long-term growth prospects. Our sales for the quarter were actually very positive, increasing 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 with strong results across each market sector. We saw good growth in our core markets with... core market activity with sales in less than 500 life market increasing 14.5%. We are also encouraged by the general market activity we see with new account growth up over 11% for the full-year 2007 and new sales rep recruiting increasing over 9% for the full year. So, again, some very good early indicators for 2008.", "Randy Horn is also available on the call this morning to address any questions you may have about what we are seeing in Colonial, the marketplace, then also specifically any questions you may have about the investments we made in branding and new product development at the Colonial business.", "I guess in summary 2000... I could summarize 2007 as being a very, very successful year for the company. Let me touch on a couple of reasons why I think so. First off, we have a strong operation... we saw strong operational performance across all of our core business segments. The favorable risk results, especially in our Unum US group disability area, but again the good risk results actually permeated all of our businesses in 2007. We also saw some very strong investment performance and it is not just with the investment income results, but again even the positioning of the portfolio, I believe, is very well positioned, which seems to be some very unsettled times in the market today.", "We continued to strengthen our capital position. We obviously announced in the third quarter our longer term plans for how we are going to manage capital, but again, the capital position of the company is very strong. We retained all the flexibility that we wanted to retain. As we\u2019ve said before, we intend to continue to proceed with our $700 million share repurchase program that we announced in the third quarter.", "We also continued to improve the relationships with many of our key constituencies, especially with the regulators, in part that was driven by the successful completion of the claim reassessment process that goes beyond that. We just built a deeper and more trusting relationship with regulators, which will bode well for 2008 and beyond. And lastly, we have continued to invest in the business. As strong as the year ended, we recognized that there is even greater opportunity out there and we are continuing to make investments in that business... in the businesses to actually make sure that we continue to maintain that profitable, yet disciplined growth we\u2019ve talked about to you in the past.", "Again, the plan here is a very simple one, it's execution. We've have got good plans. We are coming off some strong results in 2007 and again I can assure you that the entire organization in focused on the things necessary to be successful in 2008.", "And with that now... I'll now turn the call over to Tom White who will provide a little more detail on the quarter. Tom?", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "Great. Thank you, Tom. I'll keep my comments this morning on the operating results fairly brief, but I do want to highlight the following. First, just some operating results highlights and I'll start with the Unum US group disability line. As Tom said, we continued to see improvement in the group disability benefit ratio and profitability and profit margin in the quarter. New claim incidence was slightly lower for group LTD compared to the third quarter and our claim recovery performance continues its solid levels. Also within group disability is our STD line of business, which continued to perform very well also with stabled claim incidence trends. The investment income in the fourth quarters are... we saw several million dollars lower than the average of the past few quarters and it reflects a lower level of bond call activity within this line of business.", "Finally, expenses ran somewhat higher in the fourth quarter, again this is for the group disability line, and this is largely due to higher investment in advertising and branding expenses and also product and service development costs, as well as higher incentive accruals.", "Moving to the Unum US group life and AD&D line, we saw an exceptionally strong level of profitability in this line this quarter with a benefit ratio of 69.5% compared to 75.9% in the year-ago quarter. Expenses also ran somewhat higher in the fourth quarter in this line, again reflecting the similar expenses as those recorded in the group disability line.", "Finally, the Unum US supplemental and voluntary line. We also had a strong quarter here in this line with BTOE increasing 19.6%, driven by generally strong risk results and premium growth of 7.6%. Also in supplemental and voluntary, the income from miscellaneous investment income was favorable in this line, with approximately $5 million this quarter from higher than normal bond call activity. This hired a normal bond call activity in net investment income in the fourth quarter was partly offset with higher operating expenses in the period.", "So, to summarize the results for the Unum US as a segment, we had strong risk management results, which more than offset expenses that were above our normal quarterly run rate. Net investment income, in aggregate, was in line with our expectations, and these trends produced growth in pretax earnings of 23% for the fourth quarter.", "We move to Unum UK. We continued to see generally favorable claims experience in the UK operations, especially within group life, with a benefit ratio remaining stable compared to the results of the past several quarters at 60.8%. Before tax operating earnings growth was approximately 4% in dollars, but did decline 2% in local currency. As we indicated at our Investor Day, we expect to see a slower rate of earnings growth and a slight downward trend in the margin for Unum UK as we invest in new growth opportunities.", "However, we fully expect the margins and ROE to remain quite strong, and this quarter was no exception as Unum UK, the un-leveraged ROE was a very robust 29.5% and the pre-tax margin again\u2026 pre-tax earnings relative to premiums was 33.8%. Net investment income in Unum UK in the quarter benefited from favorable performance in the index linked bonds. And then you will see expenses in Unum UK were about $4 million higher than normal, primarily due to the accrual of remaining least payments on a non-occupied facility over in the Unum UK operation.", "Moving to Colonial, again, excellent quarterly results, was a favorable experience in all the primary product lines. We continue to again expect a gradual rise in the benefit ratio to more normal levels in the low 50s, but expect that very gradually over time. You will notice that the expense ratio for the Colonial segment in the fourth quarter is higher than normal. This includes advertising and branding expenses, as well as new product launch expenses that were about $4 million above our normal run rate as we launched our new branding initiatives for Colonial. We expect to incur advertising and branding expenses in 2008 at a similar level as in 2007. However in 2007, those expenses were incurred entirely in the fourth quarter, whereas in 2008, the expenses will be incurred more evenly throughout the year.", "The closed disability segment, the results were $23.4 million there and generally consistent with our expectations for this segment following the securitization that we announced last quarter. Importantly, the claim trends were stable this quarter with new claim incidence remaining fairly stable and solid recovery experience again in the closed disability segment.", "A couple of other items to mention, the tax rate, you will see that the rate on operating income, this is excluding the debt extinguishment costs and the realized investment gains and losses, was not lower than normal at 30.5% and this is primarily due to the release of a FIN 48 tax liability of approximately $7 million. And also you will notice debt extinguishment costs with the $400 million debt tender, the $150 million bond call and other de-leveraging activities in the fourth quarter, we incurred after-tax debt extinguishment cost of $36.1 million. With this activity, we\u2019ve completed $752 million of our planned $800 million in debt retirement. Our consolidated return on equity for the fourth quarter was 11.5% and for full-year 2007, it was 11.2%. The leveraged ROE for our core operations of Unum US, Unum UK, and Colonial was 17.1% for the fourth quarter and 16.7% for the full-year 2007, very strong results there.", "Finally, the trend of strong statutory earnings continued in the fourth quarter, with our fourth quarter net gain from operations, this is after-tax and excluding special items, was $227.3 million for our traditional US insurance subsidiaries and for full-year 2007, the net gain from operations after-tax and excluding special items totaled $850.3 million, which is an exceptionally strong performance. Regarding the claim reassessment process, very pleased to report that since the end of the third quarter, we have completed the reviews of the final 256 claims and the final examination under the multi-state regulatory settlement agreement is well underway and we anticipate its completion in the first half of 2008.", "I would like to close with a few comments on the investment environment in our investment portfolios. The current market volatility, particularly with the widening of corporate spreads on new investment opportunities continues to mitigate much of the impact that we are seeing in the decline in treasury rates. And obviously the ten-year treasury was down about 56 basis points in the fourth quarter. The new money yield for us in the fourth quarter was 6.18%, this compares to 6.48% in the third quarter, 6.31% in the second, and 6.07% in the first quarter. We had a high level of purchases of inflation index bonds in the UK, which tends to lower the reported new money yield. The overall portfolio yield declined by 4 basis points, however, importantly, the interest reserve margins remained generally stable compared to the third quarter 2000 levels that we outlined in our November Investor Day presentation.", "We enter 2008 with hedges in place on approximately $600 million of expected cash flows and this represents approximately half of the expected total cash flow to invest for 2008. From a portfolio quality perspective, we are happy to report that there have no material changes in the quarter. You should note that we have added a page to our statistical supplement, which provides some details on the asset to mortgage backed securities portfolio.", "Now, I'd like to highlight a few important facts that are frequent questions that we get regarding the investment portfolio. First, we have no sub-prime mortgage exposure. Secondly, we have no CDOs related to asset backed or residential mortgage backed securities. Our Alt-A exposure has been reduced to $5.5 million on a book value basis and $5.8 million on a market value basis, and all of this is rated AAA. The book value of our private equity partnership exposure is $61.7 million. And finally, we have no direct investments in any of the financial guarantors, and our exposure to investments was wrapped by financial guarantors is $148.6 million on a book value basis and $152.6 million on a market value basis, and the average underlying rating on these is A1.", "Overall, we feel that our investment portfolio is in excellent shape and well positioned for... likely continuing to be a challenging environment in 2008. Our high-yield exposure at year-end was 5.3% of invested assets, is generally stable with the 5.8% exposure we had last year. The level of non-current investments is only $2.6 million at year-end and it compares to $16.2 million at the end of the third quarter and $12.5 million at the end of '06.", "We will be pleased to address any specific questions that you have regarding our investment holdings in the Q&A session. So, with that let me turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Tom, and I will keep my closing comments very brief. Let me just reiterate how pleased I am with our fourth quarter results and those for the full year. Again, this a strong performance. We are very pleased with what's happened, obviously, this didn\u2019t happen without a lot of hard work by all of my associates. So, I want to thank all of them for the great work that was put into what's turned out to be a very good year for us this past year.", "We said at the Investor Day Meeting in the fall that we are a very different company and let me just kick off four things I think are important to keep in mind as we think about the close of year. First and foremost, especially in this environment this is important, we have retained substantial financial flexibilities in the organization. We have a stronger balance sheet, with risk-based capital at 344%, leverage at 21.4%, as I said before, over $1 billion of liquidity at the holding company.", "Secondly, we have better positioned our portfolio... investment portfolio, with historically low levels of high-yield bonds and very limited exposure to the asset classes that are troubling many financial institutions today. Thirdly, we have a more diversified business foundation, that comes in part with the growth of our Unum UK and Colonial operations, but also has been supplemented by the repositioning of the Unum US operations. And I can assure we have solid plans for 2008 and the focus throughout the organization is on developing disciplined profitable growth. Again, I very much feel that we are focused on that. So, I get much different foundation for the future. And last but not least, we have made continued progress toward resolving the regulatory and legal matters, which were initiated in 2003 and 2004. Now, while we are not immune to economic volatility, we are significantly better positioned today than anytime in our past.", "Finally, with respect to guidance, we are reaffirming the 2008 guidance we provided at our November 19 Investor Day, which was for operating earnings per share within a range of $2.35 per share to $2.40 per share.", "At this time, operator we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Tamara Kravec with Banc Of America Securities.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Tamara.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "Good quarter.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "We are happy to have '07 being a strong year. I have a couple of question. First, in light of the probability of recession increasing with industry experts and economist, how are you feeling about this business going into '08 with that probability rising and particular in light of your goal for the continued improvement in the benefit ratio in your [inaudible] business? That's my first question. My second is just touching on reserves and just given the accelerated pace with which the FED is lowering rates and I think that's probably expected to continue near term, are you readdressing reserves in light of your interest margins, if you could talk about that? And then just addressing the competitive environment, particularly in the less than 2000 lives where you saw good growth. Thanks.", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "Good. Tam let me start with your first one and then maybe ask Kevin to supplement my comments. But, let me start with the fact, again as you look at the company today, given the balance of our business, we don't feel as though we have anywhere near as much vulnerability to swing from the economy. And again, by that I mean, you look at the contributions that Colonial now makes to our company, Unum UK now makes to our company, and even within Unum US the fact that we have a more diverse product portfolios in terms of contributions from voluntary and group life and things like that. So, again, I start with the point that the company is in a very different position overall relative to where it was in the past. Maybe what Kevin can do is speak specifically for the Unum US group disability line in terms of some of the things that we have done there and why we think again that we are in a better position than the past. I will say though we are keeping a vary eye on the economy throughout as it relates to client activities, also it relates to investment activities as you said. So, we're not taking this for granted. Maybe Kevin just talk a little bit about the Unum US exposure, especially with group disability.", "Kevin  P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Thanks Tom. Good morning Tamara.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "Good morning.", "Kevin  P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "With respect to recession risk in Unum US in group disability, a couple of things, first of all, just overall on Unum US, we are a different portfolio than we were four, five years ago. Our mix of business is now roughly plus or minus 30% group disability, 30% supplemental, 30% life. So, we are nearly as exposed on the disability site for the total Unum US performance as we were in 2000, 2001. Our mix of business by industry is really solid, we don't have exposure of any more than about 14% or 15% in any one industry sector. Our mix of business by size, as you know, has been improving. Our LTD in force is now about 54%, 46% large in our sales in the fourth quarter, actually hit right on our 40-20-40 kind of target in terms of small, medium, and large, so well diversified there. Our claim management results have been extremely consistent over the last seven or eight quarters, our quality indicators are good, satisfaction measures are still solid, incidence has been pretty stable, and our renewal plans continue to operate effectively and have consistently beat plans each of the last three years. So, overall I think we're in pretty good shape.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Kevin. If I can move to the second question, just around interest rates and the impact on reserves, and Tom you want to take that?", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "Yes. I think, Tamara, the important thing that we watch is certainly the interest reserve margin there, and if you go back to the Investor Day, we provided where those margins are. There is no material change in those in the fourth quarter. I think the benefit that we have despite the low interest rate environment is the fact that we\u2019ve got about 50% of our cash flows for 2008 already hedged and so\u2026 you know, obviously there is a little market sensitivity to the other half, but with the mix of investments that we look at, certainly the widening of corporate spreads on investment grade securities, that's offsetting a fair amount of the draft that we're seeing in treasury rates. Now, having said that, as we look out for 2008, we really don't see any pressure on us to make any adjustments in those discount rate assumptions. If this environment would persist for the full year, then we have to revisit that. But, we're in good shape here for 2008.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "Okay.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. And then, Tamara, lastly, just for the competitive environment, maybe I'll ask each of the business heads actually speak to that. First with Kevin, then I\u2019d ask Randy and Susan also to speak to what's happening in their respective environment. Kevin?", "Kevin  P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "With respect to the core market, the smaller and medium-sized part of the business, our activity was very strong. In the fourth quarter activity was up 11%. Closing ratios improved throughout the year. Packaged sales grew for us throughout the year. 38% of our fourth quarter sales were three lines of business and 77% of our sales were two lines of business. So, pretty strong across-the-board performance in our core marketplace. Case sales were up 13. I think it needs from the standpoint of our distribution system and its ability to deliver terrific fourth quarter for us with solid momentum going into '08. Supplemental sales were up as well. So, I think the competitive environment in the core market has much to do with the way we execute than worrying about what's happening with other companies, and I think our components throughout the year continued to improve. So, feeling pretty good about our core market performance.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Randy, just maybe\u2026you had strong core market performance as well actually and maybe just speak a little bit about what you're seeing in your core market.", "Randall C. Horn - President and Chief Executive Officer, Colonial Supplemental Insurance", "Yes. Really, just same as Kevin, Tom, and good morning Tamara. Really not any major change in terms of the overall competitive environment, great activity in our core markets, our new accounts\u2026 number of new accounts were up over 16% in the fourth quarter. And again, certainly there could be some economic pressures as we move into 2008. But, again, I think we can overcome that, we are just staying focused on our core markets and maintaining these very high activity levels.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Susan, maybe you want to hop around the UK environment?", "Susan Ring - Chief Executive Officer, Unum UK", "Yes. Sure. Where we are seeing most competition being most aggressive I would say within the large case, small case, and in particular group life as well. We are obviously maintaining pricing discipline and in our core markets as well. Within the core market, [inaudible] and closed rates improvement so that all above targets and term levels. [inaudible] activity right across the board is very strong. So, I think we are very focused on the core markets maintaining pricing discipline, where we are seeing less competitor activity. So, we feel very good about 2008 as well.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "Thank you, Tamara.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Thanks. Actually going to follow-up on Tamara\u2019s question with a question on investments relative to a recessionary environment. How do you think about DDDs, now you're getting paid more to take risk, spreads are one, yet there is more risk and perhaps collinearity with your business. Is this a time to be taking more risk and taking advantage of being rewarded for it, or are you thinking in terms of cutting it back because maybe you might be doubling up some bets on\u2026  investment risk with business risk?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Bob, this is Tom, it\u2019s a good question, I will offer a few thoughts and maybe I\u2019d ask Tom to supplement those. But, I don\u2019t think this is the time we will positively take additional significant risk. I think it\u2019s the time to continue the path we have taken, which is being very selective, very cautious, that\u2019s played well for so far. You are right, even though there are some buying opportunities out there and I can't say we would do a little of that, we really aren\u2019t going to be aggressively going and building, I don't think the BAA or certainly about the high-yield position, maybe a little selectively here and there, because again the outlook is sufficiently mirky to take an aggressive position right now, even tough there could be some money to be made, frankly, it's not what we are proposing to do. I think, as you know, we have actually... we do have the lowest level of high-yield we have had in quite sometime, it is probably, almost half of what it was at its peak, five, six years ago. We have also underweighted, I think, some of the sectors of the economy, which are cyclical in nature, for example, financial institutions, I think , we are roughly... about half of the market weight. So, I don't think we are going to materially change much of that. I think there may be some things out there that people do opportunistically, but again, from our point of view, this is not the time to be too aggressive in some of those areas.", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "Bob, as you think of investment strategy, it has for many, many years focused on investment grade corporate bonds, typically in the BBB to A range, and we think we are getting good value there. We will augment that by looking at a little of high-yield, I'd say right now. We are not particularly excited about putting a lot of new money into high-yield even though spreads have widened. I think we feel like we are getting paid nicely for the risk that we are taking in our core kind of BBB, A corporate bonds. We also do a little bit in mortgage loans. We do a little bit with private placements and these are all investment classes that we'll look at when we think there is relative value to be invested in in those areas. I'd say right now that we think the sweet spot for us kind of remains in that BBB, A, we feel like we are getting paid for the risk. When you first asked the question, my first thought was, I'd much rather be taking risk in BBB bonds than in sub-prime versus CDOs or things like that. We are very pleased the way the investment portfolio is and we have had good performance. We have kind of had in our strategy for the last two or three years that we were going to go into a softer cycle and that's certainly happening and I think we are as well positioned as we can be right now.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "So, don't look for the BBB ratings to change materially over the next couple of quarter, is that the message?", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "That's the message.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Thank you very much.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Bob.", "Operator", "We will go next to Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Good morning.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "A couple of questions. First is, can you give an update on trading\u2019s outlook from either A.M. Best or Moody's?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Tom, you want to touch on that one?", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "I think in terms of rating agencies, Tom, to me the numbers speak for themselves. To have a negative outlook when we have got a 344% RBC, 21.4% leverage, holding company liquidity at $1 billion, and we just had $850 million in statutory earnings, I don't think a negative outlook is the appropriate outlook to have. We have certainly messed with all of the rating agencies. It would be our hope that those negative outlooks go away. Since we meet with them and they let us know when they are having their meetings and what their decisions are, I don't want to front run any comments that they may or may not make. But, again, we present the facts and I think the facts dictate and suggest that a negative outlook is not the appropriate outlook to have right now on the company.", "Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse", "Okay. I guess specific to A.M. Best, I think the last few parameters they had in place included continued improvement in the disability cost ratio, which you have delivered on and the closing as multi-stage.", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "Yes, that's a good point, Tom, because A.M. Best has been watching the client reassessment very closely. One of the things they wanted to see was a completion of that claims reassessment process. And during January, we actually completed the last of the claim reviews, so that's behind us, and here we can check that off the list, and I would except A.M. Best to whip that issued off the table, so that they will look at the rating\u2026 and again I don't want to front run any comment they may or may not be making. But, I think you point out that the numbers are strong and the issues that they have been focused on have pretty much been addressed.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Next question. On the guidance on the group income protection benefit ratio, the  88 to 89, does this assume stable incidence in terms of just overall claims incidence and severity and also as most of the benefit expected to come from the reprising side, I guess, what I am trying to ask is, do you have some buffer built in case the environment does get worse from a incidence and severity standpoint?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's the good question, Tom. Kevin?", "Kevin  P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Yes, Tom, good morning. I think the 88 to 89 generally expects stable incidence plus or minus moving, but we are also continuing to execute on our renewal program, we continue to move prices up a little bit where we can and of course we continue to experience positive consistent performance in our claims organization, and I still think we have a little bit of outside [inaudible] performing on all cylinders now. Yes, there is a little bit of\u2026 yes, there is volatility, but of course the 88, 89 doesn't presume a sever swing in essence. Frankly, we haven\u2019t seen that either over the last fourth quarter at all, we have been pretty stable.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Kevin, from a leading indicator standpoint, as of right now, you are also not seeing any meaningful change from a claims, incidence, or severity standpoint, is that fair to say?", "Kevin  P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Yes, it is fair to say. You know, we saw a little bumpiness in the fourth quarter. For example, manufacturing incidence actually was a little better than it has been. On the other hand, financial sector was a little worse than it had been, but pretty much within normal ranges.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Just two more quick ones. I guess substantial improvement on group life and AD&D benefit ratio. Should we assume that\u2019s a highly favorable result or are we also seeing the benefits of re-pricing because I believe based on the mix shift you seen on the group life side, you have also lost some large cases there.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think you have got two things going on, we did have generally favorably mortality throughout the year, that was true across most of our operating units in the life business. But, of course, also we have continued to execute on our renewal plan. We have purchased some large case group life business, just why you are seeing the total premium lines are down, but the margins of course have gone up because we had better margins on the small and middle sized market.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Okay. So, we can assume a little bit of improvement, but probably not all the way, is that fair to say from a run rate standpoint?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. We are operating pretty well there right now.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Okay.  Last question for Bob Grieving. A lot of noise on 4Q statutory results, can you just at least explain some of the  seating commission issues as it relates to both the special purpose vehicles as well as the statutory entities? How would you think about those in the context of your overall statutory results?", "Robert C. Greving - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Actuary", "Tom, good morning. Obviously, there is noise, in the period, we did complete the Northwind Reinsurance transaction and that does follow through our statutory results. Keep in mind that while the reinsurance agreements that went along with Northwind are internal between four of our statutory subsidiaries. So, each of the subsidiaries does get reported separately from a statutory perspective. Under statutory rules, any reinsurance agreement, even if it is internal between affiliates, has to be an arms-length reinsurance agreement. So, each one of those reinsurance agreements have to be in a position as if it were with a third party and of course the state insurance departments make sure that those agreements are fair to the statutory entity that they are regulating in their state of domicile, that resulted in a positive seating commission coming from both Provident Life and Unum America. They got paid positive seating commissions for their blocks of business as that transaction was executed with Northwind Re, and a negative seating commission for Provident Life and Accident. Now, under statutory accounting, you are aware that that\u2019s very conservative accounting and that requires negative seating commissions to be expensed and recorded as a loss immediately and positive seating commissions to be amortized into earnings over time. So, you do see no eyes going... going particularly in the Provident Life and Accident walk of business and that's one of the reasons why we said that's kind of an extraordinary item because that loss as a result of that reinsurance got charged off immediately. Under GAAP, you won't see that because the amortization of both positive and negative seating commissions occur over time. We\u2019d be happy to go over that with you. Tom, I think it might be... it\u2019s kind of beyond the call, but we\u2019d be happy to go with that in more detail with you when the statutory statements are completed and that accounting actually can be tracked through the overall financial statements, if you would like.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "That's helpful. So, the high level is simply the $219 million seating commission out of Provident Life and Accident is going... there is going to be a positive adjustment to Provident and Unum Life of America, but it\u2019s going to be amortized with the P&L overtime, is that correct?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Mark Finkelstein with FPK.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Good morning.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Tom just asked a couple of my questions, but let me follow-up on a few things. One is, what are your persistency assumptions for 2008 in US? When would you expect kind of the large case to stabilize and start to increase overall persistency?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Kevin?", "Kevin  P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "I think, persistency, in 2008, for the most part, would be pretty consistent with where we finished up 2007, I don\u2019t see any reasons right now to move that assumption either way. We are pretty much \u201cthrough sort of the large case performance management aspects of our business\u201d, we continue to go through a little program every year where we identify under-performers and try to move those prices up or to the extent that those customers won't accept those price increases, move them up. But, I would say for the most part, our large case business is getting close to sort of being stabilized.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay. I actually missed the comment, Susan, can you just go over sales in the UK for the fourth quarter?", "Susan Ring - Chief Executive Officer, Unum UK", "Yes, sure, absolutely. If you compare our fourth quarter \u201907 sales to fourth quarter '06, it is a bit of tough comparison because we had some legislative changes that took place in October, so we actually had an increase in up-sell activity during the fourth quarter '06. If you net that out\u2026 that comparison out though and neutralize that impact, then our fourth quarter '07 sales increased by 12%, 13% over 2006. So, it actually was quite a substantial growth. If you remove the impact of the legislative changes\u2026 if you look at the core sales during the fourth quarter, we feel very, very healthy closed ratios, which all came through for all of our product lines above plan and we saw up-sell activity very strong in the fourth quarter and in fact for the full year, and growth activity levels were high, up sort of 127% of planned expectations. So, fourth quarter sales, I think, came through very strongly. Does that answer your question?", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Yes, that's perfect. And then just overall expenses in the US, I mean obviously elevated in the fourth quarter, I think both US and Colonial. Did that essentially\u2026 is that kind of a one quarter thing or how much of that should persist kind of elevated expense ratios into the early part of 2008?", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "The vast majority of that, you can kind of think of as a one-time thing. Clearly, in Colonial, we did about a year\u2019s worth of advertising spend in the fourth quarter and for 2008, that will be spread throughout the year. In Unum US\u2026 and you will see it in each of the three business lines there. But in Unum US, as we indicated, there are some higher expenses related to some advertising and branding that we moved up, there is some incentive accruals in there, there is a little bit of an impact that\u2019s moving some of the people involved with the claim reassessment into operating roles. They fill in as kind of normal attrition occurs and some growth begins to occur with the Unum US business and within the claims areas. The vast majority of that, you can kind of think of as a one-time thing. We will have\u2026 when you look at 2008 expense ratios really across the board, they will be a touch higher than what we saw in 2007 and that's mostly within Colonial, there is a little bit of advertising that we are going to do, it will be about $1 million a quarter. I\u2019d say in the US, there is a little bit that we\u2019ll be doing. There are some Simply Unum investments that we\u2019ll be making in the UK. Susan is looking at the voluntary market, so there are investments that we are making there. I am not talking about a dramatic move in expenses, a fraction of a percentage. But, these are investments and what we think are some great opportunities for the company.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay. And then just final question. I am going back to a slide that you presented at your Investor Day, and it's the long-term disability incidence index. What are the interesting elements of that slide is it actually shows incidence patterns starting to increase, at least on the slide about four quarters ahead of a potential recession not without forecasting whether we go into one or whether we don\u2019t go into one. But, it sounds like incidence patterns were actually pretty stable in the quarter, and I am just curious if you have any thoughts kind of showing that, you know, in the slide, typically you start to see the increase ahead of the recession and in this particular situation we may not be, do you have any thoughts on that?", "Robert C. Greving - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Actuary", "This Bob Greving. Mark, the actual submitted incidence for group LTD business in the fourth quarter was actually a little bit below what we were seeing in the third quarter. So, at least at this point in time, we are really not seeing any rising incidence as a systemic type of a pattern. We get a little bit of blip up, a little bit of a blip down, but nothing that seems to be systemic at this point time.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay, thank you.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark, [inaudible] but in fact part of this can also be attributed to the mix of business actually. I think one of things I thought we gave an exhibit, but there has been noticeable difference in the incidence patterns between core market, for example, in large case over economic cycles. And our business mix has shifted to more of a core market focus as you know. Some of that\u2019s going to be\u2026 likely we are going to see that, whereas if the business is not [inaudible] economic swings.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Great. Thank you.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take your next from Eric Berg with Lehman Brothers.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "I had a question about growth, but I actually want to precede it by... I want to precede it by asking a question about incidence that was prompted just by Tom's comments. In thinking about incidence and how well it's going are not so well or just the state of incidence, just how meaningful is it look at the fourth quarter versus third and by that\u2026 I guess what's behind my question is sort of this thought, is it the only incidence that really matters in your business, not the trended incidence, but actual to expected taking into consideration that incidence could be going up and that could be a good thing if it's being driven by, say a change in mix in favor of different industry groups or different... a change in the gender mix of your business? I'm thinking of what matters is not the sequential change, but just how incidence is going relative to your expectations, what are your thoughts on that?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Kevin?", "Kevin  P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Eric, I think you are on the money. I think absolute incidence matters more when you get some severe swings that you are not planning for and pricing for and you have to react to it. When incidence moves sort of in a more gradual fashion, actual to expected is what we pay attention to because that\u2019s what drives our renewal programs, that\u2019s what drives our pricing strategies and it\u2019s also what we measure in terms of mix of business.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you. And then my closed questions or closed related questions is this, understanding that the premiums have been shrinking as part of a very clearly articulated and very purposefully carried out plan, it\u2019s clear what you're saying and it\u2019s clear that you are doing exactly what you want to do, that's coming through loudly and clearly, should we presume, Kevin, that now that the large case business, as you said, I think, in response to some earlier question, should we assume that now that the large case business is just about stable that we can expect soon, say in 2008 or\u2026 maybe just pose an indirect question, when can we expect premiums in Unum US to start growing, that\u2019s probably the simplest, greatest way to ask the question?", "Kevin  P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Eric, I would think realistically, probably more as we enter into 2009... maybe... I'd expect core market sales to grown throughout '08, I would expect supplemental sales to grow throughout '08. I think large case sales are still very choppy, it depends on what\u2026 how inventory has\u2026 maintain our discipline there. You think persistency is largely stabilizing in large case and I think the growth will start to turn, as we get our Simply Unum platform launched throughout 2008, I think you'll start to see some acceleration of core market and supplemental sales growth, which will actually, I think, for the most part, show up and earn premium in 2009.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Eric.", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction]. We will go next to [inaudible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, thank you very much. Obviously, there are several metrics by which the balance sheet is strengthened quite a bit. I probably could do the math, I guess, but I am curious if you tell us roughly what the ROE would have been had your balance sheet metrics been at target as supposed to above target, roughly speaking?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we\u2019d have to come back to you. I am not sure we know that. What we are saying is with the excess capital, the lower level of debt, etcetera, what does that mean...", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "Any one factor, we might be able to do it on our head, but unfortunately we are working...", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Simultaneous equations here.", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "If you think through it, from an RBC basis, we are at 344. We are going to target around 320, given the environment that you have, 24 points of RBC. Our leverage at 21.4% is nicely below the 25% level that we will target over the long-term and then again the holding company liquidity at $1 billion, our one-time the annual fixed charges is about 300. So, there is about a $700 million cushion there and that replenishes itself pretty nicely throughout the year. I don't know if  I can work through all the math here, but when you look at all those capital management matrix, we got some pretty nice cushion on each one of them.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think if you had all the pieces up, it comes pretty close to about $2 billion of over capitalization or under-leverage. So, you can probably do the math from there on the ROE. Wouldn\u2019t dare to do that in live prime time, but it does amount to about $2 billion of extra capitalization across unit price.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Great. I'll take my calculator to it. Thanks very much.", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "I think if we could... we'll take one more question and obviously people will be available to take other questions after the call. Let's just go with one more operator if possible.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our final question from Chris Jermany [ph] with Goldman Sachs.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, thanks very much for the question. It looks like, I guess, A.M. Best just revised your outlook to stable from negative so that risk appears to be off the table. But, I was wandering as far as proceeding with the $700 million buyback latter, I was just wondering, I know you mentioned you can foresee the recession environment causing you to alter that, but what would cause you to considering or altering the amount or timing of that buyback program?", "Robert C. Greving - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Actuary", "As you look at our overall capital program, we have indicated, we are going to be cautious about deploying all of that, but obviously our stock price, currently, we feel is it an opportune level for share buyback. We have got obviously a very heavy capitalization, well above our targets, leverage is in great shape, and I think if you look toward the latter part of the year, if operations continue to be on plan and we execute our plan as anticipated, we will be generating additional capital during the 2008 timeframe, over and above what we have got there now.  We'll certainly keep an eye on the economic market, what\u2019s going on with our investment portfolio, as well as our overall operational results. So, we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got appropriate cushions. As Tom White indicated earlier, we feel that our reserve base is in good shape. We don\u2019t really feel we need to re-modify and discount rates at this point in time, particularly with the hedging program that we have got out there. But, we will be watching all of those parameters to be somewhat cautious, I believe, as we go through the year, particularly given the drumbeat that we are hearing from the market as far as potential recessionary activities across the board. We will be watching all of those things and executing accordingly. But, I do think that this is a time when, as Tom indicated earlier, we should take a serious look at whether or not we can accelerate a portion of our share program.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "What you said Bob, I think Chris it would take\u2026 Bob, you\u2019d agree, our [inaudible] in the short timeframe. As you said and was said throughout this call, we ended the year on a very positive note. We have got substantial financial flexibility. Again, one of our priorities is always going to be sure that we continue to maintain flexibility in the face of whatever economic environment we face. But, it is hard to see something I think that would get in the way in the short-term our ability to execute the previously announced $700 million share buyback.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Thomas A. H. White - Head of Investor Relations", "Good thanks Chris. With that, let me thank you all again for taking the time to join us on the call this morning. And at this point, operator, this will complete our fourth quarter 2007 earnings call.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to your host Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you Darrel. Good morning everyone and welcome to the first quarter 2008 analyst and investor conference call for Unum Group. As we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements, that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements and risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. Our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs can be found in the Investors section of our website at www.unum.com.", "Please take note that the statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found on our website also in the Investor section.", "As you know, yesterday afternoon, Unum Group reported earnings for the first quarter of 2008. Net income in the quarter was $163.1 million or $0.46 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $178.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted common share in the first quarter 2007. Included in these results for the first quarter of 2008 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $44.7 million or $0.13 per diluted common share and $3.2 million or $0.01 per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2007. These losses were driven by the provisions of DIG B36 accounting, which require changes in fair values of embedded derivatives in certain modified coinsurance contracts to be reported as realized investment gains and losses and resulted in a first quarter 2008 after-tax investment loss of $41.6 million compared to a $2.2 million after-tax loss in the first quarter 2007. So if you exclude this DIG B36 accounting impact, net realized after-tax investment losses related to sales and write-downs of investments were $3.1 million in the first quarter 2008 and $1 million in the first quarter 2007. Adjusting for this item and excluding discontinued operations, after-tax operating income was $207.8 million for the quarter or $0.59 per diluted common share compared to $174.6 million or $0.50 per diluted common share in the year-ago first quarter.", "On the call this morning are Thomas Watjen, President and CEO of Unum Group and Bob Greving, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Actuary as well as the heads of our three major operating segments, Kevin McCarthy, Susan Ring and Randy Horn. And at this time I would like to turn the call over to Tom Watjen.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning. For us, the first quarter has proven to be a strong start to 2008 as much of the positive momentum has been building in our businesses over the past couple of years carried over to the New Year. Excluding net realized after-tax investment losses, we reported $0.59 per share in operating income for the first quarter, 18% higher than the $0.50 per share reported in the first quarter of 2007.", "Our pre-tax operating earnings improved 19% when compared to the first quarter of last year with core operations pre-tax earnings growth of 14%, primarily driven by strong risk trends across all of our business lines. In fact each of four primary business lines reported lower benefit ratios in the first quarter of 2008 when compared to the first quarter of 2007, which to me is a strong reflection of the disciplined approach that we've been taking to the business over the last several years.", "Our investment portfolio credit quality continues to hold up well in this environment with minimal exposure to today's risky asset classes. We did experience some pressure on net investment income due to lower than expected levels of bond calls and miscellaneous investment income, which is really a byproduct to the low levels of refinancing and M&A activity we saw in the first quarter. We historically have received around $14 million to $15 million of this bond call and miscellaneous income, again per quarter and frankly we had zero this past quarter. This was especially evident in the investment income results that you saw in our Unum U.S. group disability and our closed blocks of business lines of business.", "Our sales trends were mixed, but I am extremely encouraged by the growth that we saw in UNM U.S., which\u2026 we actually saw sales growth in the quarter of about 29%. In our recent investment investor meetings we have discussed with you the importance of voluntary products in the marketplace and our company is focused around the core market, which is selling to the small and mid-sized employer.", "Sales trends in these two important markets were strong in the first quarter with core market group sale increasing 36.5% and voluntary benefits sales increasing 34%. While our reported sales results for Colonial Life and Unum UK were below our expectations, and when you get to the detail you will see that the rest of underlying positive trends in our core market activities reached these two businesses. Also in our recent investor meetings we discussed our commitments in new product and service offerings to capitalize on the changing market dynamics. One such initiative is \u2018Simply Unum\u2019 a comprehensive product and service offering in our Unum U.S. business which combines group and voluntary coverages on one fully integrated platform targeted at core market. Our limited roll out which began in late 2007 is producing very encouraging results. Now it's too early for Simply Unum to have an impact on our sales results, however, we are encouraged by the broker and customer receptivity and early results are very much in line with our expectations.", "On April 1st, we rolled out the offering out to six additional field sales offices and plan to operate in an additional 12 field sales offices by mid-year. We plan to complete our full nationwide roll out as we receive state approval for each of these products and services. I should add that Simply Unum is not the only initiative designed to further leverage our leadership position and I think capitalize on some of the opportunities that are emerging in the marketplace.", "Colonial Life has begun to raise its profile in the market with a new branding program. We believe this investment along with its new life and health products and enhanced enrollment capabilities will help lead to accelerated long-term growth in agent recruiting and in sales. In the UK we are focused on a number of new products and service offerings including a new dual benefit group income protection product offering, which provides assistance to both the employer and the employee in the event of long-term sicknesses.", "I think all these initiatives are very much designed to capitalize on our leadership position and show that frankly we are making additional investments in our business to assure that in future quarters we can continue to produce predictable profitable growth that we think is sustainable into the future.", "Now let me take a few minutes just to talk about each of our three business segments. Let me start with, Unum U.S.", "Our pretax operating earnings for Unum U.S. increased by 14% with strong performance across each of the three reporting lines. Improvements in the claim management process continue to enhance results in this segment's group disability line with our BTOE [ph] for the quarter increasing 34.5%. The group disability benefit ratio for the first quarter was 91%, down another 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2007 and 240 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2007. Incidence trends remain generally stable in the first quarter for both our LTD and our STD lines of business.", "I am sure there will be some additional questions in the Q&A session about the vulnerability of that businesses economic conditions but we did not see any material change in the incidence in the quarter based on anything that is happening in the economy. We remain confidant that reducing the benefit ratio to the 88% to 89% range by the end of early 2002 or early 2009\u2026 I'm sorry, early... the end of 2008 or early 2009 timeframe is still very major realistic objective.", "We also saw solid results across the other lines including group life and accidental death and dismemberment, where BTOE increased 12% and in the supplemental and voluntary lines of business where earnings grew 7%. Unum U.S. sales were very strong this quarter, increasing 29% from the first quarter of 2007 with encouraging underlying trends both in our core market sales, our voluntary benefit sales as well as our key account growth. And Kevin McCarthy is available to give... provide more detail on those results as well as any developments that are occurring in the marketplace.", "Now shifting to Unum UK, our BTOE of $87.1 million for the first quarter was a16% increase over the first quarter of 2007. We continue to see excellent risk results with a benefit ratio at 57.3% in the first quarter and all three business lines produced lower benefit ratios year-over-year. Sales declined 10% in the first quarter on a dollar basis reflecting a difficult comparison due to some legislative changes introduced in 2007 and also some very competitive market conditions especially for our group life products and our sales for large employers. And Susan Ring is available to address any questions you may have on both the results on the market conditions over in the UK presently.", "And last but not least Colonial. Our BTOE in Colonial increased 13% to $67.4 million in the first quarter, a record quarterly result for Colonial Life. Results continue to reflect positive benefit experience for the accident, sickness and disability product lines. Expenses were back to a more normal level following our brand launch in late 2007, which elevated expenses for the fourth quarter. Sales were flat for the first quarter, a disappointing overall start to the year but we did see encouraging signs with positive core market and new account growth. Randy Horn is also available on today's call both to discuss the results as well as to discuss the Colonial's marketplace.", "Now, I would like to now move to a little... to a brief discussion of our capital management initiatives. As you may recall, when we announced the completion of Closed Block securitization with our third quarter 2007 earnings release, we also outlined our capital management philosophy which is centered on maintaining sufficient financial flexibility to support our operations across different economic cycles while also positioning for improvements in our current ratings and of course responding to opportunities in the marketplace. And we've maintained a very, very strong capital position which I think frankly at this point gives us a great deal of financial flexibility.", "Our first quarter estimate of risk-based capital remains about 340% for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies, substantially higher than our long-term target of 300% and our year-end target, 2008 target of 315% to 325%. Our leverage excluding the non-recourse debt and capital associated with our securitization tail wind in Northwind Holdings finished the first quarter at 21.9%, well below our target of 25%. We intend to retire the $175 million of short-term debt due this month which will move our leverage ratio even lower in the second quarter and through the balance of the year we are going to continue to certainly look for ways to optimize our capital structure.", "Holding Company liquidity was $624 million, comfortably above our target to cover one year of fixed charges plus maintain a capital position for business and economic volatility. And so we completed the first half of our $700 million share repurchase authorization, which we authorized in the fourth quarter of 2007. In the first quarter through a $350 million accelerated share repurchase, we purchased approximately 14.5 million shares and at this time we fully expect that we will complete the balance of the repurchase over the remainder of 2008.", "I guess as I close, we're off to an awfully strong start for 2008, we saw strong operational performance across all of our operating businesses, again driven by very strong risk results.", "We saw strong sales activity especially in our core and voluntary marketplace. We continue to maintain a very high level of credit quality in our investment portfolio in the face of what is obviously a very challenging financial environment. We maintain financial flexibility and capital flexibility driven by the strong balance sheet and capital position we have plus the continued strong performance of our business and again everything gets very sustainable as we look to the balance of this year.", "And we continued to improve the relationships with many of our key stakeholders, highlighted by the important conclusion on a favorable terms of the California settlement agreement, which closely followed our successful completion of the multi-state review and claim reassessment process. And as you could sense too, we\u2019ve continued to invest in our business to leverage the position that we have in the marketplace, which again we think are really quite leveragable as we look forward into some very good market dynamics out there ahead of this.", "Now I would like to turn the call back over to Tom White, who will provide more detail on the quarter. Tom?", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Great. Thanks, Tom. I'll can keep my comments on the operating results fairly brief this morning but I do want to provide the following highlights. First for Unum U.S. in the group disability line, we continue to see improvement in the group disability benefit ratio, which as Tom said has declined in 91% for the first quarter. New claim incidence was generally stable in the first quarter with the levels we experienced\u2026 generally consistent with the levels that we experienced in the first and fourth quarters of 2007.", "Our analysis of incidence trends shows no significant variations either in any occupational categories or by case size. We have cautioned that if recessionary pressures show up in our claim incidence trends, it would more likely occur with a lag. However, we see no current signs of economic pressure on this part of our business. Additionally, the SCD line, which can be a precursor to LTD claim activity, also continues to perform well with stable claim incidence trends evident in first quarter. Net investment income for group disability in the first quarter was somewhat lower than recent historical quarterly averages and this reflects a lower level of bond call activity and prepayment premiums within the investment portfolio, as again as Tom described this refinancing activity and M&A activities remain at low levels.", "You'll recall that in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2007, this activity was somewhat elevated as indicated by the higher levels of net investment income attributable to bond call premiums in those quarters.", "And finally, the expense ratio was somewhat higher in the first quarter 2008 relative to the last year due to the slight decline in premium income and also higher product and service development costs.", "Moving to the Group Life and AD&D line, we saw an exceptionally strong level of profitability in this line with a benefit ratio of 68.2% compared to 75.2% in the first quarter of '07. The expense ratio for this line was higher this quarter reflecting the higher sales volume and quote activity as well as higher expenses related to product and service development. And also you should keep in mind that as our mix of business for Group Life shifts somewhat away from large case to more core market business, a slightly higher operating expense ratio will result.", "Finally, within Unum U.S. the supplemental and voluntary lines, we produced a record quarterly income in this line with BTOE of $68.7 million, an increase of 6.8%, which was driven by generally strong risk results and premium growth of 8.2%. And again the benefit ratios for each major business line improved relative to the year ago results and the expense ratio also declined from the fourth quarter 2007 levels.", "As Tom indicated, sales at Unum U.S. were strong increasing 29%. Core market sales for our group lines, which I'd defined as LTD and STD and Group Life were very strong, increasing 36.5% for the first quarter following an increase of 20% in the fourth quarter. We continue to be opportunistic in the large case market and sales for the first quarter grew by 12.4%. Our mix of sales was also encouraging with 61% core and 39% large case sales, which is in line with our long-term objectives. Momentum continues to build in the voluntary benefits line with sales increasing 34% for the quarter. And individual disability recently issued sales, which increased 8% for full-year 2007, grew by 13.8% here in the first quarter.", "Finally, premium persistency in our group lines improved for each of our LTD, STD and Group Life lines in 2008 compared to last year with terminations again focused mainly in the large case segments. So to summarize the results for Unum U.S. as a segment, we had excellent risk management results and the leveling out of higher expenses that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007, and these more than offset the lower level of miscellaneous net investment income associated with bond call premiums and prepayment income.", "So these trends\u2026 excuse me\u2026 overall produced growth in BTOE of 14% for the first quarter. Now I would like to move to Unum UK, and there we continue to see very strong results from Unum UK with a 16% increase in BTOE to $87.1 million for the first quarter.", "Risk results were excellent with a benefit ratio of 57.3% for the quarter compared to 61.1% in the year-ago quarter and 60.8% in the fourth quarter of '07. Lower rates of claim incidence for both group long-term disability and group life and an increased rate of claim recoveries for group long-term disability drove these results.", "First quarter expenses in Unum UK declined from the fourth quarter levels, which were elevated due to the accrual of remaining lease payments on a non-occupied facility. Finally, our first quarter sales, as we mentioned, declined by 10% on a dollar basis due primarily to lower large case activity as well as the benefit we experienced last year from sales driven by age, quality legislative changes. Additionally, the group life market in the UK remains challenging with competitive pricing limiting our opportunities. We did see good core market activity with sales in the under 500-life market for group LTD and for group life increasing by 8%.", "Moving to Colonial Life, with excellent quarterly results, in fact a record quarter, with favorable risk experience in the accident, sickness and disability product line. The benefit ratio continues to run below our long-term expectations and we continue to expect a gradual rise in the benefit ratio to more historical levels going forward. You\u2019ll notice that the expense ratio for Colonial declined from the elevated level of the fourth quarter of '07. The first quarter 2008 ratio was 19.7% compared to 21.7% in the fourth quarter of '07 and 19.3% in the first quarter of '07. We had high branding and advertising expenses in last year's fourth quarter and as we move through 2008 you can expect to see a more leveled pattern of spending which we will in turn translate into more consistency in the expense ratio throughout 2007. As Tom indicated, sales at Colonial Life were flat this quarter, but we did see some positive underlying trends. We saw good growth in the core market with sales in the under 100 life employee commercial market actually increasing by 8%. However, sales declined by 5.5% in the over 100 employee commercial market. We are also generally encouraged by the activity in the market. New account growth was up by 4.2% from the first quarter. However again, average new case size declined by approximately 5%. New sales rep recruiting and productivity show positive trends with new contracts increasing by 41% in the first quarter and our key new rep production milestones continue to improve.", "And finally, persistency at Colonial Life was stable to slightly higher for its major product lines relative to year-ago results. Finally moving to the Individual Disability Closed Block segment, these results were $13.7 million, which were below our expectations but it was driven entirely by lower net investment income. Similar to our Unum U.S. group disability results, the lower level of net investment income results from an extremely low level of bond call premiums this quarter as refinancing activities in the market remained low.", "We also had lower levels of an invested asset as a result of the fourth quarter of '07 release of excess statutory capital, again driven by the securitization that we announced last year. And that was capital that previously supported the Closed Block. Importantly, the risk trends for the closed visibility block remains stable in the first quarter and you will notice that the interest adjusted loss ratio was 19.1% [ph], which was below both the fourth and first quarter 2007 levels.", "Our weighted average share count, assuming dilution for the first quarter of 2008 was 351.5 million shares compared to 360.7 million in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we lowered the outstanding share count by 14.5 million shares with the execution of a $350 million accelerated share repurchase and you'll notice that the share count at the end of the first quarter of '08 was 346.3 million shares.", "Our consolidated return on equity for the first quarter was 11.2%, which was consistent with the full year 2007 ROE. Book value per share increased to $22.6 per share as of the end of the first quarter compared to $21.52 at March 31, 2007. And if you exclude the net unrealized gain on securities and the net gain of cash flow hedges, book value per common share increased to $21.06 at March 31, 2008 compared to $19.56 a year ago.", "And finally, the positive momentum in statutory earnings continued with our first quarter 2008 net gain from operations, this is after tax, was $148.4 million for our traditional U.S. Insurance subsidiaries compared to $143.4 million a year ago. Now I would like to close with few comments on the investment environment and our investment portfolio. The current market volatility, particularly the widening of corporate spreads on new investment opportunities continues to present opportunities for us. And despite the decline in U.S. Treasury yields in the first quarter, these wider corporate bond spreads enabled us to achieve a new money yield for the first quarter of 6.58%. This compares to 6.18% in the fourth quarter of '07 and 6.07% in the first quarter of '07. The overall portfolio yield, you noticed increased by 4 basis points relative to the year... excuse me, to the year-end 2007 yield. And the interest reserve margins also increased slightly and remained comfortably above our 50 to 60 basis point target.", "From a portfolio quality perspective, we are happy to again report that there have been no material changes in the quarter. We've outlined our exposure to asset mortgaged backed securities in our statistical supplement and I would like to take a minute just to highlight a few important investment facts that are frequent questions that we get. First of all, we have no subprime mortgage exposure, we have no CDOs related to asset backed or residential mortgage backed securities. Our Alt-A exposure is $5.2 million on a book value basis and $5.5 million on a fair value basis, all of which is rated AAA.", "The book value of our private equity partnership exposure is $51.6 million. We have no direct investments in any of the financial guarantors and our exposure to investments with wraps by financial guarantors is $135 million on a book value basis and $132.3 million on a fair value basis and the average underlying rating on these securities is an A1.", "So, overall we feel that our investment portfolio is in excellent shape and well positioned for what will likely continue to be a challenging environment in 2008. Our high yield exposure remains at approximately 5.2% of invested assets. The current level of non-current investments is only $4 million. And as always we will be pleased to address any specific questions you have regarding our investment holdings in the question and answer session.", "So, with that let me turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, thank you Tom. Again before we move to your Q&A, let me just close by reiterating how pleased I am with a strong start we've had to 2008. While we certainly all agree that this is no time to relax, we are certainly very pleased with where things are at this particular point with the strong balance sheet and a more flexible financial platform were relative to our long-term goals. Our risk-based capital was in excess of those goals, our leverage is below those goals and our liquidity to holding company is above those goals, all things which you would like to see. We have a well-positioned investment portfolio with historically low levels of high-yield bonds and very limited, as Tom said, if any exposure to the asset classes that are troubling many financial institutions today and very importantly and more diversified set of businesses with greater sources of growth which enable us to operate better in any environment.", "Now, we are certainly not fully immune to economic volatility or uncertainty. However, we believe we are significantly better positioned today operationally and financially than at any time in our past. We believe too that we're positioned well to benefit from some of the long-term changes happening in the marketplace whether there... the migration to voluntary products, dealing with issues the employers and employees are dealing with, or the federally funded challenges that Medicare and Social Security have. Again we are well positioned to benefit from those and as you can sense from my earlier comments, we are investing heavily in our products and services and people to assure that we are positioned well, the market leader to benefit from some of the market changes.", "Finally, with respect to guidance, we are increasing slightly our 2008 guidance by $0.02 per share to reflect the first... strong first-quarter results. Our new guidance is for operating earnings per fully diluted common share within a range of $2.37 to $2.42.", "Now with that operator, I think at this point we'd like to begin to move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instruction]. And we will take our first question with Colin Devine with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Good morning.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Colin.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Couple of questions, just to sort of flush out what's going on... sort of as you continue transform that... the U.S. business and I was wondering if Kevin is around to talk a bit about case counts to give us a sense of really just... from your customer base how is that changing, perhaps just you got Susan on the line, she could also talk about what's going on in the UK in that respect? And also if we could talk a bit about the benefit ratio, just expand is... as you noted the expense ratio is going to start to come up as the mix changes, what's driving the benefit ratio down? Is it the improvements in the back office, the repricing or is it partially a function of the mix? And then lastly, where are the Close Blocks, if you can maybe just give us some sense of what a realistic earnings run rate for it is now that has been securitized and you have taken some of the assets out of that?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good. Colin, good question. Maybe, Kevin, I'll just ask you to start on the case count for Unum U.S., as well let me just tie into that the benefit ratio piece and then we will come to Susan on the question for the UK.", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Great. Good morning, Colin. Case count for the quarter was up 31% and Unum U.S., really, really strong results following our fourth quarter results and core premium of course and associated with that case count was up 37%. So the momentum that we established in the second half of '07 continued in terms of customer acquisition. And by the way, case persistency was up also in the quarter. So overall, customer acquisition and retention is going very well. On the group income protection loss ratio improvement, incidence was stable in the quarter, recoveries were slightly improved and I think that drove some of the improvement, certainly mix and continued success in our renewal program also drove some of improved results.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Kevin, it\u2019s worth. I think just those were not surprising results on the customer side, when you look at the customer service scores in terms of potential to renew, desire to do more business and so forth, and we just had some very fresh data on that in that regard, which is again very encouraging for the future.", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "That's right. All of our customer satisfaction ratings continue to go up, like we did to renew, like we did to recommend and a lot of recent information about our brand attributes and financial strength, service quality, all of those ratings were up.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Kevin just to jump in for a sec, to sort of get at this, the mix changes, the benefit ratio and the expense ratio are going to change. So, we've got a target for where the benefit ratio is going to. Am I correct in understanding and this is what I thought Tom noted, expense ratio is going to start to drift up, so if the benefit ratio target is 88, what are we going to be looking at for an expense ratio?", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "I think the expense ratio will drift up just little bit at a time probably in the 18 to 19% range for a while. But then I think as Simply Unum comes on board, it will work its way back down, because we have efficiencies with the launch of Simply Unum as a result of having all of our customer management capabilities for all product lines on one single platform and a lot of our customer service capabilities are then web enabled for our customers. So you get some level of, if you will, customer-self service kicking in there as well. So\u2026 and I think also as our business mix moves to the small case marketplace and we continue to be affected in our target markets, you are going to also have more of your sales in lower incidence segments, which I think will also help us on the claim management expenses as well.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Thanks.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Susan, if I could just maybe ask you to speak a little to the UK experience in the sales front, especially on the case counts for the quarter?", "Susan Ring - Chief Executive Officer, Unum UK", "Yes, absolutely. Hi, Colin. And with regard to our case count, and that's up overall by 5% over last year and up 11% in our core market. And as far as sort of the underlying trends regarding sales are concerned and they are looking quite healthy [inaudible] product lines and significantly ahead of plan. They are up 24% to 30% and [inaudible] core market are significantly up on 2007 and group income tax in our group long-term disability was 13% versus 8% [ph] in the half last year. So, the key issue really is large case sales [inaudible] our average premiums down and that's really due to extreme pricing pressure that we are seeing in the market where finally the competitors are even prepared to write business below the cost of claims. And the second factor that\u2019s impacting our sales results is Group Life, where concentration of risk issues and where the level of exposure that we hold precludes us writing business in certain hot areas. And we haven\u2019t been able to write the volumes for Group Life that we would have expected. And other competitors either don\u2019t hold the same amount of business and as we have or and they have had a more cavalier approach to the concentration of risk issues than we tend to take. And so really they are the two factors that are impacting our sales, but core sales really remain healthy. That answers the question, Colin.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Perfect.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good. Thanks Susan. And maybe Tom if you could address Colin\u2019s questions about sort of the more sustainable run rate for earnings in the Closed Block.", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Yeah, I think Colin the way to look at the Closed Block is probably earnings in the low to mid 20 millions of dollars per quarter. And if you looked at this quarter's results, if we had had a normal quarter for bond calls, retirement [ph] income that would have added about $9 million to $10 million to net investment income and that would get us to kind of $23 million $24 million, we didn't have that this quarter, it is very unusual one for that on that regard. And also keep in mind that with the securitization, we moved out about $400 million of capital and so the net investment income from that capital is no longer reported in that line.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Colin.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question with Bob Glasspeigel with Langen-McAlenney. Please go ahead.", "Robert Glasspeigel - Langen-McAlenney", "Hi, Good morning. I am going to stay up with Colin on the group question and actually just tell us what's going on and as we look at page 7 on commissions going up and amortization of DAC less deferrals sort of going up. What sort of pressure is that going to offset as we go over the year with the benefit ratio coming down.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'm sorry. Bob you are looking at the page 7 of the statistical supplement.", "Robert Glasspeigel - Langen-McAlenney", "Right.", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "In U.S.?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "In U.S.", "Robert Glasspeigel - Langen-McAlenney", "U.S.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Tom you want to start?", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Yeah, I think certainly commissions are going to move up a little bit if sales move up. And that's a direct correlation there. On the amortization issue with the change in the amortization rules going back a year ago with SOP '05-1, if I got all my numbers right. It did cause some changes in that and what we had for Unum U.S. this quarter, particularly in the group disability line was a little bit more of these internal replacements where there was enough of a change in the renewal of the contract that causes us under the new accounting rules to go in and write off the DAC and put a new DAC. So there is a little bit of that expense, it\u2019s maybe $2 million that's impacting that. So there will be... a little noise from that going forward but it's fairly minor relative to the overall earnings of the business.", "Robert Glasspeigel - Langen-McAlenney", "I think the message, I think I am hearing is our earnings growth in U.S. group is going to be less than the benefit ratio improvement held back by discretionary spending on the expense ratio and a higher drag from commissions?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think so, we love to have higher sales, I mean we will deal with higher commissions, as the business comes on, the profitability flows through on it. But I wouldn't want you to think that we are going to feel any margin pressure from that.", "Robert Glasspeigel - Langen-McAlenney", "I didn't say margin pressure, I'm just saying the margin improvement won\u2019t be as much as the benefit ratio would suggest by itself. So we got a couple of drags that will offset it?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I am not sure, Bob, I think that... I don't think it is quite that extreme. Actually I think because the other thing is we have expenses or I think Kevin now are a little bit higher than expected, but I think we are going to grow our way back into that and actually have comeback in line. So I think there is a couple of other dynamics Bob going on there that, I don't know if Kevin you want to add to that.", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "I think we have some temporary uptick in expenses by our expansion of core distribution and are refocusing of our distributing channel towards the core marketplace, also increasing voluntary sales drive expenses up a little bit in the short-term. And are Simply Unum launch of courses as we roll that out and all the promotion and training that goes along with that. But then as Simply Unum as I said earlier as Simply Unum sales kick in we will start to get expense ratio efficiencies that start to flow through from that offering. And I think that that will bring the expense ratio back down. And Simply Unum in all of our strategy is of course focused on the small and midsize marketplace and so as I said those tend to be lower incidence marketplaces. So our claims expenses should start to come down as a result of that, and I think also we will get sort of generally a better claim operating performance results in those marketplaces. More package sales. So I think everything that we are doing is geared towards gearing up growth where we think we can improve profit margins and generate earnings growth.", "Robert Glasspeigel - Langen-McAlenney", "Thank you for your answers. I appreciate it.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, thanks Bob.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question with Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Hi good morning.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Tom.", "Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Few specific questions and then one macro question. I guess starting with Susan, on the UK, I was curious on your comments about the level of competition which sounds like it's getting bit more intense. Can you comment on what you think that means for your sales outlook and also persistency? Are you also seeing aggressiveness if competitors are trying to take business away from you? And then also what do you think that means to sort of the overall growth rate of your business over the next couple of years? Thanks. I will start with that then I have a few follow-ups.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Susan?", "Susan Ring - Chief Executive Officer, Unum UK", "Yes, sure. Thanks Tom. You are absolutely right to say the competition is competition is very intense and really with regard to our key competitors and as I said that is being extremely aggressive as far as pricing is concerned. That is certainly putting pressure on us, particularly at the large end of the market. And what we are doing is we are making sure that we are maintaining pricing discipline and it's not just putting pressure our sales, but it's also putting pressure on persistency and that we do have a very rigorous retention programs in place and at all size sectors and that's the business that we hold. And obviously most particularly on the large case, which is where and where tending to be most aggressively attacked and that also really right through including the small and medium case as well. And we do have a very good track record of making surely hold on to the business and that we have got and making sure that customers appreciate the value proposition. If we do these cases then and we keep track of them and we obviously still maintain a relationship because it's still paying existing claims system and we do go back for that business, and we do have a gain of very good record as regaining customers if we aren\u2019t fortunate enough to do some. So, I would say that we've got an aggressive retention program in place to make sure we keep hold to the business that we want. And we do have good results in our core markets from a sales point of view. We are maintaining our pricing discipline. And we are selling very much on the value of the customer proposition that we have to offer and our service proposition. And that is often very well appreciated by clients, by brokers. And to the extent that we do find that we are able to keep business at a price premium and we are also able to close new businesses at a price premium as well. And so, in terms of growth outlook and where obviously I am staying extremely focused to make sure we gain and keep what we are aiming for and having said that we are maintaining pricing discipline and we are not going to write business at a loss. So, [inaudible] having some other key points you want me to make.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And Susan just if I could add to that too. I think what you just described is a very similar set of circumstances we faced in Unum U.S. at point some time where you have competitors coming in and doing predatory pricing things and just maintaining that discipline. At the same time continuing to be sure we put pressure on our own product development and sales organizations to be sure that are out aggressively doing the right thing but doing it with cases that we can write profitably. And so, as I said, there is great parallels between the market dynamics that we see from point at times between the U.S. market and the U.K. market. And So I think people have seen in the U.S. market how that is translated ultimately into profitable growth.", "Susan Ring - Chief Executive Officer, Unum UK", "Yeah, absolutely, Tom and the new product that you mentioned that we have launched [inaudible] and that's a real innovation within the UK market, is something that nobody else has to offer. And so obviously we are expecting that that would deliver sales and that other competitors haven't at this point replicated that. So, we definitely have a first-mover advantage from that point of view.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Susan.", "Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "So Tom, I guess to your point about, the price discipline. Is it fair to say that if competitor pressures continue to be intense, it is a business that you would be willing to shrink to really hold on to your underwriting discipline if it comes there. I don't know if it is going to come to that or not. But is that, didn\u2019t you say that that would be your posture?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think very much, Tom. I think, again, the parallels are very strong between what we were just discussing in the UK right now versus the things that Kevin had to work through in Unum U.S. I mean, again, we have to be sure that we stay disciplined, be innovative, focused on service, focused on training of our people and the relationships we have in the marketplace, but just know when to walk away from business that needs to be walked away from. And again, I think as you point out, it's not clear to me that we're going to see the business shrink in the UK, but on the other hand, the mindset is one to be sure that if we grow, we're going to do \u2013 be sure we grow profitably and on a sustainable basis. And certainly our team has done that, you can see with the results. Actually not just this past quarter, but looking back several quarters, the things around large case and group lies have been out there for a while and I think the team in the UK has been very good about staying disciplined on profit.", "Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then one other, I guess, just a more macro question. The comment on claims frequency still being, I think, pretty stable or at least claims incidence being pretty stable. I'm just curious, in past, recessionary cycles, has it really been on the incidence side that you've seen it or is it really on claims duration? Because as I think about it, it would seem that it would be harder to get people to return to work when there is fewer jobs as opposed to seeing a big flood of new claims coming in, just curious what you're seeing on that end?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Tom, a big question. Kevin I may ask you to speak to that just operationally in terms of what we are seeing and kind of a look back to the last cycle in terms of why there is actually some key differences, I think, even in terms of the profile of our business right now.", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Good morning, Tom. In terms of our current business situation, as we said LTD incidence is flat. STD incidence was actually slightly improved in the quarter. IDI incidence was solid, flat. Waiver of premium incidence was flat, voluntary disability and critical illness incidence levels were favorable. So we just didn't really see any pressure at all from the incidence side. Looking back at prior recessions, I think the impact was more from the incidence side of the equation than from the recovery side of the equation although you do see some pressure on the recovery side, but more from the incidence side. In the 2001 '02 '03 recessionary period incidence went upwards but it was primarily driven by a large case and as you know we've significantly shrunk our large case presence over the last several years. Back then our large case business was I think 33% of our in-force business now... in terms of LTD now down to 26% of our business. So, considerably different mix of business today than we had back then. We also have much more diversified earnings and our claims operating performance is clearly reflected over the last eight quarters that were much tighter on claim management and our renewal machine has been... just terrific over the last four years. So, in a lot of ways I think that the pressures that we experience in '01 '02 are going to be mitigated and softened I think as a result of our diversified business mix and our approach to the business.", "Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Okay. So, and Kevin, so you are not seeing anything on the incidence side right now\u2026", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Nothing.", "Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Or sorry, on the recovery side right now?", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "No, in fact recoveries were slightly improved in the quarter.", "Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "I think Kevin you mentioned too, a big difference too is the change in process and leadership in that part of our business and actually investing quite a bit in that part of our business, which I think is somewhat more comforted in good and bad times as more consistency in terms of how that performs and so that\u2019s a big difference also?", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Absolutely.", "Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks.", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Thank you, Tom.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question with Eric Berg with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead, sir.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. Thanks very much and good morning to everyone.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Eric.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "Yes, good morning. So, I have two questions, one that is let's say a follow up to Tom, and it's really directed to Kevin and it's a general question. So, as everyone knows we have this situation where millions of people are facing housing pressure, price of the house is going down, resets on their mortgages, in some cases unable to refinance. I certainly\u2026 your message is coming through loudly and clearly that you've not seen an increase in incidence so far, but how should we think? What's on your mind, Kevin, in terms of this housing crisis and I'm just wondering is there any link, could there be a link between the housing crisis and the disability insurance business?", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Well. Good morning, Eric. It would be a stretch. I think one of the things to think about with incidence and recovery patterns is the degree to which people under financial pressure think that living on a fixed disability income, which is a lower percentage of earnings than their current salary levels would be an effective economic solution for themselves. I really sort of couldn\u2019t go there in a sense that housing pressure... housing crisis pressure would generate higher levels of incidence [inaudible] recovery because I think everyone is going to be better off working and earning an income than they are receiving a partial replacement of earnings from disability.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "So, you're saying it would be a stretch, but if they were a link, if I understand you and again I understand that you are saying it\u2019s a tenuous link, but you're saying if there were a link, it might take the form of an individual's feeling overwhelmed by his housing situation, negative equity, for example, just sort of becomes depressed and goes out\u2026 seeks to go out on disability, is that how in theory it might work?", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "I am sure there are some people who are going to be depressed by their economic situation and they might try to file disability claims. But, in general looking at the entire book of business there, I just don't see a link between what you're describing. I think if anything people under income pressures or ability to pay their build pressures, disability is not a good place go to resolve that problem, in fact that\u2019s a worst place than working.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Kevin, thank you. I think what you're saying too though is something goes on disability, they are not recovering 100% percent of their income.", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Right.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, if they have their own personal financial pressures whether it's because the housing field cost or whatever may be the cause of it. This is not a way to win\u2026 to gain the system frankly, not just for our company, but for our industry. They were time pass for people who work and may have been some over insurance in decades past. But, I think frankly that\u2019s not as much the issue with our industry or a company and therefore again if people are filling those financial pressures, frankly they are better off working than they are actually taking the policy out.", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Absolutely.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The issue might actually be more, Eric, it does affect disposable income and desire to buy voluntary products. So, it\u2019s a little more the\u2026 not the claim incidence side, Kevin, but for you and Randy, the issue of you find some persistency or lack of sales because of the challenges people are facing individually and even there we don't see that because of the small nature of the size of this premium relative to other things that they do.", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Right.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "Very clear, that set me straight on that issue. My second and final question relates to the very, very favorable claims experience in Group Life and my question is a simple one, there was a dramatic reduction year-over-year in the Group Life benefit ratio. It\u2019s now much lower than it was on a full-year basis than each of the last three years, should we view this benefit ratio, 68.2% in the quarter, as a new standard or was it anomaly? Thank you.", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Yes, it\u2019s Tom While. I wouldn't think of it as an ongoing run rate. I think generally a bit more favorable than normal and could move up a little bit. However, the overall profitability and margin on the business, we would expect to stay relatively flat with where it is, but if you look at the underlying issues there, the incidence was a touch better. The average claim was pretty flat with what it was before. The waiver of premium, which is another kind of risk driver in there, was favorable. I think the mix of business is probably helping us, certainly getting out of some of these larger cases over the last couple of years has improved the profitability. I think bottom line is, profitability should stay very strong, but you may see the benefit ratio tick up a little bit.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "That's helpful, Tom. Thank you.", "Robert C. Greving - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Actuary", "Eric, this is Bob Greving. We also see a seasonal pattern in our Group Life claims and the first quarter of the year is always the most favorable quarter. I think you'd probably see something go back into the\u2026 to the low-70% range like we experienced for the total year last year overall.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks to everyone.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks you, Eric.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question with Tamara Kravec with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Tamara.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "I wanted to delve a little more into the voluntary and supplemental business. You had pretty solid earnings and sales were up 34%, and you've obviously had your roll out of Simply Unum. So, if you could just talk about your expectations there for sales and profitability as we go forward?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good. Kevin, you want to pick up on that?", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Yes. Good morning, Tamara. We did have an excellent quarter and we had terrific momentum entering the year in our voluntary benefits business. In addition to that, not so much as a result of the Simply Unum content as much as sort of the overall attitude that we have in the marketplace in our distribution systems around commitment to voluntary products in our longer-term strategy around Simply Unum. I think we have increased core market focus in voluntary benefits. We are expanding our rep distribution channel in the core market, and that of course I think will drive additional voluntary benefits down the road. So, we are very optimistic about sales growth in VB. We are also introducing new products. We have good diversity in our voluntary benefits lines of business, and we'll continue to introduce additional voluntary lines in 2009. And so overall, I see that as being an increasing percentage over the course of time of our Unum U.S. book of business. And of course, we have terrific investments in our enrollment capabilities there as well, which I think will drive increased participation in our voluntary lines and we have solid persistency there too. So, overall it's a really good story.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "In your mind, do you have a target business mix? I mean given that your profitability in your Group Income Protection business is improving and that the earnings there are more robust? How would you envision the mix in the U.S. changing there over the next couple of years?", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "I don't have a target. I would think that our business would tend to be sort of, a third of our business voluntary, about a third of it group disability, about a third of it life and AD&D kind of business. But I think as we get our Simply Unum strategy launched over the next several years, the lines are going to blur between what I'll call traditional group lines and voluntary lines. In fact, I think our overall target is to be a benefits company to provide as many benefits as we can through that one Simply Unum platform to employers and to provide as much funding flexibilities we can to employers and employees. And so I think the lines between how much of it's voluntary, how much of it's employer paid will begin to blur at the time. The real question is how many lines, how many clients can we acquire and how many lines of business can we place to satisfy the needs of those clients.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "Okay. And I am sorry if I missed this earlier, but I think the amortization in your UK segment was sequentially down a lot? Was there a reason for that?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it goes back to the change in the DAC accounting last year, the SOP 05-1 and how those internal replacements are handled.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "Okay.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Actually the pattern of renewals is a little different in our UK business relative to our U.S. business. In the U.S., it's more of a kind of a heavy January 1, and in the UK it\u2019s a little more\u2026 little more heavily focused on April 1. There is a little noise, as we kind of get a year past that and you'll see a more normal pattern emerge.", "Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities", "Okay. Thank you.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Tamara.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We will take our next question from Mark Finkelstein with FPK. Please go ahead.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Good morning.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "I wanted to go back to a point that you touched on kind of in a brief comment, but just at Colonial, do you believe you're seeing any impact from the economy on either sales or kind of I guess account penetration on those cases you currently have. And if so, how does that factor into your sales expectations for the year. One of your competitors said that they may be seeing some impacts. So, I'm curious in kind of why you're seeing in your experience.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That\u2019s a good question, Mark. Randy, you want to take that one?", "Randall C. Horn - President and Chief Executive Officer, Colonial Life", "You bet, Tom. Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Good morning.", "Randall C. Horn - President and Chief Executive Officer, Colonial Life", "Yes, we're watching that very, very closely as you can imagine. In the first quarter, we're not really seeing much impact quite honestly from the economy, our account penetration is very stable. The number of payers overall in terms of those purchasing new policies from us is actually up about 3.5% or so, and our persistency is very stable, actually increasing somewhat. So, at this point in time we just not see much of an impact. And so as we look out to the future, we're still cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to hit our sales targets for the year.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay. Great. And then just real quick on the higher yield in the quarter on new money. I guess are you incorporating that into pricing and does that have any kind of impact in your view on the solid sales in the U.S.?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It is not being incorporated into pricing right now. No.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay. So, in the first quarter there were no material pricing adjustments outside of the\u2026 I think you disclosed the IDI change?", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Certainly not related to any change in investments deals.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Mark. I think at this point, Tom, maybe just one more question.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "Okay. We'll take our last question with Jeff Schuman with KBW. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Good morning.", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "How are you?", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Fine. How are you doing?", "Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. The questions for, maybe for Bob Greving. I was just wondering when you wrapped up the claims reassessment process, what was the level of the remaining claim or benefit reserve at that point and was that released this quarter or redirected somewhere or how did that sort of work its way through the financials?", "Robert C. Greving - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Actuary", "All right. Jeff, basically the reserve had pretty much been exhausted during the quarter. And we had a little bit over that that actually flowed through earnings. But for the most part it was pretty much breakeven. So, it pretty well dovetailed in to finish everything else.", "Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "You know about what the amount was?", "Robert C. Greving - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Actuary", "It was just a couple of million dollars, I think.", "Kevin P. McCarthy - President, Unum US", "Jeff, if you go back, I think it was the third quarter last year there were some adjustments that we've made, there were some IDI reserves that were released. And this quarter, we put up a little bit of extra for LTD reserves and we also kind of shrewd up the expense reserves. I think it was... we brought down a little bit on the IDI side and bumped it up a little bit on the LTD. So, the big adjustments were made in that quarter and so the fourth quarter and first quarter impacts were very, very small.", "Thomas R. Watjen - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. If anything, Jeff, we've had a little bit of expense pressure in the quarter as some of those resources we had devoted to the RSA actually got moved back into the general operations. But that's really the only pressure that we had.", "Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Tom White - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Well, thanks Jeff and actually thank you all again for taking the time to join us on the call and this completes the first quarter 2008 earnings call.", "Operator", "Once again ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tom White", "Great, thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2008 analyst and investor conference call for Unum Group.", "As we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are also located in the sections titled \u2018Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u2019 and \u2018Risk Factors\u2019 [ph] in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and also in our subsequently filed Form 10-Q. Our SEC filings including our Forms 10-K and 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website at unum.com.", "Please also take note that the statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.", "As usual, a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measure is included in today's presentation can be found on our website in the Investors section.", "Yesterday afternoon, Unum Group reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008. Net income in the quarter was $41.8 million or $0.13 per diluted common share compared to net income of $160.5 million or $0.44 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Included in these results for the fourth quarter of '08 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $167.6 million or $0.50 per diluted common share and $16.5 million or $0.05 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "These losses include the impact of the provisions of DIG B36 accounting, which require changes in fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract to be reported as realized investment gains and losses. This accounting requirement resulted in a fourth quarter 2008 realized after-tax investment loss of $120.1 million compared to $23.3 million after-tax loss in the fourth quarter of '07.", "Net realized after tax investment losses related to sales and write-downs of investments were $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of \u201808 compared to net realized after tax investment gains of $6.8 million in fourth quarter of 2007. Results for the fourth quarter of 2007 also included an after tax debt extinguishment cost of $36.1 million, which is $0.10 per diluted common share.", "So, excluding these items, after tax operating income was $209.4 million or $0.63 per diluted common share compared to $213.1 million or $0.59 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "On the call this morning are President and CEO, Tom Watjen; also Bob Greving, who is Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Actuary, as well as the heads of our three major operating segments \u2013 Kevin McCarthy, Susan Ring, and Randy Horn.", "And at this time I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning. The fourth quarter was a good quarter for Unum, which closes out a pretty good year for us in 2008, and let me touch on a few of the highlights.", "First, as Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, excluding net realized after tax investment losses, we reported $0.63 per share in operating income for the fourth quarter, which was 7% higher than the $0.59 we reported in the fourth quarter of 2007. This brings our full year 2008 operating income to $2.51 per share, a 14% increase over 2007.", "Second, operating results in the quarter remained strong. Risk results were generally in line with our expectations across all our core businesses. This was tempered somewhat by lower miscellaneous net investment income, the weakness of the British pound, which impacted the translation of our U.K. earnings, and expenses primarily related to employee terminations costs associated with cost management actions taken in Unum UK.", "Third, we saw a continued positive momentum in our sales results. The focus across all of our operating businesses remained to profitably grow our core market businesses with the sales to small and mid-size employer marketplace and we saw good success again this quarter.", "Fourth, reflecting the challenging investment environment, realized investment losses remained higher than normal this quarter. However, the fourth quarter losses, excluding DIG B36, were somewhat lower than in the third quarter of 2008. While we expect to continue to see a higher than normal level of realized investment losses until the general economic and financial market environment improves, we remain confident that our portfolio is well positioned to weather this difficult business environment. And we have the financial flexibility to absorb the investment losses, which might occur in this more challenging period.", "Also, the net unrealized loss position in our fixed maturities portfolio widened somewhat in the fourth quarter, which again reflects the widening of spreads, particularly this past quarter in the below investment-grade sector of the market, and Tom White will have more on this in a moment.", "As we have discussed with you in the past, we have very predictable cash needs, and virtually no disintermediation risk in our insurance liabilities. And therefore we are under no pressure to sell investments at a loss to meet policyholder obligation. As we have stated before, these wider spreads also present favorable opportunities for new investment. And the fourth quarter provided an excellent environment to put new money to work at very attractive yields and therefore enhance our portfolio yield, and I might add, without adding [ph] any additional risk to the portfolio.", "Lastly, we continue to comfortably exceed our targets for capital and liquidity, leverage, and risk-based capital. This financial flexibility positions us well for the continuing challenging environment we find ourselves in.", "Now, before I make a few additional comments on our fourth quarter operating results, I wanted to spend a moment on the change in 2009 guidance that we announced with our operating earnings release yesterday. We provided our initial guidance for 2009 at our Investor Day meeting back on November 11, based on business indicators as of the end of October. Over the past three months, we have seen continued poor financial market performance, a dramatic weakening of the pound, the British pound, to levels not seen in over 20 years, and certainly further signs that the economic and employment picture will worsen in 2009.", "In light of these factors, we felt that it was prudent to adjust our guidance downward, as others have, to in our case a range of $2.45 per share to $2.55 per share in operating earnings. Again, this revised guidance reflects three things. First, a move from an exchange rate of $1.65 to $1.50; second, our higher expected pre-tax pension cost of approximately $42.5 million, which reflects the lower rate of return on plan assets during 2008, and the lower discount rate assumptions for our pension liabilities; and thirdly, while we have not yet seen any meaningful changes in our paid incidence claims as the employment picture has deteriorated since most economists have assumed further pressure on employment and consumer confidence, we felt that it was prudent to incorporate some further deterioration in our outlook for 2009.", "We are now projecting operating earnings in 2009 to be slightly below that of 2008, down from our earlier guidance of growth of 4% to 6%. I think it\u2019s important to note again that at this time we have not seen any material impact on our operating results from the weak economy. But again, given the general view that things may worsen, we felt that it was appropriate to assume so in our guidance as well.", "Our 2009 capital guidance we presented in November is largely unchanged, with risk-based capital for our U.S. insurance subsidiary still expected in a range of 330% to 335%, the Holding Company liquidity to exceed $750 million. We are making a slight revision to our leverage expectation from our earlier projection of 18% to 19% to a range of 20% to 21%.", "As you can see, even with this revised operating earnings guidance for 2009, we believe Unum will maintain excellent financial flexibility, a necessity in these extraordinarily turbulent times.", "Now, let me come back to our fourth quarter results and provide a few comments on the performance of each of our businesses. First, Unum US, our pre-tax operating earnings for Unum US increased 13.5% to $182.6 million in the fourth quarter with favorable performance in the group disability and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which offset lower earnings in the group life line.", "Group disability earnings were 38% higher with solid risk results offset somewhat by lower net investment income related to lower bond call premiums. Importantly, the group disability benefit ration for the fourth quarter improved to 88.7%, a decline of 60 basis points from the third quarter of 2008, and a decline of 280 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Seasonally adjusted submitted incidence trends showed a slight rise in the quarter for our LTD line of business, but remained within the range of incidence levels we have experienced over the past several quarters. I might add that this result was within our range of 88% to 89% that we had projected for the end of 2008 or early 2009.", "We saw very strong results from the supplemental and voluntary lines with earnings growth of 26% while group life and AD&D results were down about 16%, driven primarily by lower group life premium income and slightly higher claim experience.", "Total Unum US sales increased 13% in the fourth quarter with strong results in the core market where sales grew almost 30%. Our voluntary benefit sales were flat this quarter, but full year 2008 grew at almost 15% and the pipeline for 2009 sales activity is encouraging.", "And Kevin McCarthy is available with us today obviously to answer some questions you may have about the business and the marketplace.", "Now, turning to Unum UK, our pre-tax earnings in Unum UK were $54.6 million for the fourth quarter. These results were lower relative to the fourth quarter of 2007 in large part due to the significant decline in the value of the British pound. Risk results remained in line with our longer term expectations, driven primarily by a decline in premium income, but somewhat higher than recently quarterly experience. Unum UK\u2019s fourth quarter results were also impacted by $6.2 million of employee termination cost in the quarter as they implemented a number of cost reduction actions. These actions are intended to bring our expense base better in line with our premium expectations as well as improve our operating effectiveness.", "And Susan Ring is available with us here this morning to answer any questions you may have, again, of our U.K. business or the U.K. marketplace.", "And finally, in our Colonial operations, our pre-tax earnings increased 13% to $66.3 million in the fourth quarter as we continue enjoy solid margins in this business. While total sales increased only 1% for the fourth quarter, the lower long term expectations, our recruiting results and productivity measures are encouraging and we believe will help us grow this business in the future.", "And again, Randy Horn is with us here this morning to answer any questions you may have about Colonial or the Colonial marketplace.", "Now, let me come back to investments. I mentioned it earlier, but let me say again that our investment portfolio continues to perform well with a low, manageable level of default experienced. We are seeing good opportunities to put new money to work at attractive yields while maintaining our investment quality objective.", "As for the increase in our net unrealized investment losses, we attribute the majority of the growth to wider corporate bond spreads. We certainly monitor these changes in our portfolio of values. It\u2019s not something we feel is a concern since we are not in a business, which will lead to the need to sell investment prior to maturity.", "And last, with regard to our capital position, we closed 2008 with what we believe to be a very solid financial position, one that positions us well for this challenging environment. Our risk based capital ratio for our traditional and U.S. life insurance companies is 327%, above our long term target of 300%.", "Leverage excluding the nonrecourse debt and capital of Tailwind and Northwind Holdings finished the year 21.5%, again below our long term target of 25%. And our holding company liquidity was $526 million, also comfortably above our $270 million target, which allows coverage for one-year fixed charges plus maintenance of the capital cushion for business and economic volatility.", "In summary, I feel good about the fourth quarter results and our position as we head into a challenging 2009. Our core operating segments continue to meet expectations with steady risk results across our major business. We have good sales momentum in our targeted core markets. Our investment portfolio continues to perform well in this slightly very difficult environment. We continue to maintain solid financial flexibility. And finally, our people are focused on executing our plans and not letting the external environment to become a distraction.", "Looking ahead, 2009 is certainly shaping up to be another challenging year where we are benefiting from the steps we took over the past few years to strengthen our operating and financial performance. Our primary focus is to continue to execute our plans and being alert for opportunities this environment may create.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Tom White, who\u2019ll provide more detail on the fourth quarter results. Tom?", "Tom White", "Thanks, Tom. I want to take a few minutes to supplement Tom\u2019s comments and provide some operating highlights on the quarter and I\u2019ll also provide an update on the investment portfolio.", "First, looking at operating results for the Unum US group disability line, we continue to see improvement in the group disability benefit ratio, which declined to 88.7% for the fourth quarter. New submitted claim incidence on a seasonally adjusted basis was slightly higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter of 2008, but remained within the range of incidence levels we have experienced over the past several quarters.", "Additionally, the short term disability line, which often can be a leading indicator of LTD claim incidence, continues to perform well with a low level of claim incidence in the fourth quarter. The discount rate on new claim incurrals was raised in the fourth quarter, which produced a slight benefit to our fourth quarter results. I will note, however, that the beneficial impact of the discount rate adjustment was less than the 60 basis point improvement in the overall benefit ratio from the third to the fourth quarter.", "Net investment income in the fourth quarter declined by slightly more than 1% from year-ago levels, primarily due to lower \u2013 a lower level of bond calls activities, which is a trend that we have seen \u2013 which we do see continuing into 2009.", "The Unum US group life and AD&D line results here declined to $50.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $60.1 million in the year-ago quarter, but were in line with the $50.9 million that we reported in the third quarter of 2008. The benefit ratio was fractionally higher than a year ago at 70%, primarily reflecting an average claim size. Margins in this line were also impacted by a higher expense ratio, which is due to the mix of business shift to more smaller core market cases, and also a 3% decline in premium income.", "Moving to the Unum US supplemental and voluntary line, we continue to see very strong results here with record quarterly before tax operating earnings of $72.6 million, an increase of 26%. All three primary lines, which are the recently issued individual disability, the voluntary benefits, and long term care, produced year-over-year improvement in operating earnings.", "Premium income grew by 7.7 \u2013 and risk results were stable to slightly improved across each product line.", "As Tom indicated earlier, we reported sales for Unum US \u2013 our reported sales for Unum US increased by 12.7% in aggregate and there were several bright spots to highlight. Our core market sales for our group lines, which are LTD, STD, and the group life, and AD&D combined, showed continued strong momentum, increasing 29.6% for the fourth quarter and 23.7% for full year 2008. Sales in the large case market remained flat in the fourth quarter as we remained disciplined and opportunistic in that market.", "Voluntary benefit sales increased less than 1% in the fourth quarter, but increased 14.6% of full year 2008. Our activity in the core market remained strong with high activity levels for quotes and new coverage sales.", "And finally, persistency levels for our primary lines within Unum US improved over 2007 levels, most significantly in the STD and group life lines.", "So, to summarize the results for Unum US as a segment, continued strong risk management results across the board. Some pressure on net investment income due to lower levels of miscellaneous net investment income, but continued positive sales momentum, particularly in our targeted core markets.", "For Unum UK, the decline in the value of the British pound relative to the dollar negatively impacted the translated fourth quarter results for the Unum UK segment. But the underlying operating results were generally strong. The benefit ratio rose to 63% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by the decline in premium income. We experienced an uptick in new claim incidence in the fourth quarter, primarily from our banking sector exposure. However, this increase was largely offset by strong claims management and higher claim recoveries.", "As mentioned previously, we recorded 3.9 million pounds or $6.2 million of expenses in the fourth quarter relate to our disciplined cost management program, which is intended to bring the expense base of Unum UK more in line with the lower level of premium income and to improve operating efficiencies, going forward. These incremental expenses totaled 4.4 million pounds in 2008, and are expected to be more than offset by cost savings and improvements in operating efficiencies in 2009.", "Fourth quarter sales declined 22% in dollar terms, but in local currency increased 2.4% in the fourth quarter and 3.6% for the full year. The group risk markets in the Unum UK \u2013 in U.K. remained very competitive especially in group life and the large case segments. The competitive dynamics of the U.K. market are also impacting our persistency results with persistency for group disability at 87.4%, which is below our long term expectations.", "This level of persistency combined with the current level of new sales activity will make top line growth difficult to achieve that we do expect the profitability of Unum UK to remain at strong levels.", "Moving to Colonial Life, we had continued favorable performance with $66.3 million in before tax earnings for the fourth quarter, 13% higher than the year ago levels. The benefit ratio was fractionally higher than last year, 48.3%, compared to 48% last year, reflecting slightly higher claims activity in the older cancer blocks, but generally stable performance across the other product lines. We are in the process of taking pricing actions on the underperforming older cancer product lines and no longer actively market these specific policies.", "Sales at Colonial Life increased by 1.1% for the fourth quarter and 1.6% for the full year, below our long term growth objectives and certainly impacted by the weak economy. We remain encouraged, however, by activity levels in the market. New account growth was up approximately 6% in the fourth quarter. We are seeing pressure on rework sales, which are the follow-up sales to existing customers. This is historically an important source of sales growth at Colonial Life.", "New sales rep recruiting continues to show positive trends with new contracts increasing by 4% in the fourth quarter and 28% for the full year.", "And finally, persistency at Colonial Life remained stable in the major product lines relative to year ago results. The individual disability \u2013 close block segment pre-tax earnings here was $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $15 million in the year ago quarter.", "Risk results were steady with the interest adjusted benefit ratio at 82.6% this quarter compared to 83.8% last year. Net investment income continues to be volatile and again this quarter was significantly lower than the year ago quarter primarily due to the lower level of assets supporting this run off block of business as well as the ongoing impact of fewer bond call premiums this quarter, which negatively impact net investment income by $5 million compared to year ago quarter.", "The corporate and other segment recorded an operating loss of $400,000 compared to a loss of $65.2 million in the year ago quarter. Excluding the debt extinguishment cost of $55.6 million, the fourth quarter 2007 loss was $9.6 million. This segment did benefit from $7.6 million of other income received in the fourth quarter related to a refund of interest primarily attributable to prior tax years. Also, point out that interest expense was reduced to $26.9 million in the fourth quarter of \u201908 compared to $38.7 million in the year ago quarter.", "Finally, our weighted average share count, assuming dilution for the fourth quarter was 331 million shares compared to 360.7 million shares in the fourth quarter of \u201907 and the actual number of shares outstanding at year-end 2008 was 331.1 million. Book value per share declined to $19.32 per share as of December 31, 2008, and this compares to $22.28 at December 31,2007. When you exclude the net unrealized gains and losses on security and the net gain on cash flow hedges, the book value per common share was $20.45 at the end of 2008 compared to $20.79 at the end of 2007.", "Earnings on a statutory accounting basis remained very healthy with fourth quarter 2008 net gain from operations after tax of $227.4 million for our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Net income was $143.9 million. For full year 2008, the net gain from operations, again after tax, was $682 million for our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries and net income was $540.8 million.", "Now, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes on the investment environment and our investment portfolio and also the capital and liquidity positions of the Company. On our third quarter conference call and at our November analyst meeting, we discussed with you our liquidity position. To summarize, Unum is primarily an employee benefits and individual disability company. For the vast majority of our in-force blocks, if a policyholder lapses a policy they will start paying as premiums, but we do not owe them any cash value on the policy. Simply stated, we have very minimal run-on-the-bank risk. It is because of this liability structure that we have the ability to hold our investments to maturity. Therefore, we are not in position to have to liquidate investments at an inopportune time such as today with the historically wide credit spreads to meet policyholder obligations.", "In addition, we have very little refinancing risk. At year end, we had short term debt of $190.5million, $58.3 million of that amount were reverse repurchase agreement, which will be paid off with operating cash flow, and then $132.2 million is short term debt that is due in May of 2009. We have the cash on hand to retire that debt when it comes due or will look to refinance, if market conditions improve.", "During the fourth quarter, the level of unrealized losses in our fixed maturity bond portfolio increased as corporate bond spreads widened further. The net unrealized loss position was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2008, compared to $1.7 billion at September 30th, 2008.", "When you look back at the third quarter of \u201908, we commented on our call and at our investor meeting that we had experienced basically a parallel shift in the value of our fixed maturity holdings. That is, basically all securities, regardless of rating, declined in value by roughly 4.5%. Let me contrast that to what we experienced in the fourth quarter in that our more highly rated securities tended to improve in value while the lower rated securities declined in value, and you will see this in the various benchmarks. For example, the 10-year Treasury bond declined in yield by approximately 160 basis points during the fourth quarter while most benchmark corporate bond spread indices widened. The single A index widened by about 36 basis points and the Triple B index widened by 284 basis points, and the below investment-grade index widened by over 600 basis points.", "So when you examine Page 13.1 of our fourth quarter statistical supplement you will see that year-end we held $13.5 billion of fixed maturity bonds that had a gross unrealized gain of $1.3 billion. This will compare to third quarter of \u201908 holdings of $12.7 billion of fixed maturity bonds with gross unrealized gains of $911 million.", "Looking again at the fourth quarter of \u201908, you will see that we had $18.4 billion of fixed maturity bonds with a gross unrealized loss of $3.4 billion, and this compares to the third quarter when we had $20.2 billion of fixed maturity bonds with gross unrealized losses of $2.6 billion.", "A couple of points to make on those securities in a gross unrealized loss position. First, 81% of our unrealized losses were related to bonds that carry an investment-grade rating, so we would expect that the default risk to be relatively low on those. And second, when we examined the bonds trading at less than 80% of book value, 86% of these had been in a market to book value ratio of less than 80% for less than 180 days, which does indicates that the price decline has been recent and a result of the significant widening of spreads in the second half of 2008.", "Now, as Tom said, there is also a positive side to the widening of corporate bond spreads in that the very attractive yields that we are seeing on new money purchases. Our new money yields in the quarter were 8.47% on a hedge-adjusted basis and this compares to 6.77% on a hedge-adjusted basis in the third quarter. The average credit rating on these purchases in the fourth quarter was A2, so we were able to achieve these yields without sacrificing quality. And this has the benefit of stabilizing our duration weighted book yield at 6.72% compared to 6.70% at the end of the third quarter.", "There have been some additional investment classes that have been receiving a lot of attention lately, so I\u2019d like to spend a minute discussing our exposures to CMBS and commercial mortgage loans as well as our exposure to hybrid securities.", "First, our CMBS exposure is nominal at $4.2 million of book value, and just as with subprime mortgages we were never a significant investor in these types of securities. Our commercial mortgage loan exposure was $1.27 billion at the end of 2008 or 3.4% of total invested assets. We currently only have one mortgage loan of $5.2 million that is delinquent, and we have another four loans, which total $30 million that are on our watch list, which is the list of investments that are presently current, but are subject to enhanced monitoring and more intensive review.", "We believe our overall commercial mortgage loan portfolio is of high quality with a loan-to-value ratio of approximately 67% and this is with the value based on our internal underwriting and not the appraised value, which is generally higher. We are typically \u2013 we are underweight in retail loans and on a geographic basis we are underweight in the California market.", "Moving to hybrid securities at year-end 2008, we had holdings of approximately $496 million on a book value basis. Approximately 64% are Tier 1 securities with the balance in the upper Tier 2 securities. We have three positions in \u2013 we have positions in three securities, which currently carry one or more below investment-grade ratings. And these Royal Bank of Scotland, Northern Rock, and Anglo Irish Bank, and our combine holdings of these three is $129 million on a book value basis. The balance of our hybrid holdings are investment-grade and all of our hybrid holdings are current on their interest payments.", "So, I will close my remarks with a summary of realized investment losses for the fourth quarter. Again, our reported net recognized investment losses excluding the loss of $120.1 million after tax or $184.7 million before tax on DIG B36, this totaled $47.5 million after tax or $73 million before tax. On a before tax basis, the realized losses from writedowns totaled $83.5 million while realized investment gains from sales totaled $10.5 million. The primary sources of the realized investment losses from writedowns were Ford Motor at $32 million; there were two media companies, Idearc at $21.6 million and McClatchy at $12.1 million and then Lyondell Petrochemical at $12.9 million.", "And we\u2019ll be pleased to address any specific questions you may have regarding our investment holdings in the Q&A session. So, with that, let me turn it back to Tom for some final closing comments.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Tom. Before I move to your questions, let me conclude with a couple of final comments. As you saw yesterday, we announced that our CFO, Bob Greving, has announced his intention to retire later this year and we have initiated a search process for his successor.", "As you know, Bob has been an integral part of our senior leadership team for more than a decade and has been instrumental in helping us build a strong financial foundation we enjoy today. Bob has been kind enough to provide us with plenty of advance notice to ensure an orderly transition and will certainly be very involved in the process including to help to assure a transition, so Bob isn\u2019t going to be going anywhere soon.", "In closing, I\u2019d like to reiterate how pleased I am, but not complacent with the current position of the Company. We are not immune to feeling the effects of the economy, but I believe that we have the management and resources and in place to ensure that we can successfully overcome the challenges that lie ahead. Our strategy today is standing on disciplined, profitable growth with a sharp focus on risk management throughout the organization. This strategy has served us well as we are a more diversified company, better positioned for today\u2019s challenging environment.", "Our investment portfolio is well positioned with historically low levels of high yield bonds and minimal exposure to the asset classes that are causing significant losses in the financial system today. While unrealized losses in the portfolio remain higher due primarily to wider corporate bonds spreads, our liquidity position is strong and the nature of our liabilities means that we do not need to sell investments to meet policyholder obligations.", "And our balance sheet is strong and our financial flexibility is as well with (inaudible) risk based capital, leverage, and holding company liquidity comfortably ahead of our targets.", "At this time, operator, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) We\u2019ll go first to Darin Arita at Deutsche Bank.", "Darin Arita \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good morning.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Darin.", "Darin Arita \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "A couple of questions here, the first one is on the \u2013 on U.S. group long term disability. I was just wondering if you could talk about any changes in claims trends that you are seeing across industries, if you look at the spectrum of lower risk to higher risk sectors?", "Tom Watjen", "Sure, and maybe I\u2019ll ask Kevin to address that one, Darin.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Good morning, Darin.", "Darin Arita \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "Kevin McCarthy", "As Tom mentioned, we saw a slight uptick in incidence during the fourth quarter, but most of that was what I\u2019ll call sort of normal noise. We didn\u2019t see any uptick, for example, in education or finance. We saw a mild uptick in manufacturing, transportation and utilities, which we normally see. But then we look at incidence in STD or IDI or waiver premium in life and in fact, if anything, we saw slight improvements in incidence there. So, overall, it was kind of a pretty normal and stable quarter in terms of incidence and no particular trend to point to", "Darin Arita \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. And turning to the UK, I mean the competitive environment still seems difficult there. I was just wondering how quickly do you think claims trends could increase as unemployment rises, so some of your more aggressive competitor feel some pain.", "Tom Watjen", "It\u2019s a good question. Susan, you want to take that one?", "Susan Ring", "Yes, sure, thanks Darin. As you say, it is quite a hostile competitive environment in the U.K. at the moment and has been pretty much throughout 2008. And in terms of claims trends we have seen an increase in incidence and during the fourth quarter, so that was primarily from our banking sector and primarily for psychological claims reasons. So \u2013 and we have already seen that come through. Having said that, we have an increase in the cap rates, which has more than offset that. So our claims run off experience has been continually very strong. And so that has already come through. And we also have a very strong investment in our return-to-work assets. So, we are seeing consistent and favorable performance on that front. So, I think that provides us some additional resilience in terms of the operating environment that we are operating in.", "Tom Watjen", "And maybe, Susan too I think Darin was trying to get hold to also to the competitive environment too and I think for the most part, although you see some competition in group disability, probably the greatest competition is in group life. So even though we are seeing maybe a softer economic environment, we may not see any let down in the competitive dynamics in the group life marketplace.", "Susan Ring", "No, I agree. As you say, as I was saying earlier, it is very hostile from a competitive point of view. We are seeing that really radical product expense and it\u2019s even more aggressive in the group life sectors, which has had some impact from our persistence (inaudible) June 2008. We do expect that to continue during 2009, particularly as we know that we have a competitor entering the market and we expect them to make a lower prize play. So, we don\u2019t really see that\u2019s going to change in 2009.", "Darin Arita \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Alrigh, thank you.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Darin.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll go to Jeff Schuman at KBW.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Good morning, a fairly narrow question here. The pension \u2013 the increase in pension cost, how will that emerge \u2013 it\u2019s at $42.5 million in \u201909, should I think of that as just kind of a $10 million a quarter (inaudible) going forward or is there some kind of one-time element referred to that?", "Tom Watjen", "Bob, you want to take that?", "Bob Greving", "Yes, hi Jeff, this is Bob Greving. Yes, it basically will be assessed on a quarterly basis, so it will be \u2013 it will emerge on a fairly level basis each quarter.", "Tom Watjen", "And I will suggest, I\u2019d to that, it will show up in the corporate and other line \u2013 expenses line there.", "Bob Greving", "Right.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "But as of the change in market conditions, it would go on \u2013 and \u201909 is kind of just a new level is that how we should think of it?", "Bob Greving", "Yes, as you know the accounting for pensions is kind of strange and the losses that were incurred in the year in the investment portfolio get amortized over a number of years, so we\u2019ll still see elevated expenses for several years, but it will ultimately settle back into the kind of the normal cost range.", "Tom Watjen", "Bob, I\u2019d say at the end of the year there is another assessment of it as well as the cost, the assets and the liabilities and what\u2019s changed in both of those, so that\u2019s an annual process that every company goes through it.", "Bob Greving", "That\u2019s correct.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then one other question. You did take serious look at costs in the U.K. and took some actions this quarter. Should we anticipate that you might take a sharper look at some operations or not?", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, I think just generally, Jeff, I think every one is just \u2013 I think on an everyday basis consistently looking at cost at productivity at the same time looking for ways to improve operational efficiencies and effectiveness and there were certainly some more visible things that were done in the U.K., but I\u2019d say Kevin and Randy, in those business, you are continually looking at things, but more just kind of on a \u2013 not on a project basis, but on just an everyday basis. And I don\u2019t know Kevin or Randy if you want to add anything to that.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Tom, that\u2019s right on. Thanks for coming up all the time. And we are just trying to take advantage of opportunities as they arise but no special project I\u2019d focus.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay, thanks a lot guys.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll go to Colin Devine of Citigroup.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Good morning.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Colin.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "A couple of questions. First, it was a DAC adjustment at Colonial, if you could comment on what that was? Second, if you can just clarify on the hybrids, if they are Tier 1 or Tier 2 and what type of Tier 2, and expand that perhaps on the U.K. And then the final question, which we\u2019d talked about coming into this, I am certainly very happy to see the benefit ratio in group income protection improve, but I am also beginning to question how real this is in the wake of two recent second Circuit Court of Appeals decision. When you read language from the court about Unum\u2019s behavior is arbitrary, capricious, a comment in the absence of any argument, but first Unum showing that it\u2019s changed its internal policies. Is this becoming an obsession to get this benefit ratio down and we are going to back to where we were pre the multi-state settlement?", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, le me \u2013 I will take that last one, but let\u2019s go back to your first one and just to DAC questions on \u2013", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "The DAC and the hybrids, just clarification.", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, the hybrids, exactly. So I will take all three of these and ultimately take the last one, but Bob anything you want to add to this or \u2013 to Colin\u2019s question about the Colonial DAC?", "Bob Greving", "Colin, there is an annual review of the DAC factors for unlocking in the Colonial book of business every year and this was just a normal review and adjustment as a result of that unlocking.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "How much of that (inaudible)?", "Bob Greving", "I believe it was less than $3 million.", "Tom Watjen", "I think it was $2 million.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Yes, it\u2019s about a $28 million adjustment so I just wanted to \u2013", "Tom White", "On the \u2013 Colin, this is Tom White \u2013 on the hybrid 64% are Tier 1 securities, and the balance of those are upper Tier 2 securities. And again the book value exposure is $496 million.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Of the U.K., how much is Tier 1? Those are really the ones that everybody is excited.", "Tom White", "I\u2019ll tell you, give me just a minute and I\u2019ll get back \u2013", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. I\u2019ll come back on that. Let\u2019s talk about the claims procedures in the U.S.", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, and I think let me start, Colin, by saying, as you know, we went through a challenging period of time, to say the least. And to say we learnt something from that experience is a dramatic understatement. I think we learnt a lot about things we need to do differently. We made those changes that we do, not just once that we did for the purposes of satisfying the regulators, but these were just important changes in business that carry on way beyond just the regulatory process we went. And as you know, some of us stayed very close to watching including the Board, how we are doing in terms of being sure that those cultural and process changes that we made were again ones that lived way, way, way beyond the regulatory process we went through. And so I\u2019d look at things like the quality measures, the performance, I mean credibly encourages when I look at the activity in terms of complaint rates or appeals that we are seeing in our business right now. They are actually at very, very low levels, which gives me great comfort that the process changes we made and the mentality shift that we had truly is sustainable and is continuing the business.", "Now, we still do have some claim litigations. When you look back to time, I will say though that when you look at the inventory of claim litigations today, it\u2019s significantly below where it was even a few years ago. When I significantly, in some cases it\u2019s a third or a quarter of what it was just as recently as a few years ago. So, that deals with the issues of the past where again to the extent there is litigation outstanding, we\u2019ve been systematic about the process of kind of putting those pieces of litigation behind us in a very effective way. Now, occasionally things come up like the things you are referring to, and again that\u2019s important we can an eye on that. Because, again, we don\u2019t want to see anything pop up like that which hinders our reputation. We worked so hard to restore that reputation, and again that\u2019s why I think all of our people are very intent on being sure we take the actions to be sure that we don\u2019t let those issues of the past strip [ph] back in the business. And I feel very good about that.", "I guess the last point I make on that too is there is probably about 40 odd appeals that we have right now outstanding. The vast majority of the appeals are even ones that actually are being brought by the other (inaudible) so to speak because \u2013 there is still activity here but we feel very good about that level of claim activity going on. I don\u2019t know \u2013", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Tom, are you saying turn her up, are you then saying the courts\u2019 mistaken? Because they are saying nothing\u2019s changed. I mean you had five years to fix it \u2013", "Tom Watjen", "No, Colin, the \u2013", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "This isn\u2019t small minor courts.", "Tom Watjen", "(inaudible) decisions that were made going back to \u2013", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "This is December 24th of last year.", "Tom Watjen", "Colin, these are claims that go back to 1995 and so the court is referencing claims activity that pre-date all of the changes that we made in our claims management process. These are claims that have gone through the court system. They are still out there and we\u2019ve had a couple here that have been negative. But again, what the court is referring to are claims practices that go back to before 2000 and certainly before the changes that we made in our \u2013", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Oh! perhaps then I miss-read it, because that\u2019s not the way it reads to me, gentlemen.", "Tom Watjen", "Well, that\u2019s the fact.", "Bob Greving", "Yes, that\u2019s the facts.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Well, that\u2019s not the way it reads, but thank you.", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, now and again, we truly do recognize that we had to make some cultural and permanent shifts in our business, and again I can assure those have been made and we keep a very close eye on being sure that we don\u2019t have any drifting back to practices that we really fundamentally shifted on and I can assure that\u2019s not the case. And every measure I look at gives me great confidence that the quality of things being done today are of the highest quality and it sounds that really we still have to deal with some resident \u2013 issues of the past. Again, that inventory of issues of the past, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, is down dramatically. But I think that\u2019s \u2013", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thank you. I appreciate the response.", "Bob Greving", "I think I just reiterate that 80% of the cases under appeal right now are ones that the claimant is appealing, where the court has ruled in our favor. There you don\u2019t get publicity on those. You don\u2019t get blogs on those. Those are decisions that are \u2013", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "These aren\u2019t blogs. These are from reference court decisions some place.", "Tom Watjen", "Okay. And let me go back to your question about the hybrids. The three that I referred, Northern Rock is $19 million, all of that is upper Tier 2. Anglo Irish Bank is $14 million, all of that is upper Tier 2, and then Royal Bank of Scotland, the exposure is $96 million and that\u2019s pretty much evenly split between Tier 1 and upper Tier 2.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Perfect.

What\u2019s sort of the pricing trends were in the fourth quarter and then any change in your pricing strategy to help drive sales growth?", "Tom Watjen", "Maybe I will ask Kevin, I think, Mark, to speak to those two points.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Good morning.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Our renewal program that we initiated in the middle part of 2008 and that continues into our 2009 renewal program is a smaller renewal program than we had in previous years reflecting the improvements that we\u2019ve already made to the block of business both in terms of mix of business and in terms of pricing. The average rate increase for 2008, as you know, is in the 5% to 6% range. The average price increase in renewals for 2009 is in the 2% to 3% although we are prepared to increase that level of pricing and that volume of renewal activity if the economy \u2013 the deterioration in the economy rolls over and starts to affect our claim incidence, which to-date it has not. But we have not made any changes in pricing policy either with respect to (inaudible) renewal program or with respect to new business pricing.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Does that 2% to 3% make you a little bit more price competitive?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Well \u2013 it probably doesn\u2019t move our price up at the same rate that it did in the past, and to the extent the competitors have gone through renewal programs, I can't really tell whether that sort of gives us more competitive, less competitive or sort of on average consistent with the marketplace. I think every company to the extent that they are paying attention to both the economy and to the aging of the business ought to be sort of that in that 2% to 3% range, but I can't tell you whether they are not. I think in general, over the past several years, we\u2019ve moved our rates up in a slightly steeper slope than the rest of the industry, although that gap sort of has stayed fairly stable in the last 12 to 24 months.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Thank you.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Okay, thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "Next we move to Randy Binner at FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hi thanks. I just wanted to review the change in guidance, it\u2019s about $0.20 down and the way I am reading this about $0.08 from the higher pension costs. But I am still unclear if the remainder all have to do with British pound translation or you are also transposing some broader economic weakness into that change?", "Tom Watjen", "(inaudible) I want you to get the three components \u2013", "Bob Greving", "Yes, I mean the three components are basically the pension cost of $42.5 million. The second, with the U.K. we are projecting \u2013 we haven\u2019t changed our operating projection for Unum UK earnings in pounds, we still expect that to be basically flat in 2009 here with 2008. We had earlier used an assumption of $1.65 on the exchange rate. Now, we are assuming about $1.50 on the exchange rate. So, there are still a couple of cents a share of guidance that is economic related. It would be primarily within group disability. I think we are essentially assuming about 8% unemployment rate here in the U.S. as opposed to 7.5%, which we were using before. And I think the last December report was like 7.2% unemployment rate. So the unemployment picture kind of deteriorated a little faster than we had projected, so there is a couple of cents per share that is economically driven.", "Tom Watjen", "And Randy, we also widened out the range we had been using \u2013 a nickel range \u2013 and we went to $0.10, basically because of the uncertainty over the economy and also the uncertainty over the value of the British pound.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. And so I guess if for those of us who think unemployment may go higher, is there any way to think about what sensitivity the benefit ratio of guidance will have if we are talking about 9% or 10% unemployment?", "Bob Greving", "It\u2019s tough to say. I will \u2013 maybe Kevin you want to address that?", "Kevin McCarthy", "A couple of points there. As the unemployment goes up, although we monitor it quarterly, we also pay attention to the unemployment rate as applied to the mix of business that we actually manage, both in terms of industry and sizing. Unemployment rate in those industries is lower than that rate. In addition to that while incidence, driven by an unemployment rate correlation may move up, simultaneously we are maintaining stability and consistency in our benefit operations particularly with respect to claims management and recoveries. And we continue to move the mix of business from large to small and that sort of drives the overall average weighted incidence rate down. So I think the \u2013 while we are cognizant of it, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d expect a really significant effect.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. So even if \u2013 so if we went from 8% to 10%, it would still wash out for those reasons. We wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect a big step down with earnings\u2013-", "Kevin McCarthy", "I think \u2013 yes, I mean I think it\u2019s awful hard to predict sort of the exact incidence correlation related to gross unemployment rates, but obviously if unemployment rates change by a factor of 25% or 40% or something like that, I mean obviously it has a potential to affect into a greater degree but we are not seeing it at the moment.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. And just real quick, as long as Kevin \u2013 as long as I have you \u2013 could you give a little more color, I think a previous analyst asked about just kind of where the business is coming from. But may be a more kind of qualitatively what \u2013 where are you winning the small case business and getting better sales there. If you can give color around where you are winning in the market there, that would be great.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes I think we are \u2013 we continue to execute on a strategy as you know that we try to sell multiple lines of business and cross sell as much as we can. We are simply Unum strategy (inaudible) although we don\u2019t any specific metrics yet on simply Unum because it\u2019s too early. We are making better than expected progress there, which means we are getting stronger mix of business in terms of package sales. 65% of our disability business was in our target markets, which tend to be the low incidence markets and the smaller case marketplace. So more on the sort of white color professional services side of the business, healthcare, as opposed to manufacturing and retail, those kind of things. But I think we are \u2013 I think our service story, the consistency of our pricing and discipline and the consistency of our marketplace execution of that couple of years I think is just \u2013 is a level of momentum that we had throughout the year and that\u2019s what\u2019s continuing and I think helping us to win in the market.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Thank you very much.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Thank you, Randy.", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll move to Bob Glasspiegel at Langen McAlenney.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Bob.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Just a follow-up to Jeff\u2019s pension question. You said $42 million extra from prior guidance. What\u2019s the overall pension cost in \u201909 and if the market stays down 7.2% is that sort of a moving target, if you don\u2019t earn your 7..5% in \u201909?", "Bob Greving", "Bob, this is Bob Greving. The overall cost for the plan is $73 million for 2009. And I haven\u2019t gone through the math, but \u2013 of the sensitivity of actual performance, but what we\u2019ve assumed for 2010 is that we actually earn our 7.5%. We \u2013 you actually see that \u2013 that $73 million actually drop off about $10 million between \u201909 and \u201910 if we actually achieve our 7.5% return. Obviously, we are hoping for a little bit of a bounce back in the market, but you never know what\u2019s going to happen.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. What\u2019s \u2013 you contributed some money to sort of close the balance. I know achieving your capital plan is probably your primary objective versus closing the pension liability, but is there an economic argument to maybe being a little bit more aggressive in closing the \u2013 and leaving a little less capital at the holding company?", "Bob Greving", "Well, we always take a look at contributions into the plan. For example, this year we made $130 million of contributions into our pension plans. So we are committed to moving it. as you know, the Pension Protection Act also has some pressure on companies to fully fund those plans over the next three years. So, we are looking at it. We do have about $70 million in our plan right now for contributions to the pension plan in the current year and that\u2019s all built into our current capital projections that we\u2019ve given to you.", "Tom Watjen", "And Bob, actually you are getting to it. Bob, it\u2019s an economic decision actually and so I think we have the certainly the excess capital to use but I think at this point still the way we sort of laid out the plan is the right sort of balance between capital and cost.", "Bob Greving", "Well, I think the other think, Tom, is we want to see how big \u2013 the years start emerging before we make contribution commitments. As you know, Bob, you basically get credit on contributions of a plan that goes back to kind of beginning of the year. So we do want to kind of wait and see how the year actually emerges before we make those kind of commitments.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "I mean at this point a dollar of capital is worth than $0.07 of earnings, I suspect, but \u2013", "Bob Greving", "That\u2019s right.", "Tom Watjen", "That\u2019s not the way we are looking at it.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "But at some point there is a tradeoff and the economics become more compelling. Just one last question. The tax rate, if any, in the quarter was what? It looks like it came down a couple of percent from run rate?", "Bob Greving", "Yes, I think that the tax rate was 32.5%. We\u2019ve been kind of in the 33.5% to close to 34% range for the prior three quarters. And it\u2019s just kind of normal year end tax adjustments that were made that helped them. I think for your modeling purposes, somewhere in the 33.5%-34% range is what we should see.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "You know me too well, you also know my next question. Thank you.", "Bob Greving", "Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Tom Gallagher at Credit Suisse.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Tom", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning. A few questions, first, just one on the reserves. The \u2013 you had a 5% reduction in IBNR this quarter and if I think about sort of the parallel to that I would think about risk in force just being measures as premiums, were down about 2% sequentially versus 3Q. Just based on your comments earlier that you are expecting I guess the overall claims environment to get a bit worse from an incidence standpoint, why would you be releasing IBNR, not building it right now. That\u2019s my first one.", "Tom Watjen", "I think, you used the term releasing IBNR is not accurate. I mean IBNR changed from the third to fourth quarter. And it\u2019s for LTD. It\u2019s reflective of the fact that the volume of business is slightly lower. It reflects the fact, we commented that we did make an upward adjustment in the discount rate assumption, and so that \u2013 the way that gets accounted for is there is about $3 million of IBNR release due to that. There are some changes that we\u2019ve made in our claims management processing as we move STD claims to an LTD basis and they are actually reported a little sooner and that has the impact probably $3 million or $4 million of movement in IBNR. But what happens on the other side is that $3 million or $4 million is added to other parts of the reserve. So, it\u2019s not a reserve release into earnings. So \u2013 there are a lot of moving parts as we\u2019ve described in the past, but to describe it as a reserve release I think is inaccurate.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Well, Tom, if I just look at the disclosure on Page 12, you went from essentially $1.9 billion of IBNR to little over $1.8 billion this quarter. and so there is $80 million some odd of a reduction. And I understand \u2013", "Tom Watjen", "Well, what time period you are looking at, Tom?", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just sequentially looking at \u2013", "Tom Watjen", "Okay. Keep in mind, we made a change in the \u2013 and there is a footnote in the statistical supplement, I will get Bob Greving to describe it, but a lot of that is in the closed disability block where there is a change in the reserve valuation system and it actually \u2013 why don\u2019t I get Bob to talk about what we did there.", "Bob Greving", "Yes, we actually implemented a new system that basically redistributed the reserves on that line of business, IBNR policy reserves and claim reserves. And that implementation did actually move a lot of the numbers around. It didn\u2019t move the overall net reserve for the block as a whole. It\u2019s rolling off. So it did have an effect on that. On a restated basis, Tom, may be to help you out, the impact of that the IBNR on the old basis, on a reported basis was $387.2 million in the third quarter. On a restated basis, it would have been $353.2 million in the third quarter and that dropped to $350.3 million in the fourth quarter, so there is only about $3 million movement on an apples-to-apples comparison for that line of business. But there is a lot going on behind the scenes, I guess, if you want to think about it as far as implementing that force system what we call the force system.", "Tom Watjen", "(inaudible) speak to because we just obviously completed our year end reserve studies and all the cash flow testing studies, but \u2013 and there is a high level comfort in all work that\u2019s been done at year end.", "Bob Greving", "Yes, it\u2019s a good point. We actually \u2013 actually we look at everything on a quarterly basis, but on an annual basis we actually execute a much tighter and more thorough review of all of the reserve basis and we do that internally as well as with our Board and our external auditors and so that has been completed and actually we are in a stronger position reserve wise this year than where we were last year and our assumptions that were used in that analysis are a bit more conservative even than what they were last year. So we are feeling pretty good with where we are on a reserve adequacy.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And just as I think about the IBNR, not to obsess on that one item, because I realize there is a lot of moving pieces here, should we expect that to build over time? If in fact claims insurance is expected to even pick up moderately, should I expect to see that grow relative to earned premium?", "Bob Greving", "Tom, you will see two moving parts, obviously of incidence increases, you will seen an increase in the applied factors that will increase the IBNR. That will be offset by any decrease in the actual in force itself. So if there is as run off of the premium, for example, the old closed block of IDI is running off at about 5% per year, you will see that kind of run off if that business runs off. If there is a growing block of business, you will see the IBNR increase. We have not changed our practice in applying IBNR factors, whatsoever. And at least in the last two years, we have not changed our practice, whatsoever. So what you are seeing is actually the movement in the book of business.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just one last follow-up. Tom White, you had mentioned the new discount rate went up, but the benefit for the quarter is less than 60 basis points. Can you give some quantification ex the increase in the discount rate, what the benefit ratio improvement would have been\u2013?", "Tom White", "Tom, we don\u2019t like to quantify it just because it starts to speak to too much around pricing assumptions, and so we tend not to do that. I will say that the \u2013 if we had not done the discount rate adjustment, the benefit ratio would still have improved from the third to the fourth quarter.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Is guidance that we should still see an improving trend in the benefit ratio still in place or maybe you can just comment prospectively what you\u2019re looking at?", "Tom White", "I think our guidance would assume a pretty flat benefit ratio throughout 2009.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks a lot.", "Tom White", "Yes. Thanks, Tom.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Eric Berg of Barclays Capital.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Eric.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you very much. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning to everyone. Two questions. First, with respect to the U.K., it\u2019s obvious why a reduction in premium in and of itself would send the benefit ratio higher as you referenced. Hello?", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, we\u2019re hearing, Eric.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much. I\u2019m on a cell and I thought we had cut out.", "Tom Watjen", "No, no.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Yes. If I do, obviously you\u2019d just go on to the next question, but (inaudible) here. My question with respect to this U.K. benefit ratio is this. I\u2019ve been thinking the way it works is if you lose some business and therefore show lower premium, you\u2019d also show lower benefit as well. But I would think that a loss of business would lead to no change in the current ratio because both the numerator and denominator would be going down. How does the math of that benefit ratio work when you have lower than expected premiums?", "Tom Watjen", "Bob, I think you can address that because it\u2019s not just the way it works in the U.K. It\u2019s kind of universal. Group business I\u2019d say.", "Bob Greving", "Eric, as you know, there is a fairly long waiting period on these claims, particularly in our group income protection business. And so an immediate change, which you have to reflect in earned premium in the period, is not necessarily immediately transferable into the \u2013 a change in the claim incidence that actually is being reported because those claims are claims that actually have occurred in prior periods as they kind of work their way through the system. So there is a delayed effect. And so in the period that we actually are reporting a decrease in premium, you won\u2019t see an immediate decrease in the claim number, but there will be a lagged effect.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "That answers it. My second of three questions relates to OTTI, what is the effect, if any, of rating agency downgrades on your determination of OTTI? In other words, my question is, a rating agency\u2019s upgrade/downgrade is its opinion, not Unum\u2019s opinion of securities. So one would think in the first instance that what the rating agencies are doing shouldn\u2019t affect your determination of OTTI. But I wanted to ask the question\u2013", "Tom Watjen", "Sure. And a good question. And I guess you got to need to think about at what level of rating \u2013 a rating downgrade is occurring. It\u2019s something smoothing from a BBB to a BB. That\u2019s still in the upper end of below-investment grade. It\u2019s still current and it would be unusual for us to impair something at that level. Now at something down in the CCC, CC, D land, if those are being downgraded, those are the securities we\u2019re going to take a much closer look at. And we\u2019re going to make a determination whether or not we think the interest payments are going to be made and whether or not the value of that security can recover over our holding period time. So I think you really have to kind of think in those terms. And we did not \u2013 we did impair the four securities that I mentioned. Those were Idearc and McClatchy and Lyondell and Ford. And again those were just determinations that we made, that we didn\u2019t think that those bonds would return in value over the holding period that we expect to have in those.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Last question maybe to Kevin is a general one about the dynamics of the business. My understanding is that the way the business works is that, as the economy sinks into joblessness, as unemployment rises, all annuity companies get reported to them an increasing number of, let\u2019s call it, subjective claims. I don\u2019t know whether they are feigned claims or legitimate or not, but you tend to get an increase if I understand things, in more subjective claims. And my question is, while I understand that you are expecting some increase in incidence from here, you\u2019re not expecting as much incidence as would have been the case if you had not changed the way you do business. So my question to Kevin is, what are you doing differently in the current recession that will sort of blunt the impact that will allow you to end up with a lower rate of increase in incidence given these subjective claims than would have been the case if you hadn\u2019t changed the way you do business?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Thanks, Eric. Good morning. I\u2019m not sure I can exactly relate one to the other. I think one would anticipate in a tight economy an uptick in submitted incidence, one might expect that would be on sort of the softer decisions as to whether person consider themselves to be disabled or not. They are probably making that decision in the light of their own employment environment, whether they are trying to hold on to their job or whether they think they might be going to lose their job. And all of those subjective factors turns out they submit a claim. It\u2019s probably not possible for us in a general sense to know what any one person is thinking. In a marketing sense, though, we try to target markets at those industries that have lower overall expected incidence rates. We also, on an underwriting basis, to the extent that we\u2019re talking about mid-size companies or larger, we are certainly underwriting the economic environment for that particular industry and that particular company, because to the extent that we look at any underwriting risk and think that there is a potential for downsizing or bankruptcy, that wouldn\u2019t be a positive indicator from an underwriting perspective. And so you try to avoid sort of that effective subjective claims by avoiding the overall risk of unemployment, if you will.", "Tom Watjen", "And Kevin, it\u2019s probably worth reiterating, I think you said in your comments, but our experience has been the small and mid-size employer incidence level in softer economic conditions, it\u2019s nowhere near as volatile as the incidence rate amongst large employers. And as I think everyone in the call knows, we made a fairly substantial change in strategic direction three or four years ago. And so our book of business entering this period of time is very different today than it was, for example, back in 2001-2002.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Absolutely. And if you look at our fourth quarter sales \u2013 our 2008 sales, only 36% of our business was large case business, 64% was small and medium size full market business.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I guess just one quick \u2013 and this will be my final follow-up \u2013 in terms of adjudicating subjective claims, things that cannot be more \u2013 that cannot be easily diagnosed on a physician\u2019s X-ray, how are you doing it differently today than would have been the case in the last \u2013 or is it different?", "Kevin McCarthy", "I think it\u2019s somewhat different in the sense that we engage discussions in a positive way with the employer and with the claimant\u2019s physician earlier in the game. We actively use independent medical evaluations maybe to a greater degree and also earlier in the game. And we are very engaged in trying to work with the claimant and the claimant\u2019s physician to the extent that that\u2019s possible and the claimant\u2019s employer to try to find a way to accommodate and get that person back to work.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you all. Very helpful.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Thank you, Eric.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Finkelstein at FPK.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK", "Good morning.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK", "I actually want to go back to the U.K., if we could. I mean, obviously, incidence did pick up. I think you attributed a little bit to the economy. Premium levels are kind of continuing to decline. I guess what I\u2019m asking is what should we expect in terms of that disability benefit ratio and why should we be comfortable that kind of earnings on a sterling basis should be flattish with last year? I understand the expense saves, but if you could just kind of put that all in context, that would be helpful.", "Tom Watjen", "Yes. Susan, may I ask you to just sort of pick up on that question. I think maybe, Tom, if you could fill in a little bit as well, if you could. But Susan, why don\u2019t you get it started?", "Susan Ring", "Yes, sure. With regard to incidence, as I said, it started to pick up in the fourth quarter. We haven\u2019t actually seen that continue so far in the first quarter, but we do expect increased incidence come through waves of never as different industries subject to issues with regard to the current economy. Offsetting that, though, we do have very strong recovery performance, and those increased claims do tend to be (inaudible) duration. So as far as the benefit ratio is concerned going forward, I would say that the curve [ph] this is trending very similarly perhaps up a couple of percentage versus the whole of 2008. So we\u2019d expect it to be sort of a fairly consistent performance as far as benefit ratio is concerned going forward. With regards to the earnings, we are delivering strong margins still in the UK. So we\u2019d be \u2013 obviously we\u2019re expecting that to be sustained and with just a slight drop in the margin performance going forward. So with regard to 2008, we saw that come through at 6% overall. And from a good long-term disability perspective, it\u2019s (inaudible). So with regards to the (inaudible) with regard to the competitive environment, which is particularly hostile and aggressive, we don\u2019t see that changing going forward. So I would expect the margin to drop slightly and as a result, our earnings will be fairly flat for 2008. So I hope that answers your question, Mark.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK", "Sure. Okay. And then, Kevin, I guess you talked a lot about claim incidence, can you just talk about claim duration? I guess historically how is that trended with changes in unemployment? And I guess what are you thinking about in terms of expectations on the unemployment rate moving from 7.5% to 8.0% and I guess risks of an even higher unemployment rate?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Good morning, Mark. Well, as I\u2019ve commented earlier, I mean, to the extent that unemployment correlates with incidence and it\u2019s not a complete direct correlation, we watch the unemployment rate, we watch the way in which we underwrite, we pay attention to unemployment rate by industry, and also, as Tom mentioned, target sort of the smaller size of the marketplace (inaudible) that sort of a slower uptick in incidence and claims as a result of the economy. So we have a lot of things in place and try to watch where incidence is coming from. We watch our STD block in particular because so much of our STD block is marketed and packaged with LTD. And in fact, incidence and prevalence rates in STD are actually slightly down compared to the third quarter. So right now, as I said, we are not really seeing much in terms of recovery rates. I think to Susan\u2019s point, to the extent that you get an uptick in claims and they are driven by the sort of \u201cmore subjective\u201d type of claim. You would expect those durations to be shorter. Currently within our STD block, our average duration days are actually slightly down. So the durations of the claims are shorter. From a long-term disability standpoint, it\u2019s a little bit harder to say much about that. You made me see a slight uptick in recoveries in, what we call, the first duration right after the end of the elimination period. But after that, once somebody sort of makes it through that first duration, they feel legitimately disabled and you are managing them just like any other claim.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK", "Okay. And then I guess just a follow-up on Tom\u2019s question on IBNR. I guess I\u2019m just looking at the numbers, Bob, that you gave. I think you said $387.2 million down to $353.2 million, that $35 million, did that essentially get moved into other reserves out of IBNR, so there is really no net impact?", "Bob Greving", "Yes, basically it\u2019s in the other reserves, your policy reserves and your claim reserves. The overall impact of the implementation of force was very nominal as far as the total reserve for that block of business.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Tom White", "Good. Thank you, Mark. And I think at this point \u2013 I mean we\u2019ve gone a little long, but I think we probably need to close the call, but if anybody has questions that we didn\u2019t have a chance to get to, certainly funnel those through Tom White, but thank you all for taking the time for joining us for this quarterly.

This call may be recorded.", "At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tom White", "Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter 2009 analyst and investor call for Unum. As we get started, I want to remind you that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and are located in the sections titled \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. Our SEC filings can be found in the investor section of our website at www.unum.com.", "Please take note that the statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found on our website, also in the investor section.", "Yesterday afternoon, Unum Group reported earnings for the first quarter of 2009. Net income in the quarter was $164.9 million or $0.50 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $163.1 million or $0.46 per diluted common share last year.", "Included in the results for the first quarter of 2009 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $41.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, and $44.7 million, or $0.13 per diluted common share, in the first quarter 2008. These losses include the impact of the provisions of DIG B36 accounting, which requires changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract to be reported as realized investment gains and losses.", "This accounting requirement resulted in a first quarter '09 realized after-tax investment gain of $15.4 million compared to a $41.6 million after-tax loss in the year ago quarter.Net realized after-tax investment losses related to sales and write-downs of investments were $57.2 million in the first quarter of '09, compared to $3.1 million in the year ago quarter.", "So excluding these items, our after-tax operating income was $206.7 million for this quarter, or $0.62 per diluted common share, compared to $207.8 million, or $0.59 per diluted common share, in the year ago first quarter.", "On the call this morning are President and CEO, Tom Watjen, and Bob Greving, Executive Vice President, CFO and Chief Actuary, as well as the heads of our three major operating segments, Kevin McCarthy, Susan Ring, and Randy Horn.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Watjen.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning. With our first quarter results, we're obviously off to a fast start for 2009. I want to touch on certainly a few of the highlights I take away from the quarter, and I'll spend a few moments later going into more detail.", "First, excluding net realized after-tax investment losses, we reported $0.62 per share in operating income for the first quarter, 5% higher than the $0.59 we reported in the first quarter of 2008.", "In addition, each of our businesses continued to perform well with lower benefit ratios on a year-over-year basis for each of our specific businesses.", "Our overall level of profitability, however, was impacted somewhat by the challenging environment for net investment income, particularly miscellaneous net investment income, and the weakness of the British pound impacted the translation of our U.K. earnings.", "I would point out that if you look at the pre-tax operating earnings growth, as reported, that was up six-tenth of a percent. If you actually have a constant currency, in other words, apply the same currency evaluation that we had in the first quarter of 2008, operating income actually grew 8.5%.", "On an earnings per share basis, we reported a 5.1% growth in earnings per share year-over-year, but again on a constant currency basis, that would have been 13.6%. So can you see the magnitude of what the impact of translation changes have meant in terms of our reported results?", "Third, we continue to see solid momentum in our sales results. As we've discussed, our strategy is to focus on maintaining underwriting and pricing discipline and have a particular emphasis on core market and voluntary market growth. We again saw a positive momentum in these areas. Companywide case count grew 21%, which tells me our value proposition is a strong one.", "Fourth, while realized investment losses remain somewhat higher than our long-term trends, excluding DIG B36, our losses were in line with the experience of the two previous quarters. We expect to continue to experience somewhat higher realized investment losses until the economy in financial markets improve. However, we remain confident that our portfolio was well-positioned to weather this difficult credit cycle.", "The net unrealized loss position in our fixed maturity portfolio widened slightly in the first quarter from year end 2008 levels. Tom White will provide further detail on the performance of the investment portfolio in his remarks. I will say that the environment for new investments remained positive in the first quarter, which is reflected in the attractive yields on new money we experienced in the quarter.", "Finally, we continue to maintain the financial flexibility to support the business and to absorb any further investment losses which might occur. You will see that we comfortably exceeded our targets for capital and liquidity, leverage and risk-based capital, and are on track to meet our year end 2009 capital metrics guidance.", "Now, let me come back again and spend a few moments just talking about a few of these elements in a little more detail, starting with our Unum U.S. business.", "Pre-tax operating earnings per Unum U.S. increased 16% to $183.6 million in the first quarter, with strong earnings growth in the group disability and supplemental and voluntary lines of business offsetting lower earnings in the group life business.", "Group disability earnings were 44% higher driven by strong risk results. The group disability benefit ratio for the first quarter improved to 88%, a decline of 70 basis points from the fourth quarter and 300 basis points from the year ago first quarter.", "Seasonally adjusted submitted incidence trends and claim recovery results actually showed a slight improvement relative to the fourth quarter and were generally in line with our first quarter of 2008. Again, this quarter, we saw no risk pressure from the weak economy.", "We also had very strong results from the supplemental and voluntary line with earnings growth of 24%. Results in the group life and AD&D line were down 13%, driven primarily by lower premium income and slightly higher claims experience.", "Total Unum U.S. sales increased 3.5% in the quarter. We saw good growth, though, in several areas, including a 16% increase in core market sales and an 11.5% increase in voluntary benefit sales. As you know, these are two areas we've targeted for growth this year and believe there's good long-term potential there as well.", "These positive results were offset somewhat by reduced sales in the large case market, an area where we are maintaining our underwriting and pricing discipline. Our pipeline for large case sales is building, however, and we expect to show a strong second quarter large case sales growth.", "As we've said in the past, this is an opportunistic market and we want to continue to be very selective. We actually are seeing some very good opportunities in this environment. Kevin McCarthy is here, obviously, to answer any questions you may have on this segment or the outlook for this particular business.", "Now turning to Unum U.K., our pre-tax operating earnings were $62.3 million for the first quarter. While on dollar terms, these results were below year ago results, due to the decline of the value of the British pound. In local currency, the first quarter operating earnings actually increased by 1.6%.", "Our strong U.K. results were also driven by favorable risk results, specifically favorable claim incidents in the LTD line of business. We also saw some benefits from the expense initiatives we discussed on the fourth quarter call, and Susan Ring is available here this morning with us to address any questions you may have about the U.K. business or marketplace.", "Colonial Life actually saw pre-tax earnings increase 5% to $70.9 million for the first quarter, again also driven by favorable risk results. While total sales were generally flat with year ago results, we continue to see growth in our core market sales which increased 1.8% in the quarter with new account activity increasing actually 10.8%.", "We also saw solid growth in recruiting and in our new rep contracts. Both of these indicators should lead to further core market growth in the future. So, again, those are very good leading indicators. Randy Horn is on the call here this morning to address any questions you have around Colonial's results or the Colonial marketplace.", "Now shifting to investments. Our investment portfolio continues to perform well, with a manageable level of default and impairment experience. We are seeing good opportunities to invest money at attractive yields while intending our investment quality objectives. Although, we monitor changes in our portfolio of values closely, today's unrealized investment losses are not a significant concern to us, since our liabilities generally would not cause us to need to sell investments prior to maturity.", "Certainly, last but not least in this environment is our capital position, which again we continue to feel very good about and very comfortable with the position as well as the financial flexibility that's implied by the current capital ratios. Our first quarter 2009 estimate for risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies exceeds 330%, above our long-term target of 300% and in line with our year end 2009 target of 330% to 335%.", "Leverage, excluding the non-recourse debt and capital of Tailwind and Northwind Holdings, is 21.2% as of the end of the first quarter, below our long-term target of 25%. Holding company liquidity was $473 million, also comfortably above our $270 million target, which allows for coverage of one-year fixed charges plus the maintenance of the capital cushion for business and economic volatility. Again, we are on track to meet our year end 2009 target of holding company liquidity in excess of $0.75 billion.", "In summary, I feel good about our first quarter results and our position as we move ahead. Our core operating segments continue to meet our expectations with strong risk results across our major businesses, which reflect the disciplined strategies we put in place, a commitment to maintain pricing, and the strong underwriting and risk management disciplines that we built in our business.", "We are seeing strong sales momentum in our targeted markets. We have a strong value proposition for our customers and we can offer them a wide selection of benefit choices supported by a focused and engaged group of professionals.", "Our commitment to this business and stability as a provider is also working in our favor in this environment. We are growing our customer relationships indicated by the case count growth I mentioned earlier. We believe we're going to be in an excellent position when the economy eventually recovers.", "Our investment portfolio continues to perform well in a tough environment. We continue to maintain strong financial flexibility to protect us in these uncertain times, and importantly, to position us to continue to invest in the business and seize on opportunities created in this challenging environment.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom White, who will provide more detail on the first quarter results. Tom?", "Tom White", "Great. Thanks, Tom. First, I want to take a few minutes to supplement Tom's comments and provide some operating highlights on the quarter.", "Within Unum U.S., we'll start with group disability. As Tom indicated, the group disability line reported a strong quarter as we continued to see improvement in the benefit ratio, which declined to 88% in the first quarter compared to 88.7% for the fourth quarter, and 91% in the year ago first quarter. There are a number of factors that are driving this continued improvement and I will point to four.", "First is the ongoing shift in our block of business to more core market business and less large case business, as well as the shift to more stable industries such as healthcare and education and away from traditionally economic-sensitive industries, such as retail, construction and manufacturing. Second, we saw favorable claim recovery trends. Third, ongoing adherence to pricing discipline, particularly in the large case business. Fourth is a continued stable level of new claim incidence.", "New submitted claim incidence on a seasonally adjusted basis was slightly lower in the first quarter than the fourth quarter of 2008, and essentially in line with the first quarter of 2008. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter since the peak in U.S. employment levels that our new claim incidence has remained stable, which we think is a strong signal to us that the strategic changes we have made within this business are paying off in lower volatility and greater consistency.", "Additionally, the short-term disability line, which can often be a leading indicator of LTD claim incidents, continues to perform well with a low stable level of claim incidents in the first quarter.", "Lastly, the discount rate on new claim incurrals which was raised in the fourth quarter last year was maintained at that level here in the first quarter. Our interest reserve margin for this line of business continued to widen.", "Moving to the group life and AD&D line, operating income here decline to $48.3 million, compared to $55.4 million a year ago, primarily driven by lower premium income, which declined by 2% and a higher benefit ratio of 69.8% this year compared to 68.2% in the year ago first quarter, resulting from higher average paid claim size.", "The supplemental and voluntary line had a strong quarter with operating income of $77.6 million, which is 24% higher than last year. All three primary lines here, recently issued individual disability, voluntary benefits and long-term care, each produced year-over-year improvement in before-tax earnings.", "Reported sales for Unum U.S. increased by 3.5% in aggregate and there were several bright spots to highlight. Our core market sales for our group lines, which would be LTD, STD and group life and AD&D combined, but our core market sales showed continued strong momentum increasing 16.1% for the first quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of sales growth for these lines in the core end of the market.", "Sales in the large case market for these lines declined by 16% in the first quarter. However, as Tom suggested in his comments, we expect large case activity to accelerate in the second quarter.", "Finally, voluntary benefit sales increased by 11.5% in the first quarter as our activity in the core market segment remained strong with high levels of quotes and new coverage sales.", "So to summarize the results for Unum U.S. as a segment are continued favorable risk management results, some ongoing pressure on net investment income with considerably lower than normal levels of miscellaneous net investment income, but continued positive sales results, particularly in our targeted core and voluntary markets.", "Moving to Unum U.K., Tom mentioned a decline in the value of the British pound relative to the dollar, which moved from $1.98 in the first quarter of '08 to $1.44 here in the first quarter of '09, continues to negatively impact translated results for the Unum U.K. segment, but the underlying operating performance remains generally strong.", "While operating income in dollars declined 26% in local currency, operating income increased by just under 2% as a result of by favorable claim experience, particularly in the LTD line. The overall benefit ratio declined to 53.3% for the quarter compared to 57.3% a year ago.", "First quarter sales were quite strong, increasing 45% in local currency, largely driven by higher large case activity, but we did see case count growth of 12% within Unum U.K.", "Colonial Life: the operating results remained strong here as well with income of $70.9 million, a 5% increase over year ago results. Risk results remained favorable, particularly in the life and cancer and critical illness lines, which offset somewhat higher benefit ratio within the accident, sickness and disability line. In aggregate produced an improvement in the benefit ratio to 46.3% compared to 47.2% last year.", "Sales at Colonial Life declined by one-tenth of a percent in the first quarter, with increases in the core market and public sector segments being offset by a decline in the large case segment.", "We see evidence of the weak economy negatively impacting sales activity on our existing cases. However, we are pleased to see solid growth in new accounts, which were up 10.8%, as well as new rep contracts, which were up 24%. We believe these trends are positive signs for future sales activity once the economy and employment levels rebound.", "I'll also add that at Colonial Life, persistency was generally stable with year ago results and do include a couple of large case lapses that we experienced.", "The Individual Disability - Closed Block segment earnings were $11.3 million in the first quarter compared to $2.9 million a year ago. The interest adjusted loss ratio improved to 81.2% from 82.4% last year, due to lower average new claim size and fewer reopened claims. The other income line in this segment improved as well, due to favorable results on the assumed blocks of business.", "Finally, the Corporate and Other segment recorded an operating loss of $12.9 million. This compares to income of $300,000 in the year ago quarter. Expenses are higher in this segment, reflecting approximately $10 million of incremental quarterly pension costs, which will continue throughout 2009. Interest expense was reduced to $26 million in the first quarter, compared to $31.7 million in the year ago quarter.", "Finally, our weighted average share count, assuming dilution, for the first quarter was 331 million shares. This compares to 351.5 million shares in the first quarter of 2008 with the decline reflecting the share repurchase activity that was initiated and completed in 2008.", "Book value per share was $19.39 as of the end of the first quarter. This is an increase four-tenths of a percent, compared to December 31, 2008, and a decline of 12.1% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding net unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per share was $20.86, an increase of 2% compared to December 31, 2008, and a decline of nine-tenth of a percent, compared to a year ago.", "Earnings on a statutory accounting basis remained quite strong with first quarter 2009 net gain from operations after-tax of $207.8 million for our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Net income was a $142.8 million in the first quarter of '09, compared to $125.6 million in the year ago quarter.", "Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the capital and liquidity positions of the company as well as the investment portfolio.", "Tom outlined our capital management positions at quarter end. To briefly summarize, we favorably exceed our targets for risk-based capital and holding company liquidity, and remained below our leverage target. Additionally, we are on target to meet our year end 2009 objectives.", "At quarter end, we had short-term debt of $206.9 million. $98.7 million of that amount was reverse repurchase agreements which matured and were paid off with operating cash flows in early April.", "We also have $108.2 million of short-term debt that is due in May of 2009, I believe May 15th. This is our 5.859% senior notes due May of '09. Our plans are to retire that debt out of holding company cash. We have ample cash on hand to do so and feel it is a better alternative than refinancing in today's market.", "Moving to the investment portfolio. During the first quarter, the level of unrealized losses in our fixed maturity bond portfolio increased slightly. The net unrealized loss position was $2.48 billion at March 31, 2009, compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2008.", "This change was in part due to a regulatory reporting change that was dictated by the NAIC, which reclassified certain hybrid securities for us totaled $279 million book value and had an unrealized loss of $164 million, but reclassified these from being fixed maturity redeemable preferred stocks to fixed maturity bonds.", "Since they are now considered fixed maturity bonds in our statistical supplement, we include them on page 13.1, which details our holdings. Therefore, $164 million of the $382 million total change in the net unrealized loss position, when you look from fourth quarter of '08 to first quarter of '09, was basically due to this reclassification.", "The change in unrealized losses not related to the reclassification was largely driven by the increase in treasury rates in the quarter, which offset a slight tightening of credit spreads. While credit spreads tightened in the first quarter, current spreads in the market continue to present great opportunities for very attractive yields on our new money purchases.", "Our new money yield in the first quarter was 7.46% on a hedge-adjusted basis on slightly over $1 billion of new money invested. This compares to fourth quarter at 8.47% and 6.77% in the third quarter. The average credit rating on these first quarter purchases was an A1, which is higher than our overall portfolio rating.", "Next updating you on commercial mortgage loans. Our exposure was $1.31 billion at quarter end, which is 3.5% of total invested assets. We had one new delinquency in the first quarter, bringing the number of delinquent mortgages to two, and this totals $26 million.", "We have another three loans, which totaled $9 million on our watch list, which is a list of investments that are presently current but are subject to enhanced monitoring and more intensive review. We believe our overall commercial mortgage loan portfolio is of high quality with a loan-to-value ratio of approximately 67%.", "Moving to an update on our hybrid holdings. At the end of the first quarter, we had holdings of approximately $487 million. That's on a book value basis and they had a fair value of $205 million. There were no impairments taken or defaults in the first quarter. All of these holdings remain current on their interest payments.", "There were some downgrades that increased the level of below investment grade hybrids. That number is now $159 million on a book value basis compared to $129 million at year end and the fair value of those holdings is $56 million.", "I'll close my remarks with a brief summary of realized investment losses for the first quarter.", "Our reported net realized investment losses, excluding the gain of $15.4 million, or $23.6 million before tax from DIG B36, totaled $57.2 million after-tax, or $88.2 million on a before tax basis. So on a before tax basis, the realized investment losses from write-downs totaled $76.6 million, while the net realized investment losses from sales totaled $11.6 million.", "The primary sources of the write-downs were Witco at $20.1 million, American Axle and Manufacturing at $19.5 million, and Clear Channel at $33.3 million. The primary source of the realized investment loss from sales was our holdings of R.H. Donnelly with losses of $14.2 million.", "Certainly, we'll be pleased to address any specific questions you have regarding our investment holdings in the Q&A. So with that, I will turn the call back to Tom.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Tom. Before I make a closing comment and we entertain your questions, I thought we'd anticipate one of the questions and I will make a few statements about that. That has to do with the impact the recession is having on our business.", "First and most importantly, the economy is not impacting our risk results as evidenced by our improved benefit results this quarter. I think for much of the attention, certainly, around the recession and the focus of what that may mean for our business, as you know, has been around our Unum U.S. group disability business.", "While this line is certainly important to our overall operations, it represents only approximately 18% of our current pre-tax operating earnings, and compared to a contribution of over 30% in prior years, and so, again, is a less significant part of the overall picture of the company.", "I'd also add that when you look at the Unum U.S. group disability business, there's a number of things that have actually changed there. The mix of business we've talked to you about in the past is very important, where the mix has shifted in terms of case size. The mix has shifted in terms of industry focus. So for even that part of the business that we have, which again is very, very important to us, you'll see the risk characteristics of that part of the business again are very, very different.", "The other thing I'd leave you with is the place where you'd expect to see some higher level of claims in a weaker economic environment is probably in the more subjective claims, such as muscular-skeletal and mental disorders. These types of claims only represent around 25% of our overall claims. So, again, it's not the entire disability business, in effect, that potentially is vulnerable to soft economic conditions. It's a much smaller part of the claim activity that would be vulnerable to that.", "I guess because of this I think we feel pretty good that we're well-positioned, because these risks are much smaller at the company today and much more manageable. Again, I want to come back to what I started with, which is, the economy is not impacting our risk results. In fact, again, you saw that through the improved benefit results that we actually had for the quarter.", "We are, though, in this environment, seeing some pressure on our topline. In all of our businesses, we are seeing slight pressure on new sales to existing customers, an indication that current customers are slower to add new lines of coverage reflecting the pressures they are feeling on their budgets. This is true both with employers in the U.S. and the U.K.", "As I mentioned earlier, though, case count growth has been strong, indicating to us a continued strong connection with our markets, and again, validation for our value proposition in the marketplace.", "We're also seeing some slight pressure on what I would call natural growth of our in-force block. That is, the lower levels of employment and reduced rate of salary growth have a dampening impact on the growth of existing business. Certainly, that's something we've got to keep an eye on. While these factors have a slight impact on topline growth, we do not expect them to impact our profit margin. We have embedded this into our guidance for the year.", "In short, we're certainly not immune to the effects of the recession, but believe that we are very well-positioned to effectively manage through that.", "Now, again, as you can see, the quarter certainly continued some themes that we started several years ago and we want to continue to focus on disciplined risk management; continue to focus on profitability and margin expansion over topline growth. As you can imagine, as an organization, the focus is very much on continued, consistent execution. So that's certainly priority number one.", "At the same time, we want to continue to invest in our businesses, despite the weakness in the overall economy. We are making investments across the entire enterprise. These investments range from expansion of our Simply Unum platform and build out of our voluntary benefits enrollment capabilities in Unum U.S., to Colonial Life's development of our new enrollment system and expansion of their sales force to include work in the Unum U.K. operation, to revamp our group life product offering and develop new products to expand the market for group risk in that particular market.", "We have the resources to support our business during these challenging times and to make these kinds of investments in new products and services, which we know will enhance further our competitive position in the marketplace. While we are not immune to external forces, we are much better positioned today than at any time in our past, and certainly believe that we are positioned to take advantage of the opportunities which may emerge in today's very difficult and challenging environment.", "Finally, I will conclude with my prepared comments by reaffirming our previous 2009 operating earnings per share guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 per share, as well as our capital management targets as well.", "At this time, Leo, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operating Instructions) We'll take our first question from the site of Darin Arita, Deutsche Bank.", "Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank", "Can you talk about, with the U.S. disability, the difference in claims incidence and recovery rates that you are seeing between the core market and the large case market?", "Kevin McCarthy", "In general, we typically see lower levels of incidence rates in disability in the core market versus the larger case market. We do see some better recovery rates in the small case marketplace primarily, I think, driven by industry mix. Whereas in the large case market, you've got industries like manufacturing, wholesale, retail, transportation, utilities, those kind of companies. Whereas in the small, medium-sized marketplace, it's more professional services, financial services, education and healthcare.", "So, in general, as we move our mix shift from large case to core market, that's a positive effect of that in the loss ratio.", "Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank", "Has the difference, though, in experience changed at all in the past few quarters?", "Kevin McCarthy", "I think we continue to get improvement in our claim recovery performance across all size segments. This particular quarter, we had an improvement in particular in shorter duration recoveries as well. Also, we had lower average-size new claims in terms of indemnity levels. We had lower paid incidence and we had higher average-sized recoveries. So, all of those contributed to the improvement in our loss ratio in the quarter.", "Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank", "Just turning to capital. Looking at it building up, you've got a lot more holding company liquidity, the RBC ratios there, in excess of 330%. In your discussion with the rating agencies, what do you think it takes to get your ratings to move higher from here?", "Tom Watjen", "Let me start, but ask maybe Tom White to supplement that. I would start by the fact, this is certainly the environment for us to continue to build capital. I think I will always feel very good, obviously, about the capital business we have right now, and the economic, and financial environment we have right now. Sort of warehousing capital is very important. So I think you're going to continue to see us continue to do so and, hopefully, continue to generate the solid operating performance we have right now.", "Tom, I think, hopefully, over the long-term, that continues to enhance the rating picture for the company, but maybe you want to add to that.", "Tom White", "Yes, Darin. I guess from our perspective, we feel like we've delivered, certainly, our plans and everything. We laid out with the rating agencies, both from a capital perspective in terms of risk-based capital and holding company liquidity leverage, our use of excess capital, but also on an operating earnings side of things. I think one of the challenges that we've kind of had with ratings agencies has not so much been on showing capital numbers, but showing consistency in results.", "As we've said in our prepared comments, we are five or size quarters into a recession. We have had about a 300 basis point improvement in our group disability benefit ratio in what has been a very difficult environment. So, we think that speaks to the changes that we've made, the better operating performance.", "Ultimately, we feel like that will turn into better ratings for us. As Tom said, it's a very difficult market and a tough ask in this kind of market, but we think the results speak for themselves and will ultimately result in better ratings for the company.", "Tom Watjen", "I would add to it. In the meantime, we continue to perform well in the business. The ratings we have today are certainly allowing us to write new business, continue to be very effective in growing our franchise and so, whereas we'd like to see a ratings improvement. It's not exactly something that is holding us back from doing some of the things that we like to do, Darin.", "Operator", "", "We'll move next to the site of Randy Binner of FBR Capital.", "Randy Binner - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "For Tom White, I guess I'm not clear on the comment about how the unrealized loss position benefited from the NAIC classification of hybrids to bonds instead of preferreds. Maybe I heard that wrong, but did you imply that that $164 million helped how unrealized or something?", "Tom White", "No, it actually went against us. It's all geography. On that page 13.1 in our statistical supplement, that I know a lot of you focus on, in the past, anything that was considered to be a fixed maturity redeemable preferred stock was not included.", "The NAIC during the quarter basically reclassified those, and those particular specific securities, as fixed maturity bonds. So all it does in our reporting is that we include those bonds on that page.", "So what I am just pointing out that as you do your fourth quarter to first quarter comparisons, keep in mind, that we have included an additional $279 million of these hybrids. They are trading at a loss right now. So of the change from fourth quarter to first quarter, $164 million of that change is the addition of these bonds on that particular page in our disclosure.", "Randy Binner - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "I believe the overall mark on the hybrids is in the neighborhood of $0.44. Do you have a breakout of where the Tier 1s and the Tier 2s are marked?", "Tom White", "I don't have that right now. Our mix really didn't change. The portfolio didn't change. I think we had one small maturity. I think we said, what, $486 million here in the first quarter. So the mix between the Tier 1 and Tier 2 didn't change.", "Randy Binner - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "So we will just back into the 44.", "Tom White", "Yes.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the site of Colin Devine of Citigroup.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "I've got something for everybody, I think. Why don't we start with Randy? If you could talk a little bit about why your lapses remain quite strong when Aflac's basically imploded this quarter and yet you are in the same sector? What are you seeing? Also, Aflac had very strong agent recruiting, and I'm wondering if you could comment on that?", "For Kevin, it's nice to see this benefit ratio keep coming down. I assume at some point that starts to stop, but also the operating expense ratio continues to trend up. Does that reflect more the mix shift towards the small case or do you have an expense problem?", "For Susan, you promised to get the expense ratio down. You did it. Is this level sustainable? I guess, also, is this benefit ratio sustainable?", "Then Tom, so you don't feel left out here. Is there any update on the CFO search or have you been fortunate in talking Bob into not retiring?", "Tom Watjen", "You're right, Colin, you did hit us all. We appreciate that actually. None of us feel slighted here. Let's go back, let's do it in your order. Randy, do you want to pick up on Colin's points on persistency in recruiting?", "Randy Horn", "Yes, we're just not seeing any kind of significant decrease in our persistency ratios. That's very broad-based all over the country and within most of our industry classifications. So I think it really speaks to the fact that even though the recession is having an impact, and certainly there is very strong concern on everyone's minds about job outlook and that type of thing, that people value the benefits that they do have.", "As I think you know, we emphasize benefit counseling very heavily. Our folks are out there talking to people about their in force benefits. I guess my read on it, is that, people are going to drop a lot of other things before they drop their insurance coverage. I, of course, cannot speak to Aflac's situation and what they experience, but again, we're seeing very steady results all over the country.", "In terms of our agent recruiting, that is really a silver lining of this economic environment. We're seeing continuation of very strong new agent recruiting. It was up about 24% in the first quarter. We're seeing very strong levels of production coming from our new agents. So we're very encouraged about that in terms of future outlook.", "Kevin McCarthy", "I think you're right on the money in terms of what you are anticipating here. Case size mix is definitely a driver here, both in terms of an improved loss ratio performance, but also, it does have a different effect in terms of acquisition costs. As you know, our core sales this quarter were up 16%, so there's higher acquisition costs, both as a percentage of premium and in volume.", "Our case sales were up 28% in the quarter. So you've got policy issuance costs as well going up. So we don't have an expense ratio problem as much as we are, I think, spending money in the right place in terms of our business acquisition and our claims management. That's showing up in our benefit ratios.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "So we should see this, perhaps, continue a little bit? The expense ratio is just going to continue to rise slowly?", "Kevin McCarthy", "I think a little bit. I think it will eventually level off as we sort of reach a stable mix. For a while, I think you will continue to see some anticipated improvement, perhaps in the loss ration and a slight uptick in the expense ratio.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "All your major redesign is done now?", "Kevin McCarthy", "You're correct.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "It came out of, again, the claims reassessment and all that?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes, all of our claims management redesign is completed. As you know, our renewal program is also stabilized as well.", "Susan Ring", "First of all, the expense ratio. We have been maintaining strong disciplined expense control of management, particularly with regard to operational expenses, which are well-controlled and managed to within budget.", "Obviously, the expense initiative that we undertook at the end of last year has really helped. The performance incentive has been sustained from that. The part which won't be sustained, which will mean that there is a slight increase in our expense ratio going forward, is that some of the expenditure, particularly in relation to development, has been delayed or deferred.", "So what we will see is a slightly different shape in terms of those costs coming through during the year. So that piece I don't think will be sustained, but we do expect the strong management on operating expenses to be. So there will be a slight shift in that. Perhaps\u2026", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "So on the benefit ratio, was there anything extra this quarter?", "Susan Ring", "Yes. On the benefit ratio, again, we have seen very good risk management results. We haven't seen any negative impact from the recession. We've delivered good strong recoveries during the quarter, and what we have also seen is that incidents has been down and as potential claimants have really stayed at work. That, we do think, has been partially a recessionary impact from a positive point of view.", "What we don't think is that that will be sustained on an ongoing basis. So I would expect to see, again, an increase in the benefit ratio, but obviously we're still expecting to maintain very strong recovery in return to work.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "OK.", "Susan Ring", "Hopefully, that answers the both better, Colin? Great.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Yes.", "Tom Watjen", "Just on the CFO search, I think as you know, this is a very important hire for us. We want to be very methodical and careful in this process. We've got big shoes to fill with Bob's announced decision to retire. The good news is, Bob is certainly, as you know, is been willing to work with us in whatever length or period of time is necessary.", "It is hard to get a search going in the first quarter, I have to say, when you look at people going through year end closings and things like that. So it's well underway. Maybe a little slower than I would have hoped, but as I look back to what you'd expect to accomplish in a first quarter when, again, many people you would be talking to are going through year end closings themselves.", "It's probably where it should be in terms of our process. Again, the good news is, Bob has been very willing and gracious in working with us over a period of time that's necessary to be sure we got the right person and the right transition plan in place.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Maybe just one final one just to reconfirm. You feel very comfortable with Unum's capital position, very comfortable with your dividends. That sort of sets you apart from your peers, but it's always nice to have that just reaffirmed.", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, we do. It's because of two things. One is that we obviously think we have a good set of business plans in place that we're executing very consistently and it's producing very consistent results, which is important, including very strong statutory results.", "The second thing is, we have a very strong financial position and capital position that we think is good at all levels. It's good at the insurance company label. It's good at the leverage level. It's good at the liquidity level. So again, we feel good. I mean we don't want to spend, as we said before, we want to be careful that we continue to warehouse capital for this environment, but again, we feel very good about where things stand right now.", "Operator", "", "We'll move next to site of Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "You had mentioned a couple of times you might expect an uptick in large case new sales. Was that a couple of big wins or is there something broader going on there?", "Kevin McCarthy", "I think for the most part, the sales cycle for large case is somewhat longer than it is for small case. So we get a line of sight to the future a little bit easier in large case. We've got some fairly good-sized wins that we can see that are going to merge in the second quarter. That's primarily what we are talking about here. As far as the broader picture, a little bit too early to tell how that's going to play out.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Is there some change in either the market or in you that has allowed you to be more (inaudible)? You have been willing to be more aggressive in these large cases?", "Kevin McCarthy", "No. We really haven't changed our [posture] regarding aggression in large case. I do think that we are always disciplined about it. So that's why you get volatility in the sales. We always write a moderate amount of it every year and we're consistently doing that, but how it times itself during the course of the year varies.", "I think all of our positive performance over the last several years in both renewal management and the pricing stability that has occurred from that as well as our positive claims performance and the profitability that we've had in our improved service value proposition, all of that I think is probably contributing to some increased competitiveness there.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Then in the core market, you've obviously done very well. When do you come up against some tough comps in trying to sustain that growth?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Some tough comparisons?", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Yes.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Probably, the fourth quarter. We had a very strong fourth quarter in 2008. So the comparison, I think, there will be some pressure on us during the fourth quarter of 2009, given how strong we were in fourth quarter 2008.", "Operator", "", "We'll move next to the site of Mark Finkelstein with Fox-Pitt Kelton.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "I guess I have a couple of questions. I guess one of your competitors talked about some pressures in small case in terms of kind of just one kind of bankruptcies occurring, and kind of reduced plants, et cetera?", "Secondly, some looking for kind of lower-cost alternatives. I'm just curious in your core market if you are seeing any of those same kind of trends in terms of looking to kind of reduce some coverages and/or pricing or what have you and how you are reacting to that?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes, we've seen a little bit of it. Our case persistency was down a little bit in the first quarter after we had, I think, three consecutive years of steady improvement in case persistency. When we looked into that a little bit more deeply, it's primarily at the very, very small end of our business. There was a fairly dramatic increase in reported very small cases that were dropping the coverage because they were under financial or budgetary pressures.", "It didn't affect premium very much. It just affect case persistency. In fact premium persistency was solid.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Then I guess just following on the prior question, you've got a couple of competitors/blocks that are apparently out there. How is just some of the disarray with some of your competitors on the group side impacting your quote activity?", "I mean, I understand that you've got a couple of large cases? I mean, are you seeing additional opportunities for quotes, not just at the large case, but also throughout the business? How should we be thinking about just any kind of structural changes in the competitive landscape in light of that?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Well, our activity levels were up 17% and our close ratios in the quarter were up 10%. I don't know if that's totally driven by the behaviors of competitors as much as our continuing improved performance. Also, we continue to ramp-up our core sales rep staffing levels, but there is probably some combination of those.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "I guess just finally on claim incidence, I think, Tom, you broke down the higher sensitivity claims, I think 25%, some of the mental claims. Just to clarify the comment, broadly, in those specific claim areas, are you not seeing any trend movement, increases in those claim activities, due to kind of economic weakness? That statement can be made across industry sectors and case sizes?", "Tom Watjen", "It can, Mark, but I'll ask maybe Kevin to add anything to that. As I said, those are the areas you tend to think about, but frankly we haven't seen it.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Right. I think the comment, Mark, it's more about, if you are going to see something, that's probably how it would occur, but we haven't seen it. We haven't seen any discernible change in reported incidence levels by cause of disability.", "Operator", "", "We'll take our next question from the site of John Nadel of Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "So most of mine have been asked and answered, but just maybe a high level question for you guys. If we strip out the potential positive or negative impact of foreign currency, you look at your results so far this quarter and some of the expectations around some of the larger case sales that you have sort of highlighted is coming on, persistency of the business is generally stable. Can we expect topline growth on a consolidated basis or, I guess, premium growth on a consolidated basis in 2010?", "Tom White", "You need to break it down, because we've got four different stories going on.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Yes.", "Tom White", "Clearly, the Closed Block is going to decline 5% a year. That is not going to change and not going to necessarily accelerate anytime soon.", "Unum U.S., you got a couple of factors going on in there. We still think that we can get to a positive year-over-year comparison as we get towards the year end. We've got a little headwind developing with the recessionary pressure that Kevin talked about. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. With the sales that we are seeing, with the persistency we are seeing, we're still looking good there.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Yes, that was sort of my point.", "Tom White", "Yes, I think Colonial is kind of the same thing. That's pretty consistent 5% or 6% topline growth. We'll have some challenges in the U.K. We have seen the last handful of quarters' year-over-year premiums are down a little bit. That's a function of sales activity being lower; persistency being lower for the last couple of years, but persistency is firming up for the most part. Sales are starting to come back, and that will be a gradual process.", "I hate to kind of give a single answer for the total company, because you really have different things. Again, when you think of our strategy, it is not to necessarily grow the topline. We want to be selective: core market business, voluntary business, certainly Colonial, to see growth there, but it's still very much a focus on protecting profit margins and improving the overall profitability of the business.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Yes, I guess where I'm going is, I mean the capital, the balance sheet story, the liquidity at the holding company, the lack of debt maturities, et cetera, is all very strong and very defensive on a relative basis to the vast majority of your peers right now. I'm thinking just about the earnings outlook. In this environment, right, to Colin's point on how much lower can the benefit ratio go with the pressures of the economy, notwithstanding the changes that you guys have made that is positively impacting that. At some point, the premiums have to flatten to go up, to drive earnings growth, and that was sort of my point.", "Tom Watjen", "I would just add to what Tom shared with you. I think, Tom, also what you were getting to is because there's three or four different themes going on here, some of what we're seeing in some of the markets, we're targeting in terms of the core markets in voluntary, the margins are actually better in some of those products.", "So that can also be one of the things as you think forward. Because the mix of business shift, I think, has different margin characteristics to it, which maybe in the topline, I think, as you were saying, Tom maybe telling you one thing, but the margin actually maybe telling you something very different.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Just to the increase in quoting activity, not necessarily closing ratios, but the increase in quoting, any sense, Kevin, as you think about the U.S. market? How you would attribute or what portion of that increase in quoting activity you would attribute to employee benefits, to folks actually really looking to shop because they are concerned about their current carrier?", "Kevin McCarthy", "No, I don't really have much of a sense of that. I think it's probably more that we have been very disciplined about building out our distribution capacity and capability. We've added, I think, 34 core market reps between last year and this year. Then, of course, we've rolled out our Simply Unum initiative, which gives us greater ability to get multiple quotes across multiple product lines with the same customers and brokers.", "Operator", "", "We'll take our next question from the site of Mr. Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "First question is just on the improvement in the benefit ratio and group disability. I know you cited favorable claims recovery trends. Can you talk a little bit about what's underlying that? Is it return to work? Is it more settlements?", "I guess the reason I ask is just intuitively you would think returning to work is likely to be more difficult when there's fewer jobs. Anyway, that's my first question.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes. There's a number of factors. As I mentioned, the disability ratio is driven by a lot of factors. Paid incidence was slightly lower quarter-over-quarter versus the first quarter of last year. Our in-force pricing is up slightly, and that contributes to the loss ratio. It's up about 1% on a premium for life basis. We had higher average-sized recoveries in terms of their indemnity value and we had lower average-sized new claim submissions coming in. So, all of those sort of affect our loss ratio.", "We do continue to get steady claim management performance. We had slight increases in recovery rates, slight increases in death resolution rates and slight increases in settlements. All of those sort of add in.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "So a little bit of a lot of things, it sounds like.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "The next question is just on stat earnings. I noticed they were particularly strong at least on an operating basis. Can you talk a little bit about what was driving that?", "Tom White", "Yes. Statutory earnings were very good. When we get those statements out on the website here in a few days, you'll be able to look through those. We do get a little bit of benefit with the relationship between the special-purpose reinsurance vehicles when they have investment losses, and it gets reimbursed. So that helps the statutory earnings the way it gets presented.", "So what I would probably ask you to do this quarter is to focus on the net income line, where all that impact washes itself out. The fact that we are $140-something million of statutory net income in a first quarter is an excellent result for us.", "There is some seasonality in our business. We tend to see a little higher group life claim incidence in the first quarter and there is a little bit higher disability incidence just on a seasonality basis. That comes through in statutory earnings. So the fact that we have a strong statutory net income in the first quarter is pretty powerful for us.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "So, Tom, from a sustainability standpoint, you would direct us to net income as opposed to the stronger operating income?", "Tom White", "Yes, I think for this quarter. We can get together off-line and kind of talk through some of that. When those filings are out there, we can walk through it. Yes, I guess probably the better way to focus is to look at the net income for this quarter, which, again, was excellent.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "One other thing I noticed, just on page 14.2 of the supplement was, looks like incurred on prior-year claims was a large negative number and...", "Tom White", "That's positive reserve development. The way it's presented on that page. So when you look at the last four or five quarters or so, we have had very positive reserve development. That's what drives a lot of the improved results you see in statutory earnings.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "How should we think about that? Is that just underlying relative to prior estimates of reserves, you're just seeing better underlying?", "Tom White", "We are seeing better experience. We are seeing better incidence. We are seeing better recovery. Pricing, as Kevin mentioned, is coming through nicely. Mix of business is coming through. It all feeds together. You got a lower benefit ratio. You got a better profit margin. You see better reserves development, stronger statutory earnings, stronger cash flow. It's just all driven by the changes that we've put in place over the last handful of years in that business.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Last question just on the U.K. Susan, can you just talk a little bit about the environment? I guess the way I sort of look at that business is, it's been by far the most volatile just looking at sales and premium revenue and profitability, has the competitive environment stabilized? Is it lessening? Is it just as intense as it was?", "I recall back on investor day, there was discussion about what sounded like massive price disparities in the market. Maybe you could just give us an update of what's happening there?", "Susan Ring", "I would say that it's just as intense. I wouldn't say that it's [varied]. So it's something that we continue to sort of monitor and keep an eye on. We ensure that we don't get distracted by it. We are maintaining our pricing discipline. We are still very strongly positioned from a market point of view, both in group income protection, group disability, where we have the market lead, and also in group risk, overall, which includes all the group protection products.", "So we are very focused on making sure we continue to deliver to our customers, and what they want, and develop the offerings and the services that we deliver to them. So just as intense, but we're just as equally focused on what we need to do.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Susan, would you say you're still seeing some price activity that's 30%, 50% away from what you think is reasonable or is the price war letting up at all?", "Susan Ring", "No, I would say, again, we're still seeing some very aggressive pricing. Having said that, as a result of that, we have seen some losses with regard to our group life business. So you all have seen from the results that our persistency for group life wasn't where we'd have liked it to be for the first quarter.", "Having said that, though, our group income protection, our group disability persistency was very strong, in fact, 91%. Our group critical persistency was just under 90%. So we are very much focused and our field force is focused on making sure that we maintain the business that we've got.", "So there is some very aggressive pricing out there, but our service offering is very strong. A lot of what we offer from a product point of view means that we are very well-positioned. In some cases uniquely positioned with the features and services that we offer. So, we continue to focus on making sure that we develop and deliver that.", "Tom Watjen", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the site of Eric Berg of Barclays Capital.", "Eric Berg - Barclays Capital", "I know. After all these years and after this market, my skin is about three inches thick, so no offense taken at all. It's absolutely fine. I was hoping to follow-up on a comment by Kevin and Susan regarding the recession. My question is very narrow and very precise. I've listened to everything you have said about, very attentively, about the changes you've made in your business.", "My first question is, why do you think it is that in the corners of the economy, here and in the U.K., that would be hit right by a recession and in which you would expect to see an elevated level of claims, including mental and nervous claims, we have not? What's your best sense of what's going on different this time around?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Let me say two things about it. One is sort of factual and one is highly speculative. The factual one is that although with everything that's going on in the economy, the unemployment rate change in our mix of business, for example, the education and health sector where you have still got employment growth going on, has a dampening effect on expected results.", "In addition to that, particularly in group disability income, we tend to insure a lot of people who are college educated or higher. As you know, looking at unemployment, our employment level statistics, the change in our unemployment rate is much smaller than the headline rate. So that's sort of factual side of it.", "I think the speculative side of that is, it's awful hard to try to get inside of people's heads as to what makes them or doesn't make them file for claim. As I have said in prior quarters, I think right now, if you have a job, taking the chance on filing for disability at the risk of your job is probably not a great plan.", "Susan Ring", "Yes, sure Tom. I mean, in the fourth quarter last year, I don't know whether you remember, we did actually see some increase in claims incidence, but that hasn't been replicated in our experience for the first quarter. What we saw last year was, in particular, claims, the mental and nervous disorders, and they tended to be short duration claims.", "This quarter we have seen lower inceptions. I think the primary reason for that is because potential claimants are staying at work because they don't want to see the sort of job closed out or restructuring that could happen behind them when they go on to disability claims. So I think people are sort of staying put for fear of further changes.", "The other thing that we're seeing in the U.K. as well is certain employers are actually withdrawing claims. So they are submitting them and then withdrawing them fairly quickly. The reason for that is because they are undergoing organizational changes. They're restructuring. In some circumstances, they are making categories of employees, which includes that potential claimant, redundant. So there are two factors going on, really.", "Eric Berg - Barclays Capital", "My final question relates to profitability in your core business. What you call your core business is, of course, a corner of disability that lots of people have been pursuing very aggressively for years. Lots of people have told us about their desire, whether it's StanCorp or Reliance Standard, I think Met and Hartford have both created units to focus on this core market. Why do you think profitability continues to be better in your core business than in the large case market, given what would appear to be increasing attention by your competitors to your target market too? Thanks.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes, I think you're right that there is increasing attention, but still, if you look at the size and scope of our field sales and service operation and its focus and attention on the core market, I think we have broader and deeper coverage there and a long history there with a lot of brokerage relationships.", "In addition to that, we continue to redesign our offerings to fit that core market. 71% of our sales this quarter had two or more lines of coverage. So I think that we are able to maybe serve that brokerage market and that small case market place with a breadth of offerings supported by service, and even supported by the ability to add on voluntary benefits with enrollment. I just think we have maybe a value proposition that's more focused on that market.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Eric, and then thank you all for taking the time to join us on this call. This will complete our first quarter 2009 earnings call. As always, we are all available for questions if there are some to follow-up. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.

Joining us this morning on our call are as usual the heads of our three operating segments: Kevin McCarthy, Susan Ring and Randy Horn along with Bob Greving, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who as you know, will be retiring later this year. ", "While Bob will be continuing to be involved in the transition service, this will be the last quarter Bob will serve as Chief Financial Officer. As those of you who have followed us closely know he has been a significant contributor to our company over the last 12 years, and so we will miss Bob and wish him well and his family in his future endeavors. And Bob will actually have a few comments at the closing of our prepared comments here this morning.", "As you know, Rick McKenney will be replacing Bob as Chief Financial Officer and he is with us this morning. Rick joined the company a couple of weeks ago and will officially assume the CFO title next week, and we are certainly very pleased to have Rick with us.", "Now moving to our results. The second quarter was another good one for the company continuing the positive trends that we've seen over the past several quarters, and let me touch on a few of the highlights.", "First, excluding net realized after-tax investment gains we reported $0.65 per share in operating income for the second quarter in line with the year-ago results. Each of our businesses continued to perform well with stable to improved risk results across all of our operating segments.", "Our year-over-year reported profitability was impacted somewhat by the effect of the weaker British pound on the translation of U.K. earnings, but on a constant currency basis, our consolidated before tax operating income increased by 1%, while our core operating segments, that is Unum U.S., Unum U.K., and Colonial Life increased by 5%.", "Secondly, while we continue to see encouraging trends in our sales results such as case count growth by over 20% in Unum U.S., 7% in Colonial and over 35% in Unum U.K., we are seeing some pressure on sales to existing customers and premium growth in general, which we attribute largely to economic weakness in both the U.S. and the U.K. I'll touch on that further in a moment.", "Third, the investment portfolio continues to perform well and remains well positioned to weather the difficult credit cycle.  Net realized investment losses excluding the impact from the embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance agreement remains somewhat elevated though at manageable levels.", "As we've said before, it's likely we will continue to experience somewhat higher realized investment losses until the economy and financial markets improve, but the strength of our balance sheet and capital position positioned us well to absorb any potential losses.", "In addition, the tightening of corporate bond spreads across all rating categories during the second quarter improved the unrealized loss position in the portfolio. And as a result, book value per share improved by 16% over the first quarter results.", "Finally, we continue to build financial flexibility the good old-fashioned way through strong statutory earnings and capital generation this quarter. We comfortably exceeded our targets for capital and liquidity, leverage and risk-based capital, and are on target to meet our year end 2009 capital metrics guidance.", "Now, let me come back to a few things that I'd like to point out more specifically with regards to second quarter results. Beginning with Unum U.S., where our pre-tax operating earnings increased 11.5% to $191.3 million in the second quarter with strong earnings growth in the group disability line of business and improved earnings in supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which offset somewhat the lower earnings we saw in the group life business.", "Now a bit more on the group disability line. Earnings were actually up about 45% from the year-ago quarter in large part due to the strong risk results again this quarter. The group disability benefit ratio for the second quarter improved to 87%, a decline of 100 basis points from the first quarter of this year and 350 basis points from the year-ago second quarter.", "These improvements continue to be driven by generally stable claim incidents, strong claim recoveries and the ongoing shift in our in-force business of the more stable core markets.", "Unum U.S. sales increased 10.8% in the second quarter with solid growth in several areas including growth of 18.7% in the core employee benefit market line and growth of 29% in our large case market business. Sales in the supplemental and voluntary lines were more challenging, though, as we believe buyers are deferring these purchases due to the continued recessionary concerns and the uncertainty around health care reform.", "We're also seeing the economy unfavorably impact sales to existing customers and again I'll come back to that in just a few moments, and Kevin is certainly with us this morning if you have any further questions on our Unum U.S. business or the marketplace.", "Now shifting to Unum U.K., our pre-tax earnings were $67.3 million for the second quarter of 2009 compared to $92.6 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a significant decline in the value of the British pound. In local currency, earnings declined by 7% largely driven by a decline in premium income due to lower sales and persistency in 2008.", "Unum U.K.'s risk results remain very favorable and profit margins in this business continue to be quite strong. On a local currency basis, sales increased by 21% overall and 23% for our group business, primarily driven by a series of recent product changes that we made actually to our group life line of business.", "Our sales results are also beginning to be positively impacted by a departure of a competitor from the U.K. group risk marketplace, but I will also add that the U.K. market continues to be very competitive. And Susan Ring is with us this morning for any questions you may have on the U.K. business or the U.K. marketplace.", "Now, shifting to Colonial Life, our pre-tax earnings increased 5% to $71.3 million in the second quarter as our risk results remained favorable and our profit margins for this business continue to be very strong. Total sales declined 3.9%, which as I mentioned earlier, is heavily driven by the declines in sales to existing customers.", "However, we are continuing to see strong new account growth, which was up actually 7.4% in the second quarter, which should position us well if and when the economy begins to recover. And Randy Horn is with us for any questions you may have on that business or that market segment.", "Now shifting to investments, our investment portfolio continues to hold up well in this environment. Our default experience remains good and net realized investment losses remained at very manageable levels. Furthermore, the valuation of our portfolio improved dramatically as we saw a tightening of corporate bond spreads in the second quarter and our unrealized investment losses were significantly reduced from the end of the first quarter.", "And now finally, as it relates to our capital position, we remain in a very solid position and continue to build financial flexibility throughout the quarter. Our second quarter 2009 estimate for the risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies is approximately 340%, above our long-term target of 300% and our year-end 2009 target of between 330% and 335%.", "Our leverage excluding the non-recourse debt and capital of our Tailwind and Northwind holdings is at 18.5% as of the end of the second quarter, well below our long-term target of 25% and our holding company liquidity ended the second quarter at $475 million, which is in line with our March 31 result despite paying off $108 million of maturing debt and making a $70 million contribution to our pension fund in the second quarter.", "We're on track to meet our year-end 2009 target of $750 million of excess capital, which is over three times our target level.", "In summary, we feel very good about our second quarter results and our position as we move forward. Our core operating segments continue to perform well and are meeting our expectations. Our solid risk results today are a reflection of the risk management plans we implemented over the past few years, including disciplined pricing, underwriting and risk selection.", "The sales momentum in our target markets remained generally very positive and in fact this quarter is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our core group of market sales, which includes LTD, STD and group life. ", "We believe that our solid value proposition in the wide selection of benefit choice is supported by a commitment to service and serving us well in this market place. While we see growth opportunities in the market though, however, we will continue to remain very disciplined and be sure that we can maintain the pricing discipline, the risk management that's led to our recent success.", "Our investment portfolio continues to perform well despite the difficult credit environment and certainly, last but not least, our capital position remains strong and we continue to build financial flexibility to protect us in these uncertain times, and frankly to also invest in our business and seize any opportunities that this challenging environment may present us with.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Tom White who will provide more detail on the second quarter results. Tom?", "Tom White", "Great. Thanks, Tom. I'd like to start with a few comments on operating results in the second quarter then move to a summary of capital management and investment portfolio results. At Unum U.S., the second quarter continued the primary themes of the past several quarters, that is, solid margin improvement in group disability, generally stable results in group life and AD&D, and continued growth in our supplemental and voluntary lines driving an 11.5% increase in income for the segment.", "Within Unum U.S., the group disability line reported another strong quarter with income up 45% to $68.3 million. We continue to see improvement in the benefit ratio, which declined to 87% in the second quarter compared to 88% in the first quarter of this year and 90.5% in the year-ago second quarter.", "A number of factors are driving this continued improvement, including: One, the ongoing shift in our block of business to more core market business and less large case business as well as the shift to more stable industries and away from some of the more traditionally economic sensitive industries.", "Two, favorable claim recovery trends. Three, ongoing adherence to pricing discipline particularly in large case business. And finally, a continued stable level of new claim incidents. New submitted claim incidents on a seasonally adjusted basis were in line with the trends we experienced in the first quarter as well as those of the past several quarters.", "In the group life and AD&D line, operating income declined to $48.7 million compared to $54.3 million a year ago, primarily driven by lower premium income, which declined by 3% and a slightly higher benefit ratio of 70.5% compared to 69.5% a year ago resulting from higher mortality.", "Finally, the supplemental and voluntary business income grew 6% to $74.3 million with all three primary lines of business showing year-over-year premium growth.", "Reported sales for Unum U.S. increased by 10.8% in aggregate. Core market sales for our group lines, which are LTD, STD and group life and AD&D combined, but for our group lines, core market sales showed continued strong momentum increasing 18.7% for the second quarter and 17.6% for the first half of 2009.", "Sales in the large case market for these lines increased 29% in the second quarter, largely due to the inclusion of two large case sales. The supplemental and voluntary lines struggled a bit this quarter with combined sales decline of 14.4%. The voluntary benefits line had a sales decline of 6%, which was primarily driven by lower sales to large case and existing accounts. Case count growth in voluntary benefits increased by 26%, indicating a good level of activity in the core market.", "The roll out of our Simply Unum platform has continued to gain traction with approval now in 50 states and implementation completed in 47 states. Our experience to date has exceeded our expectations with Simply Unum-related sales now exceeding 20% of our small case sales, many of whom are first time buyers of group and voluntary benefit plans.", "Unum U.K., the decline in the value of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar coming down from a $1.97 a year ago quarter to a $1.53 in the second quarter 2009 continue to negatively impact translated results for the Unum U.K. segment.", "Underlying operating performance, however, remains generally strong with income and local currency at 43.9 million pounds, a decline of 7% caused primarily by the 9% decline in premium income. The margins in this segment remain very favorable driven by favorable claim performance in both LTD and group life.", "Second quarter sales were quite strong, increasing 21% in local currency, largely driven by higher large case activity and also improved sales in the group life market where we've made a number of improvements over the past several months. These improvements include product innovations as well as greater internal focus on group life sales by our sales reps, all of which are leading to greater quoting opportunities for us and fewer declines to quote, which resulted from overconcentration issues.", "We are also beginning to benefit from the exit of AEGON in the U.K. group risk market and the movement of some of that business to us, a trend that should continue to benefit us in the second half of 2009.", "With the recent improvement in sales trends and stabilization of persistency over the past few quarters, we believe that the year-over-year premium declines we have experienced in recent quarters will begin to improve in the second half of 2009; this being done without sacrificing underwriting and pricing discipline. We continue to expect declines on a year-over-year basis, but less than that experienced in this second quarter.", "To conclude our core operations, Colonial Life's operating results remained strong with income of $71.3 million, which is a 5% increase. The benefit ratio was generally stable at 46.4% in the second quarter compared to 46.9% the year-ago quarter. Our sales at Colonial Life declined by 3.9%, largely reflecting the impact of the weak economy on our sales in existing accounts.", "Colonial Life derives about two-thirds of its sales through reworks as we actively manage existing account relationships. This component of our sales declined by 7.3% in the second quarter and 9.1% in the first half of 2009. We are encouraged, however, by our sales to new customers, which grew 2.8% in the second quarter and 13.2% in the first half of the year. Additionally, our new account growth is holding up well with growth of 7.4% in the quarter and 8.9% year to date.", "We believe we will continue to face a tough sales environment as the economy struggles and unemployment remains elevated, but case count growth and continued strong agent recruiting bode well for future sales trends as more favorable economic conditions develop.", "The Individual Disability Closed Block pre-tax earnings declined to $10 million in the second quarter from $15.2 million a year ago. The interest adjusted loss ratio improved slightly to 82% in the second quarter from 82.4% and remains generally consistent with the trends of the past several quarters. The corporate and other segment recorded an operating loss of $16 million compared to $6.7 million a year ago. Expenses are higher in this segment, largely reflecting approximately $10 million of incremental quarterly pension costs, which will continue throughout 2009.", "Interest expense was reduced to $25.6 million in the second quarter, compared to $30.6 million a year ago. With the rebound in the credit markets, the company's book value per share likewise rebounded. Book value per share was $22.57 at the end of the quarter, which is an increase of 16% from the first quarter and excluding net unrealized gains and losses on security and a net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per share was $22.07 as of June 30, which is an increase of 6% from the first quarter.", "Earnings on a statutory accounting basis remained quite strong with second quarter 2009 net gain from operations, this is after tax, of $149.5 million for our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries and net income was $108.4 million.", "With these strong levels of statutory earnings, the company continues to generate capital internally, which obviously enhances our financial flexibility. Even with the $108 million debt maturity that was paid off in May, and as Tom mentioned, the funding of $70 million to the company's pension plan out of holding company cash, our capital management metrics continue to build in the quarter.", "Our estimate of risk-based capital for our traditional U.S. insurance companies is approximately 340%, which is slightly higher than the first quarter level. This level is well above our long-term target of 300% and ahead of our year-end 2009 guidance of a range of 330% to 335%. ", "Holding company liquidity was $475 million at the end of the second quarter, in line with the first quarter level of $473 million. This level is also well above our long-term target of one-time holding company fixed charges, which is now approximately $230 million and on target to meet our year-end 2009 guidance of approximately $750 million.", "Finally, our leverage position was 18.5% at June 30th, which is nicely below the March 31 level of 21.2% with the retirement of the May maturity. Again, this is well below our target of 25%, and we're obviously pleased that the financial flexibility of the company has been enhanced through internal capital generation as this provides us even greater opportunities as credit markets continue to improve.", "Moving quickly to the investment portfolio, during the second quarter the level of unrealized losses in our fixed maturity securities portfolio improved materially as credit spreads tightened significantly across all ratings categories. The net unrealized loss position was $487 million as of June 30th compared to $2.5 billion at March 31.", "Not surprisingly, with the tightening of credit spreads in the second quarter, our new money yield declined somewhat from the levels of late 2008 first quarter of '09. Our new money yield in the second quarter was 6.82%, which compares to 7.46% in the first quarter and 8.47% in the fourth quarter.", "The overall portfolio yield remains stable with the first quarter and the net interest reserve margins for our primary ongoing lines of business, including Unum U.S. group disability continue to widen. And we made no adjustments to the new claim discount rates in our businesses this quarter.", "Along with the improvement in our overall corporate bond holdings, the fair values in our portfolio of hybrid holdings improved in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we had holdings of $492.8 millions on an amortized cost basis and $316.3 million on a fair value basis.", "In the second quarter, we recognized impairments of $25.5 million on two of our holdings, $22.3 million of which was recognized in income as a realized investment loss and $3.2 million was recognized in other comprehensive income.", "One final point on our hybrid exposure, our below investment grade hybrid exposure is now $162.2 million on an amortized cost basis or $82 million on a fair value basis.", "I'll conclude my remarks with a summary of realized investment losses for the second quarter. Our reported net realized investment losses; this is excluding the embedded derivative gain of $91 million after-tax or $140.1 million before-tax, totaled $39.6 million after-tax or $52.8 million on a pre-tax basis.", "The bond impairments for the quarter included the $22.3 million before tax loss on the two European bank hybrids as well as a $25.8 million before-tax loss on a U.S. auto parts supplier and a media services company. We also had additional net realized before-tax investment losses of $4.7 million.", "So with that, I'll turn it back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Tom. Before we move to your questions, let me touch on a few additional items including an update on how the recession is impacting our business. It's important to note that the economy is not currently impacting our risk results as evidenced by the performance of virtually all of our business lines this past quarter.", "We are, however, experiencing some impact on our premium income. In all of our businesses, we are seeing a lower level of new sales to existing customers, which indicates that because of the economic pressures, customers are hesitant to add new lines of coverage. We're also seeing some pressure on the natural growth of the in-force block. The lower levels of employment and the reduced rate of salary growth combined to lower compensation of many employers, which adversely affects the level of in-force premium.", "Instead of adding 1% or 2% to our premium growth on an annual basis, it's now reducing our block growth by about that amount, which is why it's so important we continue to add new customers, and again which all of our businesses have done very well this past quarter.", "These factors will continue to impact our top-line growth as long as the recession continues and unemployment levels remain high, but again they are not impacting our profitability.", "So while we're not immune to the effects of the recession, we do believe that we are well positioned to effectively manage through it because we've got a very high-quality offering in the marketplace. We have an excellent value proposition. Our employees are very engaged in the business right now serving our customers. We have a more diversified platform to build and grow from than we've ever had before. And as we said in our comments today, we have a very strong financial position and have maintained strong financial flexibility to obviously weather whatever difficult times may still lie ahead.", "Finally, I will conclude my prepared comments by updating our guidance for 2009 operating earnings per share. We're revising upward our guidance for this year to a range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, which is an increase of $0.05 per share. The more positive outlook is driven primarily by two factors: higher operating earnings in our Unum U.S. segment relative to our expectations in the first half of the year, and an upward revision in our assumption around the dollar/pound relationship.", "Now before we turn to your questions, as I mentioned earlier, this is going to be Bob Greving's last call, and since Bob has such a close relationship with many of you, we thought it would be good just to give Bob a chance to offer a few perspectives outside the normal Q&A section. So, Bob, I'll pass things to you.", "Bob Greving ", "Thanks, Tom. I'll keep my comments brief. I appreciate the opportunity to leave you with just a couple of thoughts. We've had our share of challenges over the last 12 years, but I'm real pleased with how well the company has performed during this current difficult economic environment and especially where it stands today. The company is well positioned with consistent operating performance, a strong investment portfolio and sound capital levels and I've been very proud to be a part of this hard-working and disciplined management team.", "I also know that I leave the company and the CFO position in the extremely capable hands of Rick McKenney and a strong finance and actuarial team.", "And lastly, I want to thank all of you on the call that I've had an opportunity to come to know and interact with over my career. I've enjoyed working with you and I want to wish you all the best.", "Thank you. Tom?", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Bob. And again, we certainly have valued your contribution over what's been a very interesting 12 years, hasn't it?", "Bob Greving ", "It certainly has.", "Tom Watjen", "And again, I think things have been left in a good state and certainly you and Rick have done a wonderful job in the transition process. And so we certainly want to thank you for all the good work that you also make for a very smooth transition.", "So, at this time, operator, I think we're ready to begin the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question today from Colin Devine at Citigroup.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "I've got a couple of questions. Simply Unum, if you could just expand a little bit more about how you're marketing that product and why it's working? I know Tom White touched on it briefly in his comments, but it seems like that's such a big part of the growth strategy going forward?", "For Randy, with Colonial, once again your operations results seem to be coming in much stronger than I guess your leading competitor, Aflac, in terms of other persistency with their lives right now were 30% of sales, you are doing better. What is about Colonial that's giving you the success there?", "And then we don't want to let Bob Greving get away without one last question. I want to talk about the pension. Is there a chance here, what is this funded status now and is there a chance to fund this thing up and get away from a bit of this ongoing drag that we've been seeing?", "And then finally, for Susan, in the U.K., maybe just to talk a little bit about, is AEGON getting out of the business there? Can it help that much given the concentration you've got and I know U.K. regulatory authorities are a little worried about the size of your market share as it stands?", "Tom Watjen", "Good. Thanks, Colin. We'll start with the first one on Simply Unum, Kevin?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Simply Unum has been a pretty good success story for us so far. We're very pleased with the results. From a marketing standpoint, I think the easiest way to think about it is that it's a total offering. We basically approach the employer with the idea that we can manage their overall benefits portfolio in a simpler way than they've purchased and administered that portfolio in the past. So we package products together both employer-paid and employee-paid products.", "We provide a single enrollment process with benefits communication to communicate the entire package, and we provide a simple one platform administrative process that's easier and less expensive and more productive for the employer and the human resources benefits administration department. And I think from the broker's standpoint, it allows them to present a total offering. From the customer's standpoint, it allows them to purchase a total offering and do it in an efficient way both from a funding and administrative cost standpoint and I think that story plays well.", "Tom Watjen", "That was a trend we were seeing three or four years ago, but certainly in the environment we're in now, we can even see an acceleration in the needs for those attributes you talked about.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Absolutely both the combination of the employers maybe needing to share the funding of benefits products with their employees and at the same time, employers needing to feel confident about the way in which they do that doesn't jeopardize their employee relations, but rather enhances it.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Kevin. Randy, you want to pick up on Colin's question with respect to your operational performance and just some of the dynamics that are driving that.", "Randy Horn ", "You bet, Tom and good morning, Colin. I think it really just comes down to us really staying focused on the basics of our business. So, I can't speak to specific initiatives and strategies of our top competitors, but in terms of what we can control we're staying focused on growth of our agency system. That is really job one for us. We've been doing that for the last two to three years staying very focused on our recruiting infrastructure and helping these new sales reps get productive very quickly.", "We've seen our new rep recruiting up over 25% again so far this year and that's on top of some very good results in 2008. And again, we're looking at the productivity of these new folks very closely and we're very pleased with what we're seeing there as well. We continue to see, Colin, our value proposition and our core markets resonating very well. That's coming through in terms of activity levels as evidenced by growth in our average weekly producers. That's up close to 6% here so far this year.", "Growth in new accounts, Tom White went through some of those stats with you earlier, continue to be very, very strong. And we're also continuing to expand our broker relationship. So I really think it just comes back to staying focused on the basics, what we can control and at the same time maintaining our financial discipline. And all that just seems to be working pretty well right now.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Randy, could you tell us what your level of weekly average producers is? That might actually be a helpful thing to add to the stats since I know it's a big part of sort of what drives your growth?", "Randy Horn", "", "The actual number of average weekly producers is right around 2,100, right in that area.", "Tom Watjen", "The only thing I would add to it, I think you continue to invest heavily in your service infrastructure and as we actually do have outside reviews of service quality and the service quality metrics continue to improve, actually. They're already at a very high level, but continue to show steady improvement obviously which is very important to customers in these trying times.", "Randy Horn", "That's right, Tom. We continue to give very, very high marks and that serves us well.", "Tom Watjen", "Good. Let me shift, Bob, to the pension question.", "Bob Greving ", "Yeah, Colin, on the pension plan, we contributed $70 million to the pension plan in the second quarter, which should bring the funded status into about the mid-70% range. I think we finished the year at about 71% on the plan. It would take probably a little bit more than $200 million currently to fully fund the plan, if we were just to dump a wad of money into it at this point in time.", "Obviously, investment performance has been relatively decent this year, a little bit over 4% for the first part of the year. So we're hoping that some of that unfunded status actually comes back as the investment portfolio comes back and we're seeing that in the general marketplace. But if we were just to throw some money at the plan right now, it would take about $200 million.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Is that an option for redeploying capital then if stock buy backs are going to sort of rattle the rating agencies a little bit? This seems to be one that would boost earnings, address this issue and kind of be a win-win for everybody.", "Bob Greving ", "It definitely is an option. Buying back or not financing outside debt, share repurchase and pension plan contributions are all kind of the candidates for use of capital. So it definitely is an option to examine.", "Tom Watjen", "Susan, the question on the market, especially the developments around AEGON?", "Susan Ring", "I actually had you ask three questions in one regarding AEGON. So I'll try and pick as of in turn. First of all, you asked why did AEGON withdrew from the group risk market. And I understand and also their publicly stated reason for doing that was due to capital reasons. So I think that that's very much the reason for doing that.", "In terms of whether it can help us that much given our concentration issues; we actually made some changes back in May prior to AEGON's withdrawal as part of our overall review of our group life publication in any event. So, where we are close to hot spot locations, we have actually sought additional reinsurance and as a result we've been able to open right up to all hot spot locations.", "So we actually don't have any restrictions from a hot spot or an accumulation of risk anymore. So the changes we were making to our group life portfolio therefore have obviously positioned us well with regard to the AEGON block. And we have, in fact, written 22 million pounds worth of the AEGON business so far, the majority of which isn't included in our numbers yet. So I think we included about 1.3 to 1.4 million pounds worth of those sales in our second quarter numbers. So the majority of that is still to come through.", "And with regard to the third question about regulators and are they concerned about us; obviously with regard to the way in which [we've] approached AEGON, it's not an acquisition. So we're just effectively bidding in the open market. If that business comes up, great, (inaudible) advance of that business coming to the market, so we're not precluded from doing that by our regulators and so there's no restriction in taking that approach as it stands. So that's not a problem for us at all. So hopefully that answers your questions regarding AEGON.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question today from Darin Arita at Deutsche Bank.", "Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank", "In looking at the U.S. group disability benefit ratio that continues to improve nicely. Can you give us a sense of what the benefit ratio looks like on your core versus your non-core business?", "Tom Watjen", "Kevin, you want to speak to in a general sense because we don't break it out.", "Kevin McCarthy", "We don't typically break that out. In the general sense, first of all, no matter who you are, no matter what company you are, your core business loss ratio would be lower than your large case business loss ratio because acquisition costs are higher, policy administration costs are higher, commission levels as a percentage of premiums are higher, so the loss ratios would be generally lower.", "That said, the margins, I think, the easiest way to answer the question is the margins are better in small cases than they are in large cases. Incidence levels are generally lower in small cases rather than large cases and those gains more than offset the increased expense ratios in the small case business, but we don't break out the loss ratio specifically.", "Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank", "And then I guess sticking with the U.S. business given the challenges to generate new business, can you talk about pricing trends and also what steps Unum is taking to retain its existing book?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yeah. Pricing trends for us are pretty stable. Our renewal program this year is a very modest, I think, 1% to 2% kind of adjustment in in-force pricing. New business pricing is very stable year over year. And I think year-to-date in the marketplace pricing, I think it has been fairly stable. I'd expect pricing maybe to be a little bit more challenging in the second half of the year. A lot of our competitors are probably facing sales challenges given the first half of the year, so I'd expect the competitive environment to be a little tough in the second half of the year.", "And the second part of your question, Darin we have a pretty robust customer contact management program to stay in touch with those clients. Also over the last four years, our renewal program, because it has been so robust, is much smaller. It puts a lot less of that business at risk, plus our service quality standards are much higher and delivery of service is much higher. We have a regular method of staying in touch with customers, making sure that we're serving them properly. We survey them, we make sure that we're on top of what their service needs are. So I think in general that reflects itself in continuing high persistency levels.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question today from Tom Gallagher at Credit Suisse.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "I guess first just sort of big picture just to see if I'm thinking about the way things will progress here directionally right. So it seems to me just based on the environment that we're looking at sort of flattish overall revenue trends for the next year or so, but we'll probably continue to see improvement in the margin, but the delta or I guess the degree of the improvement in the margin probably narrowing a bit. Do you think that's a fair representation of the way you see things playing out over the next 12 months or so? That's question number one.", "And I guess related to that, it gets to the margin question, is how should we be thinking about the spread between overall portfolio yield and discount rate, I guess, which would be particularly important on your group disability business and the IDI? And at some point is it possible we're going to start to see reserve releases as a result of that margin getting to some level that you think is over and above of what you think is an adequate cushion? Those are my first two questions.", "Tom White", "Okay. Tom, it's Tom White. I'll start on these anyway. To your first question, I think generally speaking you're right. Now, just looking within Unum U.S., if we were to split out our premiums by core business and large case business, we're actually seeing a little bit of a year-over-year increase in the core business. It's growing 1% to 2% a year and then when you layer in the voluntary benefits business, which we certainly view as a growth business for us, probably 3% or so type year-over-year growth.", "So where the drag is coming from is continues to be more on the large case business, which is fine. We want to grow that at some point, but we need to grow it the right way but in our results to date we continue to see a little bit of a decline on a year-over-year basis in the large case business. I think your point on margins is generally correct. As the business mix continues to move in the direction of more core market business by itself that will lead to an improvement in margins.", "It will be gradual over time, but we think it's something that will continue over time because it will continue to be a strategy for us to grow that core end of the business. Now, moving to the spread and the discount rate, this was a quarter where we actually added to the margin there and, again, I'll define the margin as the difference between the portfolio yield and the aggregate discount rate. I think for our group disability business, it widened by about 3 basis points and it's at about 87 basis points. We target something in the 50 to 60 basis point range.", "Now, I wouldn't expect reserve releases from that. What that does is it just positions us very, very nicely because if you look at what' going on in the credit markets a couple of quarters ago, we could invest new money at 8% and it's getting to be a little bit of a struggle to get 6 to 6.25%.", "So the market has changed quite a bit and this is probably the time that some of that margin will be eaten into very gradually over time just because the opportunities to expand that margin really don't exist given the current spreads that we're seeing in the bond market. So don't expect a reserve relief, but, however, you'll probably see that margin drift down a little bit over a fairly extended period of time.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "And I guess just a follow-up, Tom, for either you or Bob. So there's no imposed ceiling or limit in terms of how wide that margin can get, that's fairly discretionary in terms of just your overall stance on conservatism with regard to the way you allow reserves to develop? Is that fair to say or is there any bright line that we -- is it 100 basis points? I just want to get a sense for \u2026", "Bob Greving ", "Tom, this is Bob. There really isn't a bright line. If you really think about it, we hold our reserves at a conservative best estimate level and we feel that by the current portfolio rate as Tom indicated over time is not going to sustain itself. As you know, we also manage that spread with the discount rate on new claims and so as we see that spread growing, that gives us an opportunity to maybe modify the discount rate on our new claims as they occur.", "As you recall, we did reduce our discount rate on new claims back in the fourth quarter, I think, of 2008. We continually monitor that and we do some projections, we work with our investment people to do some projections over time to see where that new money rate looks like it's going and we'll establish our reserves that way. There is no bright line on that, but there is a practical level of conservatism that has to get built in, but we see that as being modified more on new claims than on some kind of a major adjustment to existing claim reserves.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "And then just one last follow-up. So with all of that said in terms of the growth trajectory and what's happening with margins since you're not growing premium levels very much, is it fair to say that most of your stat earnings or if not all of your stat earnings should be available for free cash flow up to the holding company? And I'm just thinking of it from the perspective of how much capital do you really need to retain if you're not growing the in-force too much?", "Bob Greving ", "Tom, I think you can kind of monitor that by watching our risk-based capital levels. As you see that RBC level at 340% for our traditional U.S. companies, clearly above where we need to be as far as our target RBC ratios are concerned. That does produce opportunity for additional dividends to the parent company. And so as the statutory earnings continue to be generated at the subsidiary companies, that does give us that expanded opportunity.", "Tom White", "You just have to put a couple of numbers around that, Tom. The holding company cash uses, which would be interest expense and paying the common stock dividend run us about $230 million a year, you'll need $50 million to $100 million to kind of fund growth in a more normal growth environment for us and you can contrast that with stat earnings on our U.S. business that are in the $600 million to $700 million range. And then you also need to take into account the expected capital that gets generated over our U.K. business, which is probably in the $100 million to $150 million range per year.", "So, bottom line is it's a nice position to be in and we're generating a nice amount of excess capital.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Steven Schwartz at Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates", "I'd like to go back and revisit with Susan some of what she was talking about. But first, just so I'm clear on this, the DIG B adjustment, basically what this is reflecting is credit spreads coming in on whoever it is you're doing reinsurance with?", "Bob Greving ", "This is Bob. I'll take that one. We have an assumed reinsurance agreement with New York Life where we bought the individual disability business a number of years ago. The assets actually stay on New York life's business, which under accounting rules creates an embedded derivative and what that DIG B adjustment or the embedded derivative adjustment is, it's supposed to reflect the value of that agreement in an unlined situation.", "In other words, if the companies were required to unwind it, what kind of value would be traded between the companies in that situation. We consider that adjustment while it's interesting from an accounting standpoint, we consider it generally uneconomic because there really is no unwind provision in that agreement. That was a purchase of a block of business using an indemnity reinsurance approach, and there is no escape for either company except under the most dire circumstances of insolvency, which we don't see for either us or New York Life.", "So I think that adjustment is an interesting accounting one, but we do not consider to be an economic impact type of adjustment.", "Tom White", "What you'll see and what you've seen over the last several years that we've accounted for this is that in periods of time when corporate bond spreads tighten, we're going to see gains on there and when bond spreads widen out, you're going to see an unrealized loss and we try to split that out because again we don't view it as economic and we try to split that out so you can see what's actually going on within the investment portfolio.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates", "I understand. I was just trying to figure out what was the driver of the change. Susan, if you could, story from the U.K. has basically been its very competitive. We expect our benefit ratios, our loss ratios to go up over time. Now we find out that AEGON has left at least some part of that market, the benefit ratios don't seem to be moving much, wondering if you can give us an update kind of on what's going on over there.", "Susan Ring", "I would say from a competitive perspective, we're still seeing that the market is extremely competitive and obviously we have had some movement in terms of competitors with AEGON withdrawing in June and obviously we had Zurich come into the market as a new entrant back in April. But with regard to the core competitors that we've been competing against, that hasn't really changed and so it has been aggressive, it's still intense.", "So what we've been really doing ourselves is making sure that obviously retain our pricing discipline, but that we're really focused on growth both from a sales and also particularly from a persistency perspective to ensure that we hold on to the business we've got.", "With regards to benefit ratios, our projection is still that they will trend gradually upwards into sort of the early '60s and we have seen in the first half of this year as you're aware lower inceptions although in the second quarter whilst so it's still favorable, at the end of the quarter we did start to see those trends slightly upwards. So we are expecting inception rates to normalize over time.", "We haven't seen any significant impact with regard to our recovery levels, so we're still expecting those to remain strong, but we do expect that the benefit ratio will trend back up after our inception rates normalize and we cease to see the favorable impact that we have seen within the first half, and there are some signs that that is starting to happen. So we would expect to see the benefit ratio turned up slightly.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay. If I may, just quickly, Susan, maybe you can say those numbers again that you've written 20.7 million pounds of group life out of AEGON, but you've only recognized something like 1.8, can you give us those numbers again?", "Susan Ring", "Yes, certainly. With regard to the AEGON block that we've moved since they withdrew from the market, we have written 22 million pounds worth of sales, that includes both group income protection but also group life. The majority of it is group life and with regard to the sales that we've credited so far within our results in the second quarter we put through about 1.3 to 1.4 million pounds worth of sales.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates", "So we're going to see a nice up in the third quarter?", "Susan Ring", "So we will start to see that come through in the third and fourth quarter and we are hoping that obviously it will be written and transferred across by the end of the year. But it will impact third and fourth.", "Tom Watjen", "Steven, just to clarify that, the reason that you've got a differential there is that latter part, the 18 million pounds to 20 million pounds it has not been recognized yet. It is not effective yet. And so when those cases actually go effective that's when we would report that as effective sales.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Randy Binner at FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "Just a quick question looking to the sectors, the business sectors you write group long-term disability and health care education public sector, those areas together are maybe more in the third of the book. And I think historically you've seen lower claim incidence there and just curious about if incidence in those areas has changed at all as they become, I guess, a little less defensive given public finances at the state level, and then also if you're seeing any pressure on sales there or increased competition?", "Tom White", "Kevin, you want to take a first stab at that.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yeah, good morning, Randy. No, we haven't really seen any change at all in incidence by industry sector. Not only was incidence very stable on the line of business this quarter, but it was pretty stable across all industry sectors and we always get competitive volatility sector by sector depending on what type at the moment, I wouldn't say that is anything significant. I think there is no discernible changes I think in the marketplace around health care or education or anything like that.", "Tom Watjen", "Randy do you want to add to that, too, because you still have a big public sector block?", "Randy Horn", "Yes, really very, very constant on our side as well, Randy, not seeing any upticks in claim incidence and our persistency has always been very strong in our public sector blocks and with our educator business specifically we're not seeing any changes in that either. So far so good there.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jeff Schuman at KBW.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "Just wondering if you could help us what seemed to be maybe some conflicting currents in the U.S. market. Susan, of course, talked about AEGON withdrawing from the U.K. based on capital concerns. Obviously, in the U.S. we have companies that are still capital constrained although pressure on the industry has eased a bit, but we've also seen just terrible growth numbers and I think Kevin talked about maybe expecting companies to compete pretty strongly for growth in the second half, so how does this sort out? Which is more geared at this point, growth or capital? And how does the competitive bottom line sort of shake out of that?", "Tom Watjen", "I'll comment and maybe ask Kevin and Randy to add to it. I think what you're maybe getting at, Jeff, is if there's some excess of the marketplace in the U.K., why aren't we seeing the same issue here in the U.S.? I think maybe that's the root of your --", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "I think that's part of it and also, once again, if companies are constrained, even if they stay in the market, they might compete less aggressively rather than more aggressively, I guess.", "Tom Watjen", "On the first point, I think we get down to what's our view of consolidation. I think we always view that this business we're in tends to be one that ultimately consolidates and I don't want to predict too precisely, but I do think that we will see some consolidation in our business as people go through the exercise of deciding where their capital should be, where their returns are going to be the best and where their key franchises are they have to protect in this environment.", "But I would say that since people have raised a lot of capital in our sector here the first half of the year, my guess is most people in our industry are kind of absorbing all of that and may be we will think strategically about this question maybe a little further down the road.", "So I guess none of us are expecting big amounts of consolidation probably between now and the end of the year. What might likely may happen though, as Kevin alluded to in his comments is people may find themselves behind plans, may find themselves having to push and be a little more aggressive. That happens by the way all the time. It just happens maybe with a little more intensity in an economic environment like this, but I think, Kevin, that's really what you're referring to is when people get a little behind, this product line actually is probably performing a little better than other product lines some people have in their portfolio of business. And, therefore, may push a little harder in this business.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Absolutely. I think if you look at our competitors, a lot of them are just pure plays. They're complicated multi-line companies and they need to protect their customer relationships, their broker relationships, they have to make sure they continue to finance the quality and depth of their sales force.", "And as Tom mentioned, some of these products lines that may be lagging in sales, they still generate reasonable margins for those companies, so ramping up sales in order to protect all those relationships and still generate a return, it wouldn't be surprising if I think for companies to be more aggressive in the second half given the shortfalls in the first half.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Watjen for any additional closing remarks.", "Tom Watjen", "Let me thank all of you for taking the time for joining us this morning.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tom White", "Great. Thank you, Clayton. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2009 analysts and investor conference call for Unum.", "I'd like to remind you that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact.

Participating in this morning's conference call are Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO, as well as the heads of our three core operating segments, Kevin McCarthy, Randy Horn, and Susan Ring.", "And now I would like to turn the call over to Unum's President and CEO, Tom Watjen. Tom?", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning. I would like to begin this morning's comments \u2013 call with a few observations on the third quarter before I turn it over to Tom White for a review of our operating results and then to Rick McKenney for his comments on the quarter and a review of our capital management investment portfolio results.", "The third quarter was another good one for our company with a continuation of many of the business trends that we had been having over the past several quarters. Let me touch on a few highlights. First, excluding net realized after-tax investment gains, we reported $0.64 per share in operating income for the third quarter, in line with last year's third quarter. Operating results in Unum US were especially strong with earnings increasing 15%, which was driven by a continued profit improvement in our group disability line of business.", "While the soft economy and continued high levels of unemployment continued to put pressure on our ability to grow the top line as it does with all of our businesses, Unum US' profitability continues to improve. Colonial Life' third quarter results were also solid with operating earnings growing 6% with just over 3% premium growth and generally stable risk experience. Finally, our Unum UK results were below our expectations with operating earnings on a local currency basis declining by 27% relative to a year ago. The decline is primarily attributable to lower premium income which we will discuss further in a few moments.", "Second, despite the difficult economy, I'm encouraged by our sales results in our target markets. Specifically, we saw an 11% increase in Unum US' core market sales, 3.4% growth in sales of Colonial Life and a nice rebound in Unum UK sales. In addition, case count growth continues to be strong across all of our businesses, especially in the smaller end of the market. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see some premium pressure as employers are not generally adding new benefits in this environment, and in many cases, the level of employment with our existing customers is down. We are likely to continue to face these headwinds into 2010 as well.", "Third point is the investment portfolio continues to perform extremely well and the quality remains very high. As a result of the significant change in the interest rate environment, including rates and spreads, the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio now stands at a net unrealized gain of 2.2 billion dollars, compared to a net unrealized loss of $2.5 billion just six months ago. And finally we continue to build financial capability with continued strong statutory earnings and the opportunistic debt financing we did late in the third quarter, further strengthening our capital position. Rick McKenney will provide greater detail on our capital position but you can expect that we will comfortably exceed the 2009 targets for holding company liquidity and risk based capital.", "In summary, I feel very good about our third quarter results and our position as we move ahead. Our core operating segments continue to perform well and we are general meeting our expectations. Our solid risk results today reflect the plans we implemented over the past few years that included disciplined pricing, underwriting and risk reduction. Sales momentum in our target market remains generally positive with solid growth in our core group market. Our strong value proposition and a broad array of product choices supported by our commitment to service is serving as well in the marketplace.", "While the economic conditions may continue to adversely affect premium growth, I can assure you, we will remain disciplined and we will not be (inaudible) for growth. Our investment portfolios continue to perform very well in this environment. And so last but not least, our financial position is excellent. We continue to build financial flexibility. Our excess capital remains a valuable asset, especially in this uncertain economic environment.", "Now I will turn the call over to Tom White who will provide more detail on the operating results in the third quarter. Tom?", "Tom White", "Great. Thanks Tom. Net income for the third quarter was $221.1 million or $0.66 per diluted common share compared to net income of $108 million or $0.32 per diluted common share last year. Included in the results for the third quarter of 2009 are net realized after-tax investment gains of $9.5 million or $0.02 per diluted common share compared to losses of $108.9 million or $0.32 per diluted common share a year ago. These amounts include the impact of the embedded derivative and a modified coinsurance arrangement which resulted in a third quarter 2009 realized after-tax investment gain of 28.9 million compared to a $44.1 million after-tax loss a year ago.", "Net realized after-tax investment losses related to sales and write-downs of investments were $19.4 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to losses of 64.8 million in the year ago quarter. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $211.6 million for this quarter or $0.64 per diluted common share compared to 216.9 million or $0.64 per diluted common share in the year ago quarter.", "Looking at the operating results for our operating segments, in total Unum US operating income increased by 14.9% to $197.1 million in the third quarter. Within Unum US, the group disability line reported another strong quarter with income up 37% to $75 million. We continue to see improvement in the benefit ratio which declined to a 85.3% in the third quarter compared to 87% in the second quarter of this year and 89.3% in the year ago quarter.", "A number of factors continue to drive this improvement, including the ongoing shift in our block of business to more core market business and less large case business as well as the shift to more stable industries and away from traditionally economically sensitive industries, a generally consistent rate of claim recoveries and net favorable claims experience, and also the ongoing adherence to pricing disciplines, particularly in the large case business.", "Paid claim incidents rate in our group long term disability line were slightly higher this quarter relative to the third quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009 experience but the average size of the new claims was lower and therefore the financial impact of these claims was minimal. The higher claims were largely from traditionally non-economically sensitive sectors of the economy, so we believe it is normal quarterly volatility rather than a trend related to the economic environment. Also our STD or short-term disability claims experience was also somewhat higher this quarter than in the second quarter of 2009.", "Moving to the group life and AD&D line, operating income declined slightly to $50 million in the third quarter compared to $50.9 million in the year ago quarter, primarily driven by lower premium income which declined by 2% and a stable benefit ratio of 70.3% in the third quarter this year compared to 70.4% in the year ago quarter. The supplemental and voluntary line third income \u2013 third-quarter income grew 9% to $72.1 million. The recently issued individual disability line and long-term care line both reported improved earnings over year ago, while the operating results in the voluntary benefit line was marginally lower.", "Reported sales for Unum US declined by 7.1% in aggregate. Core market sales for our group lines which include LTD, STD, and group lines showed continued positive momentum increasing 11% for the third quarter and 15.6% for the first nine months of 2009. Sales in the large case market for these lines declined 3.3% in the third quarter. The mix of our core market and large case sales thus far in 2009 is 66% core market and 34% large case which is a very positive trend. The supplemental and voluntary lines struggled this quarter with a combined sales declined of 21.9%. Voluntary benefits had a sales decline of 17.8%. Case count growth remains positive in the voluntary benefits line which increased 24% relative to last year which reflected a continuation of the good level of activity in the under 500 life market.", "Moving to our UK results, before tax operating earnings in this segment declined from $92.5 million in the year ago quarter to 58.7 million in the third quarter of this year. The decline in the value of the British pound relative to the dollar which came from a $1.89 third quarter last year to $1.64 in the third quarter of this year continued to negatively impact translated results for the Unum UK segment. The underlying operating performance was also weaker with before tax operating earnings in local currency declining 27% to 35.8 million pounds from 49 million pounds a year ago.", "The primary driver of the lower operating earnings was the decline in premium income which was 103.4 million pounds this quarter compared to 118.6 million pounds in the year ago quarter and 111.6 million pounds in the second quarter of 2009. Basically the same factors that we see in the US are impacting the premium income in Unum UK, that is higher than expected levels of lapses, somewhat in the large case block; secondly a reduction in the existing block due to companies downsizing reductions and salaries and lower sales to existing accounts. And then third, the lower level of sales and lower persistency that we experienced during 2008, which reduced the size of our in force block relative to the prior year.", "Also impacting the earnings in the segment this quarter was a return to what we would call a more normal level of claim incidents from the extraordinarily favorable trends we experienced in the first half of 2009. The benefit ratio in Unum UK declined to 50.2% in the third quarter compared to 52.4% a year ago and 54.4% in the second quarter. This is largely driven by the impact of lower inflation on claim reserves associated with group LTD policy containing an inflation linked benefit increase feature. The offset is reported in the net investment income line where lower net investment income results from a reduction in inflation, which reduced the return on bonds for the interest income is linked to UK inflation.", "The impact this quarter was approximately 9 million pounds for both lower net investment income and reserves which would result in a benefit ratio of approximately 59% if you adjust for this. Third-quarter sales for UK were quite strong, you will see increasing 63% in local currency. We continue to benefit from the exit of our competitive in the UK group risk market and the movement of some of that business to us. We also expect to see strong fourth quarter sales as we gain this business in the open market.", "Moving to Colonial Life and concluding our core operations, Colonial Life's operating results remain strong with operating income of $70.4 million, a 6% increase over the third quarter of last year. Premium income in this segment grew by 3.4% while the benefit ratio of 48.2% this quarter was slightly higher than a year ago result reflecting a higher level of paid cancer claims. The third-quarter margin remains quite favorable at 27.8% against the third quarter of 2009.", "Despite the difficult sales environment, sales at Colonial Life increased 3.4% in the third quarter. Many of the same trends we have discussed in recent quarters continued this quarter with favorable new account growth. Our new accounts increased 16.7% over a year ago and new account sales increased by 10.9% while sales to existing accounts remain challenging with the decline this quarter of 9/10 of a percent. This level of sales to existing accounts while is lower year-over-year does mark an improvement from the trend in the first half of the year. We also saw favorable sales growth of 19% in the public sector market which is a very important market for Colonial Life which produces about 23% of total sales against (inaudible).", "Recruiting continues to remain strong with growth in new rep contracts up 45% this quarter and 31% on a year-to-date basis. The average weekly producers increased 7.6% in the third quarter. The individual disability closed block pretax earnings improved to $7.2 million from $2.5 million a year ago. The interest adjusted loss ratio was stable at 81.6% this quarter while premium income declined 6.7% and net investment income declined slightly by 2.6%.", "Finally the corporate and other segments recorded an operating loss of $13.7 million compared to $7.2 million in the year ago quarter. Expenses are higher in the segment reflecting approximately $10 million of incremental quarterly pension cost. Interest expense was reduced to $24.1 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to $28.2 million in the third quarter of last year.", "So with that review of our operating results, I will turn the call over to Rick McKenney.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Tom. As you heard in the overview of our operating results, the trends we experienced in our businesses this quarter remain consistent with those of the past several quarters. We continue to see that consistency playing out in multiple areas of our business and across each of our segments. Let me break it down into the key drivers of profit.", "First we saw a generally steady risk experience across the business. We did see a slightly higher level of volatility in this quarter's claims in the US disability business. It is something we will continue to monitor closely but not something we see as a trend at this point. And the benefit ratio continued to improve. Risk results in the UK in terms of claim incidents and recovery trends were generally in line with expectations.", "I would note that although this quarter's results were not as favorable, there is a very positive trends, and margins we experienced in the first half of this year, they are strong and improved from a year ago. And then when you take Colonial Life steady results, the overall picture continues to be favorable. Second, we have not been immune to the environment on the top line. We have had good sales but we have seen premiums decline in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis by 3% after adjusting for currency. The environment is causing some clear global headwinds for the growth of the benefits business.", "In the quarter, this is most pronounced in our UK business, which is feeling the effects of earlier lower sales and persistency, and challenges from the economy, such as downsizing and salary reductions. These elements are true to some degree across each of our businesses and will persist until we see improvement in the economy. Third, underlying our consistency has been the performance of our investment portfolio. This was strong in this quarter reflecting the ongoing rally in the fixed income markets and the rapid tightening of corporate bond trends across the rating spectrum. Corporate bonds compose the majority of our investments.", "For reference, the spread of the Lehman \u2013 the Barclays US Investment Grade Credit Index has tightened back to 198 basis points at September 30 compared to 275 basis points at June 30 and all the way from 493 basis points at year-end 2008. With this tightening, the net unrealized position of our fixed maturity securities portfolio has now swung to a net unrealized gain of 2.2 billion compared to a net unrealized loss of 2.3 billion at year-end.", "With the rebound in the credit markets, the company's book value per share likewise rebounded. Book value per share was $24.86 at September 30, a sequential increase of 10% from June 30, and 23% from a year ago. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, book value per share was $24.06 as of September 30. With the continued tightening of credit spreads in the third quarter, it is not surprising that our new money yields declined somewhat from the levels of late 2008 and the first half of 2009. Our new money yields adjusted of hedges in the third quarter was 6.75% compared to 6.82% in the second quarter and 7.46% in the first quarter. The overall portfolio yield has remained relatively stable throughout the year and the net interest rate reserve margins for Unum US group disability continued to widen.", "Finally, in the third quarter, our reported net realized investment losses excluding the embedded derivative gain of 29 million after tax totaled 19.4 million after-tax. The 19.4 million realized loss this quarter compares to 40 million in the second quarter and 57 million in the first quarter and clearly continued the trend of declining realized losses. As we look forward, some level of realized losses is likely to persist, so the amount we believe will be manageable relative to the size of our investment portfolio and our capital position.", "Moving to capital management, in addition to the strong gap [ph] in earnings this quarter, our statutory earnings in our traditional US life insurance companies were also solid, with third quarter 2009 after-tax operating earnings of 137 million, which brings 9 month after-tax operating earnings to almost 500 million. This level of statutory earnings continues to drive very positive momentum in our capital management metrics and overall financial strength and flexibility. Additionally, a highlight of the third quarter was the issuance of $350 million of senior debt in the last week of the quarter. Over the past 24 months, we had significantly reduced our leverage which was 18.5% at the end of the second quarter. We have expected debt issuance as part of our capital management strategy and with the rally in the credit market over the past several months, we have launched an offering late September. We are pleased with the execution and demand for the seven year note which fits well in our debt stack and priced at just over 7%.", "With this financing, the companies leverage ratio excluding the securitization related debt and equity is around 21% where we are comfortable and we don't have any debt maturing under 2011. When you think of debt issue and the continuation of strong statutory earnings, we are revising expectations for year-end 2009 capital position. We now believe that risk based capital for our traditional US insurance companies will be approximately 360% at year-end, surpassing our expectations of 330% to 335% and our estimated 3Q RBC ratio of 340%.", "Holding company liquidity is expected to be at around 900 million, well ahead of our expectations of 750 million, and ahead of our current level of 864 million. And finally, leverage will be around 21% in line with our prior expectations. We still believe today's economic environment dictates a strong financial position and we believe that we are in excellent shape. I hope you'll join us at our investor briefing next week when we take you through our plans for 2010. To sum up, all in all, it was a good quarter for the company. Despite the difficult business and economic conditions, we continue to perform well and build on our strong financial platform.", "Now, I will turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks Rick. While this continues to be a difficult business and economic environment, I'm pleased with our results and extremely proud of the work our people continue to do in serving our customers and delivering on our plans. As you've heard from our comments, the recession is having an impact on our ability to grow our top line. Both here in the US and the UK, the rise in unemployment over the past several quarters has impacted the natural growth rate of our business. Importantly though, we see little evidence that employers are eliminating plans and are encouraged by our accounts growth and healthy case persistency. These position us well for future top line growth when the employment picture improves.", "While the economy has had its greatest impact on our premium growth, we are also closely watching for any other factors, which could impact our profitability, such as low interest rates, expense trends, and claim incidents trends. Since I know you will ask, we have not seen any meaningful increase in claims incidence, but we are seeing some volatility in claim incidents in some parts of our business, and we will certainly be keeping a close watch on this.", "As we have said many times on these calls, we are not immune to the effects of the recession, but with our diversified business mix, focus on profitable growth and solid balance sheet and capital position, we are very well positioned. While we have a great deal of confidence in our position and ability to execute our plans, we are still very cautious on the general environment which impacts our approach to business planning and capital strategy for 2010. Again as Rick said, something we'll have to discuss in further detail at our annual investor meeting to be held in New York next Monday, the 9th of November.", "Finally, with respect to guidance, we continue to expect operating earnings per share for 2009 to fall within our previous guidance range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share. However, with the top line pressures we are seeing, the lower half of that range is more likely than the upper half of that range.", "Operator, this completes our formal comments, and so let us move to question and answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator instructions). The first question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Langen-McAlenney.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen-McAlenney", "Good morning, Tom. I am probably over analyzing the exact words you used, but in your concluding remarks, I think you said the economy is beginning to \u2013 or the recession is beginning to have an impact on the company. It is sort of ironic that this would be in a quarter where GDP was up 3.5%, so I suspect you are in kind of a cynical camp on that number. But specifically the question is, how much do you think you're going to lag the economic recovery? It sounds like they are just beginning to have an impact on the economy in this quarter suggests that there is a lag, because the economy has been weak for a while?", "Tom Watjen", "I think, Bob, it is a good question. I think when we look at the impact the economy has on the company, I want to clarify. I think we think it is mostly around the employment picture and I think that is where as you look at the unemployment rate continuing to move up, you look at the \u2013 certainly we are seeing some slowing in the deterioration in the employment picture, but still I think there is \u2013 the outlook that most economists have for 2010 continues to offer relatively slow recovery in the employment picture, and I think that is what you hear reflected in the management comments today.", "I think that is something we have been watching or I think if you look back to the comments we made the last couple of quarters, I think we have talked about the premium pressure. Really the premium pressure is really coming just because of the employment picture. So again I think I like you to see some great signs that the general economy is improving and whether it is economic growth or some of the trade things but on the other hand I think our business is most focused around the employment picture.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen-McAlenney", "Thank you. And my follow-up is if you execute your plan and it seems like you've surpassed your capital goals at the holding company, when is the soonest as you think you can consider another buyback recognizing the rating agencies are a huge wild card?", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, we will talk more about this I think next week, Bob. I think just at this point I think again I want to clarify, we feel very confident in our company's business plans, strategy, our ability to execute that plan strategy. I think any hesitancy we have about sort of putting any work to \u2013 any capital to work in a share buyback comes more about the concerns about the general economic outlook. And so I don't want to put a time up there except to say that we were very fortunate to have the capital position we have. As Rick give you some of the guidance for year end, we are expecting to be even in a stronger position than we expected to be. Our operations continue to perform very well. But again I think it is our view at this particular point, this is a time to continue to accumulate capital, and accumulate capital to begin to sense the things that are important to our business like the unemployment picture begins to show some improvement. And I think that is the mindset I think we're going to be bringing to this as we move into 2010.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen-McAlenney", "Thanks. I'll follow-up with you next week on this. Thanks.", "Tom Watjen", "Okay, thanks Bob.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Colin Devine with Citigroup.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Good morning.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning Colin.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "A couple of questions, I guess first just following upon the capital on there, Tom, with the cash building up pretty rapidly, and obviously we generated a fair amount of cash flow on your own annually. You talked about just being I guess careful conservative, is there some thought maybe given the strengthening the capital position of the insurance businesses even further, obviously you want your ratings back, and it seemed to me something like a 400% raise might make that statement. Second question, I think we'd all appreciate just an update from Kevin and probably Susan on how the sort of the renewal season is going and pricing trends and just what we will get more next week. And that finally Randy, you know Colonial sales, I though were just extremely strong, certainly in very stark contrast to the disappointment we saw at AFLAC in the same sector. I guess what are you guys doing right because clearly your biggest competitor is struggling mightily?", "Tom Watjen", "Three important points, Colin. Let's get started in the capital and I will Rick to pick up on your question.", "Rick McKenney", "Ye, thanks Colin. I think it is important to go back to what you mentioned which is the strong free cash flow generated out of our statutory earnings. That gives us a lot of flexibility to channel those earnings into the direction we want. Over the past years, that's been building up our holding company levels, and we have done that. I think we will probably slow that down and you will see us building up in the insurance companies on a natural basis, and that would be reflected in the year end forecast of around 360. So you will see those RBC levels go up, we don't really need more cash at the holding company at this point, and the strength of our insurance companies will be the focus as well.", "Tom Watjen", "And maybe just shifting to market conditions in both the Unum Us and the Unum UK business, Kevin, you want to pick up on the question around renewals and the market conditions?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Thanks, Tom. Good morning Colin.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi, Kevin.", "Kevin McCarthy", "The real program for 2010 will be about the same size, slightly larger than it was in 2009. The large majority of those renewals, particularly in the larger case sector have been offered already. The average increase is quite small, sort of in the 1% to 2% range and I think that reflects the fact that we have gotten through sort of everything that we needed to get through in terms of rebalancing the portfolio the last three or four years. And the real problem is really more about just being disciplined with the way in which we continue to manage that in force block. And so far, our persistency remains solid. There is nothing out there that indicates that we are going to have anything that is going to shake us up on the persistency side.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks Kevin. Susan, you want to pick up on the market environment that you are facing in the UK?", "Susan Ring", "Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Tom. Thanks Colin. And yes, it remains a very competitive environment here in the UK, but we still believe that we are very strongly positioned and still remain a recognized market leader and all the metrics indicate that we are staying there. And so we are very focused, very disciplined, and certainly very focused on renewing our existing block. And in terms of our renewal program and (inaudible) is still saying that there is pressure on existing clients, with regards to salaries or lack of salary inflation, and also membership pressure. So it still seeing shrinkage of some of the schemes that we hold. And in particular, as you are aware, the financial services sector, the financial sector, the whole actually has been under some pressure. So that's in particular where we have seen it come through. But we are maintaining pricing discipline and ensuring that we keep our margins healthy and high.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "And I am showing \u2013 I know I can relate to the towering inflation pressure. With respect to the strong sales you are talking about for the fourth quarter, how much can that buffer the earnings impact of the slower premium growth over the next year?", "Susan Ring", "You want me to take that, Colin?", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, please. Susan, go ahead.", "Susan Ring", "Yes, sure. I mean we still expect \u2013 obviously we had a strong sales quarter in the third quarter and as you can see from the metrics, we were sort of about 63% invested at the same quarter last year and showing growth on the second quarter this year. And we still expect sales to be stronger in the fourth quarter and that certainly could help improve our premium position and help offsets some of the evolution that we have seen in our existing block.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thanks.", "Tom Watjen", "So maybe just moving on last but not least, Randy, just the success you've had at Colonial?", "Randy Horn", "Yes, thanks Tom. Good morning, Colin. Yes, as a backdrop, the entire industry has seen pressure on existing case sales due to the economy. We have been no exception to that but we did see nice improvement in the third quarter. The existing accounts sales tend to be somewhere around 65% of our total sales, so that is a very important issue for us. We have instituted a lot of programs to help our agents get out and visit existing customers and talk to them about our various offerings and again seen very good improvement there.", "Our new account activity as, Tom White and Tom Watjen referred to earlier continues to be very strong, good double-digit growth there. And I think overall, Colin, we just continue to see a nice growth rate in our entire agency system. As you know we have been very focused on new rep recruiting and district manager recruiting over the last several years, starting to see that pay off at this point. I think a good indicator is that of those strong new account sales that we had in the quarter, over a third of those were from reps recruited in the last couple of years. So again good growth in the system, good focus, and we're seeing pretty good results at this point.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks Colin.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Thank you very much. I'm not sure if you have this level of detail but I was curious you had mentioned how employment levels have been something of a headwind, have you been able to perceive any difference in the core versus the last case customers?", "Tom Watjen", "To be honest, Kevin, do you think there is any reaction to Mark's question?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes, I can't think of anything sort of that pops out (inaudible) looking at metrics, Mark, that would indicate that kind of difference. The only thing I would say is that the large case market is basically fully penetrated and so the pressure \u2013 excuse me, the pressure in terms of premiums comes from those large customers having declining employment levels, which is pressuring our top line, our earned premium and our natural growth, if you will. And the fact that maybe deferring decisions about what we call MBOC [ph] or upgrades and benefits. So we see that in the larger case sector. In the smaller case sector, on the other hand, you know it is not fully penetrated, and we continue to see really, really solid new account growth. Core premium was up 11%, I think small voluntary cases were up 24%. Case count for the year is up overall. So we are not seeing sort of the same dynamic.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Yes, thanks for the color. And then the benefit associated with lower inflation, is that all captured in 3Q if we look at 4Q assuming no change in underlying inflation, is there any continuing effect in the fourth quarter, any benefit from that, or is that all captured in 3Q?", "Tom Watjen", "Go ahead, Rick.", "Rick McKenney", "I think it is captured in 3Q. And when you look at that, our proxies reflect that in the reserves. So it would have reflected what we saw in the inflation movement, the corresponding reduction in the benefits, as well as in the investment. This is matched up (inaudible). It would be reflected in the third quarter if it stays flat. Fourth-quarter inflation you wouldn't expect carry through on that element.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Thank you.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Mark Finkelstein with FPK.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK", "Good morning.", "Tom Watjen", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK", "Three I think quick questions. One is back to Colin's renewals question, Kevin, I'm just curious, are you seeing anything different in the buying habits of employers of group products, whether it is an extent of coverage, et cetera?", "Kevin McCarthy", "You know I think there is pressure on employers in terms of their employee benefits pressure, that is coming from the economy. It is also coming from sort of the healthcare side of the equation. And that of course is what drove us to invest in our Simply Unum platform and continued to invest in our voluntary products portfolio. And as we have introduced that Simply Unum initiative during the course of the last 12 months, we continue to see an increase in the number of purchases of group benefits to also buy voluntary coverage along with it, particularly in the smaller end of the market. And so in that sense, I think there is a slow but gradual shift towards maybe packaging of benefits and sharing cost, between employers and employees within the benefits program, and that is consistent with the strategy that we have been investing in.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK", "Okay. I guess back to the claim activity, I guess I understand the comments around incidents being a slight up tick which are characterizing as kind of random fluctuation, but the other side of that is recoveries looked better, offsets looked better, would you characterize that as normal volatility as well, or is there anything different you are going in whether it is reserving or what have you that is part of that answer?", "Kevin McCarthy", "On the recovery side, we are not doing anything different, and it is not in really anything reflective of anything we are doing on the reserving side. I think we are seeing just continued good solid performance in our benefits operations area. And I think on the offset side, the same thing is true. Although there also maybe positive effects showing up from Social Security, maybe improving more claims in recent days, and also there was a cost of living adjustments during the course of this year in Social Security as well. So that probably benefits us to some small degree on the opposite side. But no I think it is just, I think it is just diligent performance.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK", "Okay. And then back to the capital management question, I guess, I understand the comments, I understand the rationale of wanting to be patient or still in a somewhat volatile market, but I guess the one thing I struggle a little bit with is why not take a little bit of where we're at and top up the pension plan before year end? And I guess what I am thinking about is, you know it looks like theoretically you have got call it, 1.2 billion of capital margin today, you know you're topping up the pension plan before year end, is obviously rating agency family, cosmetically it shows a better position. I guess why not take a little bit of that, I think maybe we said around $200 million on the prior quarter call, why not do that before year end?", "Tom Watjen", "Rick?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes, so as we look at the pension in terms of how it has come down and the funding status in the course of the year, we have funded part of that earlier in the year. We're looking at potential addition by the end of the year. But we don't have a need to fund that completely right away. We do see some of those investments we have will come back over time and we like to take a little bit longer term view to it but not to say that we wouldn't put some more money in the pension before year and adjust our plans over the next couple of years. But we don't have a need to completely fund that up-to-date, watch it continue to increase, and have capital then effectively be within the pension and unable to access it.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK", "Okay, all right. Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.", "Mike Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks, guys. It's Michael Zaremski filling in for Tom actually. Two questions, so spread tightening has been great for book value obviously. Some competitors have talked about lower new money yields pressuring margins though. I believe in your prepared remarks you talked about your reserve margin widening which seemed a little bit kind of intuitive, so if you can give us some color on that issue?", "Tom Watjen", "Tom, you want to take that one?", "Tom White", "Sure. Michael, I think what we're seeing is the \u2013 well, first of all just to put numbers around it, we saw the, this is just for Unum US LPT block of business that that net interest reserve margin widened from 87 basis points in the second quarter to about 91 basis point here in the third quarter. You're exactly right. New money yields have come down but I think where we are benefiting from is the fact that late last year, the early part of this year, those new money investments were so wide that it's just given us some nice momentum that will probably continue here for a couple of more quarters.", "So you know if you think about it, we have got a very large investment portfolio, 6 billion, $7 billion, and we're investing for that particular block of business. In real round numbers, maybe $100 million a quarter, something like that. So anyone quarter's new money yield aren't going to have a significant impact. And you really kind of need to think of it more on kind of a rolling say fourth quarter basis and again we are still benefiting from some of the nice high yields. Now what we look at is, we project all this forward, and given where we are with the discount rate on new claim incurrals being quite a bit lower than the aggregate that we used, we're in good shape. We are \u2013 that 91 basis points I referenced, we target somewhere in the 50 basis points to 60 basis points range. So there is quite a bit of cushion there that we could potentially eat into over many, many quarters before we would be in a position to need to make any adjustments to new claim incurrals.", "Mike Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So what that \u2013 I guess this gets into my next question, I guess the cushion between you're saying of 50 toward your target of 91 bps, if I look \u2013 I don't if this has anything \u2013 sort of correlate with on a statutory basis prior year reserve development, so continues to look great, I think it was positive 69 million this quarter. I believe that's slightly a net number, I don't know if there were any particularly big positives or negatives in there on a statutory basis or if this cushion\u2026", "Tom White", "Mike, I don't know \u2013 there really weren't any unusual items in the statutory earnings. I think it is just a good solid quarter. And as Kevin referenced to when he was talking about operations, you know very good solid operating performance on the claims side and that leads into nice solid profitability.", "Mike Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, thank you guys.", "Tom Watjen", "Okay, thank you Michael.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hi thanks. Just back to the incidents thing, you made comments at one of the investor conferences in September that overall incidents and other claims trends for DI were not where they usually are relative to macro trends, most notably unemployment. So I hear the comments that you made that it is more a volatility issue rather than any kind of trends, but maybe just at a higher level, it would be nice to hear your view of kind of where you potentially saw this kind of volatility relative to past cycles, in particular as it relates to the unemployment rate?", "Tom Watjen", "Kevin, you want to take that? I guess maybe a good place to start is just reminding everyone about the mix shift that we have been through because I think in the past certainly we saw greater volatility and incidents amongst our large case block of business and obviously we have been through substantial change in strategy there.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Right. That's a gentle way [ph], Tom. I think if you remember last year, at the investor day, we modeled out sort of the idea that we might have a 5% or so up tick in incidents during the course of this year. And we haven't really seen that. And we saw a little bit of volatility during the third quarter although most of that was actually in July. And as I look at incidents, as it emerged though the rest of the third quarter, and into the beginning of the fourth quarter, it seems to have come right back to us an stabilized again.", "And I think the big difference for us as a company compared to prior recession is really two things. We are much more focused on mix of business by size as Tom said. I think Tom White mentioned that two thirds of our sales were in the core during the third quarter and that is a pretty consistent pattern over the last six, seven, eight quarters. And also we often talk about our diligence about industry mix as well and shifting our mix of business away from transportation, wholesale, retail, more recession sensitive industries, and towards healthcare, education, professional services, where at least in healthcare, employment has been fairly stable in comparison to other industries. And so just \u2013 I think our management of mix of businesses has been the most critical factor in keeping that incident line stable.", "Tom Watjen", "Maybe this is a teaser for investor day. I think we're going to into that in more depth by industry type actually this upcoming Monday.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, that is helpful. And then just maybe on new money yields, obviously the trend across the industry that new money yields are lower and so we've already seen that investment income line, just some color on kind of if there is any sort of shift in how you're looking at different asset classes on a new money basis and where you maybe see the best opportunities?", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, Randy, really no changes there. We are basically a corporate bond investor, you know the BBB, A range is kind of the sweet spot for us. I would say we're probably seeing maybe incrementally a little bit more opportunity in some commercial mortgage loans but that is really \u2013 one of the things we benefit on, I probably should have mentioned in my other answer was, we have done a fair amount of hedging over the years, and that we get benefit from that. And part of the reason for that program is because when we get into environments like this where treasuries are low, spreads coming in, you are heading that little incremental pickup from hedges certainly helps that new money yield, and you know probably adds 20 basis points, 25 basis points to a quarter's new money yield.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you Randy.", "Operator", "Next question comes from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Hi, good morning everybody. So I just want to go back to the capital management issue and I assume that next week there will be some more time spent on this. So I don't want to steal any of your thunder, but thinking about the 900 million target for cash and liquidity at the holding company, if you are at 360 RBC, maybe the RBC ratio needs to be higher, sustainable, going forward than it has been historically, but you can still sort of argue 500 million to 700 million of capital cushion at the life companies under that scenario. So you're sitting on a lot, the business overall appears to be trending down in terms of the size just given macro conditions, so capital needed to support growth seems to be lower than historical, I'm just wondering if you could give us maybe a little bit better sense of understanding the caution on the outlook, macro outlook, how long would you expect to sort of maintain that extra cushion?", "Tom Watjen", "Rick, you want to pick up on this?", "Rick McKenney", "Sure. And we will talk about it in a fair amount of detail next week as well but not to delay to that, there isn't really a timeframe. We're evaluating it on a daily basis what the economy is looking like. This is a cautious stance and we've got a fair amount of capital. So we're not going to put a timeframe on it or anything we're going to do. We do have options and this flexibility doesn't give us options about where we put that capital. We will talk about more about what those options are but I think your numbers are right. We have a fair amount of capital cushion both at our insurance companies as well as at the holding company and will have to choose what to do with that over the course of the next 12 months to 18 months. I think what we said is just now isn't not that time.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay. Somewhat related, is there anything, are there any real opportunities out there from an M&A perspective?", "Tom Watjen", "John, I will pick up on that one. I mean we have always said our first focus is just taking our existing three businesses and investing heavily in them, especially now, and maybe some others don't have the ability to do so, just to continue to build up of our strengths in the marketplace. And so I just want to emphasize our first priority is just taking the three operations we have and continue to make them better. Having said that, we're going to \u2013 we certainly keep our eye open for acquisitions that may supplement the things we are doing in our three businesses. We obviously have the financial and capital wherewithal to do so, but we are awfully disciplined. It's got to \u2013 it would have to fit very nicely with the things we're doing, the risk would have had to be incredibly manageable, and so I would say at this particular point in time, there is not much out there. I mean we are looking, we continue the network to be sure that we have a chance to look at things that might work, but it is very slim pickings in terms of things that would be fitting the criteria that I admit are very high, but the criteria we set for an acquisition.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Fair enough, thank you.", "Tom Watjen", "Good, thanks John.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). Next question comes from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James and Associates.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013Raymond James and Associates", "Good morning. Just a couple of quickies here, going back to renewals on the group DI business, any change really in the trends vis-\u00e0-vis rate guarantee periods?", "Tom Watjen", "Kevin?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Good morning Steven. Not from our end at least in terms of rate guarantee periods, I think. You know we're watching the economy, we're happy with persistency, the improving persistency that we have on the back. We think the block is stable which is why our rate increases stance is pretty flat. We have seen some activity more on the sales side in the marketplace and we have larger, longer rate guarantees have been offered by some competitors but not by us. We are not moving on that.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013Raymond James and Associates", "Ok, very good. And then just on the question of ratings migration as a corporate bond buyer, my assumption just sitting here looking at my screen day in and day would be that that has slowed down considerably?", "Tom Watjen", "Well, actually we have not seen a lot of ratings migration across our book of business in general, and certainly that would have slowed down (inaudible) but it is important to note that we did not see that much in the quality of our book and where we were over the course of time.", "Tom White", "Yes. Steven, it is Tom White. One thing that we will have on the investor day materials, we will break out that BBB exposure and what you will see there is the low end of the BBB, we had much less exposure. So I think there is a bit less risk of seeing downgrades because we tend to migrate to the upper end of that BBB range.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013Raymond James and Associates", "Okay, very good.

And now I'll turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?", "Thomas Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Our first quarter results were a good solid start to 2011 and are in line with our expectations. We continue to see generally stable risk experience particularly in Unum US, but also in Unum UK and Colonial Life, where we've seen some volatility in past quarters. Now Rick and Tom will talk in greater depth about our results for the quarter, but before they do, let me just touch on a few highlights that I think are noteworthy. ", "First, we have continued to report modest earnings per share growth, in part driven by our continued improvement in Unum US earnings as well as we also continue to benefit from our share repurchase programs. Second, we continue to maintain a very strong capital position, driven by our solid operating results and strong investment performance. Our weighted average risk-based capital ratio ended the first quarter at approximately 395% and our holding company's cash and marketable securities position is over $800 million. ", "Third, we are growing in most of our target markets. Unum US operation showed a 10% growth in new sales this quarter, with a 10% growth in voluntary benefits, 7% growth in Group LTD and 8% in Group Life. At Colonial, we continue to see modest growth in our core commercial markets, which remains the sweet spot for Colonial, with pressures certainly continuing to come from our sales in the public sector and the large-case marketplace, which we expect to continue to be choppy. ", "As we expected, given the pricing actions we're taking in the U.K. market, sales were down in the Unum UK, but we continue to have a very positive outlook about that marketplace. I might add that we have not seen any material change in the economic or competitive environment. We fully expect the environment obviously to improve at some point, but until it does, we remain committed to maintaining a disciplined strategy that has served us so well over the last several years. ", "Fourth, our investment portfolio remains in excellent shape, with strong credit quality and generally stable portfolio yield. As you know, our current Chief Investment Officer, David Fussell has been trying to retire for some time, and we are pleased that his replacement, Breege Farrell has joined the company as our Chief Investment Officer. We look forward to the contributions that Breege will be making with our already strong investment team. ", "Next, as I mentioned early, we continue to aggressively repurchase stock with a total of $224 million repurchased this quarter and $580 million repurchased over the past 12 months or about 8% of our outstanding shares.  Our capital strength and flexibility remains a significant asset. ", "The last point I wanted to make before turning things over to Tom is that the consistency we are experiencing in our results today is no accident, but the result of a several-year process to reinvent the company. Our strategy is grounded on maintaining a disciplined approach to the market with a focus on profitability, not just top line growth. As a result of our more disciplined targeted efforts, we have shifted our business mix to a better balance of core markets versus large-case businesses and a better spread of business, including a greater portion of our business coming from non-Disability lines. We have, therefore, not experienced the volatility that some others have had, and we remain committed to following this more disciplined and measured approach to the business. Now I'll ask Tom White to provide an overview of our operating results. Tom?", "Thomas White", "Great. Thanks, Tom. Net income for the first quarter was $225.4 million or $0.72 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $229.8 million or $0.69 per diluted common share last year. Included in the results for the first quarter of 2011, our net realized after-tax investment gains of $9.7 million or $0.03 per diluted common share compared to net realized after-tax investment gains of $16.5 million or $0.05 per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2010. Also included in the results for the first quarter of 2010 is a tax charge of $10.2 million or $0.03 per diluted common share related to the change in tax treatment of the Medicare subsidy for retiree health benefit plans. ", "Net realized after-tax investment gains for the first quarter of 2011 include an after-tax gain of $9.1 million, resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract compared to an after-tax gain of $11.9 million in the first quarter of 2010. ", "Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the first quarter this year are net realized after-tax investment gains of $600,000 related to sales and write-downs of investments compared to net after-tax gains of $4.6 million in the year-ago quarter. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $215.7 million or $0.69 per diluted common share compared to $223.5 million or $0.67 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter. ", "Turning to the operating segments. In total, Unum US operating income increased 5% to $209.1 million in the first quarter. Within Unum US, the Group Disability line reported another solid quarter from a risk perspective, though operating income declined 3% to $73.5 million, as net investment income declined primarily due to a decrease in the level of assets supporting this line of business. ", "Within the Group Life and AD&D line, operating income increased 3.1% to $52.8 million in the first quarter, with higher revenues offsetting a slight uptick in the benefit ratio. In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, first quarter income increased 14.7% to $82.8 million. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by a strong rebound in earnings from the Voluntary Benefits business line, which more than offset small declines in income from the recently issued Individual Disability line and the Long Term Care line. ", "Moving to Unum UK, operating income in this segment decreased 19.6% to $48.7 million in the first quarter of 2011. Operating income declined 21.9% in local currency. While premium income and local currency was down 1.8% in the first quarter, the benefit ratio was higher at 69.3% compared to 63.1%, reflecting the impact of higher inflation on claim reserves associated with policies containing an inflation linked benefit increase feature, a lower level of claim resolutions in Group LTD and lower premium income. And these items offset favorable Group LTD claim incidents relative to the year-ago quarter. ", "Concluding our core operations, Colonial Life experienced a 5.5% decline in operating income compared to last year, as premium income growth of 5.8% was offset by a higher benefit ratio. The Individual Disability Closed Block operating income was $9.9 million, first quarter of 2011 compared to $11.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The interest adjusted loss ratio was slightly higher at 84.7% this quarter compared to 84.5% in the year-ago quarter. This was driven primarily by lower premium income, which declined 5.5% due to the expected runoff of the Closed Block. Net investment income declined 4.6% due to a lower level of bond call premiums and a decrease in the level of assets. And finally, the Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $21.7 million compared to a loss of $8.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Interest expense increased to $34.9 million this quarter compared to $30.3 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the debt issuance from September of 2010. During the first quarter, we paid off debt maturity $225 million of our 7.65% senior notes, which were due March of 2011. This will result in a lower interest expense going forward. In addition, net investment income in the Corporate and Other segment was lower, driven primarily by lower income from private equity partnerships and our investments in low income housing tax credit partnerships. Our increased activity and tax credit partnerships over the past year contributed to a lower income tax rate in the first quarter compared to a year ago. So with that overview of the operating results, I'll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis of this quarter's results.", "Richard McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Tom. A few topics on the quarter which continues with our theme of stability. The areas I'm going to cover are the key profitability drivers for our business lines, a snapshot of our investment portfolio and an update on our capital position and actions. ", "Starting with a risk experience for our primary business lines, in Unum US, risk experience remain generally stable again this quarter. Our Group Disability performance remains favorable, with a benefit ratio declining slightly this quarter to just under 84%, which is down from the 84.2% we saw in the first quarter of last year and down sequentially from the fourth quarter. ", "New claim incidents continue to show some volatility, but was down slightly on a sequential basis relative to the fourth quarter, and it remains within a range of experience we've seen over the past several quarters. Claim recovery experience remains favorable in the first quarter. We have no reason to believe this will change, and we'll look for similarly consistent levels in the Group Disability benefit ratio in the future, and longer-term improvement in profitability will be driven from business mix shift to more core market and Voluntary Benefits. ", "For the Group Life and AD&D line, results were generally stable, with a slight uptick in mortality experience, producing a benefit ratio of 70% which is consistent with the year-ago quarter. ", "Looking to the Supplementary and Voluntary line, Voluntary Benefit earnings were strongly up this quarter, with favorable risk experience, especially in the Disability and Life lines of business. Premium income in this line was also quite strong, growing 11.2% year-over-year. The loss ratio in the recently issued Individual Disability line was slightly higher than the level of last year, but risk experience remained relatively stable. And finally, Long-term Care loss ratios were up year-over-year, but consistent with the fourth quarter. We continue to make good progress on the Individual Long-term Care rate increases that we began to file in the fourth quarter of last year and we filed in 46 states and the District of Columbia. So far, we have almost received 90% approval out of the 26 states that have reached a decision, and we continue to work with the remaining states. The additional premium from this rate increase will emerge over 2012 and 2013. ", "Moving to our Unum UK results. We are pleased with the stability in the financial performance for this segment in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, though comparisons to the year-ago quarter show earnings that were substantially lower as we've been discussing for several quarters. The benefit ratio for the first quarter was 69.3%, down from 71.7% in the fourth quarter, with favorable Group Long-term Disability claim incidents offsetting some higher Group Life mortality experience. ", "And finally, on Colonial Life, earnings and risk results for the first quarter were within our expected range, particularly for the Accident, Sickness and Disability line of business that produced adverse claims trends in the fourth quarter of 2010. The benefit ratio of 51.4% this quarter included less favorable risk results in the Accident, Sickness and Disability line due to a higher level of incurred claims, as well as slightly unfavorable mortality experience in the Life line of business and remains within our expected range of 50% to 52% for this segment. ", "Looking at the Premium line, first with Unum US, new sales in the segment showed some positive momentum for us in the first quarter, growing 10% in total with much of this growth coming from sales and new business to existing customers. On a product line basis, sales of Group Long-term Disability increased 7% and Group Life increased 8%. Within these group lines, our new case count sales were up 14% relative to last year, with particular strength in the smaller case size portion of the market. We continue to see strong new sales growth in the voluntary benefits marketplace, with premium sales this quarter increasing 10% and new case count growth of 21%. ", "At Unum UK, we continue to work to increase price in the U.K. Group risk market and are pleased our persistency, while lower than last year, is holding up well relative to our expectations. There is pressure on sales comparisons, which are down 29% compared to the year-ago quarter in local currency. This reflects the current competitive environment in the U.K. in conjunction with our pricing actions. In aggregate, we're seeing greater stability in our premium income line, which declined 1.8% to 104 million pounds in the first quarter. We are pleased with the progress that Jack McGarry and his team are making and implementing several important operational initiatives, including these programs related to renewals of existing in-force business.", "And finally, sales in the Colonial Life segment were softer this quarter, declining 4% after several consecutive quarters of growth. Breaking it down though, we continue to see positive momentum in the core commercial market segments which are cases with less than 1,000 lines. This area saw a 2% growth. However, sales were lower this quarter in 2 areas which can be more lumpy and that is the large case commercial market and the public sector market. ", "Our sales through existing accounts showed slight improvement compared to last year driven by favorable results from new sales into existing cases. And importantly, on the recruiting front, our new rep contracts grew by 7% in the quarter. ", "Turning attention to the balance sheet in the investment portfolio, we continue to see excellent results. The credit profile of our investment portfolio remains strong, with the net unrealized gain position in our fixed maturities securities portfolio at $3.3 billion at quarter end and our portfolio watch list showing no signs of deterioration in the first quarter. You should also note that since the end of 2009, in aggregate, we have booked a net gain in our results from the investment portfolio. ", "Although challenging, the low interest rate environment continues to have only marginal impact on the company. Our portfolio yields continue to hold up well, with our aggregate portfolio yield of 6.69%, down only 6 basis points over the past year. The yields on the various investment portfolios back in our product lines also showed similar stability. The yield net of our discount rate for Unum US Group LTD business remains in good shape at 97 basis points at March 31, and our discount rate is unchanged. ", "With these stable operating results, book value per share continues to grow, increasing 10% to $29.08 at, March 31, 2011. And looking at our capital, our statutory earnings started out the first quarter of 2011, in line with our expectations. Net income on a statutory basis for our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries in the first quarter was $142 million. This is a level consistent with our full year expectations that we believe will continue to drive strong growth in our capital position. ", "The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life companies was approximately 395% at quarter end toward the upper end of our target range for the year. And holding company cash and marketable securities totaled $816 million. ", "During the first quarter, we paid up $225 million of maturing debt and repurchased $224 million of our stock. As Tom mentioned in the last year, we have bought back roughly 8% of our shares, and we have remaining share repurchase authorization of $921 million at quarter end. And our leverage ratio finished the quarter at just under 21%. ", "Finally, as we look forward and given consistent results, we are confirming our previous outlook for 2011, which calls for operating earnings per share growth of 6% to 12%. Now I'll turn it back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Thomas Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm pleased with our overall results for the quarter, particularly the stable risk experience we saw across the company. Economic and competitive conditions remain challenging, but I believe that our strategy of focusing on consistent, profitable growth is the right one for our company. Our strong capital position and financial flexibility, combined with our strong business model, continue to position us well for the future.", "Now this completes our formal comments, and operator, let's move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Darin Arita, Deutsche Bank.", "Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank AG", "I have a question on the U.K.", "Thomas Watjen", "I'm sorry. We didn't catch the question. [Technical difficulty]", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Mark Finkelstein, Macquarie.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie Research", "On the U.K., sales were obviously challenged in the quarter. Persistency levels came in a little bit. And I guess what I'm interested in is I understand we want to be disciplined and profitability has gotten hurt over the last few quarters, and we're trying to correct that, which seems like the right answer. But I guess I'm just curious about how do you think about whether we have the right pricing in place. We've overshot a little bit. Just give us thoughts on that, please?", "Thomas Watjen", "Yes, Mark. That's a great question, and I think as you know, our company actually went through a very similar exercise with Unum US several years ago, So we have a fair amount of experience thinking about how to go through a repricing exercise and keeping track of the right variables and metrics as we do so, And maybe, Jack, I'll ask you just to respond specifically to what we're doing in the U.K. and what you're seeing so far.", "Jack McGarry", "I mean, clearly sales are challenged. It continues to be a pretty intense competitive environment. But the fact of the matter is, the way that these things are rolling out are very close to what we planned on, particularly around the persistency and renewal And I would remind you that kind of our historic persistency level has been in the high 80s rather than in the low 90s that we saw last year. It was slightly below that as a result of the renewal actions. But more importantly than that, we're getting the right actions we are asking for. We're clearly keeping the better performing cases.", "The cases that we're losing would tend to be unprofitable cases for us. And oftentimes in this environment, we're losing them at rates that are below the rates we were charging on in-force. So we're very encouraged about the margin improvement. We're also encouraged about the fact that the renewal program, as it's rolling out, is demonstrating our ability to sell value. We don't have to match the lowest rate in the marketplace to keep in-force business. In fact, we have a good margin there. So we feel like we're pretty much on track. It's very consistent with the experience we saw in the U.S. when we renewed business there, both from a persistency perspective, but also from a kind of margin improvement perspective in the difference between the things we're keeping and the things we're losing. So right now, we're watching it very closely. We're mindful of the impact on in-force premium, but we feel pretty good about where we are.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie Research", "So persistency is as you expected it to be with the rate increases?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie Research", "Just on the U.S. Group Long-term Disability, if I look at the only data that we had is what you put in the back of the supplement regarding reserve roll forwards. And this quarter was a really strong quarter for claim recovery patterns. I think it's  the highest that you've had, at least according to that chart, as a ratio at the beginning appeared reserves in history, basically with one quarter close. I guess how sustainable is this level of claim recoveries? And I mean, is essentially the claim recoveries just offsetting the higher incidence that we are seeing from the economy. I mean, can we expect this level of recoveries to continue, I guess it's the question?", "Thomas Watjen", "Kevin, can I ask you to take Mark's question?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Sure. It was an extraordinarily, I think, good quarter. We've had rock solid recovery patterns now, I think for, I don't know, 10, 12 quarters in a row. But this one was particularly strong, I think, both in terms of recovery count and also in the average size of reserves that were on those recoveries. And then and to some extent, that offset was... incidence levels certainly were higher relative to last year's first quarter, but lower relative to last year's third and fourth quarter and the average size of new submits was a little bit lower than we've been experiencing last year. So to some extent, within all that, you've got some volatility, particularly around average sizes of claims. I think, in terms of solid recovery performance, I expect it to be sustainable. I don't see any reason that, that's going to change, but it may not necessarily stay at the high level that we have in the first quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Darin Arita of Deutsche Bank.", "Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank AG", "Had one on the U.S. In terms of the voluntary benefit ratio, that's steadily declined over the past few years. I was wondering if you can talk about what's driving this and how much lower it can go.", "Thomas Watjen", "Kevin, can you grab that one?", "Kevin McCarthy", "I think it's operating sort of above what we expected to operate right in and around 50% or so.  That's a loss ratio. It's been going down, primarily, because our growth rate in Accident and Disability and Critical Illness Voluntary lines have been growing faster than the growth rate in our Life and the Life portfolio is somewhat more mature, therefore, has a higher loss ratio. So it's supposed to be driven by business mix. The other, I think, factor is that we have raised prices slightly in Voluntary over the last several years on our portfolio, and we continue to manage that business, both in terms of participation rates and pricing and size, mix et cetera in line with our strategy.", "Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then in terms of this business, we are seeing the premium income growth start to accelerate again. Where do we think the growth can go to here?", "Kevin McCarthy", "On Voluntary?", "Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank AG", "That's right. The Supplementary and Voluntary business.", "Kevin McCarthy", "I think that in General, we expect to outperform the marketplace. In Voluntary, we expect right around double-digit growth and sort of on the higher end of double-digit growth if you will sort of in the midteens. I think it's the target level for us in terms of the Voluntary business since the economy recovers.", "Operator", "And we'll move to our next question from Colin Devine, Citi.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc", "I was wondering if I could touch on 3 things. First, with respect to Long-term Care, perhaps if you could expand a little bit on the average rate increase you've received. What that really means to premium then over the, I guess, if you like the next year? And what even more importantly it's going to mean that benefit ratio? So the first question there on Long-term Care. Second, with respect to the U.K., maybe I missed it, but I've got to say, this is the first time that I've heard you acknowledge that you've got a pricing problem on the U.K. book, unless I misinterpreted what you said. Except I thought both Jack, Tom you referred to. We've been through this in the U.S. We're doing it again. And if you do, then have a pricing issue on that block maybe we can expand a little bit more on what you think the magnitude of that is. And then finally, I don't want to leave Randy out, on Colonial with the benefit ratio, early in the fourth quarter, it wasn't just an aberration. How long do you see this sort of elevated ratio continuing? Are we going to be at these levels for a while here or can you get it back down?", "Thomas Watjen", "I should ask Kevin to take your first question on Long-term Care.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Let me just work my way back with it. I think the results of the rate increases will be largely stabilization, in terms of the loss ratio. There would be average size of the rate increases.  Our target level was in and around 25%. On the approvals rate we've received so far, it's south of that, primarily driven by the fact that about half of the states have approved the rate increase in the 23%-ish kind of average range and half of them have only approved a partial rate increase in the maybe 10% to 12% range with the idea that we'd have to come back again for a second round. So I think the premium, as Rick said in his remarks, will emerge more in 2012, 2013 and sort of in the range of somewhere around $30 million by the time we're finished all the way through the rate increase actions.", "Thomas Watjen", "If I could just PS at the U.K. point, actually Colin, let me just be sure I'm clear. We don't feel we have a problem in pricing like for example, when I refer to the U.S. Obviously, the U.S. had to go through a fairly significant amount of repricing because we had very low returns in that business. And the situation we find in the U.K. is actually we still have very strong returns. It's just those returns have come down. We want to take the actions necessary to bring them back up again, so it's very -- maybe the process is somewhat similar, but the starting point and ultimately the ending point, in terms of the U.S. versus U.K. is very, very different. So Jack is always politely saying to me that don't give me too much grief when we have a 20% plus ROE business, and you're talking about pricing actions because that's really what we're talking about is taking and improving the pricing and returns in a business, which frankly already has some very good returns. We just think they can be taken to a higher level. And with that, Jack, maybe just sort of elaborate a little bit on just some of the things that we've been doing. And I think you touched on this a little bit earlier, but maybe just pick up on just one of my comments.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. We do have a 30% margin in the business. I don't think the problem is with pricing levels as much as perhaps the direction prices were headed in the marketplace and the desire to stop and reverse that direction. Actually, I talked about this in fairly good level of detail at the Investor Relations meeting in November about the fact that we had reduced rates. In 2009, the market had responded to that very aggressively. Still left us with very healthy margins, but had reduced rates across the marketplace pretty dramatically, and we were just looking to reverse that. We feel very comfortable with the level we're rating at now. We feel very comfortable with the profitability of our business. We feel comfortable that the profitability of that business will improve as a result of the rate actions that we are taking. And so we still view this as an extremely high margin, high return attractive market and one that has a huge opportunity for growth as well. So I wouldn't label it a pricing problem, so much as taking some management actions as the market leader to make sure that there isn't a pricing problem in the marketplace in the future.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, Jack, and just to be clear, so we can all relate as to what happened in the U.S., right, where you tactically shrunk the size of the book, premiums came down. What should we expect then really in the U.K. as you go through this? The sort of decline we saw here in the first quarter, more or relatively stable?", "Jack McGarry", "I think we would expect fairly stable persistency, as we move through the block. Hopefully if the marketplace begins to harden somewhat that things will, persistency could drift up in the second half of the year. We expect to be completely through pricing actions over the next 2 years, so we will have been through the entire block from that time, and we would expect persistency to improve over that 2-year cycle.", "Thomas Watjen", "And Colin, unlike the U.S., as you know, there wasn't a big large case block, for example, like we had to tackle in the U.S. which in effect, there was big chunks of premiums that really had to exit the income statement. That's not the same situation we find in the U.K.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, I know. It's more than a lot of the tactics we're using are similar. Some of the results in terms of keeping better business, losing the worst running business, the impact of persistency of the rate actions are similar, but at a very different level and at a very different profitability level than the U.S.", "Thomas Watjen", "And Colin, if we could shift to your last question, we have a sort of 2-part answer. Maybe I'll just ask Rick to speak a little bit to the benefit ratio and then ask Randy just to speak to some of the operational trends and mix of business changes that have been going on in the sales activity. But Rick, on the benefit ratio?", "Richard McKenney", "On the benefit ratio, Colin you would have seen it has elevated from what were really some very low levels that we saw in 2009, 2008. So I think as we booked about 49.7% for last year in total, we've gone up to 51.7% in the first quarter, and our expectations for the full year will be in that 50% to 52% range, really driven by mix and our expectations of how we price that book. I would say that even with those benefit ratios, we're generating very good margins in this book of business and very good ROEs. And I'll turn it over to Randy to talk about more on the operational side.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc", "And maybe just one second, Rick. When you mentioned the 52%, or for Randy, is that where you really see it stabilizing? It's not sort of trending back to the 55%, 56%, of 5 or 6 years ago?", "Richard McKenney", "I would confirm that, yes. It's stabilizing at those levels.", "Randall Horn", "Yes, I definitely see stability in that 50% to 52% range. I guess just adding to what Rick said, in first quarter last year, I think Rick gave the full year number. We have a very low benefit ratio just north of 47%. So starting out from a low level there, you might recall, we did see a pattern of increasing incurrals in the Accident, Sickness and Disability segment over the course of 2010. Just absolute higher incurrals for Accident and Sickness. We did see an increase in incidence of disability claims over the course of 2010. And then we reflected that through some reserve adjustments we took in the fourth quarter of last year. But at this point, we see things stabilizing very well. Our disability incidence has actually dropped back down here in the first quarter of 2011. We had a surgeon open life claims, Colin, in March, but that really is just expected volatility. We get in that line from time-to-time. I don't see any kind of adverse trend or pattern there. In fact, we've seen that open claim level settle back down here so far in the second quarter. So long story short, yes, we expect things to stabilize in that 50% to 52% range. We've introduced some new products at the product mix shift that has helped drive us to that level. But we think that will help us on the sales front but still maintain very healthy margins and stable benefit ratios going forward.", "Operator", "We'll move to our next question from Ed Spehar, BOA Merrill Lynch.", "Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I have a question on the U.K., and I guess when I look at the U.K., the difference from the U.S. market for Unum, I think, is that your market share is about 50%, I believe, in the U.K. So I thought you'd have more price leadership than what we seem could be seeing. And I'm wondering is there any concern that this is an indication that the overall return expectation for the Unum UK market is potentially moving more toward the U.S. level? Because as you highlighted, this a very high ROE business.", "Thomas Watjen", "Let me start and then I'll ask Jack to supplement.", "I think, Ed, as you know, and I think it was alluded to by Jack in one of his earlier comments, we made some pricing decisions a couple of years ago where we had lowered prices, and actually, what happened is the market actually not just went to that level, but went below it. And we didn't really exhibit the kind of market leadership we should, actually.  And as Jack mentioned, really much of what we're doing right now is acting like a market leader. And early indications are that we can be a market leader and continue to protect prices and protect returns. But Jack, again maybe you could fill in the gaps a little bit on that.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, I would agree with that, Tom. We are holding on to the cases, having good persistency. We continue to have not the sales level we are achieving last year, but good sales level. Most of our misses, in fact, in sales were in the Group Life side as opposed to the Group Income Protection side. So I think we are demonstrating leadership. The worst thing we could do for the market is chase share with price down because we'd end up with fulfilling that prophecy. So we are going to exert some leadership. We recognize that by us raising rates on our in-force block and having somewhat poorer persistency for a short period of time, that's going to mean sales for some of our competitors. Hopefully, they will recognize that and begin to recognize that they can take the opportunity to grow and increase their pricing levels as well. This is early days. I mean, we've been at it for a quarter now, really through our January renewals. The marketplace hasn't had time to react yet from a pricing perspective, so we are very hopeful that during the second and third quarter, they'll have that opportunity. We're very optimistic about our ability to maintain. In fact, we are maintaining, if not, in fact we are improving margins as a result of our pricing actions. We are improving returns, and we also, harken back to the huge opportunity that exist in the U.K. with only 1 out of 10 people currently insured for group income protection in a social environment that's really going to be relying more on the private industry to provide protection. So we're very optimistic about the market and our leadership position in it.", "Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And my follow-up would be I understand you're exhibiting price leadership. But if the market doesn't follow, why wouldn't you go to the market.", "Is there something about the risk profile of this business that you deem a 20% plus ROE to be necessary? Because I'm assuming that if you thought the risk profile was similar to the U.S. market, why wouldn't you accept the same level of returns if the market doesn't come to where you are, especially considering that you're highlighting better growth opportunity in the U.K. relative to the U.S.?", "Jack McGarry", "Well I think a part of it, because the market hasn't demonstrated that we need to go there. I mean we're a 50% market share leader. We're taking a little hit on persistency right now with the rate actions we're taking, but well within our plan. We're improving margins. To drive the market to the U.S. level of profitability, to gain another couple of percent market share doesn't seem like a very good value proposition for us. So as long as we can maintain our market share, we can protect our margins. We can get the returns we are getting, and we can demonstrate that we don't need to be at the market to sell income protection because of our value proposition. We can sell at a premium. We're going to continue to do that.", "Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I guess, I'm not suggesting that you're going to be aggressive to gain 2 points a share. I guess what I'm suggesting is if there's some fundamental shift in this market where if you don't follow everyone else's, your share goes from 50% to 25%. Is there some reason for you to require a 20% ROE for this business based on the risk profile of the Unum UK market versus the U.S. market?", "Jack McGarry", "Well, first we see no evidence of that fundamental shift in the market. That would -- in fact, we see evidence much to the contrary, in terms of what we're doing right now. But no, there's no risk profile in this market that requires that level of return. It's the fact that the markets were able to achieve that level.", "Thomas Watjen", "If I could just add to what Jack has said. Again, there really is no evidence there's any difference in the risk characteristics. If you look at the basic fundamental actuarial sort of components underneath this in terms of incidence and claim and duration, those sort of risk factors, they're very, very similar to what they are in the U.S. So there's no fundamental underpinnings in the U.K. that are all any different than what they are in the U.S. I think what we're getting at is as a market leader, we probably made a couple of fundamental mistakes a couple of years ago, which is why we made the change in leadership where we were leading with price, and we didn't need to lead with price. As Jack mentioned, we have a tremendous value proposition. People truly respect the claim expertise we have in U.K., the service we have in the U.K. and it was a strategy change, really. Well rather than focus on just leading with price, let's get back to delivering and leading with value, which is frankly, we find in the marketplace so far, the market is prepared to pay for that value.", "Jack McGarry", "And in addition to that, we do write at a higher margin than our competitors do.", "Thomas Watjen", "These customers value that additional value proposition. So I would say we probably erred a couple of years ago on choosing to get away from so-called selling value into selling price, and that's why we're actually backtracking on that with the actions we've talked about here in the last 12 months.", "Operator", "We'll move to our next question from Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan.", "Jamminder Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I had a question, 1 just maybe if you could talk about competitive trends and just your sales outlook in the U.S. disability market. Obviously, this quarter you're up 7% in Long-term Disability. I think the last couple of quarters, you were weak. And then secondly, related to that, we've heard from a lot of companies saying that they're raising prices if you've seen that happen in the market. And the other question that I had was just on the base of buybacks. I think you did $224 million in the first quarter. You've got $921 million remaining on your authorization. I think that runs through sort of the first half of next year. But should we expect you to take that long to use all of that upward? Would you be doing it faster? And just talk about the base of share buybacks.", "Thomas Watjen", "Let me ask Kevin, but let me speak to your first three questions, which really deal with the competitive dynamic.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Well, we've heard some companies talk about making price adjustments, and I think we've seen some limited evidence. But at the same time, we see other companies that continue to be quite aggressive and so in general, I would say there's not been a significant shift in the competitive environment. We've been consistent with our value proposition. Our prices actually in the marketplace were slightly higher at this time this year than they were last year, so we're maintaining that kind of discipline and focus. And then we continue to focus on growing in our core marketplace and in the less economically sensitive industry. So in general, we are focused on sort of delivering our value proposition, our ability to market in the core market and packages with Voluntary Benefits, and we are not worrying too much about the price levels right now, and we're not seeing much difference.", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, you want to pick up the question on share buybacks?", "Richard McKenney", "Sure. If you look at the first quarter, the $224 million that we did, if you take the remaining authorization of $921 million, you'd see a similar level on average than we would continue to deploy over the authorization period. However, I would caution against that because we are going to be very opportunistic in terms of how we buy back stock. So it's for modeling purposes, the average is okay and how it actually comes out, I think it will be quite different depending on market environment.", "Jamminder Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And by that, you're just implying if you get a better price, you'd buy more [indiscernible]?", "Richard McKenney", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll move to our next question from Jeffrey Schuman, KBW.", "Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I'm going to ask the U.S. question first and then I'll come back and get in my, I guess, mandatory U.K. question. But on the U.S., just kind of a high-level question. As we look a couple of years down the road to what we hope is a stronger economy, better employment environment, I think, pretty straightforward there would be top line implications for you. How should we think about kind of margin implications? Should we think of you as having better risk margins in that environment or maybe just realizing a little bit of operating leverage in a better growth environment or should we think about more kind of a stable margin expectation versus where we sit today?", "Thomas Watjen", "Kevin, do you want to talk about that as it relates to the Unum US business?", "Kevin McCarthy", "_", " Yes. I think as the economy recovers, we get some job growth, we get some wage growth as well. The implications, I think, would be more significant on the top line, in terms of growth of the business of rejuvenation of the sort of NBOC for example, the additional benefits. So overall, profit levels increase as the top line increases. As far as margins, you might see a marginal improvement in profit margin, but I wouldn't see a significantly different risk profile that we're managing through right now.", "Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. So it's mostly top line opportunities.", "Kevin McCarthy", "I would say, absolutely.", "Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "On the U.K., you made it a point several times that you got aggressive on pricing in 2009, and now you're trying to kind of address that. But when I looked at a much longer picture, particularly to the Disability business, that it seems that there's a much longer trend that's hard not to be concerned about. I mean, if we look at disability sales in the U.K., and assuming available local currency numbers are right, you really only have a modest blip up in sales in 2009, 3% sales growth. Other than that, sales peaked in 2004 and have declined quite steadily since then, in many cases, double digits. Premiums, disability premiums in the U.K. constant currency, I think it's 30% below where they were 3 years ago. So it appears that there is a long-term trend of giving up disability share in the U.K. That extends well beyond this period of sort of recent price adjustments. How do we think about you stabilizing or even reversing that long-standing market share trend?", "Thomas Watjen", "Let me start and then I'm going to ask Jack to sort of pick up. First, I'm not sure of the numbers you're looking at, Jeff. But actually, I don't believe we've actually lost market share in the last sort of 5 years. Our biggest challenge, frankly, is that the market isn't growing. I think Jack alluded to, and he'll speak to, I think, a little bit more when I pass it to him. But this is a market that's substantially under penetrated relative to the U.S. for disability coverage, roughly 10% let's say. And that 10% penetration rate in the U.K. has existed for decades. So from a strategic point of view, our biggest issue isn't trying to reshape how much of the pie we own of the existing pie, because again, it's roughly a 50% market share. There's little upside for doing that, and that's actually probably one of the things that led to couple of pricing things that we talked about earlier. Our biggest focus is kind of building a stable foundation to take advantage of the business opportunities that exist today. At the same time, as Jack alluded to earlier, recognizing the biggest leverage for us is expanding that market share from market size from where it is today. So if you could take that 10% penetration to 15% or 20%, that's where a lot of our focus is being spent. It's being spent on working at the policy level with those that are setting policy in the U.K. Government to all the way down to simplifying our product and service offering. But again, Jack, you may want to speak to that, because again, I think we've been fortunate enough to maintain a pretty consistent market share, with the market -- with the lack of market growth is really the issue that's constrained our growth, and that's where much of the focus is right now.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, and actually, Tom, since 2002 I believe, our market share went from 30% up to 50%. A lot of that was the result of consolidation in the market. Several key players exiting the market, which we took over their blocks, took over their in-force and got some of their sales from. And so that's buffeted the sales, but we've been steady at 50% market share for the last couple of years. The growth in the market has been severely impacted by the economy in the U.K., which took a big hit and has been impacted by pricing in the U.K. as well. The U.K. overall sales in the marketplace are down and overall premium levels in the marketplace are down due to both the economy and pricing. Our position is really solid, and the value proposition we have is great. And the opportunity, we have been working with public policymakers. We are looking on promotional campaign to raise awareness of the need for disability products in the U.K. to U.K. workers, and we'll look to expand coverage. I mean, 1 out of 10, we have a group of in-force policy holders that are only insuring 1 out of 7 of their employees. If they were in U.S., they would be insuring 4 out of 7. And so that's a tremendous opportunity that we're going to look to capitalize on over the next couple of years. Our goal is to grow the market. It's not to grow market share.", "Operator", "We'll go to our next question from Randy Binner, FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Just following up on some comments Tom White made earlier in the call, and then it's apparent in the financials that, that investment income is kind of trending down a bit as invested assets are a bit lower. Just wondering if there's anything that can be done to try and enhance investment income through a borrowing or mashed activity. We've seen some other life insurers do that. Just wondering if that's something that could be in your playbook to help for your EPS growth goals.", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, you want to take that one?", "Richard McKenney", "Your suggestions, we look at it. But really, our investment income will trend very much with our book of business. Our assets are backing our liabilities. We'll continue to invest consistently where we have done today on a good risk management basis. We'll continue to put in our corporate bond. Today's environment is a little bit tougher, given where the credit spreads in the interest rate environment is. But prior to the credit downturn, et cetera, we didn't reach for yield, and we're not going to do that today, as well as enhance those levels. We're pretty happy with where our investment income and where our investment team have been investing. We've grabbed some asset classes, particularly in 2010, which were opportunistic, and we feel very good about the credit quality of those assets. And then in the Build America Bonds and in some tax advantage investments with very high credit quality with some good enhanced yields, but there's not going to be any systematic programs to try and choose our deals with leverage or something like that.", "Thomas Watjen", "Yes, if I could add one thing, Randy, because we are a very large corporate bond buyer and corporate bond owner, we will have miscellaneous investment income. There are bonds that get called, you get paid bond call premiums, things like that. Those are hard to predict, they're volatile. Over long periods of time, it's generally pretty steady. We know they're going to come in. But by quarter and by product portfolio, it's very hard to predict those. And it really shows up when you look at the closed disability block. Because you got a flat block of business and a general decline in the overall assets, but we'll have volatility quarter-to-quarter because you'll get some bond calls one quarter and they won't be repeated the next quarter. So I think that's just kind of inherent in having as large a corporate bond portfolio and private placement portfolio that we have. Maybe time and again, we run the risk of over answering, but you may want to speak to the interest margin because, again, I think we tend to manage the portfolio for the interest margin, actually interest margin continues to be very strong.", "Richard McKenney", "That's really the kind of the driver of our investment strategy is to have investments that are providing a predictable yield that support the liability discount rate assumptions that we have.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "All of that is very helpful. I guess just to follow-up then, I mean there's an EPS guidance range that's percentage growth, and it seems like the benefit ratio of Colonial might be a little bit higher. These are all marginal things maybe a little bit lower persistency in the U.K. this year. If the investment income is just slightly lower than we may have otherwise thought, is it possible for you to kind of quantify if we should think kind of the middle, lower, upper part of that guidance range, and given what we know kind of at quarter end?", "Thomas Watjen", "No, I'm not going to give you more guidance, just range that we have out there already today from our outlook. What I would say on the investment income line relative to your expectations, it may be a little bit over given some of these tax advantage investments which will come out of the investment income line and moved to the tax line.  You would note our tax rate was about 2 percentage points lower than it was a year ago. So a little bit geography going on there as well, Randy.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "No, understood on that. It's just it seems like the asset levels are lower, but the responses are helpful.", "Operator", "We'll move to our next question from Eric Berg, RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "Given all of the commentary around the success that you are enjoying in the U.K. and sort of writing your business, getting pricing right, pricing leadership, losing, editing the line-up into a leading business that is sorely unprofitable, help you reconcile that with the very significant year-over-year increase in the loss ratio.", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, you want to take that one on the loss ratio in the U.K.?", "Richard McKenney", "Yes. So when you look actually at the year-over-year in the U.K., there are a couple of things going on. One is last year, we were seeing very good results. But you have to dig down underneath that, there's some inflation that's happened over the course of that line and the premium income line has come down. So that's something we talked about earlier, which has driven up that loss ratio. So although it's higher than it was a year ago, quite a bit higher than it was a year ago, it's within our line of expectation that we've seen over the last couple of quarters and how we talked about that book of business.", "Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers", "And in the U.S., I just want to return to the earlier discussion about claims experience there. I understand from your comments and from reading your news release that the claims incidence is, let's see, was better in the March quarter than it was in the December quarter, but higher than the year-ago quarter. What I'm interested in knowing is how does the incidence stack up relative to your expectations, and in particular, a number of your competitors have reported what they call elevated incidence, which is a term that I interpret to mean \"it's just not going in line with their expectations.\" Or irrespective of the -- putting aside the issue of comparison, incidence versus December quarter, incidence versus the year-ago quarter, how is the incidence stacking up relative to your expectations? And are you facing the same sort of negative surprises in incidence that some of your peers are facing?", "Thomas Watjen", "Kevin, do you want to tackle that one?", "Kevin McCarthy", "On an actual-to-expected incidence basis, we're performing right where we expect to be and are very consistent with our pricing assumption. We've seen some volatility over the last year and a half in incidence. Some ups and some downs, but pretty much in a fairly narrow range, this is both on a submitted and a paid incidence basis. So we're not seeing elevated incidence in comparison to some of the others' comments. As you know, we manage our mix of business. We've moved our mix of business sort of down-market, if you will, over the last several years. And actual-to-expected incidence is performing very well, particularly in the smaller end of our book of business, which is a part of the business that's also growing the fastest in our core group business. And we haven't really seen any volatility in claims by diagnosis or by industry. In fact, incidence has been even slightly improved or   basically flat across industry sectors.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Hughes, SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Could you share a natural growth number for the U.S. business for this quarter?", "Richard McKenney", "As we've talked about the natural growth for those of you, we look at our natural growth in terms of the block of business and what's happening from wage inflation and more lives taken, lives added to different cases. What we've seen over the last couple of years, 2 years ago was a negative 3%. Last year was negative 1%. Fourth quarter was pretty flat, and I'd say, we'd probably said the first quarter was pretty flat as well. So we're looking forward to the economy recovering. We haven't seen it actually coming through in some of those metrics that we look at.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "And then your sales in the Group Long-term Disability up nicely this quarter. Was there anything unusual, any new initiatives in the marketing front or channel front that contributed to that kind of growth? Any reason that wouldn't be sustainable going forward?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Mark, no new initiatives, at least specific to the quarter. We've been steadily rolling out our Simply Unum platform, the ability to package our products together for more efficiency on the benefit volume side for the employer, stronger employee communication support for the employers and we have more and more brokers in the marketplace selling packages of LTD with Voluntary Benefits. And I think all of those kinds of factors in the investments we've made strategically are paying off. And I think that in general, we should see solid core market growth coupled with strong Voluntary Benefits growth. But I do think you'll see some volatility from quarter-to-quarter sort of within line. I mean, it won't always be LTDs up 7% and Life is up 5% or Life's up 8%. It will bounce around a little bit depending on sort of what's out there in the marketplace in terms of good activity.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris Giovanni, Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I just wanted to focus on capital. I guess, first you've typically used the mid May sort of board meeting as an opportunity to increase the dividend, 10% plus. I just wanted to see if this was still the expectation again this year and does the emphasis on share repurchases that you started last May sort of mute the likelihood of this pace of dividend increase.", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, you want to cover that?", "Richard McKenney", "Certainly. On the dividend, I think you're right. It is the topic of discussion with the board, pretty consistently. But May has over the last couple of years has been a decision point in time. Given the capital position that we're in today, I think those discussions are really on 2 different sides. One is going to be the capital that we take out through recurring dividends that we see coming off our operating income. We'll discuss that, but it does not in any way impact the amount of capital we have available to ourselves for the share repurchase. So I won't necessarily say that one excludes the other.", "Thomas Watjen", "I would echo that, Chris. I think that we view both dividends and share buybacks as 2 sort of very necessary tools to put that excess capital to work and effectively do one versus another. I think we look at those as both very important creators of value for our shareholders.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then next, just in terms of debt maturity. You obviously just did the piece in March, you're tying the $225 million. So now you're looking out to 2015 before the next debt maturity of about $300 million. And with the leverage ratio where you sit today, sort of just below 21%, is there any talk of potentially taking that up here in the near term?", "Thomas Watjen", "I wouldn't say that given what rate that we're running at that we would take it out for any specific opportunity that we would have out there to deploy debt and capital via the M&A markets or anything else, but you are right that as we look out over the next couple of years, we'll see a natural deleveraging, which we don't need to have. We are at a very low leverage ratio today, and so you'd probably see us be consistent right around that 20% level, in the wake of not doing something else with debt.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from John Nadel, Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Just a couple of real quick ones. Just to follow up a little bit on the January renewal season and pricing trends from I think an earlier question. Just wondering if you dissect that a bit more and think about size, plans, small market, mid market, et cetera whether you'd see anything different happening in either or in any of those markets vis-\u00e0-vis the other, and then the only other question I have that's left over is just to think about the tax advantaged investments that you guys have been making, and had to think about what that does to your tax rate as we look forward, tax equivalent yield, that sort of thing.", "Thomas Watjen", "Kevin do you want to speak to the renewal season?", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes. I think it's been a pretty sort of uneventful kind of renewal season. We went into renewals during the fourth quarter last year looking forward to the first quarter this year, thinking that if prices in the market didn't harden, that we might be under some pressure. That hasn't, for the most part, really materialized. I think we're feeling very successful with our renewal program or I think slightly ahead of plan, relative to where we want to be right now. And out to bid levels are actually lower at this time this year compared to the same time last year. So I think we're feeling pretty successful about our renewal program right now.", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, you want to take the tax advantage?", "Richard McKenney", "Always good to have a tax question be the last. When you look at our tax rate, actually what saw in the quarter about 31.5%, we'd see it probably a little bit higher than that, just slightly higher than that over the course of the year from a planning perspective. Specific to the investments, we were very active last year on tax advantage investments. We saw very good returns. Those returns have come in quite a bit here over the last 6 months with a lot of other players who are out of that market are getting back into it. So we'll still do some of those, but not quite the rich yield that we saw, and you'll see our tax rate to this day kind of fund in slightly higher, but about the level I had said today.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "So we're definitely seeing that sustainable at a lower level at least relative to the last couple of years. Got it.", "Thomas Watjen", "Well, thanks, John, and thank you all for taking time to join us this morning.

Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'll turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas A. H. White", "Great. Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 Analyst and Investor Call for Unum Group.", "Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements.", "Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and in our subsequently filed Forms 10-Q.

Although a little choppy this quarter, actually, I'm pretty pleased with our quarter. Because despite the pressures that we saw in several of our product areas and most notably, in the U.K., our earnings per share grew 9% in the quarter. ", "Before I turn things over to Rick and Tom, I want to touch on actually a few of the highlights. First, despite continued challenging market conditions, our investment portfolio remains in excellent shape. Today's low interest rates remain a headwind. But our portfolio yields remain generally stable again this quarter. Despite this, we have already begun to reflect today's lower interest rates in certain of our businesses and reduced the new claim discount rate for our U.S. Group Disability business by 25 basis points. ", "Second, our capital position remains solid with a weighted average risk-based capital ratio of 396% at the end of the third quarter. Our holding company's cash and marketable securities position at over $600 million, providing a solid financial foundation for the company. ", "Third, with respect to our share repurchase activity. Given the weakness in our stock this past quarter, we stepped up our stock buyback activity with a total of $250 million repurchased this quarter. ", "Over the past year and a half, we have repurchased $975 million of stock and reduced our share count by 12%. And since the fourth quarter of 2007, we have repurchased almost $1.7 billion of stock, reducing our share count by 19%. Over the same period, we've raised our quarterly dividend by about 40%, while all of the same time remaining in a very solid financial position. ", "And finally, despite the difficult market conditions, I'm pleased that we continue to see modest growth in most of our target market. Unum US reported growth in new sales of 10% this quarter, with 12% growth in core market sales and 16% growth in voluntary benefits sales. ", "Sales at Colonial Life were up almost 4% in total and core commercial market sales grew 7%. Sales growth in the U.K. remains challenging, as we continue to raise prices on new and existing business. ", "In summary, despite the pressure we saw on parts of our businesses this quarter, particularly in our U.K. business, I'm generally pleased with our performance. ", "Looking ahead, we expect the environment to remain very challenging, with continued pressure from persistently high unemployment and low interest rates. We continue to believe that we are well-positioned for this environment and we will continue to take the actions needed to deliver value for our customers and solid financial results for our shareholders.", "Now I'll ask Tom White to provide an overview of our operating results this quarter. Tom?", "Thomas A. H. White", "Great. Thanks, Tom. Net income for the third quarter was $205.6 million or $0.69 per diluted common share compared to net income of $220.8 million or $0.68 per diluted common share last year. Included in the results for the third quarter of 2011, our net realized after-tax investment losses of $15.9 million or $0.05 per diluted common share, compared to net realized after-tax investment gains of $0.9 million or less than $0.01 per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2010.", "Net realized after-tax investment losses for the third quarter 2011, include an after-tax loss of $21.8 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract compared to an after-tax gain of $1.1 million in the year-ago quarter. ", "Excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $221.5 million for this quarter or $0.74 per diluted common share, compared to $219.9 million or $0.68 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter. ", "The income tax rate for the third quarter was lower compared to a year ago, due to the release of $6.8 million of income taxes, related to the enactment of a tax rate reduction in the U.K., and our increased level of investment and tax credit partnerships over the past year. ", "Turning to the operating segments, Unum US operating income increased 7.2% to $219.5 million in the third quarter as strong results in the Supplemental and Voluntary line of business and generally stable results in the Group Life and AD&D line of business more than offset a decline in operating income in our Group Disability line of business. ", "Within Unum US, operating income in the Group Disability line declined by 7.3% to $72.1 million in the third quarter of 2011, driven by a lower level of premium income and an increase in the benefit ratio. Premium income declined 0.9% to $508.9 million in the quarter, largely due to the ongoing effects of the weak economy on headcount and salary growth at existing customers. The Group Disability benefit ratio rose to 85.5% from 84.6% in the year-ago period due to a higher level of paid incidents for both long-term and short-term disability, as well as a reduction in the discount rate for Group Long-term Disability new claim accruals, and Rick will have additional comments about our risk results in his remarks. ", "Within the Group Life and AD&D line, operating income increased 0.6 % to $53.1 million in the third quarter, benefiting from slightly higher revenue in a slightly lower benefit ratio. ", "In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, third quarter income increased 27.3% to $94.3 million. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by strong results from the Voluntary Benefits business line, as well as solid growth in the recently issued Individual Disability line, the effects of which more than offset a decline in income from the Long-term Care business. ", "Premium income for this line increased 3.9% to $412.3 million in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sales in the voluntary benefits line of business. The interest adjusted loss ratio for Individual Disability recently issued, declined due to favorable claims performance. The interest adjusted loss ratio for Long-term Care was higher, primarily to an increase in active life reserves, as a result of continued favorable persistency levels, as well as an increase in loss trends. ", "The benefit ratio for voluntary benefits declined to 50.3% from 54.6% in the year-ago period, due primarily to a lower average paid claim size for voluntary life and lower paid incidents and prevalence rates for voluntary disability. ", "Moving to Unum UK, operating income in this segment decreased 26.1% to $34.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Operating income declined 28.6% in local currency. So while premium income in local currency was up 4.8% in the third quarter, the benefit ratio was higher at 78.8% compared to 66.9%, reflecting unfavorable risk experience in the Group Long-term Disability product, primarily -- driven primarily by the increase in the average size and severity of new claims in the third quarter, relative to the year-ago period. ", "Concluding our core operations, Colonial Life experienced a 5.6% decrease in operating income compared to the year-ago period, as premium income growth of 5.3% and slightly higher net investment income were more than offset by a higher benefit ratio. The benefit ratio rose to 52.6% in the quarter from 49.9% in the same period last year, due to a higher level of incurred claims in the accident, sickness and disability product line and an increase in the level of cancer claims coming from an older block of cancer products. ", "Individual Disability \u2014 Closed Block operating income was $14 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared to $9.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was driven primarily by lower operating expenses and a decline in the interest adjusted loss ratio which more than offset a decline in both premium income and net investment income due to the expected runoff of the Closed Block. Premium income declined 5.8% to $196.4 million, while net investment income declined 1.9% due to a lower level of on call premiums, a decline in prepayment income on mortgage-backed securities and a decrease in the level of assets. The interest adjusted loss ratio was 84.9% this quarter compared to 85.5% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting favorable mortality experience. ", "And finally, the Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $21.5 million compared to a loss of $10.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The higher operating loss was driven primarily by lower net investment income, resulting from lower short-term interest rates and investments in low income housing tax credit partnerships. ", "So with that overview of the operating results, I'll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis of this quarter's results.", "Richard McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Tom. A couple of themes to take you through. First, I'll highlight the key drivers of risk results, a little bit on our top line growth in our core business segments and then update on our investment portfolio, with a particular view to rates and conclude with an update on our capital strategy.", "I'll begin with a review of risk experience for our primary lines of business, starting with Unum US. For Group Disability, the benefit ratio of 85.5% increased by roughly one percentage point in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2011, as well as the third quarter of 2010. ", "Focusing on the change from the prior quarter were 2 primary drivers. First, we elected to reduce the discount rate we use on new claim incurrals this quarter by 25 basis points. This had an impact on our earnings of $3 million or about 65 basis points on the benefit ratio. ", "We felt that this was an appropriate move, given today's low interest rate environment. I would note that our portfolio rate remains very robust. In fact, the margin widened by 2 basis points to 98 basis points this quarter. Despite that, we did feel that the magnitude of the recent drop in interest rates warranted the move to adjust slightly. ", "Second, as we have commented in the prior few quarters, we have seen a higher level of volatility in our new claim incidents. And this quarter was no exception to the trend. New claim incidents was slightly elevated again this quarter and had a negative impact on the benefit ratio of approximately 0.5%. ", "As we have seen in the past, our claim recovery experience remained solid again this quarter. Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor these 2 trends closely and look to take the appropriate pricing actions to maintain profitability. ", "For the Group Life and AD&D line, results continue to remain stable. The benefit ratio of 70.2% for the third quarter is very consistent with the results we produced over the past several quarters, and the earnings contribution remains very consistent in the low $50 million range. ", "Looking to the Supplemental and Voluntary lines within Unum US, we saw a very good overall earnings results driven by strong performance in the voluntary benefits and Individual Disability recently issued lines of business. Risk results in these lines are favorable compared to the year-ago quarter. ", "We also saw lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs due to favorable premium persistency in certain product lines, as well as an unlocking for favorable mortality experience in our interest-sensitive voluntary life products. ", "Turning to Long-term Care, the loss ratio was higher both on a year-over-year and compared to the second quarter driven by the continued growth of active life reserves for this quarter due to the trend we've seen for both persistency, as well as loss trends. ", "As we have discussed on prior calls with you, we are working to offset this by filing for rate increases on certain of our LTC policies. These filings have been completed in all 50 states in the District of Columbia. So far, we have received rate increase for approval in 35 states and have achieved 88% of the requested rate action in those states that have reached a decision. The additional premium from this rate increase will emerge over next year and into 2013. ", "Looking across the business, loss pressure was most acute in the U.K. We saw an unusually large increase in the average size and acceptance of new claims and the Group Long-term Disability line in the third quarter which drove an increase in the benefit ratio to 78.8%, compared to 69.8% in the second quarter and 66.9% in the year-ago quarter. ", "While year-over-year, new claims volumes were broadly in line, the percentage of approved claims went up resulting in an increase in reserves associated with these new claims. In addition, the average size of these approved claims was also elevated. This compounded the effect of the higher acceptance ratio. As we've analyzed the results, we can't point to any external causal factors, but we will obviously continue to watch closely to determine if it's truly just volatility. ", "And finally on Colonial Life, the benefit ratio for the third quarter was 52.6%, slightly higher than our expected range of 50% to 52%. This quarter, we experienced less favorable risk results in the accident, sickness and disability line and also in the cancer and critical illness line.", "The primary driver or adverse results for cancer and critical illness came from unfavorable risk experience on older policies that we no longer actively market and have been taking pricing actions on. ", "Our newer policies do not have the policy provisions that have led to the volatility that we've experienced in this line. Given these results, as well as the mixed shift towards slightly higher benefit ratios associated with a new accident product, it is likely that the Colonial Life benefit ratio will continue around these levels into 2012. ", "Overall, we still like the profit of margins we see this business produces and the growth opportunities we see going forward. ", "I'd like to now turn to the top line for each of our business segments, beginning with Unum US. We saw a good momentum for new sales in Unum US, again this quarter, increasing 10% for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2011. Group LTD STD and Group Life and AD&D combine to shows sales growth of just over 4%. But importantly, 80% of those sales were generated in the core market. Voluntary benefits continues to be a positive growth opportunity for us, with sales this quarter growing 16% and growth of overall premiums in this line at a healthy 10%. ", "While new sales trends remain encouraging, we have stable persistency trends in our primary Unum US business lines.  The challenge continues to be the slight drag on our overall premium growth from a weak economy and lack of employment and wage growth. ", "At Unum UK, the top line trends we experienced in the third quarter were largely consistent with what we experienced in the first half of the year. While new sales trends remain difficult, declining 30% compared to the year-ago quarter, we have seen that persistency is holding up well and premium income continues to firm up, increasing 4.8% compared to last year's third quarter. So while gaining new business remains challenging in the U.K., especially the large case market, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on renewals on our in-force business. ", "Finally, sales in Colonial Life segment increased 3.6% in the third quarter, primarily driven by higher sales activity in the core commercial sector which is up 7.1%. Recruiting trends at Colonial Life remained positive, with new rep contract growth of 5% this quarter and 6% year-to-date. ", "If we now turn to the investment portfolio, we continue to be very pleased with the results. The credit profile of our investment portfolio remains in excellent shape. With a net unrealized gain position in our fixed maturity securities portfolio at $5.7 billion at quarter end. This quarter, we reported a net realized after-tax investment gain, excluding the amount of derivative impact of $6 million, and our portfolio watch list remains quite small. ", "So while the quality of the existing portfolio continues to be quite strong, the challenge remains in investing new cash flows at attractive rates. This is not a new topic. But so far, it's only had a marginal impact on our portfolio yields. We benefit from having a low level of new cash flow to invest, relative to the size of our existing portfolios, as well as the hedges we have in place on our long-duration LTC portfolio. This allows us to pick our spots as we did this quarter by investing early in the quarter. As a result, our portfolio yields continue to hold up well with our aggregate portfolio yield of 6.68%, down only 3 basis points from the beginning of the year. ", "The yields on the investment portfolios backing our various products lines also showed some more stability. As I mentioned previously, we did move the new claim discount rate down by 25 basis points in the Unum US Group Long-term Disability line this quarter to begin to recognize the drop in interest rates. The portfolio yield net of our discount rate for this line expanded by 2 basis points in the quarter to 98 basis points, so we continue to remain well-positioned, but we're also taking actions on some of the challenges we see on the horizon. We'll spend more time in our upcoming Investor Day meeting dissecting the impacts of the current environment on our portfolio. ", "Our balance sheet and capital position remain in a very healthy position. Book value per share continues to grow, increasing 15.2% from September 30, 2010, to $32.36 at September 30, 2011, and leverage remains stable at 29.2%. ", "Statutory operating earnings for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies declined somewhat to $139 million from $157 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting some of the loss pressure that I mentioned. ", "The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies remains strong at approximately 396% at quarter end at the upper end of our targeted 375% to 400% range. ", "Holding company cash and marketable securities totaled $647 million at September 30. With lower stock price in the third quarter, we stepped up our share repurchase activity and bought back $200 million in the quarter. Which brings the total year-to-date number to $620 million. ", "Finally, as we look to the fourth quarter, we're confirming the outlook we provided going into 2011, which calls for operating earnings per share growth of 6% to 12%. We'll discuss our outlook for 2012 at our Investor Day on November 16 in New York, and look forward to seeing you there. I'll now turn it back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Thomas Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. In closing, despite pressure in a few areas, especially with our U.K. business, I'm generally pleased with our overall results and the 9% increase in earnings per share. Our investment portfolio and capital position remain significant assets in this environment and position us well for what is likely to remain a very difficult environment. Operator, this completes our prepared remarks and let's move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  We'll go first today to Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So just jump in, I guess, to the U.K. The higher loss severity there, the paid incidence that was described, can we get more color around what's driving that. And is that the result, potentially of lack of return to work ability by workers there?", "Thomas Watjen", "Good morning, Randy. Jack, do you want to pick up on Randy's question?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes, it really wasn't a result of a lack of return to work. In fact, during the quarter, our recoveries were very solid, so the return to work -- it was around the initial claim decision. We get claims in the door. We go through the process of deciding whether the claim meets our definition of disability or not. As we went through that process, we had an abnormally high level of approved claims and a lower level of declined claims. So it's sort of mix of approved and declined. And the average size on the approvals was elevated whereas the average size on the declines was abnormally low. So we think it's pure volatility. It's not a reflection of the economy or any claim trend that we can see. We'd liken it to throwing 4 coins in the air and they all show up on tails. It doesn't happen very often that all the variants go in the same direction and it doesn't really say much about what we expect in the future.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. But it's not, I guess just to be clear, it's not an issue of increased claim incidents. It's just same number of claims that skewed more towards high cost non-denial situation?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes. In fact, year-to-date, our submitted claim incidents, or the incidents of claims coming through our door is down year-to-date. In fact, in every quarter of 2011, submitted incidents has been below the year-ago quarter in 2010. So the submitted claim volumes are behaving very well. It's just a fluke around the ones that were provable versus declinable?", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I had a question for Kevin. If you could maybe talk about pricing trends. We've heard from several of your competitors that they intend to raise prices in the disability market. I'm wondering if you have actually seen pricing improve? And then second for Jack, if you could just talk about how competitors are behaving in the market. You've obviously been raising prices. Have you seen competitors follow through or have you not seen that, because your sales results sort of suggest that other companies might still be at lower price points than where you guys are?", "Thomas Watjen", "Thanks Jimmy. Kevin, take the first piece of that?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, I'd say prices seem to be maybe hardening a bit, particularly in the core markets. A number of carriers have expressed the need to either adjust their discount rates or to raise their rates to adjust for claim volatility. And I think we've seen some of that coming through during the third quarter. I wouldn't say it's a significant element, but it's at least, I think, useful to us, in terms of maybe some hardening in the marketplace, making it a little bit easier to place renewals and to maintain existing business. So yes, a little bit harder in the core market I'd say.", "Richard McKenney", "Thanks, Kevin. Jack, do you want to pick up on the U.K. piece of that?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes, I think it took a while to happen, but I think we're showing some signs of hardening in the market, although our sales were down for the third quarter, they were pretty much in line with what our expectations were. The other positive note is we're continuing to accelerate our renewal program. Since it's getting stronger and so has improved throughout the year and you've seen that reflected in our earned premium line. We've also heard of a couple of different competitors that have recently announced to the brokerage community that they're rolling out their own renewal programs, so there are signs that the pricing environment in the U.K. is reacting to the economic environment and improving.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then if we think about -- I think, you've just recently started an ad campaign, but penetration rates in the U.K. market are actually pretty low. Are you expecting that to move up over the next few years, and have you seen any move in that direction as you've started to like, raise awareness of the product?", "John F. McGarry", "We just started the ad campaign, It's been very favorably received by the market. If people haven't seen it, it's on backup plan Unum on YouTube. We have seen -- we have been deepening penetration, a larger portion of our sales coming -- is coming from deepening penetration on existing customers which is consistent with our strategy. We're also encouraged by our interaction with the brokerage community because more and more of our key brokers are talking about that as a key growth strategy for 2012.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to see if you guys could comment just a little bit more, in terms of lowering the discount on the new claims. I guess, given the margin you guys still have and the cushion relative to the target?", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, do you want to pick up on that?", "Richard McKenney", "Yes, when you look at what we did on the quarter, one of the things that we would've talked about this last quarter, we do have a pretty significant margin. It gives us a lot of flexibility, in terms of how we go through that. When we look at pricing in the marketplace, we have to be reflective of the environment that we're in. And we chose this quarter to actually lower the discount rate by 25 basis points, notwithstanding the fact that we still maintain a significant margin. In fact, on the quarter, it went up by a couple of basis points. But as we take it into our new claim discount rates and as we ultimately take it into the market, we do need to reflect what's going on in the environment with regard to interest rates. So the flexibility has not changed at all, but I think that we are reflective of the severe drop we saw, even since the second quarter.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then I guess in terms of interest rates in sort of the ILTC book, you guys pointed to sort of persistency remaining high, loss trends higher. I mean, how should we be thinking about the reserves you have set aside for that book of business, a potential need to maybe strengthen those or write-off back? And then along those lines, what's the opportunity, given that you're not writing any more new business there to maybe move that to a closed block?", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, you want to take on that?", "Richard McKenney", "Sure. Just a few thoughts in LTC. I think it's important to paint the whole picture. I think we've been pretty open about the challenges in this business. Like the rest of the industry, we have seen low loss rate in the product. It caused us to build reserves faster than we would have initially thought. And that is mostly in the individual LTC product line which I think you did specify. We stopped selling that a few years ago and we've been taking pricing actions as I mentioned, to stabilize that loss ratio and I gave you through those details in my prepared comments. What we have been seeing over the last couple of quarters, there's some pressure on the loss trends which we'll handle in the same way, with regard to pricing actions. But it will take time for those pricing actions to take hold. I think the bigger change we saw in the quarter was the sharp move down, particularly 30-year treasuries dropped almost 150 basis points. In this line like any line that makes it more tough on a long-tailed insurance-type product. So the product is still profitable, but I think we've been clear, it's going to be a difficult product to manage in today's environment.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just a few, Jack, I guess, maybe this is a semantic issue, but I'm just trying to figure this out. I mean, you're talking about severity being up. That's -- in my mind, that's usually an indicator of just being one of those things. You take claims submission, the acceptance is -- the actual submissions are down, the acceptances are up. I mean, like I said, maybe it's semantic, but that, to me, would seem to indicate that frequency is actually up. What could drive that difference?", "John F. McGarry", "I wouldn't suggest actually that frequency was up. Severity was up this quarter. Year-to-date, our acceptances are down. Our paid claims are down and our submitted claims are down. So we had volatility this quarter. The severity was a combination of just as you're working through the claims, more of the claims were medically justified. We had a lot of cancer claims during the quarter that are pretty clear cut. And actually, I'd suggest that it's just the opposite of what you would expect with an economically-driven trend, because if you had an economically-driven trend, you'd expect submitted claim volumes to rise as economic pressures rose. You'd expect more of the claims that you've got were actually declinable and not medically justified. So although your submitted claims would rise, your paid claims would rise less quickly and your acceptance rate would actually lower. What we saw in this quarter was just the opposite of that. Submitted claims were down year-over-year and our acceptance rate was up because the claims that we did make decisions on in the quarter were justified medical claims. So I do think a lot of it is just a lot of things lined up against us in one direction. Some of them go back and forth. It's unusual to have them all point in the same direction like that at once. And we saw that begin to subside toward the end of the quarter and don't expect it to continue into the fourth quarter.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then if I could add just a couple of more quickies. Rick, maybe you could talk about what should we be thinking about the tax rate on a go forward basis or at least for the fourth quarter? And maybe, Randy, I think you touched on -- there was a benefit that you had in some older policies that you no longer have. Was that unlimited chemo?", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, why don't you pick up on the tax rate and then maybe I'll do the question about the Colonial one, we may move that to Randy, which ever, I'll let you handle that.", "Richard McKenney", "Yes. On the tax rate in the quarter, we reported just over 30%. We did benefit from a tax rate that was affected in the U.K., which had an impact on our deferred tax liabilities which brought that down. So the 30%, if you back that out, right around 32%, I think is probably a reasonable number. That's down from where it's been in the past because we do have some low income housing tax credits, but 32% is a pretty good range as you look going forward. And then your question specifically around the policies affected, yes and that was correct. It was the unlimited chemo and those type of products.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Maybe just a clarification in the U.K. I guess, based on what you're seeing in early Q4, and I guess, Jack, how you're describing the claims. I mean, is it your expectation that the U.K. normalizes and we should be thinking about loss ratios kind of in line with what we've seen in the past or is there anything that you're seeing whether its severity or what have you that maybe it's going to be elevated?", "John F. McGarry", "That would be my expectation.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so normal then. And I guess the only -- just a clarification, I know -- I mean you're relatively new to the U.K., you've obviously kind of made some changes over there. Is there anything that's changed in the claim handling practices that may have driven that ratio of accepted versus submitted claims to change at all?", "John F. McGarry", "No, there really hasn't. In fact -- I think, we've made changes in our claims organization that has gone in the other direction, in terms of shoring up the claims organization. We actually, for the quarter, had a pretty strong recovery quarter. So our ability to get people back to work was actually  pretty solid for the quarter. This was all around that initial decision about accepting or rejecting liability.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just finally, one follow-up on Long-term Care. The interest adjusted loss ratio on kind of a rolling fourth quarter average has trended up pretty meaningfully. And I know you're putting in place, rate increases. I guess the real question is, are the rate increases that you've been filing, are they enough and what is the strategy around that if they aren't?", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, do you want to pick up on that one?", "Richard McKenney", "Sure. When you look at where our loss ratios, interest-adjusted loss ratio is in the quarter, it is a little bit higher than what we expected going into the process. I think the expectation was certainly around the persistency causing some pressure and that's really what the pricing actions were targeted towards. We'll have to continue to look at what the right pricing level is for these policies, given what we're seeing both on persistency, as well as the loss trends and reflect that going forward. I think it's going to be an ongoing discussion when we look at this block of business.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "When would be the next opportunity, I guess, to try to submit additional rate increases if the decision was that it's not purely a persistency issue, but also an incidence issue?", "Thomas Watjen", "In case we have to breakdown every specific stay. I think there's a regular process with each day that are actually going through, so I don't know, Mark, what's the real theme around that. There's an ongoing strategy, I think, Rick as you said, and I think Kevin has said in previous calls, they just continually move through the book and almost once you've been through it, you start again actually. So I think that strategy, I think, remains the right one with that individual Long-term Care block.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "You're still using a 6% to 12% EPS range for the full year which is very wide, given that we've had 3 quarters in, and suggests if my math is right, sort of a $0.68 to $0.84 range for Q4. I mean, $0.84 seems challenging. In prior years you targeted like lower middle part of the range or give us some color. Plus the fact that you haven't suggested that there are a lot of wildcards going into Q4 and you just want to make sure the visibility -- the signal at the visibility is a little murky going into the fourth quarter?", "Thomas Watjen", "I would say -- Rick, why don't you pick up on that. I think, less than that and actually, I think, as you know, Bob, really a couple of years ago, we began the practice of getting off a quarterly guidance and getting to an annual guidance. So every Investor Day, as you know, we break down our business into component pieces and share some outlook for the component pieces as well as the bottom line. So I think what you're seeing is a continuation of staying with an annual sort of set of target. And really, I don't think you should interpret that as being having lack of confidence in the fourth quarter. I think we've got some pretty good visibility into the fourth quarter.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Okay, but one follow-up, could you just expand on what the claims incidence increase was within Long-term Care?", "Thomas Watjen", "Sure, Rick, you want to pick up on that?", "Richard McKenney", "Yes. I look at it in terms of the lost trends that it did increase. So incidence is one piece of that. We've had a couple of quarters of building incidence. I think we've also had lower mortality in that block which goes back to almost a persistency-type element. So it was really multiple areas, nothing specific that I'd point to. I would note that this is a block of business where we actually have very low amounts of claims that come through. It's still fairly early in the block, particularly as you get to some of our newer policy years. So we're dealing with the data that we are seeing today.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Schuman with KBW.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "A clarification. I think, Rick mentioned something about [Indiscernible] voluntary and I didn't catch that. What was that the case and [indiscernible] amount please?", "Thomas Watjen", "Sure. Rick, why don't you pick...", "Richard McKenney", "The dock and lock [ph] that we saw was involuntary in our Interest-Sensitive Whole Life business, FAS 97 unlocking was roughly $5 million in the quarter.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Was that pretax or?", "Richard McKenney", "Pretax.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Pretax, okay. And then elsewhere in the company, where there are any other that, kind of balance sheet-type adjustments like that in the quarter?", "Richard McKenney", "There was, actually, I should mention in that line, in the same -- supplementary and voluntary line IDI block recently issued, also given some higher persistency in the block, we actually had slower amortization in there. And that was $4 million to $5 million as well.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "$4 million to $5 million, okay. And I'm wondering in terms of what should be the expectation for U.S. group disability, in other words, we had a number of years where there was a clear guidance about loss ratio improvement and you delivered on that. Then we transitioned to a period of kind of a flat loss ratio expectations and you delivered very clearly, against that. I think last year, the loss ratio was flat as a pancake. We seen a couple of quarters now, very slight sequential deterioration even if you x out the change in the discount rate. Are we entering into a period now, where we should expect a little movement there or are we still in the flat period?", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, you want to pick up on that, maybe ask Kevin also to supplement of that?", "Richard McKenney", "Yes, I think that what you said is right. The discount rate was the biggest move that you saw in the quarter. I think we've been saying all along, there has been volatility, so we saw a little bit of that in the quarter. We'll have to see how that settles back down as we head into the fourth quarter. But that slight uptick is probably something that we'll continue to see in that range. But we're still talking about pretty small movements within the overall loss ratio.", "Thomas Watjen", "And Kevin, you might want to pick up on that too, because I think the big difference today versus where we were in the past was that the profile of our book of business is very different and obviously, with a lot more core market business in there.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "All right, thanks. Jeff, yes, I think our expectations around the loss ratio is still fairly flat in an -- plus or minus in around the 85% range. We're a little bit above that now, primarily because of the discount rate move. We'll be moving prices up in the mid single-digit range on both in-force and new business and that will mitigate that effect and actually get back some of the cost of the discount rate. For 3 consecutive years, we've had kind of a submitted incidence spike in the third quarter than then, has flattened out and declined during the subsequent fourth and first quarters. And that happened in third quarter of '09, third quarter of '10 as well. And so as we saw it happen here in third quarter of 2011, I think we felt it appropriate to bake into our price increases and renewals for next year, not only the discount rate change, but also the expectation that we might see that same flow. We've also had a little bit of volatility, upward volatility in incidence and prevalence on the STD line. And although we haven't seen much of that change, in terms of flow through to the LTD line, we're cautiously watching that as well, and we think right now, in this marketplace, is a good time to move our rates upward, much in the same way that our competitors are. So you put all that together and I'd say, we're really effective at placing our renewals as you know. We're effective at adjusting our sales forces' attention towards where we go hunting if you will. Making sure we pay attention to sales and lower volatility segments. And also, as you know, we've been ramping up our voluntary sales which don't have the same economic impact or risk as the LTDs. So all in all, I think we're well-positioned, both on the growth front and mix of business front as Tom mentioned. But also, I'd say, the loss ratio ought to stay, it's pretty stable in and around that 85 plus or minus range.", "Operator", ".", "And we'll go next to Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "My first question relates to the U.K., I'm trying to understand still, I mean, we talked a lot about it, but I'm still trying to understand the outlook here, and the reason that I don't fully understand yet is that I believe Rick said we'll have to take a wait and see attitude. And I believe Jack expressed optimism about a return to a lower loss ratio. I guess my first question is, which one is it. Are we going to take a wait and see attitude or are we thinking we've got to go back to normal in the fourth quarter? And relatedly, if you are optimistic about a return to a lower loss ratio, what's the basis for that optimism? In other words, I understand that you sort of ruled out the economic considerations. But because it may be something else, maybe there's a morbidity issue that you're not fully understanding. Why is it the right answer here we're just going to have to wait and see and it's too early to declare victory?", "Thomas Watjen", "Let me make a comment then I'll ask actually Rick to pick up a little then. I think both of you have heard Rick and Jack as they spoke about the performance in the U.K., use the word volatility. And I think you can't ignore that actually. This is -- the U.K. business is our smallest of our 3 businesses, whether you measure that by capital, whether you measure that by premium, whether you measure that by earnings contribution. And what that means is obviously, you can have months, quarters and weeks obviously, given the nature of this business, which just simply affects your overall results for the quarter, because of the relatively smaller block of business that operation is. And so again, I think what you're hearing us say first and foremost, is when you have a quarter like this and as Jack went through some of the assessment in that quarter, I think we clearly view it not being sort of systemic. We clearly believe it's not a carryover to some of the European issues. We clearly don't see any significant trend here. And for the moment, we stated that more of volatile issue which again, I think, as Jack alluded to, we began to see the October results begin to tap back quite nicely actually. So I guess I want to put this whole thing in context which is when you see a smaller business like this, our business does have elements of volatility from time to time. Some of our bigger operations like the Unum US for example, you're not going to see as much because it's a bigger base of business as opposed to the U.K., which is dramatically smaller. So with that, I'd ask maybe Rick or Jack, if anything you'd like to add to that?", "Richard McKenney", "Well, I'll actually probably clarify because this is my comments which I think was off. And I think that I share very much what Tom and Jack was saying, and I do believe it would be volatility, and that volatility I expect -- it's not a wait and see attitude, I expect to see that come back again in the fourth quarter. So I'd be very clear about that.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I have 2 questions if I could. You've talked to us in the past about the natural growth of your business, normal employment, reasonable wage growth environment. Can you just update us on what you think you're seeing, in terms of pressure given sort of stubbornly high unemployment levels and I think most recently, a lack of really any wage growth?", "Thomas Watjen", "Yes, thank you, John. Kevin, do you want to pick up on John's question?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. John, we're seeing the same pressure we've seen in each of the last couple of years. I think a few years ago, we said that we typically saw something in the 2-plus percent range, in terms of upward help tailwind if you will, on the top line from wage inflation and employment growth, as well as growth in our in-force accounts from NBOC. And during 2009 and 2010, we actually had a negative impact. I think in 2009, it was like a minus 2% effect, in 2010, it was maybe a minus 1% or so. Coming into this year, we thought we might be on the plus side. And it started out that way, but as the years gone on, it's basically flat, even trending slightly negative perhaps. So we've got that same kind of effect of a loss of tailwind in -- no headwind at the moment, but no tailwind either.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so -- and I guess my -- I guess, the way to think about that with some mid single-digit sort of price increases for next year, at least on a good portion of your book, and sustained reasonably strong persistency levels that we still see some premium growth in 2012, despite the lack of any help from this particular item?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, I think we'll see some very modest -- very modest, one percentage kind of earned premium growth, something like that. I think, primarily driven by solid persistency. Some effective renewal placement that gooses it a little bit, and then a strong sales year during 2011, that will contribute to 2012.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just turning to the long-term care business and the rate increases that you've gone through. I mean, you gave us some good data on the States and the percentage of expected. Can you just remind us of how that should earn through your book of business, and if 88% of what you've been filing for, can you give us a sense for what that is in percentage terms on the rate?", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, would you pick that up, please?", "Richard McKenney", "Yes, It is our intention though is that rate increase we expect to see somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range of premium that will ultimately come through, it's like you'd just sense that 88% is of those levels. And we're new, it's still not done yet, and so we'll have to see how that actually play out.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And what's the timeframe that we should think if we're getting to -- if we've got right now, 88% of $25 million to $30 million, does that all come through in 2012, does it come through over a longer period than that?", "Richard McKenney", "No, it's going to be over a longer period  and it will probably come through mid -- starting 2012, and through the middle towards the end of 2013. It takes some time.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Thomas Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask a quick one on the U.K., and then circle back on Long-term Care. So the expectation for the U.K., just so I'm clear, is that we get back to roughly around 2Q levels, call it low to mid $50 million range, or is there just some uncertainty, volatility expected there just based on what you're seeing, more just looking out, what should we expect for 4Q?", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, you want to touch the U.K. outlook?", "Richard McKenney", "Sure, I'd just give you a sense such as, as that volatility comes back in with loss ratio, it'll come back down. We're around the 70% range. And you would see it kind of ticking up closer to that $50 million number.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it, okay. And just on the Long-term Care, just so I'm clear as to how we should be thinking about it. If you look at where the interest adjusted benefit ratio has gone up to 86% now. If we assume claims remained kind of where they are today, just a natural increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio based on low lapse rates. And assuming interest rates remain where they are today approximately, I would expect the interest adjusted benefit ratio to climb toward high 80s to 90% maybe. Is that a level with which would precipitate a reserve charge? So that's question number one. And then question number 2, assuming that this is a potential scenario to think about, are you guys still comfortable moving ahead with your buyback. Because I assume that if there was a GAAP reserve strengthening, there might also be a statutory impact. But any light you can shed on that would be appreciated?", "Thomas Watjen", "Rick, do you want to touch on that?", "Richard McKenney", "Yes. I think when you look at the -- where the loss ratio will trend towards, and I think we said last quarter, we expect kind of mid 80-type level. I did mention we had some loss pressure. We'll have to see how that plays out next quarter. We don't expect that necessarily, that we'll continue at that level. And then it would be offset by the pricing increases, so you've got a few dynamics going on in terms of what's going to impact the loss ratio. That product line is still profitable. And so as a result of that, we'll have to continue to monitor how it continues to go and even as we head into the fourth quarter and go through experience studies, it's one that we pay very close attention to.", "Thomas Watjen", "And Rick, I think, as it relates to the share buyback, I think we expect to be in the market in the fourth quarter. Just to remind everybody though, fourth quarter last year, we have fewer opportunities to purchase given the staggering of Investor Day and things like that, the volumes are going to be down but I think at this point, we fully expect to be in the market and continue to buy.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. So I shouldn't be thinking about this from the standpoint of being a potential large statutory drain, at least not over the near term?", "Thomas Watjen", "Yes, we'll lay it out at Investor Day in a couple of weeks our capital plans and even to result of all that. But I would probably save that discussion for then, but we don't expect any radical change around our statutory cash flow.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Any -- do you think you'd care to venture in terms of customer end markets, where you might have seen an uptick in frequency either in the U.S. or U.K.? And then secondly, any change in behavior out of the Social Security Administration, in their willingness to approve disability claims?", "Thomas Watjen", "Kevin, do you want to just talk a little bit about the U.S. piece, including maybe the Social Security side, and then maybe Jack can connect on the U.K.?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, will do. Mark, nothing particularly noticeable on a by industry segment basis. This quarter, manufacturing incidence rates were up a little bit, transportation incidence rates were up a little bit, retail was up a little bit. Education was down a little bit. Data processing was down a little bit. That's the same kind of volatility we see every quarter, we didn't see anything sort of radical and I don't expect really, to see anything too significant either. We always keep our eyes on it, anyway, we adjust our prices accordingly for those segments that seem to be behaving a little bit out of line. We either increase rates or shift our sales  focus away from it or both. And on the Social Security Administration, no, I haven't seen much change at all, our offset levels continue to be at very strong levels.", "Thomas Watjen", "Jack, do you want just to talk also from the U.K. side?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes, I think from the U.K. side, we haven't seen anything from any consumer markets. U.K. is a little bit different market than the U.S., and note that we are -- we don't have the same penetration in customers that's largely senior executives and senior managers. So our book tends to be a little bit more homogeneous, even though -- even if it is split by industry, because it's largely covering upper management and so I think that's one of the reasons why we have tend to seen more stability through economic downturns than perhaps, the U.S. market has.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Colin Devine of Citi.", "Colin W. Devine - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "A couple of questions. I guess, first, for Kevin. You had some very strong voluntary sales this quarter. In fact, I think your third quarter was a record. But first quarter is being obviously, the strongest one but very strong third quarter. That thing's applied in the face of all the other trends you're seeing for your business and perhaps you can telling us what's selling so much? Second, and I don't want to beat a dead horse here on Long-term Care. Rick. I appreciate you said it's profitable but I think it'd be helpful to know just how profitable it is. We're getting really close to the line here? And following up on Tom Gallagher's question, is not just reserves but it's also, what's the size dock asset backing that line, and how close are we getting to having to impair that because certainly, I assume, you're projecting we're into a period of a lower long-term rates, given that the discount rate action you took on group disability. So I'd like to understand a little bit more, just the outlook on that? And then finally, for Tom Watjen. Unum, there was, I guess, chatter in the media that you might have been a bit around the RS Life property, they're just out there, looking at some M&A as well, or do you have any comments on that?", "Thomas Watjen", "Sure. Will do. Kevin, you want to pick up the first one on voluntary. But maybe also, if I could just maybe ask you to speak to the small commercial market too, because there are pockets of growth that are quite visible in your business?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Thanks, Tom. Colin, on the VV side first of all, I don't think it's any particular product on the portfolio. I think it's the whole portfolio. And I think what it reflects maybe, is a combination of things. Our strategic emphasis, our continued strategic emphasis on ramping up the voluntary market given the trends that we see in employee benefits in general. And the shift from, if you will define benefits, to define contribution at the employer level, I think it also reflects our expanded field focus. If you recall, over the last 2 years, we've expanded the portfolio of all of our core market reps to include both group and voluntary products is part of our Simply Unum initiative. And in fact, during this quarter, 70% of our group sales included an attached voluntary sale. So really strong integration and strategic emphasis on the part of our field force, and I think that's, for the most part, what's driving it. And you couple that with a strong 13% growth in our core market group business with -- if you think about that growth in 13%, you think about voluntary growing and you think about the increasing integration. I think that's what's driving the growth in voluntary.", "Colin W. Devine - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "What sort of ROE targets are you pricing for? It's hard to sort of parse that out, given IDI and LTC within that segment?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "We priced voluntary low to the mid-teens.", "Thomas Watjen", "Thanks, Kevin. Rick, do you want to pick up on the Long-term Care piece of Colin's question?", "Richard McKenney", "Sure, I'll try -- Colin, I'll try and give you a couple more dimensions to that, when we talk about the business, it is profitable. I would tell you that the returns on that business are kind of a low single-digit type ROEs. I think we've talked about that in the past. And given the pressure that's -- it remains at those levels which we'll try and combat with pricing actions. It's around the sizing of it, you have a reserve balance on that line of about $4.5 billion and the deck[ph] asset is about $300 million. And so those are all the pieces that we watch, in terms of going through and analyzing the changes that we're seeing.", "Colin W. Devine - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, and that would be your most Interest-Sensitive line right now, right?", "Richard McKenney", "I would say yes, the most challenging line to put new cash flows behind, given the long-term nature of it, yes.", "Thomas Watjen", "And Colin, to your last piece. As you know, no surprise, we really can't talk about specific acquisitions. But I do think, just a couple points I'd make and certainly, we look forward to embellishing these at Investor Day. But I think first off, we like the 3 businesses that they were in. We see good growth opportunities. Kevin talked about the growth we're seeing in the small commercial and voluntary. Randy had good small commercial growth in his market and obviously, the U.K. is going through some adjustments. But I want to always start, when we talk about the M&A, was the fact, we actually like our 3 businesses. I think we've got some good prospects, especially if you look beyond some of the economic challenges that I think everybody is facing right now. Having said that, as you know also, we've got a pretty strong financial foundation from which, to not just support our businesses, but we generate a fair amount of excess capital. And we have, over the last couple of years, been much more active looking at acquisitions that could fit within our framework of how we assess risk, how we think about where we want to play in the marketplace and not get too far afield from the things that we know well. Which means we're looking at things that extend our product focus, extend our geographic focus and I would say, especially in this environment, even though there's not a lot of things out there, I think the marketplace views us as one of the people who frankly, are a player and therefore, we do get a chance to look at some things. As you can see though, we haven't done anything which means we have a very high bar that we've set for ourselves, in terms of doing things that could complement the things we do in place right now. And frankly, measure any acquisition against our existing standalone plan with redeployment of capital which creates a pretty high threshold. But we're in the flow and it's always better to be able to look at things and say no and walk away than it is to miss something that maybe it'd be a nice complement to our business and our financial goals.", "Colin W. Devine - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, and by geographic, since you mentioned it. That does mean that you would consider outside of the United States?", "Thomas Watjen", "We would, absolutely, yes. Provided it's got the characteristics that we are looking for, in terms of the products and the marketplace dynamics that obviously, we're very comfortable with in the U.S. and the U.K. So it's got to have those characteristics, but we would look outside the U.S., yes.", "Operator", "We'll now take a follow-up from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just 2 quick ones. The sovereign exposure, the $1.5 billion or so that you have in the portfolio, can you maybe just maybe break that down by geography, particularly focused on Europe?", "Thomas Watjen", "We can, Chris and was it with Tom, scans through his document here so we can get that in a second.", "Thomas A. H. White", "Why don't you ask your second question while [indiscernible] Tom, just real quick.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then Tom, you made some comments in terms of sort of the open window period for share repurchase in the fourth quarter being smaller than other quarters. And if you look at, you mentioned in the release, the attractive share price kind of taking advantage of that in the third quarter. Is there potential to maybe do an ASR or something like that in fourth quarter, given where shares are today?", "Thomas Watjen", "Chris, let me pass that to Rick and ask Rick to speak to that.", "Richard McKenney", "Yes, I think that all tools are available to us, in terms of how we buy back our stock. It does come back to the attractiveness of where the price is. We have the capital and the ability and as we showed  in the third quarter, we'll take advantage of those windows. I think that we prefer to be in the open market buying back our shares. And so with a limited number of windows, that may in fact be the case. But any big movements, ASRs are certainly available to us.", "Thomas Watjen", "Chris, on the international exposure, looking at the aggregation of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain, we have no direct sovereign exposure. We do have, on a book value basis, about $545 million of corporate exposure. And just looking through the list, there are only 2 securities of the probably 20 or so that we have positions in, that are below investment grade and both of those are in the BB range. And those 2 together would be about $30 million, again, of the $545 million, so everything else is investment grade corporates in those countries.", "Operator", "Our final question today will be a follow-up from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "You guys were the only ones on the docket today. And by the way, I can't tell you how much I appreciate that versus tonight. The follow-up question I have for you is about the U.K. Just thinking about the economic backdrop there, maybe setting aside the volatility of the quarterly submitted and that sort of thing. Just given the increasing pressure, downward pressure potential for the U.K., to fall back into recession, unemployment rates seem to be rising, not stabilizing just quite yet. Can you give us a sense, maybe Jack can give us a sense for the pricing environment there? I know you guys were first movers. You said maybe you're seeing the market move now, but can you give us a sense for sizing the pricing actions that you've been taking?", "Thomas Watjen", "Jack, do you want to pick up on that?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes, I would. One of the things I'd point out is that the public sector is driving a lot of the unemployment in the U.K. currently, and  we are not involved in the public sector. We don't currently ensure it. So we're a little bit immune to some of that driver. From the perspective of the pricing environment, the market had been softening through 2008 to 2010. We turned the corner on it in the second half of last year. We paid some price for that from a new sales perspective. And initially, particularly early in the year from our persistency perspective, that persistency outlook has improved. There are competitors in the marketplace with renewals as well. People are reacting to the low interest rate environment. And I think there are even some small signs that perhaps picked at the large case. The market may be getting firmer there as well. So we're encouraged by where we are. We've accelerated our renewal program through the year. We've had better results in the second half of the year than we did in the first. And so I think there are some pretty positive signs going into 2012. Not that it's going to be easy mind you, and there's still pressure from a growth perspective with the lack of natural growth and salary increases. But we're positive about that direction the U.K. market is going.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Jack, maybe just relative to Kevin's comments on mid-single digits. Pricing in the U.S., any ballpark figure you can give us at least in terms of the U.K.?", "John F. McGarry", "I would say a similar level in the U.K.", "Thomas Watjen", "Actually, thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. And we certainly look forward to seeing hopefully, many of you at our Investor Day meeting on November 9 to 16 in New York, and please contact Tom White or anybody from the Investor Relations staff if you have any questions about our Investor Day meeting.", "And with that, operator, this will conclude our third quarter call.", "Operator", "Thank you, gentlemen.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas White", "Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Analyst and Investor Conference Call for Unum Group. Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the section titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. Our SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at unum.com. ", "I also remind you that statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found on our website also in the Investors section. ", "Participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, the President and CEO of Unum; Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO; and also the presidents of our 3 business segments, Kevin McCarthy for Unum US; Randy Horn for Colonial Life; and Jack McGarry for Unum UK. And now I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning. While our overall results were somewhat below our expectations, the vast majority of our businesses met or exceeded expectations, and I sum up the quarter as follows: First, we grew operating earnings per share by 4.3% with solid performance in our Unum US and Colonial businesses, which was off somewhat by -- offset somewhat by the lower-than-expected performance in our Unum UK and Closed Block segments. While this quarter's growth and operating earnings per share was below our outlook, we expect growth trends to improve throughout the year, and we are therefore are maintaining our 6% to 12% operating earnings per share growth outlook for 2012, though at the low end of the range. ", "Second, our core business segments generated healthy returns on equity of between 13.5% and 17.5% for the first quarter. Additionally, we are seeing signs of improving growth trends across these businesses. At Unum US, we saw solid sales results in the 2 segments targeted for growth, our core group and voluntary benefit lines, which were up 14% in the first quarter, an improvement over the 8.3% growth rate in 2011. ", "Colonial Life sales were somewhat below our expectations, but we are seeing positive trends in the core commercial market, a targeted market for us, and our overall premium grew almost 6% in the quarter. Finally, with firming in the pricing environment in the U.K., we are seeing better new sales opportunities in that market. ", "Thirdly, I'd point out that our capital position remains strong, with risk-based capital of 406% and holding company cash and marketable securities of $575 million. This gives us significant financial flexibility, flexibility that allowed us to repurchase $175 million of stock during the first quarter. Since year-end 2007, we have repurchased over $1.8 billion of stock and reduced our shares outstanding by over 20%. ", "And lastly, with our relatively consistent cash flow generation from operations, as you know, we have also established a pattern of returning capital to our shareholders through regular dividend increases. You saw yesterday that we announced a 23.8% increase in our quarterly dividend, which brings our cumulative dividend increase since year-end 2007 to over 73%. ", "So in summary, in spite of the results in our Unum UK and Closed Block businesses, we continue to feel good about where things stand at the company. We are growing operating earnings per share, generating attractive returns on equity and maintaining the financial flexibility needed to continue to consistently return capital to our shareholders. I can assure you that we will be very focused on improving the performance of those areas not meeting our expectations, while also building on the momentum we have established around the rest of the company. ", "Now I'll ask Tom to provide an overview on our operating results. Tom?", "Thomas White", "Great, thank you, Tom. As we discuss our financial results this quarter, I'll first remind you that prior-period results have been adjusted for our retrospective adoption of the accounting standards update for deferred acquisition costs and also for our treatment of the nonoperating retirement-related gains and losses which we now exclude from the operational performance of our businesses. ", "Adjusted prior-period results are available on our website in an 8-K and supplemental exhibit, which we filed on April 17. As a benchmark, for full year 2011, our after-tax operating income per share -- this is adjusted for the retrospective adoption of the DAC accounting standards update and excluding the after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses, after-tax realized investment gains and losses and certain other items was $2.98 per share. ", "As you can see from our press release yesterday afternoon, we\u2019ve reported net income of $213.9 million for the first quarter of 2011 or $0.73 per diluted common share, compared to net income in the year-ago quarter of $223.6 million or $0.71 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the first quarter of 2012 are after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses of $7.6 million and net realized investment gains of $8.3 million. ", "Included in last year's first quarter are nonoperating retirement-related losses of $5.2 million and net realized investment gains of $9.7 million. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $213.2 million for the quarter or $0.73 per diluted common share compared to $219.1 million or $0.70 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter. ", "Now turning to the operating segments. Operating income for the Unum US segment increased 5.8% to $205.9 million in the first quarter; and premium income increased by 4%, driven by positive comparisons in all 3 lines of business within this segment. Operating income in the Group Disability line was $74.7 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $73.8 million last year, as a 1% increase in premium income helped offset a 1 percentage point increase in the benefit ratio. The increase in premium income, which is the first year-over-year increase in several years, resulted from the recent favorable sales trends, solid persistency and also a slight benefit we experienced this quarter from employment and wage growth in our in-force customer base. ", "The group disability benefit ratio increased to 84.9% from 83.9% in the year-ago period, due primarily to unfavorable risk experience in the short-term disability line of business and the impact of the new claim discount rate adjustment that we made during the third quarter last year. ", "Within the group life and AD&D line, operating income increased 1.6% to $52.4 million in the first quarter, benefiting from an increase of 7.1% in premium income, which offset an increase in the benefit ratio to 72% from 70% last year. The increase in the benefit ratio was due to higher incidence rates. ", "In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, first quarter income increased 13.7% to $78.8 million. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by solid growth in premium income and favorable risk experienced in each of these product lines. Premium growth grew by 6.4% this quarter. ", "Moving to Unum UK, operating income in this segment declined to GBP 24.7 million from GBP 30.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio increased to 72.4% from 69.3% in year-ago quarter, while premium income in local currency increased by 4.2%. And Rick will examine the U.K. results in greater detail in his comments. ", "So concluding our core operations, Colonial Life reported an increase in operating income of 4.8% this quarter to $69.7 million, driven by premium growth of 5.7%, which offset a slight increase in the benefit ratio to 52.1% from 51.4% a year ago. ", "The results for the Closed Block segment this quarter showed a decline in operating income to $15.4 million from $31.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the Individual Disability block was 83.1% compared to 84.7% last year, while the interest adjusted loss ratio for Long-Term Care was 91.2% compared to 83% last year. ", "Premium income declined by 2.9% due to the ongoing wind-down of the Individual Disability block. ", "For the Corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $20.6 million in the first quarter compared to a loss of $21.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Net investment income is lower due to the lower asset levels, a lower proportion of assets invested at long-term interest rates and an increase in the amortization of the principal amount invested in tax credit partnerships. Interest to debt expense declined to $32.5 million in the quarter compared to $34.9 million a year ago, due primarily to last year's first quarter debt maturity. And expenses are lower than the prior year, primarily due to decreases in expense accruals. ", "As previously noted, our after-tax nonoperating retirement-related loss for the first quarter of 2012 was $7.6 million. And for your modeling purposes, you can expect this loss to continue at this quarterly rate for the balance of 2012. ", "Now I'd like to call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis of this quarter's results. Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Thank you, Tom. In my comments this morning, I'd like to cover the margin trends we experienced in our business segments this quarter, a view on the growth trends, and we'll also provide an update on our investment results and capital position. ", "First on operating results in the first quarter, I'll start with Unum US. It was a very good quarter for the Unum US segment, with operating earnings growth of 6% and generally solid risk experience. Sales growth and persistency trends were also encouraging, and I'll cover those in a moment. For Group Disability, the benefit ratio remained within the range we've seen over the past 2 years with a benefit ratio in the first quarter of 84.9% compared to the fourth quarter ratio of 84.7% and 83.9% in the year-ago quarter. ", "Submitted new claims incidence trends for long-term disability were slightly higher, but paid incidence trends were actually slightly lower. Claim recovery trends continued their favorable performance over the past several quarters. These trends were offset slightly this quarter by weaker results in our short-term disability claim experience, as we experienced higher paid incidence rates and higher average weekly indemnities. We've already begun taking action which we believe will firm up the result in short-term disability, and we don't expect to see this trending through to our long-term disability results. ", "Additionally, the new claim discount rate adjustments we made in the third quarter last year negatively impacts the benefit ratio by approximately 65 basis points. We made no additional changes in new claim discount rate this quarter, and the interest reserve margin remains stable at a spread of 97 basis points. Overall, we were pleased with the performance of the group disability line, which generated over a 13% return on equity for the first quarter. ", "For the group life and AD&D line, the earnings contribution this quarter remains stable at $52.4 million, up 2% from a year ago. Premiums grew by 7% this quarter due to the recent improvement in sales trends, as well as higher premium persistency. The benefit ratio at 72% was higher than we've seen in previous quarters, primarily due to higher incidence in group life. The overall margin for this line remains very healthy, generating an ROE north of 15%. ", "Moving to the Supplemental and Voluntary line within Unum US, we saw very good overall earnings results again this quarter, which increased 14% due to solid risk experience and strong premium growth. Premium growth was 6.4% in total and 9.2% for the voluntary benefits product line. The benefit ratio improved to 50.1%, primarily driven by favorable risk experience in the voluntary benefits life product line and the Individual Disability recently issued product line. The ROE for this business line stands at 13%, and it remains an attractive growth opportunity for the company. ", "Turning to the U.K., results were lower than we expected, with operating earnings declining to GBP 24.7 million, with lower net investment income and unfavorable group life experience. We attribute the results in our group life business this quarter to volatility, as the increased claims are not concentrated in any single customer or time period when the business was underwritten or sold. To give some context, this is a relatively small block of business at roughly GBP 130 million of annual premium income, so it's subject to variations in claim activity. We anticipate that these results will return to more normal levels of profitability as the year progresses, which would be more in the GBP 30 million of quarterly earnings and an ROE of around 20%. ", "Colonial Life produced another solid quarter as operating earnings in the first quarter increased 5%, with premium income increasing almost 6%. The benefit ratio was slightly higher this quarter at 52.1% compared to 51.4% in the year-ago quarter and was up slightly in each of the lines. The ROE for Colonial Life remains a very healthy 17.4% for the quarter.", "To round it out, this is the first quarter after loss recognition that we\u2019ve reported our Closed Block with the inclusion of our Long-term Care business. The results came in lower than a year ago and below our expectations due to higher claim incidence in Long-term Care. We attribute this to volatility this quarter, but we still need to establish a firm run rate in this business under its Closed Block status. ", "So turning to our sales trends, we were very pleased with trends we're seeing across our business lines. Sales at Unum US continued the strong trend we've seen for the past few quarters, with total sales for the first quarter increasing 12%. For the group disability and group life and AD&D combined, sales increased 11%, with sales in the under-2,000-life core market increasing 11.5% and comprising just under 70% of the sales mix. Voluntary benefit sales were also strong, increasing almost 16% for the quarter, with positive contributions across all product lines and market segments. And persistency for Unum US was also strong at 91.7% for Group Long-term Disability and 91.3% for group life. ", "Given these strong trends, along with a very slight benefit from the improving employment picture in the U.S., we produced 4.4% premium growth for the Unum US segment, its highest growth rate in several years. ", "In the U.K., we also continue to see better pricing trends in the U.K. market. And as a result, new sales activity has rebounded strongly against relatively low sales volumes from a year ago. In addition, persistency is firming up for the Group Long-term Disability line at 86% compared to 83.5% last year, as price is absorbed into the market. Given these trends, premium income in the U.K. in local currency increased just over 4% in the first quarter. ", "Finally, in Colonial Life, premiums grew 6%. New sales in Colonial Life were relatively flat, with new accounts increasing 3% but a smaller average case size impacting the total new account sales volume. ", "Moving on to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio, we continue to be pleased with the trends we're seeing. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains excellent, with a net unrealized gain position of our fixed maturity securities portfolio at $5.5 billion at quarter end and our watch list of potential problem credits continuing at historical low levels. Net realized after-tax investment gains and losses excluded -- excluding the embedded derivative in the reinsurance contract was essentially breakeven this quarter. ", "The ongoing low interest rate environment continues to be challenging. And additionally, the tightening of credit spreads throughout much of the quarter made for an even more difficult quarter to put money to work. By being selective in our asset purchases, we were able to achieve new money rate, which is hedge-adjusted for 5.4% for the first quarter. As a result, the overall portfolio yield held up relatively well at 6.62%, comparing to 6.67% at year end. Given the environment we saw in the first quarter, we did run a cash balance higher than usual, which creates a drag on our net investment income. Given lower amounts of cash flows in the second quarter, we'll look to catch up in the second quarter while continuing to be opportunistic. ", "Our capital position continues to be strong. While statutory net income for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies was down slightly from a year ago, our run rate continues to support our capital model that generates about $500 million of free cash flow per year. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies remains at approximately 406%, above our 2012 target range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash, marketable securities total $575 million at quarter end. And we continue to expect it to be within the range of $500 million to $800 million by year-end 2012.", "During the first quarter, we took advantage of a lower share price, and our share repurchases totaled $175 million of our planned total of $500 million for the year. We also announced yesterday that we increased the dividend for the fourth straight year, and this year, notably, at a more rapid rate. We see this as reflective of our cash flow characteristics and a positive way to return money to our shareholders.", "In closing, with a comment on our outlook. Despite the volatility we have described and pressure on the investment side, we continue to see 2012 operating earnings per share growth in the lower end of the range of 6% to 12%. ", "Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. In closing, despite the unfavorable results in a couple of areas which we recognize we must address, we continue to grow operating earnings per share, generate solid ROEs in our core business segments, grow our business in our target markets and generate capital, which has allowed us to continue to buy back stock and raise our dividend. And as Rick said, we're maintaining our outlook, which continues to call for operating earnings per share growth at the low end of our 6% to 12% range. ", "This completes our prepared comments, and operator, let's move now to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Giovanni, Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to see -- regarding Long-Term Care and the incidence levels that you guys talked about, I believe your book is at a relatively younger age maybe versus some of your peers. So curious if we should be worried that this higher incidence levels, this early on could lead to the need to maybe strengthen reserves in the future.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Two questions embedded in there, Chris. Why don't we sort of ask Kevin to speak a little bit just to some of the incidence and claims trends? And obviously Rick can speak to our confidence in the reserves.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, you're right. Our average age is probably lower than our competitors, primarily because we have about 50% of our book of business in the group Long-Term Care business. And that average age is in the mid-40s. The expected levels of incidence at that age would be quite low, so even small upticks in incidence would generate the appearance of a fairly significant higher percentage. That said, the block of business isn't sizable enough to not have volatility, and I think this kind of volatility that we experienced in this quarter isn't atypical of this kind of business.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, you want to speak to the financial side of that?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I will. As I noted in my script, what we saw in the higher loss ratio in the first quarter is a reflection of the quarter. With regards to claim incidence, we saw in LTC and not what we would expect longer-term in these businesses, as Kevin just referenced. So if you look at the Closed Block in aggregate, we were running around $30 million if you look over last year. It's come down a little bit as we look into this year, and we're running in probably the $25 million to $30 million range. And we were lighter than that by $10 million pretax. So I would chalk that up to volatility. You mentioned the reserves. We did take action at year-end, but those actions were much more about our long-term assumptions. And as Kevin said, this incidence we saw in the quarter is not our long-term expectation.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then Kevin, the commentary in the release was pretty positive around the competitive environment in group disability, and you talked about some pickup from employment and wage increases. So I wanted to see, one, if you could talk about sort of -- expand on the competitive environment. And in the past, you've talked about sort of $80 million in premium from sort of natural growth from expanding wages and payrolls. So wanted to see how much of this you think you're capturing today.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "First, let me address maybe the competitive pricing environment. I would say that, generally speaking, a number of companies over the last year have announced in one way or another, either price increases or renewal programs. I think we've seen some uptick in premium for life across the industry, which is a good solid trend. I mean, there are always a few competitors that, that's not the case. But in general, there's been an uptick in PPL [ph]. And in general, we've seen fairly stable pricing, especially in the smaller case end of the marketplace through the end of last year and into the first quarter of this year. In terms of a 4% of earned premium growth overall in Unum US, very little of it is from natural growth. I think there are encouraging signs in the economy, other than maybe this morning's payroll -- unemployment report. But in general, I think the signs have been encouraging. But that only accounts for sort of less than 0.5% of the overall growth. The primary driver of growth was solid sales here in 2011 and really solid persistency levels.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, then one just last quick one on capital management. Back at the 2010 Investor Day, you talked about potentially being able to do up to $900 million of share repurchases a year, and you backed away from that last year due to some of the economic headwinds. But curious if you would be willing to upsize your buyback this year in order to achieve your EPS growth target?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, you want to take that one?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, I would like to talk about that one. I would agree with those numbers we laid back out in 2010. We got off of that track last year as we saw challenges over the course of the summer with what was going on in the Eurozone, et cetera. As we came into this year, our 2011 investor day, we talked about $500 million of repurchases over the course of the year. We did a little bit more than that run rate in the first quarter, but we're sticking to the $500 million for the full year. And to your last point, we don't think about it from an EPS perspective. We think much more on the capital management side as returning capital to our shareholders, doing it as a good use of the excess capital that we've generated, and we'll continue to do it that way. The last point I would make is, a lot of the numbers we put out back in 2010 still hold. So when you think of the excess capital that we still have out there on the balance sheet, both in terms of cash as well as RBC in excess of our expectations over the longer term, that dynamic still exists, but we're going to wait until we see a better market and a better environment on the horizon before we bring out some of that capital.", "Operator", "Up next, we'll hear from Mark Finkelstein, Evercore Partners.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "To get to the low end of the range of 6% to 12%, does that assume full recovery in U.K. and LTC earnings?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. When you think about the lower end of the range, the 6% to 12%, we've talked about 2 dynamics there. We\u2019ve really mostly talked about one, which is the pressure we've seen from the lower interest rates and the higher cash balances that we're holding. I think our expectation, as we've said in our earlier comments, is that over the course of the year, that the volatility that we saw in both LTC as well in the U.K. will dissipate. So when you take those together and a whole lot of other things that will happen over the course of the year, it leads us to the conclusion that we're still within our range of 6% to 12%.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess, just going back to the incidence on LTC, I mean, the interest-adjusted loss ratios really did pick up quite a bit. Are there any metrics that you can give us that just show that it really was a blip in incidence and just not kind of a continuation of a negative trend, albeit much more magnified this quarter? I mean, are there any sequential actual expected type metrics or anything that can kind of tell us just how much of an anomaly this was?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, you want to talk about it a little bit, because you guys obviously monitor the business on a fairly regular basis?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "We've seen this kind of hiccup in incidence before in disability lines and Long-Term Care lines. The claim volume was a little bit elevated in the first quarter. We've seen other quarters that were somewhat similar. We typically see some seasonality in the business as well, particularly after the holidays in the first quarter. But like I said earlier, this kind of volatility, we track it, and we see it from time to time. From a claims management standpoint though, we're pretty active about making sure that we understand where claims are coming from and what we can do about it. I mean, we can't do much about the incoming mail, but from there, we can actively manage the claims. And we've taken a couple of actions since the end of the year to shore up and strengthen our Long-Term Care active management. I'll give you a couple of examples. We did appoint a new senior financial executive to oversee the business. We did put in place sort of an internal, regular internal audit-type peer review of claims activity. And we did put in place an inventory management system around claims, similar to what we executed in long-term disability that's served us so well in that line of business. So I think as Rick said, we would expect this volatility to happen from time to time, and we would expect it to dissipate.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just finally, with you, Kevin. I think Rick made an opening remark suggesting that the STD incidence shouldn't travel over to LTD. I guess, what gives you that confidence?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "A couple of things. We track something that we call the flow-through rate, the rate at which STD claims become LTD claims. That's not moving at all. In fact, if anything, it's slightly declining. Secondly, duration days, the length of time that STD claim would stay on-claim, it has been incredibly stable over a long, long period of time. So when I take a look at what's going on in STD, I think again we've got an uptick in incidence. We're addressing that with pricing actions, and we don't see any flow-through to LTD.", "Operator", "Up next, we'll take a question from Ed Spehar, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have 2 questions. I guess the first would be, if the earnings run rate continued for Long-term Care at the 1Q level, so I think you said about $10 million less than what you thought, what, if anything, would that imply for reserves?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, well, I think that what you're talking about though is, and it is a little bit speculative, that, that higher incident rate persists for a long period of time. And so if it's a long period of time, it's something you have to address. But I'd very quickly say that we don't expect that, as Kevin said, and as I've said. And so I think that it does not have the impact on reserves. It is more volatility intra-quarter, which is an income statement issue and not a balance sheet issue.", "Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that. But if there's -- I mean, if it did, I mean just sort of sense as to how big of a deal it would be if this number was $10 million a quarter worse than what you're thinking. I mean, is it a reserve issue at all? I guess my point is, is it a reserve issue at all, or is it just that earnings would be coming through $10 million less a quarter every quarter going forward?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Well, I think we're speculating a little bit here, so what we're\u2026", "Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "We have to do that though, unfortunately, Rick.", "Richard P. McKenney", "What we're talking about is short-term trends versus longer-term trends. And we're saying this is a short-term trend, and it will be earnings impact in the current quarter, which we've shown you. If it happens again, it will be earnings impact in that quarter. And then longer-term, if we see that as a trend, we'll have to reflect that into our reserving processes. But that's a long way out from where we sit here today.", "Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, and then a related question is, have you considered that there's any possibility that there was an acceleration of submitted claims in Long-term Care, simply because of your decision to exit the line? Is there any reason to think that, from either a customer or distributor standpoint, that you might have had some upfront-ing of claims?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, you want to take that actually? Because we've looked at that right there\u2026", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "No, I think -- first of all, I think it would be way too soon. We didn't make the announcement until the first week of February, something like that. So it would be way too soon for that sudden influx of mail to sort of come in. So no, I don't think there's any evidence to that. Like I said, we do a lot of internal review of incoming claiming volume. We want to make sure whenever we see an uptick in incidence, that there's nothing -- there's no sort of new thing happening to us. And we didn't see any evidence of that. Like I said, I think it's just volatility.", "Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Is there any reason to think that, that could have an impact in subsequent quarters, just the announcement that you're getting out?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "I don't think so. I mean, when you think about the definition of disability, I am hard-pressed to see people deciding that they've got multiple ADL losses, activity of daily living losses, just because we made an announcement. I mean, either they have it or they don't.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "I think, Kevin, you mentioned, too, one of the things we have done since the announcement is shore up a lot of our resources actually supporting this business, made a number of adjustments in personnel and things like that. So to the extent we do get a higher level of claims, we've got the resources to be sure that we're only paying the ones that should be paid.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jay Gelb, Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "What's the sensitivity to Unum's sales in the U.S. from a pickup in improving wage numbers and employment?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, do you want to take that one?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Sure. I don't know if I could quantify it for you, Jay, but I mean, certainly an uptick in wage inflation, if you will, would increase covered payrolls, which in turn would increase the dollar volume, if you will, of sales, pretty linearly. And then I think an increase in employment would be similar. I mean, we start -- if companies started to grow, instead of covering 100 people in the company, we'd be covering 105. So I think it's a very linear relationship. And if we see an uptick in wage inflation and we see an uptick in employment, we'll see an uptick in the dollar value of sales in premium.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Jim, I might say that we're not expecting significant improvement in the economic environment actually. So the growth that you've seen in the last year or 2, which we reported here in this past quarter, is more driven by basic fundamentals. It's either a combination of competitive dynamics improving. Obviously, our reach and touch in the marketplace continues to expand. We've had great stability in this company in terms of our sales and service organization. I think, Kevin, which actually is probably more behind the growth that we've seen, and probably what we're expecting the rest of this year.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "The other thing I'd say, Tom, is that any improvement in the economic environment with respect to wages and employment probably reflects itself more in what we call NBOC, in-force customers beginning to grow again. And we did see an increase in NBOC during the end of last year and into this quarter. And it reflects confidence.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "On a separate issue, the drop-off in Unum UK net investment income quarter-over-quarter was pretty significant. Was there any specific driver to that? Or is that the right run rate going forward?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Tom, you want to take that one?", "Thomas White", "Yes. Jay, basically, what happened is in last year's first quarter, we had a bond call. I think it was about GBP 2.7 million. And actually, it's a little unusual for us to have that. So we had that working against us. We didn't have any on-call premium this year. So about a $2.7 million swing year-over-year because of the bond call last year.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "It was down from $50.5 million in the fourth quarter of '11, so\u2026", "Thomas White", "The other thing is we'll get some adjustments and some noise with the inflation. Keep in mind, with our group disability policies over there, about 30% or so have an inflation rider, so as inflation moves up and down, we'll have some movement in the net investment income, which actually gets offset on the reserves and flows through the benefit ratio. So it doesn't have any impact on overall income, but we can get some noise with how inflation moves around in the U.K.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Their indexing guild [ph] so we're invested in over there.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So what do you feel the right run rate is for net investment income in Unum UK?", "Thomas White", "It's going to move around. You have to -- we can probably -- I can take you off-line, and we can kind of talk through what some of the trends have been. But it's going to be heavily dependent on the direction of inflation and how that kind of flows through the investment income line.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Tom, maybe also to point out too that, that also affect -- the movement in the rates in inflation affect also the benefit cost. So there's a linkage sometimes. So actually just focusing on the investment income is a piece of it, but it's also a benefit cost connection as well.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the Closed Block, the impact of the Long-term Care business going forward, I know you're trying to figure out what the run rate is there, but maybe you can give us a bit more sense in terms of how we should think about it.", "Richard P. McKenney", "We are trying to establish a run rate there, as I mentioned. But I think I also mentioned in my earlier comments, we'd expect that 25% to 30% range is probably more realistic for this Closed Block going forward. As I mentioned, that's slightly down off of the run rates we were seeing last year as we've taken the entire business through the Closed Block process.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And that would be considering no other unusual impacts, correct?", "Richard P. McKenney", "That's our expectation.", "Operator", "From Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, we'll hear from Tom Gallagher.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to come back to Long-Term Care for a minute. And Rick, I just want to make sure I'm doing the math correctly. So if I take -- if I kind of overlay your interest-adjusted benefit ratio with what I think is reasonable other expense line, it looks like you lost a slight amount of money in Long-term Care in this quarter and you made money in the Closed Block Individual Disability. Is that correct?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I think that's pretty close. We don't split out those results, but I think that\u2019s directionally correct.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And if I sort of extrapolated, and again, I know this is assuming -- making an assumption, but if I assume that claims do remain elevated and I had just a moderate loss on a GAAP basis for the next 3 quarters heading into year end, would that precipitate another reserve charge, to kind of get back to Ed's question, if you had -- if you strung together 4 quarters in a row? Or is that still too early to determine that the reserves are inadequate? Or you just can't make a determination? I'm just curious how you would think about that.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. I think I'd point you back to the underlying causes that brought that into a lower-earning position over the next 3 quarters. And then we have to take those causes, which in this quarter would be claim incidence and whatever that cause might be. And you\u2019d take those new levels and put that through the reserves and see if you're adequate on that basis. And there's other offsets going the other way that will change over the course of the year as premium -- new premiums come in from pricing and things like that. So you take all that together and then evaluate your reserves in that process. But I think you have to go to the underlying causes, not to what the earnings run rate is. The earnings run rates can differ from what your long-term expectations are of claims incidence or any other factor behind the business.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then I guess my other question would be on a related note. Even though you did take a Long-term Care reserve charge on GAAP, there wasn't much of a statutory impact from it last year. So it really has had minimal impact on capital management, which you've been able to still do in a fairly robust way. If there was a Long-Term Care issue on claims incidence, would that also be a stat issue? And would that potentially change the outlook on capital management? And then just a related question, has there been a corresponding statutory impact now that you've seen some softening on GAAP on Long-term Care this quarter?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Okay. Lots of questions in there. If you take what happened in the quarter from a statutory perspective, we did see higher incidence. We're paying on more claims, and so we'll have a little bit less of a run rate on the statutory side. Once again, we don't expect that to continue. So we'd expect our statutory earnings to go right back to our model that we're expecting longer-term in the company. We mentioned at year end that our GAAP reserves are similar to our stat reserves today, but those are 2 fundamentally different bases of accounting. So you\u2019d have to build up from the underlying assumptions and how that might change your view around both GAAP or stat. So if we do see pressure in this business, ultimately we could see pressure on the statutory side as well, but we don't see that today. And so we'll have to see how that plays out.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Understood. Last question, just on the U.K. I think last time we had a blip in the U.K., you guys had talked about in the month following the close of that quarter, things had gotten a bit better. Do you have any early read on how things are playing out thus far into 2Q in the U.K.?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Jack, do you want to cover that? Maybe even just step back a little bit and just sort of again, in your own words, describe a little bit what we saw here this past quarter.", "John F. McGarry", "Yes. It is different that the blip in the U.K. in the third quarter was a disability blip. This is clearly a group life and dependence blip. So we don't have a read on where it is in the second quarter. It is more volatile. To kind of put it in context, our entire group life block in the U.K. is smaller than 1/4 worth of group life business in the U.S. And actually, average sizes, because the standard plan design here tends to be 4x, salary tends to be even higher. So we expect volatility in it. We don't have a good read, but we've had blips. In the past, the first quarter tends to be a little worse than other quarters. And we put some solace in the fact that we had very good group life quarters in the 3 quarters leading up to this one.", "Operator", "Our next question today will come from Steven Schwartz, Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A lot of follow-ups, but thanks for that on the U.K. in April. I'm wondering if you could talk about maybe April, and if it's possible to talk about April in Long-term Care and STD. And also with regards to STD, you're raising prices. Is that going to take a couple of years to get through, like it might in Group Long-term Disability?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, you want to pick up on both of those? Obviously...", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, I'd hesitate to say anything really about the second quarter right now. I mean, just as we say the first quarter's volatility, and one quarter doesn't make a trend, I'm reluctant to speculate on one month being a different trend. So I think we'll just have to let it play out. As Rick said and as I said earlier, we expect volatility. It's happened before. We expect it to dissipate throughout. But I'd rather wait to sort of see it happen than speculate about it. With regard to STD, in terms of renewals, yes, it'll take -- it would take about roughly 2 to 3 years to have it run through the block as long as [ph] that business has either 2- or 3-year rate guarantees. We're talking about a mid-single-digit kind of rate increase. But of course, new sales would flow through right away, and we're raising prices on new STD sales as well, also in the mid-single digit range. And so as sales flow through, that'll help the block as well.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I'll leave that dead horse there. If I could, a couple more questions. Rick, you mentioned cash drag in the quarter. I was wondering if you could possibly put a number on that since it sounds like you'll be fully invested at least some point during the second quarter. That seems to be the plan. And then I was also wondering, a competitor mentioned this, and I was wondering if you had seen this. Social security administration delays, maybe a lengthening in the time it takes for a decision. And if you'd seen that, how that affects you.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, why don't you take the cash piece, and then Kevin on the social security offset piece?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. On the cash side, what we saw in the quarter is a few hundred million. So you're looking $300 million-ish type range of excess cash that we wanted to put back to work. As we look out at how much we actually did put to work, it was a fair bit. Second quarter is a lot lighter in terms of incoming cash flow that we have coming in. So even if we do slightly less than we did in the first quarter, we'll be caught back up. But sitting on that cash, even for a short period of time does cause a little bit of drag. And we'll just have to work our way through that. But we expect to be caught back up, mostly because of the volumes that we see of cash coming in, in the second quarter and our expectation that our team will continue to be opportunistic and get that out over the course of the second.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on social security?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "With respect to social security, there's been a trend of higher rates of approvals by Social Security over the last several years, and that's reflected in our strong offset performance. We haven't seen really anything with respect to generally delays in awards and the recognition of those awards. And in any event, from a pricing and reserving standpoint, we plan for that anyway. So even the awards were delayed, they would be awarded retroactively. And as long as that occurred according to our pricing assumptions, it would make no impact at all on our financials.", "Operator", "Our next question today comes from Randy Binner, FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I wanted to hit on STD again. I guess I haven't heard in all these questions if there was an explanation of kind of what the dynamic was with the higher claims there. And then also I was curious beyond raising pricing if there's any actions you're taking on the claim side to try and mitigate whatever the trend there is.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. A couple of things. What we've seen is a general creep in incidence and prevalence in STD over the last several years. So it was a little bit more visible this quarter. As I said, the length of STD claims hasn't changed at all. Flow-through to LTD has not occurred. And so I guess what I would conclude from that is that it's maybe a higher volume of very short-term, short-term disability claims. Those -- that makes it somewhat harder to manage, because we're not trying to manage recoveries. A lot of times, we get short-term disability claims that are so short that by the time we find out about them, the person's already back to work. That said, we are taking a look at whether or not we can do something around the very, very front end of short-term disability claims to monitor the incoming to see whether we can get our arms around whether or not there's anything we can do about that. At the same time, I think the more practical answer is we just need to raise prices to reflect the incidence and prevalence level we're seeing.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And that's kind of across job classes, across geographies? There's no trend in that?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "No. No trend that I can point to at the moment.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay, that makes sense. And then just one more kind of higher-level question on net investment income. I think people have hit it in different areas. And it was a little bit light versus our model, and I appreciate the comments on putting cash back to work. But I guess there's -- just to kind of clarify or make sure, there's no -- there's nothing you're going to do in the portfolio to take additional action, kind of different investment strategy, different asset allocation? It's the same asset mix and strategy you're looking for in the portfolio, just trying to get more cash to work. Is that right?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "That's absolutely the case. I think we know the asset classes that we like, and on a relative value basis, we'll shift from one asset class to another, whether it's private placements or corporate bonds or commercial mortgage loans, and we'll go where we see relative value. But you won't see a move in the overall portfolio. It's been stable over the last several years, and you can expect it to stay there. It'll be marginal moves in each of those product lines or those asset classes depending on what the environment looks like.", "Operator", "From Barclays, we'll take a question from Eric Berg.", "Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Actually, I used to be at Barclays. Now we\u2019re at RBC. All joking aside, I wanted to return to the Long-term Care area. And I guess my first thing is, I wanted to clarify that the incidence, the pickup at incidence that you experienced in the March quarter is different from the issue that you addressed fundamentally in the large reserve increase that you took to exit the business. In particular, my understanding is that when you booked the large charge to exit the business, that was fundamentally about how long older people are living in or remaining in nursing homes -- essentially, they\u2019re staying alive -- before the claim ends due to death in the nursing home, that this was really about the length of stays in nursing home. And so my question is, first, are we really talking today about a new aspect to the claims? People entering nursing homes, the number of claims as opposed to the length of claims? That's my question.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. We think about -- I'll take you back to year-end. There were 2 fundamental things that we highlighted: one which you referenced which was termination rates, how long people are staying on-claim and what our long-term view is of that. The second is interest rates. So we did adjust for what our perception is of interest rates drifting down here over the next 3 to 5 years, and those are the 2 big aspects of that. What we saw this quarter is different than those items on the incidence side, and it's different than what we've seen over the last several years. So if you look back to some of the increasing loss ratio we had in the past, it was much more about lapse-ation or persistency of people staying on their parts [ph] as opposed to the utilization and incidence which we're seeing here. So we did see that blip up in the quarter, and we'll certainly keep a close eye on it. But at the moment, we think it's volatility.", "Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And let me just ask a second and final question on this topic. It is sort of the same question but asked differently from the one that was asked I think by Ed and Tom, and it's this. Let's say you continue to experience elevated incidence. I know you don't. You've said that repeatedly. You're calling this volatility. But let's say you did experience it. My question, what would be the case -- what would cause you not to have to take a reserve charge in the face of ongoing elevated incidence? Others -- the other fellows asked you, wouldn't that lead to a reserve charge? I'd like to know what would be the set of facts and circumstances under which, faced with higher incidence on a continuing basis, you wouldn't take a reserve charge?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. I think that incidence is one attribute of the product line, and so we\u2019d have to look at all the other pieces, including the ones we adjusted at year-end to see if they play out that way. And the other thing that's important is we are able to increase prices in this line. And so we are actively continuing to raise rates in this line to reflect the characteristics of that block. And certainly an increase in incidence and utilization is brought [ph] would correspond with us continuing to raise rates. And so I think that's -- you mentioned what's the one offset. I'd probably highlight that as an important factor.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And Rick, bringing into that the fact that we've really brought in some people into this exercise to be sure we've got resources behind this, including a very senior addition to the team. So Eric, I mean we just aren't taking this issue of how we reprice and rethink that block of business casually. There's an active process in place, as Rick said, to be sure that we're being as aggressive and as appropriately aggressive as we can be on pricing and repricing.", "Operator", "From Sterne Agee, John Nadel is up next.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I guess to beat the Long-term Care horse to absolute death, can you just update us -- Rick, you mentioned pricing. Can you update us on where you stand with respect to the pricing actions? Maybe guys give us an update on state-by-state approvals, the expectation for impact to premiums over what period of time again.", "Richard P. McKenney", "So I'll take you through what we've seen with regard to our filing process on individual Long-term Care. The plan's still on track. I wouldn't give you much more update than take some time to implement those once they've been approved, and they have to go through the process of notification, et cetera. I would say going forward, we're going to see where price stands. But it'll be on a much more -- on a continuum. These aren't going to be initially weighted to pricing. These will be ongoing to be ongoing discussions that we have with states with regard to the particular block of business that they have there. And so to go through a process of kind of an update and a status check, I think, will be different. We'll certainly let you know as the premium starts to flow in and what our expectations are around that going forward. But so far, we're still on track. I'd take you back to the metrics we saw in the fourth quarter, and they look very similar to that.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, helpful. I guess, separately, the change in your definition of operating earnings and treating these I guess pension-related costs as nonoperating item could -- I'm just curious, what precipitated that? And why are you making that adjustment? I'm just trying to understand the theory.", "Richard P. McKenney", "When you look at the operations of our business, we certainly try and be consistent across the board. And I would say this item that we're talking about -- we're not talking about our total pension expense. We continue to have the service cost running through, which reflects the increasing level of our pension. What we're talking about here is the movement in the actuarial gain or loss, which is very similar to capital gains and losses in the portfolio in that it will get marked and it will change and we'll see gains. And that today comes through the income statement, although over a longer period of time. But we think it looks much more like capital gains and losses. And we have seen other companies out there that do something similar, and we thought that was appropriate for our business.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Can you give an example of couple of companies that you've seen do this?", "Richard P. McKenney", "GE, IBM.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So nobody in the peer group, though? I don't believe there's anybody that I cover who has done this.", "Richard P. McKenney", "No. I don't believe there is. And so we're looking at it, but I would say there's an awful lot of folks out there that do look at capital gains and losses or things that are similar to that as nonoperating items and we put this in that category.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Understood, okay. And then 2 quick ones then. Did you see any benefit in the quarter from prepayment income? Was it in line with expectations, above, below?", "Thomas White", "Yes. I think, John, it was pretty consistent with what we saw on the first quarter last year and relative to the fourth. Actually, it was a little bit lower than last year and pretty much in line with what we saw with in the fourth quarter. The thing about it, it varies by line of business. It just depends on the bond that's called and what product line portfolio that we're holding it in.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the last one is more for Tom Watjen. Just looking at the sales results in Unum UK. And if I go back in time when you made the management changes there, I think at least in part, one of the things that you highlighted was you weren't all that pleased with the mix shift that had been occurring in the U.K. away from disability, toward group life, and yet, this quarter, I see dramatic increase in group life sales year-over-year, not that disability didn't grow either. But is there anything we can take away from the quarter's results in that regard?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "No, I don't think so, John. I think we said across all of our businesses, we -- obviously there are parts of our business that are opportunistic. And occasionally, we're going to see things that if we can price the business properly, we're going to be opportunistic. And I think you saw that to a degree in the U.K. results in the quarter. There are a few cases, for example, that were reasonably large, but ones that again we could obtain on a very attractive price. And as Jack mentioned in his comments, other than this quarter, we've had a pretty good run of 3 quarters of pretty good results in the group life line in the U.K. So I think that discipline you referred to, we're very much staying with. Across all of our businesses, we can see opportunistic things come along, which can cause spikes. In Unum US, for example, you'll see the spikes in large case when you see those kinds of opportunities. So nothing has really changed there. Again, our fastball and our presence in the U.K. is dominated by our disability franchise, and we really have, with Jack's leadership, I think really brought more focus to that. We're very engaged in the public policy debate in the U.K. about the role private disability can play in the broader sort of public policy arena. So please don't misread that quarter in terms of a shift back to some things that I think, as you rightfully point out, we were trying to move away from.", "Operator", "Up next, we'll hear from Sean Dargan, Macquarie.", "Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research", "Just following up in the U.K. I think the consensus now is that the U.K. is in full-blown double-dip recession. Does that change either the top line or bottom line guidance that was given for 2012?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "No. And Jack, maybe you can speak a little bit again to just how, if at all, you're seeing the recession impact your business.", "John F. McGarry", "Yes, clearly, the interest rate environment is having an impact on our business. Natural growth is weak in the U.K. as it is in the U.S. and isn't -- we didn't get the 0.5% lift in natural growth in the U.K. I think a full-blown double-dip recession is a little harsh. There was a small 2-quarter decrease, but it was like 0.2% dips. They expect low but growth for the remainder of the year. But actually in kind of getting back to John's question as well, I think the recessionary pressures are more than offset by a better competitive environment in the U.K. We felt much better about the 40% increase in our GIP sales than we did about what happened in group life, which was opportunistic. But those sales were actually across the board in all size, levels. We've seen in the U.K., particularly in the financial services industry, several major banks come out and request proposals to insure all of their bank employees, which is something that is new to the U.K. and a very positive sign for our business, because that's the direction our strategy is going. And a lot of companies look to what the banks and other major employers in the U.K. do, as they're thinking about their own benefit design. So we think that's a positive movement. We\u2019ve begun to have some success in selling additional -- in selling and convincing in-force customers to insure additional employees under their schemes, which is a really positive sign, again, consistent with our strategy. And so in the U.K., our growth story isn't necessarily as focused on the economy growing as it's focused on expanding the number of employees that employers choose to provide coverage to in the U.K.", "Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just one quick one on Colonial Life. The sales in Accidents, Sickness and Disability were maybe a little lighter than I was expecting. Is there some change in the competitive environment in that line?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Randy, you want to pick up on that? And even just maybe, as Sean indicated, just talk a little bit on the environment in addition to that one particular product.", "Randall C. Horn", "Not seeing any significant change in the competitive environment. I mean, it's been intense for some time now. And our real issue in the first quarter was on the new account sales side of things, where we just had smaller average case size on average. We were very pleased with our sales in all of our product segments in terms of existing account sales. So those were up nicely. So we're staying very focused on our core commercial market, and in public sector, we have excellent opportunities there, Sean. And really not seeing anything new there that's causing us not to be optimistic about the future in those lines.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "I think actually, operator, we'll maybe move to our last question. I think we're bumping up against our time limit.", "Operator", "Our final question today will come from Ryan Krueger, Dowling & Partners.", "Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "Sorry to ask yet another question on Long-Term Care. I'm not sure if you said this on the call. If so, I missed it. But was incidence elevated in both the group and individual businesses? Or was it more pronounced in just one area?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, you want to take that one?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, certainly. It was actually on the individual side, which you would expect. We talked a little bit earlier about the age differential in 2 blocks, so that's what you\u2019d expect. And it was primarily on the individual side.", "Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "Okay. And then just a general question on statutory reserving. Outside of New York, when you look at reserves at the end of the year and run cash flow testing for any business, do you then always compare on a holistic basis the reserve adequacy of the company, taking into consideration shortfalls in some businesses and redundancies in another? In other words, if you could just confirm [ph] at the end of the year that you maybe should add to Long-Term Care reserves, but then you thought some of the other businesses were redundant, would that necessitate a reserve increase on a stat basis?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick you want to pick up on that?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I don't want to end on that, but I think there's -- let me talk a little bit about that, which would be very similar to what we talked about at Investor Day, which is this is an entity-by-entity view of the business. In some entities, and the practices are slightly different, some of the entities, you are able to look across the company and when you do cash flow testing, as you would expect, because there are offsets that obviously happen. And some entities, you do it product-line-by-product-line in cash flow. So you would come up with different answers in terms of how you go through that. But I think as you look at our year-end results and how we go through, we're certainly feeling good about -- our statutory earnings are flowing across the board, and we expect that to continue.", "Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "And just to clarify, is New York the only subsidiary where you do look at it on an exact line-by-line basis versus consolidated?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I hesitate to be sure in aggregate. But that's certainly one of the entities that they do look on a line-by-line basis. That's the regulation. That would be true of everybody.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thank you. And thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. And this will complete the first quarter 2012 earnings call.", "Operator", "And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas White", "Great. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call for Unum. Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause the results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and are also located in the section titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, as well as our subsequently filed Form 10-Q.

A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found on our website also in the Investors section. Participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, our President and CEO; and Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO; and also the presidents of our 3 business segments, Kevin McCarthy for Unum US; Randy Horn for Colonial Life; and Jack McGarry for Unum UK.", "And so now I'll turn the call over to Tom Watjen.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning. As you saw from our announcement last evening, operating earnings per share grew by 3.9% this quarter and despite the headwinds, I'm pleased with the performance of most of our businesses.", "Let me highlight a few points. First, Unum US and Colonial continued to generate solid results, striking a good balance between growing the businesses while maintaining strong, predictable profitability. The Unum US premium grew 4% as we continued to see strong sales growth, especially in our core markets and voluntary benefit lines and persistency was solid across most of our product lines. When combined with a stable benefit ratio, this business continues to generate a consistent ROE of between 13% and 14%. At Colonial, premium grew at about 5% this quarter. And while sales were relatively flat year-over-year, the margins in this business continue to hold up quite well, and the result is that this businesses continues to generate a consistent return on equity of between 16% and 17%. You'll see that the earnings for this business are down slightly year-over-year and this is due to extraordinary high investment income last year and not a weakening the underlying business.", "Next, with all that said I am generally pleased with our operating performance but more exceptionally with our Unum UK business. While it remains solidly profitable and generated a return on equity around 12% this quarter, the level of profitability and the volatility of our results in this business are below our expectations. While this is our smallest business, it is a business and marketplace we like a great deal and I am confident that we can, over time, improve the performance of this business through pricing actions, rebalancing our mix of business and more consistent operating performance, and Rick will touch on that further in his remarks.", "We you'll also -- you will see too the results for the quarter in our Closed Block segment improve somewhat over our first quarter results. That was the case for both our Individual Disability business as well as our Long-term Care business which, as you may recall, was added to our Closed Block segment in the fourth quarter of last year. New claim incidence in Long-term Care returned to more normal levels this quarter from the spike we saw in the first quarter. We said at the time that it would take a few quarters for the Long-term Care block to settle down and that seems to have been the case. That block will continue to be a challenge though, and Tom and Rick will both touch on this further in their remarks.", "Now turning to our investment results. This past quarter was another strong quarter despite what obviously remains a very challenging investment environment. Today's extremely low rates will continue to pressure our investment income results, but we are working to mitigate this impact by implementing rate increases on new sales and renewals. While interest rate pressure will likely persist for some time, our credit quality remains strong and we are not going to deviate from the disciplined investment strategy which has served us so well through these difficult financial and economic times. We will sacrifice yield as need be to maintain a solid high-quality investment portfolio.", "And lastly our capital position remains in very good shape with our risk-based capital level at 404%, above our target range of 375% to 400% that for the year, and all-in company cash was at $564 million. We continue to buy back stock repurchasing around $125 million this quarter, which brings our total repurchases over the past year to $550 million. You saw that our board approved a new share repurchase authorization and Rick will touch on that in his comments. I might add that in addition to repurchasing stock, dividend actions remain a part of our playbook as evidenced by the 24% dividend increase we announced in May, the fourth consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend.", "So in summary, I continue to feel good about our position. Our overall operating trends are solid; our business unit returns are well above industry averages; our investment portfolio remains in excellent shape; and our capital position exceeds our long-term targets, providing us with significant financial flexibility. And looking ahead we expect cash flow to remain healthy allowing us to continue to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend increases, something I continue to believe has great value in these unsettling times. Given the weakness we have seen primarily in our U.K. business, we are adjusting the outlook we provided last year at the Investor Day meeting. We now believe that it will be slightly below the target range of 6% to 12% growth in operating earnings per share and Rick will touch on that more in just a moment.", "Now I'll turn things back over to Tom for an overview of our operating results. Tom?", "Thomas White", "Great. Thank you, Tom. As you can see from our press release yesterday, we reported net income of $216.4 million for the second quarter of 2012 or $0.76 per diluted common share compared to net income in the year-ago quarter of $227.6 million or $0.74 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the second quarter of 2012 are after-tax, nonoperating, retirement-related losses of $7.5 million and a net realized investment loss of $1.4 million. Included in last year's second quarter are nonoperating, retirement-related losses of $5.2 million and a realized investment loss of $2.2 million. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $225.3 million this quarter, or $0.79 per diluted common share compared to $235 million, or $0.76 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.", "Turning to business segments, operating income for Unum US segment increased 3.5% to $212.7 million in the second quarter, with premium income increasing by 4.2% and both the expense ratio and benefit ratio showing improvements relative to the year-ago quarter. Operating income in the Unum US Group Disability line was $70.4 million dollars in the second quarter compared to $78.7 million last year. While premium income increased 1.7% over last year due to favorable sales and persistency trends, total revenue did decline fractionally or by 0.2% as net investment income declined 7.5% due to a lower level of miscellaneous investment income, lower assets allocated to this line and a slight drop in the investment yield. The benefit ratio was 84.7% in the second quarter, up slightly from the year ago 84.4%, but down slightly from the first quarter of 84.9%.", "In the Group Life and AD&D line, operating income increased 10.2% to $57.3 million in the second quarter benefiting from an increase of 7.2% in premium income and higher net investment income due to a higher level of miscellaneous net investment income. And this offset an increase in the benefit ratio to 71.9% from 70.3% in the year-ago quarter. In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, second quarter income increased 13.5% to $85 million. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by solid growth in premium income which increased 5.7%, as well as favorable risk experience.", "Moving to Unum U.K., operating income in this segment declined to GBP 19.1 million from GBP 34 million in the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio increased to 85.4% in the second quarter from 69.8% in the year-ago quarter, while premium income in local currency increased 1.5%. Results in both the Group Disability and Group Life's business lines were below year-ago levels.", "Concluding our core operations, Colonial Life reported a decline in operating income up 6% this quarter to 67.6 million. Premium income increased by 5.3%, which is generally consistent with the rate of premium growth we've seen at Colonial Life over the last several quarters. In addition, the benefit ratio of 52.5% is in line with our expectations for this business segment.", "The results of the Closed Block segment showed a decline in operating income to $25.7 million from $30.4 million in the year-ago quarter with a strong improvement from the first quarter operating income of $15.4 million. Premium income declined by 1.4% due to the ongoing wind down of the Individual Disability Block. For the Corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $25.9 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $17 million in the second quarter last year. Net investment income is lower due to lower asset levels, a lower portion of assets invested at long-term interest rates and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships. The interest in debt expense was stable at $32.2 million in the second quarter compared to $32.3 million in the year-ago quarter. And finally, the tax rate in the second quarter is lower this quarter due primarily to the release of an $11 million tax liability related to unrecognized tax benefits.", "So now, I'll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis. Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Great, thank you, Tom. This morning I'll cover the margin trends we experienced in our business segments this quarter, a view on our growth trends and we'll also provide an update on our investment results and capital position and outlook for the second half of the year.", "First, on our operating results in the second quarter, I'll start with Unum US. It was another very good quarter for the Unum US segment, with operating earnings growth of 3.5% and generally solid risk experience. Sales growth and persistency continued their positive trends as well. Starting on risk results for Group Disability, the benefit ratio was in line with the average of the past 2 years at 84.7% in second quarter. This quarter compares to the first quarter ratio of 84.9% and 84.4% in the year-ago quarter. Submitted new claim incidence trends for long-term disability were slightly higher, but with an average smaller claim size and higher claim recoveries, the financial impact was neutralized.", "These favorable trends in LTD continue to be offset by somewhat weaker results in our short-term disability claim experience. We again saw higher paid incidence rates and higher average weekly indemnities. We believe the actions we are taking with pricing will firm up these results in STD over time. Importantly, we have not seen these trends in short-term disability claims trending through to our long-term disability results.", "On the investment side, the interest reserve margin for this line declined 91 basis points -- 90 to 91 basis points this quarter from 97 basis points in the previous quarter. And we expect this margin to continue to gradually decline over the next several quarters given today's extremely low new money yields. Given the environment, it's also likely that we will work in reductions to our new claim discount rate like we did in the third quarter of last year. We'll balance this against a very healthy margin that we built up over the past several years on our inforce block and our ability to adjust pricing as business renews. Overall, we remain very pleased with our Unum US Group Disability results and the strong, consistent profitability that this business line continues to generate.", "The Group Life and AD&D line was a very strong earnings contributor this quarter at $57.3 million, up 10%. Premium income increased by 7% and net investment income benefited somewhat from a higher miscellaneous net investment income this quarter, which together produced revenue growth of almost 8%. The benefit ratio was 72% in the second quarter, consistent with the first quarter, but up from a year ago level of 70%. Due to higher average claim size, which was somewhat offset by lower submitted claim incidence. The Supplemental and Voluntary line within Unum US produced its highest quarterly earnings this quarter with earnings of $85 million, an increase of 13.5% from last year's second quarter. Premium growth this quarter was 5.7% driven by almost 9% growth in the voluntary benefits line.", "Risk experience was also very good with a benefit ratio of 49%. In the Individual Disability recently issued line, we saw a stable risk experience with lower paid claim incidence rates and higher claim recoveries. In the voluntary benefits line, we experienced lower claims and a lower average claim size for the voluntary disability line. The Supplemental and Voluntary line remains an attractive growth opportunity for our company, as well as a significant source of earnings.", "Turning to the U.K., our results were weaker than we expected with operating earnings declining to GBP 19 million with unfavorable risk experience in both the Group Disability and Group Life lines. For Group Disability, the unfavorable risk experience was driven by a combination of higher average claim size and a lower average size of claims recovered -- claim recoveries. New claim incidence trends were generally flat but we did experience a lower level of declines. Group Life experience was driven by both higher volumes and average size of claims. Clearly these results are well below what we believe this business segment can generate and what it has historically generated. Again in this quarter, we saw different types of volatility which added to the challenge. But there are underlying pricing challenges we have seen in recent years that we need to address. We've talked about our pricing on the Group Disability side in last year and we continue to take price to return to profitability to the levels we've seen. The Group Life business has been more challenged in most recent quarters. It can inherently be more volatile given the size of the policies we write. But to restore the baseline profitability, we have come to expect it comes back to raising prices.", "Overall, our outlook for the U.K. remains positive, but we do have work to do over the next several quarters and years to restore ROEs back to the 20% level from our current level of 12%. In the near-term, we expect quarterly earnings targeting a range of GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million, but we may continue to see volatility outside those bounds as we work to improve performance and contain this volatility.", "Moving to Colonial Life, this segment produced another solid quarter. Results were lower than last year which benefited from unusually high miscellaneous and investment income but in line with our expectations. The loss ratio was slightly elevated in this year's second quarter, but they also are in the range of expectations. This is a very solid result that produced a 16.5% ROE for this quarter. Concluding my comments on margins, we're pleased to see the results of the Closed Block Long-term Care line of business improve from the result of the first quarter.", "New LTC claims return to a more normal level this quarter after the spike we saw in the first quarter and the interest adjusted benefit ratio declined to 87.8% in the quarter from 91.2% in the first quarter. The contribution from our Long-term Care line remained below what we feel this line can generate over the longer term, but this quarter's performance was a strong improvement from the first quarter and indicative of what we expect from the Closed Block in total over the near-term.", "Moving on to our sales trends, we remain very pleased with the trends we're seeing across our business line. Unum US continued the strong trend we have seen for the past few quarters with total sales for the second quarter increasing 9%. For the Group Disability and Group Life and AD&D combined, sales were also up 9%. With sales in the under 2,000 life core market increasing 11% and comprising about 3/4 of the sales mix. Voluntary benefit sales were also good at increasing 8% for the quarter.", "Persistency was also very high for Unum US at 91.7% for Group Long-term Disability and 91.6% for Group Life for the first half of the year. Given these strong trends, we produced 4% premium growth for the Unum US segment again in the second quarter with minimal help from the external environment or natural growth in the marketplace.", "In the U.K., we continue to see somewhat better pricing trends in the market and with that, we are seeing better sales results particularly in the Group Disability line. Group Disability sales increased by 10% in local currency with positive trends in both the core and large case markets. You'll note that our Group Life sales were flat this quarter as we firm our pricing in this line as part of our strategy to improve the profitability in this segment.", "And finally, premium increased 5.3% in Colonial Life this quarter consistent with the growth trends we've seen in recent quarters. New sales in total were essentially flat and we are slightly more encouraged with the core commercial market sales increase by 2%. The sales trend this quarter were consistent with the trends we've seen in the recent quarters. Sales to existing accounts remain generally strong while sales to new accounts are more of a challenge.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio, we continue to be pleased with the excellent credit quality of our portfolio. The net unrealized gain position for our fixed maturity securities stands at $6.4 billion at the quarter end and our watch list of potential problem credits remains very low. Net realized after-tax investment, gains and losses on our portfolio was essentially breakeven on the quarter. Currently in the investing world, the challenge continues to be the low interest rate environment, there is no question it's difficult to put money to work at attractive yields. We continue to be selective in our asset purchases and as a result, the overall portfolio yield continues to hold up relatively well. The portfolio yield now stands at 6.59% compared to 6.67% at year end.", "Similar to the first quarter, we continued to maintain higher-than-normal cash balances for our product portfolios as we search for the best possible investments. We think that is the right decision, but it does create a drag on our net investment income relative to our expectations coming into the year. We would like to catch up and be fully invested in the second half of the year, but we will remain selective and be opportunistic as possible. As such, net investment income for the balances of 2012 is likely to run below our initial outlook coming into the year.", "With regard to the balance sheet, our capital position continues to be very healthy. Statutory net income was $158 million for our traditional U.S. life insurance company this quarter. Our run rate remains very solid and continues to support our capital model that generates about $500 million of free cash flow for the year. So weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies is approximately 404% above our 2012 target range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash and marketable securities totaled $564 million in quarter end in line in the first quarter level of $575 million. During the second quarter, we repurchased $125 million of our stock. So for the first half of the year we have completed $300 million of our $500 million plan.", "We also announced yesterday that our board has authorized a $750 million share repurchase program. Our previous repurchase authorization is due to expire on August 2, today, and this new authorization will cover our expected repurchases for the balance of 2012 and give us flexibility as we develop our capital management plans for 2013.", "And closing with a comment on our outlook, as we included in our earnings release and Tom mentioned earlier, we now believe that growth in operating earnings per share for 2012 will be below the range of 6% to 12% we originally discussed at our Investor Meeting last November. The primary driver for the lower outlook is the underperformance of that Unum UK segment that has emerged in 2012 and likely will continue for the balance of the year. Our outlook for Unum US and Colonial Life has not changed. Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. In closing and before we take your questions, as I said earlier, I'm generally pleased with our results this past quarter. We have continued to generate strong profitability and growth in Unum US and Colonial Life and have maintained a solid investment portfolio and capital position and continue to generate good cash flow that we can continue to return to our shareholders with dividends and additional share repurchases. There is no question that we work to do to improve our Unum UK performance. But I'm confident that our team has the solid plan in place that will lead to gradual improvement in the performance of this business.", "Operator, this completes our prepared remarks, let us move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamminder Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I had a couple of questions. First, on the U.K. business, you've been expecting a recovery on the business but the margins have actually progressively declined. So what gives you the comfort that results have bottomed and if you just talk about how long it will take you to reprice the book and if you're seeing competitors repricing as well as you're doing it? And then secondly on Long-term Care, just talk about your comfort with Long-term Care reserves. Part of the reason you took the charge was low interest rates have declined further since the last time you took the charge. So just your overall comfort level with Long-term Care reserves?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Let me start to answer the first and then ask Jack to certainly pick up. But it think it is important to -- as you're alluding to put the U.K. business in context because there have been some questions raised in the past. And I think that there's no doubt we have a lot of confidence in that business, in that market over the long term and again even in a quarter when, frankly, it didn't meet our expectations. We still generated 12% ROE in that particular business. But I'll come to that in a second, we certainly have some work to do and Jack will talk further about that. But I think this past quarter has caused a few of us just to step back and look at the performance actually of that business over a little longer-term, for example, the last 6 quarters. If you look over the last 6 quarters what you see actually in our BTA, and you probably know this, is unfortunately a fair amount of volatility in our performance, where it ranges -- a high BTA of about $34 million all the way down to a low of $19 million that we saw this past quarter and frankly that will level the volatility in BTA is very inconsistent with what we've seen in other parts of our business and so again that's why if we step back a little bit, just a look at that business again, each quarter, each issue is explainable, as Rick mentioned in his comments. Sometimes it's around incidence, sometimes it's around recovery, sometimes it's around one product versus another. But again that level of BTE volatility in my opinion isn't consistent with what we want to do on the rest of the company. So again we've actually taken a hard look at a few actions that we can take in that market, which Jack can expound on in just a second. Some of those actions relate around pricing increases, some of those actions relate around rebalancing our business in terms of the product selection, the segmentation of the market, the capital allocation we have to put in those products. So we will have some room to improve in terms of just adding more consistency in our operating performance. And so we think we got a good game plan to address those performance issues. Again, is not just about this quarter but it's about looking at this as a trend that we've seen here which, again, on one hand for us is a 12% ROE at a low point. On the other hand, it's got more volatility than we'd like to see in over the long term. I'd also put this business in context as well. Again, very important strategic is us, we see growth opportunities. But if you look at just this past quarter, the BTA in the U.K. is about half of what we produced in Colonial. It's actually less than any one of the 3 operating lines within Unum US, so again to give a sense of context. So with that, Jack, maybe just talk a little bit more about just some of the things that we're doing and why we have confidence in our ability to turn the ship and create less volatility in this business.", "John F. McGarry", "Great, we are confident in the business. We are already implementing significant price increases in the business. The U.K. business renews, generally has a 2-year rate guarantee, so it takes 2 years to go through the block of business. We started renewals in the Group Life block in the first quarter and ramped them up. In the second quarter, we'll continue to ramp them up through the remainder of the year. We're targeting double-digit rate increases in the block. Through the first half of the year, we've achieved a 9.5% rate increase and that has improved quarter-over-quarter. The market is taking very similar actions to us. They've seen the same increase in underlying mortality that we have. Double-digit, 10% rate increases in the life market are common. We're being successful in implementing them. So we're very positive about that, the competition is reacting similarly, they have reacted similarly by the way on the way down as prices went down and admitted commitment, I believe, to restore prices. We're also looking at other things to control volatility, looking at our business mix, the relationship between income protection and Group Life, the size cases that we write, retention limits upon cases that we keep. So we're going to continue to implement actions to improve both the overall results with rates, the volatility that we see and try to lessen that and the effectiveness of our operations to implement actions to correct it.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, if I could turn to you on the Long-term Care.", "Richard P. McKenney", "First, I think it's important, Jimmy, to talk about the context of the interest rate environment in the broader business. As you heard from Jack and I mentioned in my comments, we do have the ability to reprice much of our business to reflect the very challenging interest rate environment that we're seeing. We're taking very aggressive action across all of our product lines to reflect the environment that we see ourselves in today. More specifically to your LTC question around reserves, I'll take you back to year-end in terms of the process that we went through. At year-end when we look at the business, and we will talk about at the time we saw the adjustments that we were making reflecting the interest rate environment and the go-forward of that will take us kind of about 3 to 5 years. In terms of that, I'd tell you, in the current environment, although the first half we did a pretty good job on that front as we sit here today. And the real challenges is that it probably takes you to the shorter end of that range but I think we're still out there in that type of time horizon how interest rate impact as is in the our GAAP reserves and Long-term Care.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Question for Rick, if I could, on the discount rate. I just kind of want to understand how you're thinking about that because I think you said, on the one hand, you have a pretty healthy margin. I guess it ticked down a little bit this quarter but it's still above your target. But then you also suggested in your comments given the sort of the challenge in terms of new money rates, you might be looking at a discount rate reduction at some point later this year. So I was just hoping if you could maybe frame that up a little bit in terms of order of magnitude and then update us on any guidance in terms of what a 25-basis point change in the discount rate would do to sort of, I guess, annualized earnings or EPS.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. Let me put a little more color on the commentary I gave. I think we're working with a couple of different items here. One, is the challenging investment environment we have. And we want to, in the market, reflect that challenging environment in our pricing on a pretty rapid basis. We're balancing that with over -- over different times, we actually let that margin build up quite a bit. So we're balancing those 2 items. But as we did last year, I'd point you back to third quarter of last year, we were early in that process to actually reduce our discount rate. We did it by 25 basis points and those were the kind of things we were looking at as we get in towards the end of this year because we have seen, the all-in invested rate has come down pretty precipitously, not just treasury yields but our investment yields at the kind of credit quality that we like to invest in. So we're looking at that with no prediction as to exactly what the timeframe would be. But I'm just pointing back to third quarter in terms of the type of actions we've taken, the type of size and looking into the future on that. And by the way, we referenced 25 basis points as it was last year, is about a $3 million impact to the overall company.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. And I think you told us your portfolio yield was -- I think I wrote down 6.59%. Can you just tell where you're investing new money, what rate today and I don't know if you mentioned which actual asset classes you're investing in. If you could do that as well, that would be terrific.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. When you look at that portfolio, that does reflect a fair bit of what we've been able to do over time. In the longer end of the curve it certainly support of that. Putting money to work today is quite difficult especially on the short end of the curve as you look at spreads of the 10-year treasure rate, we think A, BBB type investment. You're looking right around 3%, 3.25% maybe. Where we've been putting money to work today where we can most effectively has been in other asset classes such as commercial mortgage loans and private placements. And so we've actually done that reasonably effectively. As you get up to the long end of the curve, those types investments that you make would be more opportunistic. Different deals come to the market at different times and so it's hard to really give a general rule of thumb there as you get out towards the 30-year end of the curve, but we're still being opportunistic on that front. But very, very challenging.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Actually maybe if I add, to actually anywhere talking about the parallel pricing actions we're taking too, because certainly, the discount rate and the interest rate environment is certainly piece of the equation. But we don't believe sitting on our hands either because there's a set fair amount of activity going on to be sure that we reflect this lower rate in a business where there are certain parts of our business that are interest-sensitive but there's also a lot of parts of our business that are actually not interest-sensitive either.", "John F. McGarry", "In the case of the discount rate change, 25 basis-point discount rate change affects LTD rates by about 2%. We were in the process of putting mid-single-digit rate increases into the LTD market place during the course of this year to reflect both the interest rate environment and the sort of slight but steady volatility that we've had in incidence. As we look into 2013 in our renewal program, I expect it to be pricing in the mid- to high single-digit range increases for the LTD again to reflect those same claims trends and also the expectation that low interest rate environment will continue and that we might need to take a change in the discount rate. So we are going to price ahead of that. Most of our other lines don't have that kind of interest rate effect at all. STD and Life don't really get hurt at all by interest rates. When we will look at that in the STD line of business though as a deterioration of industry-wide experience. So we're are placing 10% to 15% price increases on STD. But basically we'll offset this deterioration on STD prevalence. So a lot of pricing activity going on and we think, on the pricing side, we're ahead of the curve in terms of low interest rates.", "Richard P. McKenney", "It's Rick again. If I come back around on the interest rate side, so I gave you some benchmarks of spot rates. I think it's important to look at what happened with actuals too in the second quarter. We actually put money to work at about 5.3%, including some of the hedges that we have out there as those hedges roll off. So those spot rates are tough. I think in the first quarter, as in the second quarter, we've actually done a pretty good job of finding the right investments out there to back our portfolio. I don't want to leave you the sense that everything we putting out there today is at 3%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Spehar from Bank of America.", "Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just had a follow-up question on the U.K. Group Life business. And I'm just wondering I believe April is the big renewal season and it seems like the recognition that you need to make some significant changes in Group Life has happened pretty recently. I understand that you're putting rate increases in, but I believe as recently as early May, you had been looking for the U.K. business to be sort of flattish in terms of earnings this year. So I'm wondering if you could help us understand how quickly you're going to be able to sort of get the profitability back to targeted levels given that we kind of missed, I think, the big renewal season.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Maybe I'll ask Jack to start with that. It's not just the renewals, I think, Jack will speak to but there's also certain segments of the market where you can change. I think you are doing some work to change your strategy. We don't need to get into too much detail there it's not just rate, I think, in Group Life that's sort of entering in the picture. And maybe, Rick, if you could follow up just a little bit with just some of the outlook commentary.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, we are looking to change the business mix. There are segments of the market that we pulled away from in selling new business. On the renewal piece, we were responding to this trend before it actually emerged, so we were already doing rate increases, they were a little bit lighter in the first quarter but we -- and during the second quarter, which would include that renewal cycle, we put double-digit rate increases into the market. As I said, we're right at the edge of double-digit. Now we expect that by year end, we'll be well into double digits. We expect to continue that through the 2013 renewal season and we'll be optimistic from there going forward as the marketplace and competitors allow. So I think we got a good jump on it. We didn't wait until May or June before we started to do renewals. A part of that is because the marketplace actually, I think, saw the blip in claims experience last year that we saw in the first half of this year. And so the marketplace had already begun to respond with rate increases last year and we followed suit on that. So I think we're -- excuse me, we're in a better spot than you might otherwise think. In addition, even though April is the big month, it's not like January in the U.S. Things are much flatter in the U.K. There's a good -- there's probably 40% of your renewals are still outstanding at midyear going forward. So we're optimistic that we caught the curve.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And I think just, Rick, in terms of outlook, I don't think we're making -- we're assuming it takes some time to get back to the levels. But that's the thing I add to that.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "I'll sort of just take you back to our comments, we expect the second half of the year will be starting to run right between GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million which is down, as you know, relative to what we would have thought coming into the year. That reflects really more of the volatility coming out of the book and just the natural fluctuations we've seen. Pricing will take some time and so that's where -- even the actions Jack has taken thus far is going to be a process that works out really over the next couple of years, although we are on top of it right now.", "Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So should we assume to get back to the 20 ROE we're looking at 2 years out?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "I think that's probably a fair assumption. We'll come back and talk about it again next quarter but I think that from what we see right now, that's probably a fair assumption.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Most of my more technical questions have been asked. Just wondering if you could give us an update on your view of the M&A landscape. I mean, it sounds like most of the activity at least that we're all pretty well aware of that's out there is sort of outside your core. But I'm just wondering if what the outlook looks like, what the opportunity set looks like within your mix?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Maybe Rick, I'll start and ask you to supplement a little bit it too. But I think John, we really don't see a lot in our core. I want to come back to you with core is we very much just stay in to the focus of the things we do well and not getting too distracted by obviously some of the other things which, as you point out, there's an awful lot of activity in some of the better areas. There's enough places where, obviously, we want to play and have the characteristics of the things we can add value in. So again, we're staying very close to the marketplace, I think if there are things to happen that are close to our space in the marketplace we're aware of them, but it's a pretty quiet period of time right now because we don't see a lot of things that sort of fit within our sweet spot in terms of where we are as a strategy. But I do think, Rick, again, we're very much viewed I think both in the U.S. as well as maybe even the other markets around the world as a potential buyer for properties, which is a good thing. But that patience is very important.", "Richard P. McKenney", "I would just add to that, when you look at the processes there, we're pretty much involved with anything that's -- and it's going on. We're certainly introduced to most situations that are out there. It's true that much of it does not meet our core. I think the business line that we're in are very much favored by the markets today and so I don't think we'll see that much in the near term, it's something we'll keep an active eye on. And the second is, as we look at M&A, it's relative to purchasing our stock. It's a very, very high hurdle to actually go and do there and relative to where our stock is. So I think that's still our primary choice, although we'd want to see a good acquisition that fits.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Certainly. And then just a quick one on Colonial. So I think your commentary has been and it's been pretty consistent now for it seems a couple of quarters. But sales to existing accounts has been -- it's held in there pretty well. Maybe we could even characterize it as reasonably strong. But new client creation has been extremely difficult. Would you characterize that pressure on the new client creation as still primarily economically driven? Or do you see that as more competitively driven because it appears,, at least from my vantage point, that Aflac is doing a little bit better on the U.S. side, and maybe I'm wrong. But I'm just wondering if Aflac and Allstate and a few others are becoming a bit more competitive in that respect?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Randy, let me ask you to on touch that, but maybe just to sort of set the framework a little. Just -- we didn't go into in-depth in our remarks but glad you raised because certainly Colonial, as Rick said in his comments, has been a steady contributor to the results of the company. But as you know, we think about the market really in 3 segments, our core commercial, it is a small business, was actually up about 2% or 3% for the quarter. Our large commercial actually is up pretty nicely for the quarter. The decrease was really more on the public sector. So as always, there's a segmentation process that applies to our core when it comes to market and I think some of the work that's been done certainly has improved our positioning. For example, in the core commercial marketplace we continue to see good results there. But with that, Randy, maybe you could add a little color to the market and what we're seeing, because I think sometimes the headline result doesn't necessarily translate into what's really happening in the market place.", "Randall C. Horn", "Sure, Tom. From an economic standpoint there certainly are still some headwinds out there for everyone. There is no question about that. I mean one of the key things we look at is consumer confidence and levels of discretionary income and that type of thing. But we're working through that just fine. So that's not a huge and not a new issue for us by any means. There is rising levels of competitive intensity out in the marketplace with a lot of different carriers getting into the voluntary space. But as Tom said overall, we feel comfortable with the activity levels and the success we're having in our core commercial markets. The real pressure this quarter was on new public sector sales and we just had a couple of real tough comparisons with the second quarter last year where we had a couple of larger cases on the public sector side. So really, John, no fundamental concerns. We feel like we're getting the right products and services out into the marketplace. We have good steady growth in our agent account and new offices that we're opening, new sales offices, et cetera. So we feel pretty good about the fundamentals and in the market overall and where we can take things. So again, economy is still not our friend, but we can overcome that and feel like we have good prospects going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Christopher Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess, first question just on capital management, I guess I was a little surprised by the buyback activity in the quarter. I guess, one, just given where the shares were trading. And two, just given the smaller window you guys have in 4Q, so should be thinking that you guys kind of get through the rest of your $500 million authorization in 3Q?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, you want to pick that up?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Certainly, Chris. Actually when you think about the buyback activity, we've done $300 million year-to-date. Our second quarter actually looks quite active. When you think about the rest of the year, another $200 million to deal. I won't tell you exactly when we'll do it. We certainly see value in our shares today and where they're trading so we will be active. But right now we are sticking to our $500 million for the year, so that is our expectation. We still look back to our capital generation model and say, in still quite an uncertain environment, that we want to spend excess that we're generating and we also keep some pretty healthy capital levels behind that. So I think that's how the layout plays out between third and fourth quarter. I'd love to see how that goes.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the tax rate was lower due to the tax accrual. Curious, as we look to the back half of this year, is there any other kind of onetime tax items that kind of are on the horizon?", "Richard P. McKenney", "There's always a lot going on in the tax line. And so we -- there's still some of that. I think as you look out to the year, probably lead you to an overall tax rate for the full year of right around 30%, which we'd say is a little bit lower in the third and fourth quarter than our expectations. We think there may be some couple of small onetime items that come through which bring that tax rate down, maybe in 29% to 30% type range.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just quickly for Jack on the U.K. book. I guess the Group Life, I wanted to see if it's at all possible to kind of split out the legacy, kind of your older Unum clients in the U.K. versus the book of business that grew a bit more substantially when AEGON maybe exited the business a few years back.", "John F. McGarry", "Yes. One of the things in the U.K. is the entire block tended to be priced on a consistent basis. And so as rates in the marketplace fell and we followed that trend, we were renewing old cases, as well as younger cases. So if you look at the cases, rating is pretty similar across the block, similar opportunities for rate increases across the block. So it's not like in the U.S. where you might get more aggressive on new sales and have a higher rate on your existing cases.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ryan Krueger from Dowling & Partners.", "Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "I had a follow-up on the discount rates. Rick I wasn't sure if I correctly heard the earnings impact from a 25 basis-point change because I think in your investor presentation last year you said $14 million annually, is that correct?", "Richard P. McKenney", "That is correct annually. I gave you a the quarterly number of $3 million.", "Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "And then you also made some discounted changes last year on the newer Individual Disability Block and I think you also made some changes in the U.K. Should we be expecting some adjustments there as well?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I'm not sure what you're referring to on the Disability Block in the U.K. Hard to predict and will reflect the interest rate environment there as well. But we don't see the same kind of pressure we see in the U.S. for similar pressures on new money investing. But in terms of adjustments and discount rates, it's not of the same magnitude as in the U.K.", "Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "And then just lastly, when I look at the reserve real forwards in your supplement, the group disability recoveries has been pretty favorable now for a few years and then this quarter was even better and I think, probably the best you've had. Can you just talk a little bit about what factors are driving this, if you can continue around these levels?", "Richard P. McKenney", "In the recoveries, as you said, we've been outperforming on the recoveries for quite a number of quarters now. But even there, you get some degree of volatility. You quarters you are running at 110% actual expected recoveries. Some quarters, 113%, other quarters 108%. I think for the most part, we're right on the money pretty consistently in terms of number of recoveries that we expect to occur but you always get sales volatility around the average size of the claim. With the [indiscernible] you see bounce around this quarter. I think we had a little bit more favorable performance on the recoveries side, both in terms of price of recovery and number of recoveries. But I do expect it to continue.", "Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC", "Okay. Just what's changed versus a few years ago? When I just look at the disclosure, seems like there's a significant improvement relative to what it was a few years ago. Is it that you're making more conservative upfront assumptions on recoveries or is it that recovery rates have actually improved?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "I don't think there's much of a process change or anything like that. I think we've got a very seasoned and well-oiled organization and that organization consistently performs. I think, I don't want to speculate but the economy begins to put consistent pressure. And the economy probably baiting just people to return to work a little bit more aggressively perhaps, but that's pure speculation. But I don't think we've made any internal process changes.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I guess just to Ryan's question, I had similar thoughts, why shouldn't claim recovery patterns start to taper off over time? I mean, they've been very strong for a fairly prolonged period of time and just it's just things revert to the mean and you price for some of the improvement over time. Why shouldn't it start to taper off?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, I can turn around and say why should it taper off? Yes, I guess recoveries are about sort of consistent, disciplined management of your claims processes, consistent and disciplined interaction with the claimants, with the claimants' employer, with the claimants' physician. And so it's a process and I just don't see any reason that we should expect it to move.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Okay, I think you touched on it, but we made a very consistent steady investment in that part of our business. I mean that's maybe stating the obvious, but that is at the heart of what's stepped to this more consistent performance once the claim comes into our hands.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, and I mean, exactly right. And I do think, Mark, you're talking about reversion to the mean. We've been performing at these recovery levels for 20 quarters, 16 quarters, whatever. But it's a long time that we've been performing at this level. And I think back 5, 6 years ago when we started to put a lot of these properties in place, we ramped up our organization for a lot of inventory control, standard control, all properties in place to measure we could have consistent performance and we've delivered on it, but don't see any reasons for it to move.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Rick, you made an interesting comment in your opening remarks and it related to the Long-term Care business, and I'm not going to get the words exactly right, but you kind of alluded to longer-term improvement in LTC. Near-term, this is kind of a sustainable level of earnings that we should be looking for. And I guess when I look at that business, loss ratios have been trending higher, obviously, despite rate increases. Interest rates are obviously lower, who knows what happens to those 3, 4 years out? But I guess what gives you the confidence in making the statement about margin improvement in a business that has really only gone one direction for you and pretty much everybody else?", "Richard P. McKenney", "That is a fair. I think, Mark, when you look at it -- this is Rick. When you look at the LTC business, that statement really stems from the fact that we're very active in terms of raising rates in that business. Been talking for that now for a couple of years but those premiums are just starting to flow. So as you go back to when we started to raise rates, the process of actually getting premiums to start to flow will take some time. We'll be starting to see that now. All the pressures you talked about are still challenging. I mean, when I talk about improvement, it's slight improvement over time. It's nonmaterial improvement. But that will come from the repricing environment.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And, Mark, if I could add to Rick's comments, I think I just would underscore the importance of having chosen to get out of that business completely, put it into Closed Block and the focus that brings in our organization. So I think to your point, Rick and Kevin, it's involvements as well. Once you make that decision and put into a Closed Block, it doesn't just sit there. There's an awful lot of focus on many things, including rate increases. And I can assure you, Mark, that we recognize this as a substantial portion of our capital supporting that part of the business. And there's not many new levers, but there are levers that we can use to, as Rick said, slightly improve the performance there.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then just one final question in the U.K. I mean if you look at this business historically, obviously very high returns, 20%-plus, you benefited from acquisitions you made a while ago that you put them on your own claims platform, they performed well. Obviously, the last few years, or the last couple of years have been much more disappointing. I guess my question is, how do we think about the true returns of this business longer term? I mean, is this really a 13%-, 14%-return business similar to kind of maybe what you'd expect in the U.S. Or is there reason to think that it should structurally be higher in the U.K. over the long term?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Maybe I'll speak, maybe I'll ask Rick to speak too. I don't think Mark, that we, we've been saying actually for the last year or 2 -- those rates of return in the upper 20s and sometimes even into the 30s were not sustainable for any number of reasons. I think, obviously, we've been trying to bring people\u2019s expectations about the returns in this business. I for one, I think we believe, as a management team, this is still a business produce well above industry sorts of ROE. That's why it's not going to get to those kinds of levels we saw before. But you have to -- Jack and his team too. The hope is that we're also doing is reducing the volatility of the BTA contribution, as I mentioned in my comments, just looking at the last 6 quarters was a low of 19 and high of 34 and bounced all round in between there. So part of it is also just getting to the right above industry average kind of ROE. There's also doing it at the business model that has more predictability in terms of its ability to produce a more consistent BTA performance as well. Rick, I don't know if you'll add anything.", "Richard P. McKenney", "I'll just add that when we look at that business we see things we can improve. I think that's a key thing. We've gotten to 12% ROE, we see action items we can take to improve the business. We see ability to take price into the marketplace and make risk selection and that differs from where we are today so I think that gives us confidence. We can be higher than here today. Jack, I don't know if you have a follow-up on that.", "John F. McGarry", "My view too is that the market is different in the U.K. There's only 4 major players in the business. That business tends to be a very small part of what they do overall. And there's a kind of market expansion opportunity in the U.K. So the dynamics of the business in the U.K. aren't the same today as they are in the U.S., where you have 25 carriers, you have deep penetration and there's a lot of fighting back and forth between carriers. So as long as those dynamics are still in place, I think you should still be able to get above industry returns on it.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "It looks like from the queue we've exhausted our questions. And so let me just thank you all for taking the time to join us. I think, as a couple of you mentioned, there's an awful lot of reporting companies here in a relatively short period of time. So we appreciate people taking the time. Obviously, we're all available for any follow-on questions. And operator, this will complete our second quarter 2012 earnings call.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead.", "Thomas White", "Great. Thank you, Kim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2012 analyst and investor conference call for Unum. Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, as well as our subsequently filed Form 10-Qs. Our SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at unum.com.", "I also remind you that statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.", "A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found on our website in the Investors section.", "So participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, President and CEO; and Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO; and also Kevin McCarthy speaking for Unum US and Unum UK; and Randy Horn for Colonial Life.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tom Watjen.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Our fourth quarter was another solid one with operating earnings per share growth of 5.1%, and for the full year, our earnings per share grew 5.7%. This represents the seventh consecutive year of operating earnings per share growth at the company.", "In the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of many of the positive trends we discussed with our Investor Day meeting in December. First, our operating performance remains solid. We continue to see premium growth in our target market and continue to generate solid operating results across most of our businesses, which allowed us to maintain our strong profitability and returns. For the fourth quarter, our return on equity was 12.2%, and full year return on equity was 12.3%.", "Second, our investment performance and asset quality remains strong. We have not deviated from our investment strategy to chase yield but are continuing to take the actions we discussed with you at our December meeting to manage through this low interest rate environment.", "Third, our overall balance sheet remains in very good shape, and our book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew by 12% this past year to $29.55 per share. Our past 3 years, even with our restructuring actions last year, our book value has grown by an annual rate of 8.4%.", "And finally, our capital position remains strong, and we have maintained our financial flexibility. We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, with statutory net income for the total year totaling $625 million from our traditional U.S. insurance companies. For year end 2012, we are estimating our combined risk-based capital ratio to be 396% and holding company cash at just over $800 million.", "We are continuing to return capital to our shareholders, and in the fourth quarter, we repurchased another $100 million of stock, bringing us to $500 million for the full year and $2.2 billion over the past 5 years.", "At our December meeting, we also discussed 2 areas which represented some challenges for us, and I'm pleased that we saw some improvement in both of those in the fourth quarter. First, results for Unum UK improved relative to the prior quarter. While much of that improvement resulted from strong group long-term disability results, our group life line of business, which has been the greatest challenge, stabilized in the quarter. We are in the process of repricing the life block, and while still early, we are generally pleased with the results to date.", "And secondly, within our Closed Block segment, our long-term care loss ratio was lower in the fourth quarter relative to the prior quarter, and we continue to take the pricing actions we discussed with you in December.", "So in summary, 2012 was another very solid year for the company. As we look to 2013, we still have a generally cautious view of the environment with continued low employment growth and low interest rates. However, we are confident we can continue to create value for our shareholders by maintaining our disciplined growth strategy, delivering consistently strong returns in our ongoing businesses, maintaining our solid financial foundation and returning excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend increases.", "So with that quick overview of the fourth quarter, I'll now turn things over to Tom for an overview of our operating results this quarter. Tom?", "Thomas White", "Great. Thank you, Tom. As you can see from our press release yesterday afternoon, we reported net income of $233.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 or $0.85 per diluted common share compared to a net loss in the year-ago quarter of $369 million or $1.26 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the fourth quarter of 2012 are after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses of $7.5 million and after-tax net realized investment gains of $16.4 million.", "Included in fourth quarter 2011 were after-tax reserve additions and the write-off of deferred acquisition costs in our Closed Block segment totaling $619.6 million, net tax benefits of $22.7 million, after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses of $5.1 million and after-tax net realized investment gains of $4.8 million. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $225 million for this quarter or $0.82 per diluted common share compared to $228 million -- $228.2 million or $0.78 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.", "Moving to a review of our business segments, operating income for the Unum US segment increased 2.3% to $212.2 million in the fourth quarter, with premium income increasing by 3.2%. The expense ratio was stable on the year-over-year basis, and risk experience was also generally stable, with the benefit ratio for the segment at 73% this quarter compared to 72.7% in the year-ago quarter.", "Within the Unum US segment, operating income in the group disability line was $73.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $77.1 million last quarter. Premium income increased by 0.5% over last year due to sales growth and generally favorable persistency trends in recent quarters. But operating revenue declined 0.3% as net investment income declined by 4.1% due to lower assets allocated to this line and a decline in the investment yield. The benefit ratio for this line was 84.5% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from both the year ago 84.7% and the third quarter 84.9%.", "In the group life and AD&D line, operating income increased 4.8% to $55.1 million in the fourth quarter, benefiting from an increase of 5.5% in premium income, as well as higher net investment income and a lower operating expense ratio, which offset an increase in the benefit ratio to 72.5% this quarter from 70.7% in the year-ago quarter.", "In the supplemental and voluntary line, operating income increased 7.6% to $83.6 million, with solid growth in premium income of 5.6% offsetting a slight increase in the benefit ratio to 52.5% in the quarter from 51.9% in the year-ago quarter.", "Moving to Unum UK. Operating income in this segment declined to GBP 21.8 million from GBP 33.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 76.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 69.1% in the year-ago quarter, while premium income in local currency increased by 1.6%. Results in the group life line of business were significantly weaker than the year-ago quarter but were stable with the third quarter, while income in the group long-term disability line was generally flat with the year-ago quarter but up significantly from the third quarter.", "Concluding our core operations, Colonial Life reported an increase in operating income of 5.1% to $68.3 million. Premium income increased by 4.4%, and the benefit ratio was stable on a year-over-year basis at 52.5%.", "In the Closed Block segment, operating income totaled $28.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $922.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for the impact of the reserve addition and DAC write-off, operating income last year was $30.8 million.", "For the Corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $34.6 million for the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $18.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. Net investment income is lower due to lower asset levels, a lower proportion of assets invested at long-term interest rates and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships. Interest and debt expense was higher at $35.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $32.4 million in the year-ago quarter, again, reflecting the issuance of $250 million of 30-year senior notes in the third quarter.", "So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis of this quarter's results.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover the profit trends we experienced in our business segments this quarter, a little more detail on our growth trends, and I'll also update you on our investment results and capital position.", "First, on operating results in the fourth quarter, our Unum US segment again produced good results with growth in operating earnings of 2.3% and generally stable risk experience across each of our product lines.", "Focusing on the risk results, first, with group disability, the benefit ratio has remained stable at 84.5%, which is consistent with last quarter as well as a year ago. The underlying experience this quarter was again favorable, with stable claim incidents, continued strong claim recoveries and the ongoing benefit of price discipline on new sales as well as renewals. These favorable trends are somewhat offset by the interest rate environment and the impact of the 50-basis-point reduction we made in the reserve discount rate for group long-term disability new claim incurrals in the third quarter.  All in all, we're quite pleased with the level of profitability we are experiencing in the group disability line, with a full year ROE of just below 13%.", "The group life and AD&D line was again a strong earnings contributor this quarter at $55 million. The benefit ratio was 72.5% in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with the third quarter level, with mortality running slightly higher than previous quarters. Margins in this line of business also remain very favorable, with ROE for the year at approximately 16%.", "And finally, in Unum US, the supplemental and voluntary line continues to be our largest earnings generator at $83.6 million this quarter, an increase of 7.6%.", "[Audio Gap]", "year and risk experience also remains generally favorable. The fourth quarter benefit ratio of 52.5% was up slightly, as both the individual disability recently issued and voluntary benefit lines similarly had slightly higher benefit ratios. These lines of business continue to be attractive growth opportunities with very good returns, generating ROEs in the 13% to 14% range.", "Moving to Unum UK. Fourth quarter results improved relative --", "[Audio Gap]", "and back within a range of expectations of GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million. The improvement relative to the third quarter was driven by strong results in the group long-term disability line of business, as claim incidents and claim recoveries were favorable.", "Results in the group life line, which has been the source of much of the recent underperformance in the segment, were comparable to the third quarter. Our primary focus for this product line is to stabilize the profitability in the near term and look to improve returns and growth over the medium term. Our fourth quarter results were a step in the execution of that plan, which includes repricing and shifts in our mix of business over the next several quarters.", "Additionally, as we mentioned at our December investor meeting, we were evaluating alternatives to reduce volatility in the group life results. And to that end, we have executed the reinsurance transaction for this line effective at the beginning of the year. This reinsurance arrangement will have the effect of reducing the amount and relative volatility of earnings from the group life line and will also reduce the overall level of required capital. The overall ROE was 13% for the year.", "Colonial Life once again produced solid results for the fourth quarter earnings, with earnings of $68.3 million, showing an increase of over 5%, while premium income increased by 4.5%. The benefit ratio remains stable at 52.5% this quarter, which enabled an ROE for Colonial Life for the full year of 2012 of just under 17%. When you look across Unum's core businesses, you see we had very good returns for 2012.", "Concluding my comments on profitability, results in our Closed Block were higher at $28.8 million this quarter. Operating earnings in the individual disability line were higher than normal, driven by favorable risk experience. On its surface, net investment income was also higher than recent quarterly trends. This occurred primarily in the individual disability line, where we received several million dollars of miscellaneous income as a result of bond call prepayment premiums. While that bond call premium increased our net investment income results for the quarter, we correspondingly adjusted the discount rate for new claim reserves. This was done to recognize the impact of losing these higher-yielding bonds to an early call and to maintain a net interest margin in our reserves. Aside from this adjustment, underlying claim experience in the individual disability block was favorable in the fourth quarter.", "Long-term care results for the fourth quarter showed some improvement over the third quarter results, with the interest-adjusted loss ratio declining to 89.9% from 91.3%. Our full year 2012 LTC interest-adjusted loss ratio was 90%, at the high end of our long-term expected range.", "Now I'd like to move to discussion of our sales and growth trends, beginning with Unum US. We continue to be pleased with our sales results, with a 4.8% growth in overall sales in the fourth quarter and 7.5% for the full year. This quarter, sales growth was a bit more skewed to the large-case market, where we remain disciplined and are happy to see this progress. Sales in the core market were down 2.6% for our LTD, STD, group life and AD&D lines combined, impacted by the rate increases we have been implementing on sales over the past several quarters.  Our mix of sales continues to reflect our long-term growth and mix objectives from the core market in 2012.", "Premium persistency has been positive all year and ended at over 90% for group life and LTD in 2012. With these positive trends, we continue to produce premium growth in the 3% to 4% range for Unum US segment, a good combination of growth and strong profitability, particularly in today's competitive market conditions and continued flat employment trends.", "In the U.K., sales results reflect the actions we are taking to turn this business. Sales were down by 42% in total, including a sharp drop of 72% in group life sales and a more moderate decline of 6.5% in the group long-term disability line. We continue to push price increases into the group life market, as well as scale back our -- certain sales in certain market sectors, as we reposition this business line for better margins in the future.", "Persistency also declined as expected due to the pricing actions we're taking, from 89.3% in 2011 to 82.5% in 2012 for group life. Persistency in group long-term disability was more stable, declining from 86.6% to 84% in 2012.", "And finally at Colonial Life, sales showed a modest increase in the fourth quarter. However, coming off a decline in third quarter sales of 5.8%, we were pleased to see this turn. Sales rebounded nicely in the public sector market, showing 8.6% growth over last year's fourth quarter, while sales were slightly negative in the core market sector.", "In the fourth quarter, we also saw a slight improvement in sales to new accounts. We have seen increasing sales from existing customers, which we will certainly remain a focus of ours. But we're also pleased to begin to see improvements in our growth in sales attributable to new account relationships.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio, there is little change to our recent trends of strong credit quality in the midst of a challenging environment for new money yields. This is due to the low level of interest rates as well as tight corporate bond spreads.", "On credit quality, the net unrealized gain position of our fixed-maturity securities portfolio stands at $7.2 billion at year end, which is mostly driven by low rates. However, our watch list of potential problem credits remains very low. The net realized after-tax investment gain or loss from our investment portfolio was slightly positive again this quarter and for the full year.", "On the low interest rate environment, while 10- and 30-year treasury yields increased slightly in the fourth quarter, much of that improvement was lost to tighter corporate bond spreads. The net result continues to be low new money investment yields, which led to a reduction of 7 basis points in our portfolio this quarter to 6.47% at year end. Our strategy for managing through this environment is centered on being selective in our asset purchases and utilizing higher allocations to asset categories such as private placements, commercial mortgage loans and below-investment-grade bonds.", "In 2012, we believe this provided better relative value. We also continue to benefit from the hedges we have in place for our long-duration, long-term care portfolio, which will cover about 20% of our asset purchases for LTC in 2013.", "The other important -- element of our strategy for dealing with low interest rates is to make adjustments to our discount rate assumptions, such as the 50-basis-point reduction we did in Unum US group long-term disability in the third quarter, which leads to higher pricing on new sales as well as renewal business. As a result, we saw our interest margin improve by 1 basis point in the quarter. As we mentioned at Investor Day, we estimate that the low interest rate environment will impact our earnings growth by 68% in 2013, of which we will recoup 1/3 as price increases work their way through the book.", "Now moving on to our capital position, which closed the year in a very strong position. As we've discussed in the past, the important driver is statutory net income, which totaled $188 million for our traditional U.S. life insurance company in the fourth quarter and $625 million for the full year. This performance helps to support our capital-generation model that generates between $550 million and $650 million of excess capital annually before shareholder dividends. The weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies was approximately 396% at year end, at the upper end of our 2012 target range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash and marketable securities totaled $805 million at the end of the year, slightly exceeding our 2012 expected range and 3x our annual cash needs.", "Our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter totaled $100 million and completed our 2012 plan of $500 million, which reduced share count by 8%. We continue to expect an additional $500 million of repurchases for 2013.", "And finally, in closing, we remain consistent with the overall outlook we introduced at our December meeting, as we anticipate growth in operating earnings per share for 2013 to be within the range of 0% to 6%.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. As we move to your questions, I'll close by reiterating what I said earlier. We are generally pleased with our financial and operating results this quarter and for the full year of 2012. Unum US and Colonial Life continue to generate strong results in the quarter, while the results in Unum UK and the Closed Block segment showed some quarter-over-quarter improvement. Our balance sheet remains strong, and that, along with our solid capital position, enables us to continue to create value for our shareholders by supplementing our operating performance, by returning excess capital to our shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividend increases.", "Now this completes our prepared comments. And Kim, let's move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Suneet Kamath from UBS.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So I wanted to focus on the U.K. and the long-term care business which surprised relative to what we were expecting. So I was just wondering if you could comment on 2 things. First, in terms of the U.K. and LTC, how much of the better-than-expected claims experience would you say is sort of a quarterly variation that could reverse? Or how much of it is just some of the actions that you've been taking in terms of pricing? And then sort of related to that, specifically on pricing, can you talk about where we are with respect to the repricing of the U.K. business, maybe a percent of the way through that? And then any feedback you've gotten from the regulators as you've tried to reprice the in-force long-term care business?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Let's see if I can sort of organize that a little bit, Suneet. Let's start with just the U.K. if we can and maybe just break it down into 2 -- a couple of pieces. One is your discussion -- your question about group life pricing and where that whole stands; and Rick, maybe we can talk a little bit about the financial outlook. But maybe, Kevin, starting with you back on the U.K. pricing of the group life block and where that stands and perhaps maybe where some of the early indications of its effectiveness are.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Thanks, Tom. Suneet, with respect to the U.K. business and the group life business, we are sort of in the early stages. Probably, we're about maybe 30% through the book of business in terms of placing renewal increases. The average increases are around 12.7% so far on the renewed business. And we have some segments, as Rick mentioned, that the price increases are significantly higher than that. And we have announced some subsets of our group life business that we're deemphasizing, in particular, the larger end of the group life marketplace. So it will take about -- though into 2014 before we fully get through that block. But I would expect us to be making that kind of progress throughout 2013 on the group life side.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Maybe just shifting, then, if we could, Rick, to you, just on an outlook for the U.K., just sort of put the quarter in perspective as we go to 2013.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. So as you look at the different elements you asked about claims, I think the life business running similar to what we saw, and we're taking actions to move through that. The disability line actually looked pretty good, but back -- I would say, it's back more in a range of our expectations as opposed to what we've done in the third quarter. When you take that all together, as we look out next year, we came in close to GBP 22 million in the quarter. We're going to see that, I think, stabilize over the course of the year. So we go into a relatively flat plan as we're looking out into 2013. But we're hopeful with what we saw in the fourth quarter that things can look pretty good there.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And then on long-term care?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes, maybe we'll break it out into 2 pieces again, Suneet. And maybe, Kevin, just on operational price actions and things we talked about in December. I think we continue to make progress on that.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, we continue to be pretty much what we discussed at our Investor Day in December. We're about 60% of the way through the process in terms of filing and approvals. As you know, we are seeking rate increases in excess of 25%. And to date, on the 60% that we're through so far, we're running ahead of that plan. So good solid steady progress. Those price increases don't actually get executed and implemented in the marketplace until the beginning part of this year, and then their effects will flow through operating earnings toward the end of 2013 and into 2014.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, if I could pick up on the long-term care question around experience, we saw that. You would have seen our loss ratio come in a little bit in the fourth quarter relative to the third. So we're certainly happy to see that. But as you see, our -- just under 90%, so we're back within our range of expectations around that. But certainly, something to watch as we continue to move through time on that, as we've done. But it's good in the fourth quarter to be back in our range of expectations, which is in the high 80s.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on the long-term care, if I could. If I look at your block, I think it looks like maybe half of it in terms of premium is group LTC and the other half is individual, roughly. Just as you're going for these price increases, do the regulators look at individual versus group differently? Is one more likely to get a rate increase versus the other? Or is it pretty consistent across the 2 product lines?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, I would say it's fairly consistent. I mean the average age of the group long-term care book is much younger. And there is usually -- there's always an employer involved and sometimes, employer premiums involved. And so, to that extent, I think the regulators may, to some extent, look a little more kindly on what we need to do in the group long-term care business because there are many options available to the employer, as well as the employee given their younger ages. Individual long-term care being a much higher sort of average age, I think the regulators are probably a little tighter on that. But so far, in both cases, we're exceeding expectations.", "Operator", "Moving on, we have a question from Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to get your perspective on how an improvement in the economy and payrolls would essentially act as a tailwind to your overall business, particularly in U.S.?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, you want to pick up on it? You spend a fair amount of time on that.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. Well, 2 things would benefit us in the U.S. in terms of improvement in the economy -- well, 3, I'll talk to 2. Wage inflation would be one. The large majority of our group life and group disability lines of business are directly related to covered payroll, and the benefits are tied to payroll. So to the extent payrolls go up, benefit levels and premiums go up. Second, I think a positive effect would be growth in employment. As you know, we tend to target markets in our group business toward economically less downward-sensitive industries, and we try to target those that are growing. And so to the extent that we get overall employment growth, that would benefit us on the sales side. It would probably benefit us on the in-force book of business side as well. And so we would start to get some sort of positive uptick in terms of earned premium. And then the third piece of the economy probably is interest rates, and I'll let Rick talk to that.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. No, I think when you look at -- it's certainly tied together in terms of actions that are being taken by the Fed, as well as just the overall improvement in the economy. As we start to see rates come up, certainly, a benefit to our business. All of our product lines that we have out there benefit from a rising interest rate environment. So we certainly will look forward to that, although we have not factored that into our plans today.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just to get your level of comfort in the U.K. business and the runoff operations, are things tracking according to plan there?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, you want to pick up on that again? Also, I think, Jay, too, you remember we went through some of this before in the U.S. I think as we think about what's happening there, I think, Kevin, there's a fair amount that we can take from our experience and having been through a very similar exercise a number of years ago in the U.S.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Right, right. Very, very similar to what we had to do with resetting our U.S. block of business. As you know, we've taken a couple of different actions in the U.K. on the group income protection side. We're bolstering our claim management practices, transferring some capabilities and skill sets from the U.S. to the U.K. I think some of that is starting to flow through when we had very solid group income protection claim management results, risk management results during the fourth quarter and expect that to continue going forward. On the group life side, we already talked about the rate increases that we're placing. We're also managing mix of business sort of downward, toward more core market business. And we also are putting a variety of other internal underwriting measures in place. That would probably have a downward effect on persistency in sales, at least in 2013, until sort of the market normalizes.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Can we start with the U.S. segment for a second? When I think of the 50-basis-point reduction in discount rate, I guess I was somewhat surprised to see group long-term disability new sales grow by 15% in the quarter with that. So any additional color you may be able to offer there would be helpful.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "With regard to the discount rate change, that's primarily with respect to new claim incurrals. And so on the risk side, we did have a very, very strong quarter because we basically were able to absorb the discount rate and keep the loss ratio basically flat. In terms of the discount rate's effect on pricing, we were already moving ahead. It's really not a discount rate change. It's more a reflection of what's the assumed interest rate that we assume in the pricing. We had built that in during the course of the year, and we had mid-single-digit price increases going on in both new business and renewal business in LTD throughout the year, and we'll continue that in 2013.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then the U.K. segment, could you -- I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you provide a little more color on the reinsurance program? Does that -- you put on kind of the size or structure of it?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Absolutely. Rick, you want to pick that one up?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, certainly. There's 2 elements to it. And as I mentioned, it's really to reduce the volatility of this business. Our core line there is certainly our group disability side. And so as we've had the challenges here, we're taking action, using reinsurance to help us mitigate some of that volatility. Roughly, we're going with a 50% quarter share on the block. So you actually reduce capital profits, premiums associated with that block. And then we're also reducing our retention levels in terms of what we retain, cutting those down to 500 million -- or GBP 500,000 pounds per life. So actually, some good restructuring there. It's not going to have a large impact on our earnings to do that. And we think it's a good use and also frees up some capital behind that product line as well. So we're happy with the transaction, and we'll see how that plays out over the course of the year.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Got it. And if I could sneak in one more, the RBC ratio came down to kind of within the target range now. How should we think of the ability to return excess capital, with the target range kind of in -- being in the target range already?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Certainly. When you look at where our RBC level is, we're within our target range. I'd take you very quickly back to our philosophy around how we're returning capital, and that is we're returning capital in which we've been using to buy back stock here for a period of time based on our capital generation. So regardless of where our capital levels are, our 396% is quite high and probably higher in the long term that we'll need. That doesn't change our outlook in terms of returning capital that we generate back to shareholders, which we expect over the course of this year will look very similar as to what it did over the last several years, which is why we're sticking with a $500 million share repurchase.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And if I could just add one thing too, Rick. I think we closed the third quarter with $762 million of cash, and we were above $800 million this quarter. And so there's some fluidity between RBC and risk-based capital, actually. And it's probably worth everybody keeping those 2 numbers in mind as we think about this whole capital position.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Absolutely, as we were over $800 million of cash. And so when you think of that, think of roughly 10 basis points to the RBC ratio is $100 million of cash. There's fluidity there. And like I said, I'll take you right back to what our capital-generation model looks like. And that's really what we predicate our share repurchases on, not actually the levels of excess capital we have, which we do believe we have today.", "Operator", "And we'll take a question from Randy Binner from FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Just one on the discount rate change. The -- we look at the 10-year and then credit spreads have been tighter too. And so the 10-year, I guess, is moving higher, credit spreads are still tight. But my question is, I mean, what would need to change in those metrics we look at as analysts before we would expect the need for another discount rate change?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Well, I think that the discount rate change we made in the third quarter was reflective of those rates that we see today. And so I think that things would have to get quite a bit worse before we would change the discount rate. Something we always look at, but we made a pretty aggressive move in the third quarter. And I take you back to the fact that we do maintain a margin in that line. So when you think about that, it can be more fluid. It's not directly tied to how we put money to work on the quarter, it's taking into account how we're putting money to work, combined with the fact that we have roughly an 87-basis-point margin between our earned rate and our discount rate. So we can manage through that. The move we made, I think, was prudent in the third quarter, and we'll take that out. I'm sure we'll come back and look at that as we get out towards the end of this year.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then on Colonial, I just kind of had a couple broad questions. And so it's really starting with the benefit ratio. I mean it came in kind of where we thought it would, maybe 52.5%. And that's been where we've been running, but it's higher than we were I guess in kind of '11 and looking back to '10. And so the first question is should we expect that to be a little bit higher kind of at the current level going forward? And then just if you could kind of talk about how the economy and competition might be affecting the sales outlook for those products in '13.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Maybe we'll flip the 2 around, actually, Randy, and ask Randy Horn to speak to the business and the operations in the economy. And then maybe, Rick, you can just touch briefly on the outlook side of things. But, Randy, just want to sort of set the stage with the environment?", "Randall C. Horn", "Sure, Tom. Good morning, Randy. Overall, the economic environment does continue to provide some headwinds, as Tom said in his opening comments. But we continue to see significant opportunity in our target markets, which is that small to midsize employer on the commercial side and then the public sector. A lot of the pressure we saw in 2012 and in -- continuing into the fourth quarter of last year was in that large-case commercial account, greater than 1,000 employees. We see a lot of volatility there, and it's not a strong area of emphasis for us. So we feel by staying strongly focused on our target markets, that there's still a lot of underpenetration in those markets, and we see a lot of opportunity there. We have very strong results in the public sector, as Rick mentioned, in the fourth quarter. We're heavily focused on the local government and education side there. And even though, again, the economy is still not our friend, Randy, overall, we still see a lot of opportunity in the highly underpenetrated markets.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And just on competition, I mean, Aflac had kind of 0% to 5% sales growth, which is probably consistent with what most of us are looking at Colonial. But I mean, is there anything -- this is an area of the industry that doesn't change that much, to be honest, from a competition perspective, but didn't know if a better economy or rate pressures and other parts of businesses have changed who you're seeing from a competitive perspective.", "Randall C. Horn", "Not seeing any significant change there, Randy. There certainly are new entrants to the voluntary benefits marketplace, but it's been fairly gradual over time. And in our target markets, we're still seeing primarily the same competitors: Aflac, Allstate, American Fidelity. So really pretty consistent on that side of it.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, you want to pick up the profitability benefit ratio piece of that?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, certainly. Actually, Randy, when you look at our benefit ratio of 52.5%, it's really on our expectations. It is slightly up over the last several years. But I take you back to the type of returns this business is seeing, it's 15% to 17% is what we put out in our Investor Day type of return. So we expect 2013 to be pretty stable on the benefit ratio side, which continues to generate very good returns.", "Operator", "Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs has our next question.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess first question for Kevin. So we saw some good sales growth, a lot of it or all of it was really driven by the large-case market versus kind of your core market. I think some of this is driven by your partnership with UnitedHealthcare. But I guess how should we be thinking about this kind of 30% growth outside of your core market?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Chris, as you know, from sort of, over the last 3 or 4 years, we've got a consistent philosophy in large-case, which was basically to just grow at the average rate of the marketplace over time and to be pretty disciplined about how we pursue cases, be opportunistic. So you see some quarters when we have strong large-case sales, you'll see some quarters where we have weak large-case sales. We look for steady sales growth in our voluntary and core market business, but we look for opportunistic sales growth in our large-case national client group business. Our partnership with UnitedHealthcare has gone great. In our national client group large-case sector, we've been aggressively sort of targeting primarily the health care sector in our partnership with UnitedHealthcare. And more than half of our sales, around half of our sales in the fourth quarter came from that health sector and UnitedHealthcare partnership. We didn't write any jumbo cases. So we wrote a good volume, if you will, of large cases as opposed to 1 or 2 big large ones. And so I would say that it was a very, very good quarter for us. I wouldn't necessarily expect it to repeat itself in any following quarter. I think it's going to be, as it has been for the last several years, hit or miss depending on whether we see good disciplined pricing opportunity out there for long sustainable relationships with clients.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Rick, you gave some pretty good insight in terms of the near- to intermediate-term strategy for the U.K. But I guess when do you expect we see that shift from stabilization to growth? Is that something we could see a year from now? Or could it take longer than that, just given the duration of some of the rate guarantees that you guys have out there?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I think we actually expect it to turn. I mean we would be hopeful we'd see a turn in the course of 2013, although we haven't really built that into our plans. I think we're being pragmatic in terms of how we expect that to come through. There's more to play out. But we certainly would look to see that as we get out into 2014.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just one last quick one. I guess regarding your hedging strategy, curious if you can comment at all on any implications from Dodd-Frank around collateral requirements or if it causes you to increase your cash balances at all.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, certainly. We're looking at that. I mean there's one area in the business that we would look to hedge as rates get up and as it is, can be behind our long-term care business. So we're certainly staying close to the Dodd-Frank implications. But when we look at the actual amount, the pure nominal amount or notional amount of hedging that we'd do it would actually be relatively modest relative to the size of our overall investment portfolio. So it's something we'll stay on top of. But although it may be impactful across the financial services industry, it's not something we are overly concerned about.", "Operator", "And we'll hear next from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.", "Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "With the price increases in the Closed Block coming in later in the year, is that going to lead to declining loss ratios?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, you want to talk just to the outlook for the Closed?", "Richard P. McKenney", "So when you look at the Closed Block, and it's 2 different pieces. Our individual disability block has been very stable, actually pretty good results we've seen over a period of time. We'd expect that to continue. On particular to the LTC side, which I think is what you're getting at. We'd actually expect it to be fairly stable. And so we've kind of put a high 80s number out there. This premium change that we're going to see flowing into these price increases, they're going to take place over quite an extended period of time. And so that's how we look at it, and it's going to take a while for it to be overly noticeable. And stability, I think, is what we're looking for behind this loss ratio.", "Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then the -- in voluntary within the U.S. business, that growth has decelerated a little bit. What's the outlook there?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "We still look to grow at about sort of 150% to 200% of the marketplace, given our position, our ability to package products between voluntary lines and group lines. As you know, we have a well-stated, well-articulated strategy to enable employers to share funding with employees through combinations of employer-paid and employee-paid products. About 10% to 15% of our group products come with voluntary lines attached. And in our mid-market, 20% of our business that we sold in 2011 came with voluntary benefits attached. We'd expect to grow in the 10% plus or minus kind of range in voluntary going forward. Marketplace tends to be sort of more in the 5% to 7% range or so right now. And so I think we're very, very optimistic about it. And I think the trend of employers sharing funding with employees will only increase. It won't decelerate, and I think that bodes well for both Unum US and impacting strategy at Colonial.", "Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Then one final question. Have you started to see any movement in that natural growth, more people, higher wages with your existing customers?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Not yet, not at least in any way that you can see flow through the numbers. I think there are good signs out there that employment may be sort of stabilizing, that this employment growth is starting to show up in some industries. We'll see what happens with the economy during 2013 if GDP holds up. And if it does, then you might start to see a little bit of wage inflation. And I think both of those things will benefit us on the normal or natural growth side.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A quickie first. Rick, earnings came in I think a little bit better than everybody was looking for. There were a few items here or there. What do you think -- what would be the base for the growth for 2013, I guess, in your mind, is the question that I want to ask?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Well, the base we're using as we lay out our outlook for next year is reported. So you think of the 315 as we talk about our 0% to 6% growth. If you look at it from a run rate perspective, it's probably a couple of cents lower than we expected, and that's more from a projection perspective. But I don't want to discount the fact that we had a very good quarter and exceeded earnings. But when you look forward, I think you'd probably pull it back a couple cents for a really good tax rate we saw in the fourth quarter and extrapolate off of that. But think about our baseline of 315 and 0% to 6% is what we put out there, how we expect to grow in 2013.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I want to go back to Unum UK, make sure I understand what is happening here. The reinsurance is on which line?", "Richard P. McKenney", "The group life line, purely.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "It's purely the group life line. And it's 50% of the in force, is that correct? Or is it 50% of new business?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, that's correct. It's in force and new business.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And --", "[Audio Gap]", "4Q '12 and 3Q '12. In 3Q '12, you stated that you thought there was just some volatility, that the normalized number in pounds was still GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million. I understand from Tom -- so you reported about GBP 22 million. I understand from Tom, there was about a $5 million hit from write-down of software assets, that's in the expense line there. That would kind of get you to 26, 27, somewhere in that range. Are you still thinking that, that GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million is the range for this year? And if so, how does the reinsurance play into that, if it does at all?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, so the reinsurance we've incorporated in terms of our outlook, so when you think about that overall, GBP 20 million, GBP 25 million is still a range. And it takes you back to an earlier question we had on the U.K. I'd like -- I'm hopeful that it could be better over the course of the year. But we built our plans that it will be relatively flat year-over-year as we see some of these pricing increases take hold in combination with what we see from an overall perspective. So U.K. had a good quarter, but I think as we look forward, we're still expecting a flattish-type plan and looking to see if some of these good results we saw in the fourth quarter can sustain.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And one thing to clarify there, Steven, is the software impairment was GBP 3 million, which [indiscernible] $5 million, just to get the currencies straight.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Right. Sorry about that. And then on Colonial, I don't know if you answered this, how much of Colonial's business is individually underwritten versus group underwritten?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Randy, you want to pick that up, just a little bit about your block of business?", "Randall C. Horn", "Yes, the vast majority of our business is still on an individual basis. It's north of 90%, so that 90% to 95% range is individual business and is underwritten.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. The reason why I ask that is that, Randy, you may or may not be aware that the EBSA came out with a FAQ regarding group indemnity insurance, and whether or not it would be exempt under ACA, certain types of products?", "Randall C. Horn", "I am familiar with that, yes.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So it sounds to me like that doesn't affect you at all. But would it generally affect the market in a major way?", "Randall C. Horn", "I think that's still an open issue on that. And certainly, our trade organization is taking a hard look at that. But from our perspective today, we feel our products are all what we call HIPAA-excepted benefits and are not subject to the health care reform legislation.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll hear from Mark Finkelstein from Evercore Partners.", "A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I also want to go back to the U.K. just to make sure I understand it. I guess the way I'll ask the question is I think, Rick, you opened it up as kind of -- describing it as smoothing. And I guess my question is, is the ultimate loss content unchanged with this transaction and it's just the emergence of the losses? Or does it fall into more of a true risk transfer type structure?", "Richard P. McKenney", "No. This is true risk transfer. I'd have to go back to the transcript. I certainly did not use the word smoothing in talking about it. It's something where we're taking roughly half the book and reinsuring that out, pure risk transfer as we look at that. And we will -- or I should say, our reinsurer will take half the risk, half the benefit in terms of how it comes through.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "The other thing I would add is part of that reinsurance transaction is also in excess of retention strategy. And so some of what happened to us in group life was that we got hit with some fairly significant, high severity claims. And so we backed off our retention limit, which allows us to reduce the volatility from that high severity claim incidence. And that should be a positive impact to us going forward.", "A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Yes, I got on late. I apologize if I misinterpreted you. I guess the other question I was thinking about is just looking at the persistency of group life and the sales levels of group life in the U.K., how tied is the group life product to disability in the U.K. market? And how cognizant do you have to be in terms of declines in group life overall vis-\u00e0-vis the disability business?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, Mark, I think -- I mean a fair amount of it is certainly tied, but I don't believe that the actions that we're taking in group life should have any at all negative effect on our group disability strength in the U.K. We are far and away the largest part of the marketplace there in terms of market share leadership. We're the market leader in terms of setting product design, market penetration expectations, distribution, enrollment strategies, service strategies, claim management. And I would expect that none of what we're doing in group life will have any negative effect on group income protection.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jeff Schuman from KBW.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I'm sorry to do this, but I think I'm going to come back to the U.K. for the ninth time. And it's probably been well explained, but I didn't quite follow it. I guess what I think I'm hearing is that you're ceding a significant amount of the volatility and you're ceding some of the capital requirement, but you're keeping the earnings, which sounds like a great outcome, but maybe I didn't quite hear that right.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "No...", "Richard P. McKenney", "So maybe I can try and clarify that, so we don't get #10 coming through. The -- it's actually full risk transfer, so we are ceding off the business. So when you look at that, the reason it's not a heavy income impact, it's because there's not a lot of income in the business right now. And so when we take that out, what we're actually able to get from the reinsurers is very similar to the profit levels that we earned at least over the last several quarters. So we'd like for that improve, but that's why the 3 of those things work together.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So at this point, they're participating in the modest level of profits, which is not much of a give-up. But then going forward, they would also participate in some of the upside, is that...", "Richard P. McKenney", "That's correct. That's correct. And so as we go through these repricing actions, we have to factor that in.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then one kind of high-level question. I think I heard Kevin say that -- Kevin was asked a couple questions about kind of U.S. corporate America and the employer situation. And it sounds like you're not necessarily yet seeing a lot of emerging strength. Thinking back a few quarters, I think, at one point last year, your premiums started to lift a bit, and I think Tom was cautiously optimistic that maybe you were on the leading edge of seeing a little bit more strength in some of the employment markets. Is it fair to say now that maybe that's -- it's a little early to identify that strength?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. Jeff, Kevin here. I would say it's bounced around a bit. We -- in the old days, pre-2009 or whatever, we'd get 2% to 3% of sort of top line in-force lift from wage inflation and employment growth. Over the last 4 years, it's been basically plus or minus 0. Yes, I think there was 1 year, it was actually slightly negative. This year, our top line growth came primarily from a combination of a strong sales year and a very strong persistency year, plus that persistency held up in spite of moving prices up. And so that's what's really helped our top line. But in terms of whether the economy has turned or not, I'm no economist, I'm just saying that it isn't showing up right now, nor are we counting on it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A quick question on the LTC. I was just a little bit confused by recent remarks that the improvements in earnings would be gradual over time. I thought you had mentioned earlier in the call that you're 60% of the way through this process and that we would see effects flowing through late 2013, 2014. Maybe if you just help me understand the dynamics of that.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Seth, yes, we're 60% of the way through the seeking approvals process. The actual execution of the rate increases doesn't start until during basically somewhere around the second quarter of this year. Those will roll out gradually across the book. And then the effect on earnings from that top line in coming from the rate increases will emerge also gradually. And so I think as Rick -- I think Rick mentioned that we'd start to see a little bit of that effect the end of 2013, a little more of that effect in 2014 and then going forward. But it will emerge gradually, and we expect, therefore, the loss ratio to stay within that range, stabilized range we think of 85% to 90%.", "Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And if we think about this cycle of how long it takes to reprice the book, is it 2 to 3 years? Is that a fair sort of assessment when we start thinking about late 2013 as a starting point?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "About 2 years, I would say, 2013 into 2014, and then you start to see the emergence following that. But I think it's going to be an iterative process. I don't think it's going to be a onetime thing. I think constantly we're going to have to monitor interest rates and the pressure of interest rates. We're going to have to monitor emerging experience. So I think we talked on Investor Day, this is a very, very young line of business. Most of the claims, if you will, is on the reserve side of the business, not on the paid claim side of the business. I think we're like 2% or 3% into the life cycle of this product. So we'll continue to monitor industry experience trends as well as our own and then we'll continue to make pricing adjustments to accommodate what emerges.", "Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. Very clear. And just one high-level question on capital. You've been pretty consistent about signaling $500 million next year. I don't know if that will still have a pretty nice cash cushion. When we think going forward, what's the main trigger in terms of bringing that down? I believe you said macro events. So if we think about sort of main macro triggers, maybe if you could help take us through that?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, you want to pick up on that?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Are you talking about the excess? When you say the trigger, in terms of bringing that down, I think when you look at...", "Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "The excess, yes.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, the excess. I think as we look at that, we've been very consistent over the last several years, and we just don't see the environment yet where we want to take those down to certain levels. You can look at what's going on in the economies around the world, there's just a lot of unknowns out there. And so we feel very good about the $500 million that we've been able to do over the last several years. We think it's a good use of our capital. But I think as we look forward, as we even said as we're going into 2013, we don't expect to take down those levels of excess capital in any meaningful way.", "Operator", "And that last question will come from Sean Dargan from Macquarie.", "Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research", "Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just when I look at the tax rate and the corporate earnings relative to where our model was, it seems that the corporate loss was higher, but the consolidated effective tax rate was lower. Should we expect to see what you reported in first quarter as sort of a guide for what we'll see -- I'm sorry, in the fourth quarter, as a guide for what we'll see throughout 2013?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Certainly. When you look at -- actually, we report on a before-tax basis, so even our corporate segment is on a before-tax basis. We have some items that are tax benefiting and on a before-tax basis actually cost us some money. So I think to cut to the chase, you should expect our quarterly run rate will look similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thank you, Sean. And I know it's been a busy morning for many of you. So thank you for taking time to join us on this morning's call. This will complete our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.

Tom?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Our first quarter results were off to a good start to 2013. With year-over-year operating earnings per share growth of 9.6% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, increasing 11.9%. Let me touch on a few of my observations for the quarter.", "First, our operating performance again remains quite strong. We continue to generate solid underwriting results across most of our businesses resulting in a stable to lower benefit ratios for each of our major business segments. As a result, we again delivered strong profit margins across most of our business segments and an operating return on equity of 11.7% for the company and 14.1% for our ongoing operating businesses.", "Second, as it relates to revenue growth, it remains a difficult environment. And you saw that in our company-wide sales, which were down 5.2% for the quarter. Not to make excuses, but when you look more carefully at the results, you'll see that the decline is driven by 2 things, a significant year-over-year decline in U.K. group life sales and pressure on our small case U.S.-based business. The U.K. group life sales results should be no surprise as we have taken significant pricing actions in this product area.", "In the U.S., the general environment remains challenging, which has been compounded by the fact that many brokers and agents and employers are focused on the implementation of health care reform, thus, delaying the implementation of new workplace benefit programs. This headwind may be with us for much of 2003 -- 2013, but is no cause for us to change our disciplined growth strategy. We continue to feel that we are very well positioned in our markets.", "The third thing I'd point out is that we have continued to deliver very solid investment results and our asset quality remains excellent. We have not changed our investment strategies to stretch for yield but instead, have continued to take the actions necessary to manage through this low interest rate environment, including raising prices in those product areas most impacted by today's low rates.", "In addition, our balance sheet remains in very good shape and our book value per share, I said earlier, excluding AOCI, grew by almost 12% to $30.24. At the same time, we have maintained a solid capital position, which when combined with our strong first quarter statutory results, continues to provide us with a great deal of financial flexibility.", "Our risk-based capital ratio of 396% continued to be at the upper end of our expected range for 2013 and our holding company cash position of over $650 million is off but well within our guidance.", "We repurchased another $95 million of our stock as part of our plan to repurchase $500 million for the year. We have now repurchased approximately $2.3 billion in stock since we initiated this program in 2008. Later this month, our board will consider an increase to our common stock dividend, which they have increased in each of the past 4 years.", "Last, let me also touch on a couple of other areas that have, in the past, not performed as well as we had hoped, both of which I am happy to say continue to show steady improvement this quarter. I'm, of course, referring to our Unum UK group life business and our Closed Block. Our Unum UK group life business result is stabilized and we continue to have -- we continue to make progress executing our planned repricing and repositioning of this block of business. While more time is needed for these results to be fully realized, I am pleased with what we are seeing thus far.", "And within our Closed Block segment, our long-term care interest adjusted loss ratio improved in the first quarter compared to both the year-ago period, as well as the previous quarter. This line continues to present longer-term challenges, but we are pleased with the improved risk performance we have seen in this line in the most recent set of quarters.", "So in summary, the first quarter represents a good start to the year. While we continue to have a cautious view of the business environment for 2013, which may slow the growth of the business, we continue to believe that the disciplined approach we have followed in the past will allow us to continue to generate solid margins and returns in our businesses. That, along with our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend increases, we think will assure that we continue to create value for our shareholders.", "So with that brief review of the first quarter, I'll now turn things over to Tom for a brief review of the operating results. Tom?", "Thomas White", "Great, thanks. As you can see from our press release yesterday afternoon, we reported net income of $212.6 million for the first quarter of 2013 or $0.79 per diluted common share compared to net income in the year-ago quarter of $213.9 million or $0.73 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the first quarter of 2013 are after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses of $9.7 million and after-tax net realized gains of $6.7 million. Included in the first quarter of 2012 were after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses of $7.6 million and after-tax net realized investment gains of $8.3 million. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $215.6 million for the quarter or $0.80 per diluted common share compared to $213.2 million or $0.73 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.", "Moving to an overview of our business segments. Operating income for Unum US segment increased 1.1% to $208.1 million in the first quarter with premium income increasing by 2.5%; a lower benefit ratio, 70.9% in the quarter, compared to 72.5% in the year-ago quarter; and a lower expense ratio, were off somewhat by higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs in the supplemental and voluntary business line due to higher level of policy terminations.", "Within the Unum US segment, operating income in the group disability line was $77.9 million compared to $74.7 million last year. Premium income increased 2% over last year due to sales growth and the impact of rate increases. The benefit ratio for this line was 84.3%, down from a year ago of 84.9%. This line includes a before tax gain of $4 million from the purchase and retirement of the debt associated with the Tailwind securitization.", "In the group life and AD&D line, operating income increased 10.5% to $57.9 million in the first quarter, benefiting from an increase of 3.5% in premium income, as well as favorable risk experience, which lowered the benefit ratio to 70.6% in the quarter compared to 72% a year ago.", "In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, operating income declined by 8.2% to $72.3 million compared to $78.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The primary driver of the lower earnings was a higher level of DAC amortization, which resulted from unfavorable policy terminations, primarily in our voluntary benefits product line.", "Underlying risk experienced in both the individual disability recently issued and voluntary benefit lines was favorable relative to the year-ago quarter.", "Moving to Unum UK Operating income in this segment declined to GBP 20.2 million from GBP 24.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio improved to 69.5% in the first quarter compared to 72.4% in the year-ago quarter, while premium income and local currency declined by 14.5%, primarily reflecting the group life reinsurance program. We saw favorable risk experience in the group life and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which were partially offset by less favorable results in the group long-term disability line.", "Wrapping up our core operations, Colonial Life reported an increase in operating income of 8.2% to $75.4 million. Premium income increased by 3.6% and the benefit ratio remained generally stable at 52.5% compared to 52.1% year-ago quarter. Net investment income increased by 11.5% in the quarter and included approximately $5 million of miscellaneous net investment income above the level we normally experience in this segment.", "In the Closed Block segment, operating income totaled $27.3 million compared to income of $15.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The interest-adjusted loss ratio for both the individual disability and long-term care blocks improved from the year-ago quarter.", "For the corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $33.7 million for the first quarter compared to a loss of $20.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Net investment income is lower due to lower yielding assets and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships.", "Interest and debt expense was higher at $34.8 million compared to $32.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses were higher in the first quarter compared to a year ago due to less favorable expense accruals.", "So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick McKenney for a further analysis of the quarter. Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Thank you, Tom. This morning, I'll spend a moment on profit trends we saw in our business segments this quarter, including detail on our growth trends. Then we'll comment on the investor results and our capital position.", "First on operating results in the first quarter, Unum US operating earnings increased just over 1% with favorable risk experience across each of our major product lines. Focusing on risk results first and beginning with our group disability business, the benefit ratio continues to perform well at 84.3% for the first quarter of 2013, which compares favorably to the 84.9% in the year-ago quarter and 84.5% in the fourth quarter of 2012. The underlying experience this quarter was favorable, with stable overall claim incidents, continued strong claim recoveries and the ongoing benefit that we realized from the pricing discipline we show on new sales and renewals.", "Also recall that we reduced the new claim discount rate for Group Long-term Disability in the third quarter of 2012. This line of business continues to perform very well as we seek to balance growth but maintaining strong profit margins. The group life and AD&D line had a very strong first quarter as well. The benefit ratio improved in the quarter to 78.6% compared to 72% in the year-ago quarter, which led to earnings growth of over 10%. The improved risk results were driven by a favorable average claim size while claim incidence was slightly higher.", "And finally in Unum US, the Supplemental and Voluntary line produced $72 million, which is lower than the run rate we have seen. We saw a higher level of policy terminations in the voluntary benefits line than we have seen historically. This causes more DAC amortization, which was partially offset by reserve releases as these cases leave.", "As for the underlying risk trends for the Supplemental and Voluntary line, both lines of business exhibited favorable risk experience relative to the prior year quarter. The fundamental trends for both of these lines continues to be quite positive, providing the company with a strong long-term growth opportunity. This comes as we leverage our traditional employee benefit relationships to increasingly provide employee-paid financial protection products. Our markets are increasingly moving in this direction and we remain well positioned to serve those market needs.", "Moving to Unum UK, earnings on a pounds sterling basis were GBP 20.2 million. This result is consistent with our expectations and we are pleased with the underlying business trends in the first quarter. The benefit ratio for the first quarter is 69.5%, showing improvement from the fourth quarter of 76.2%. The group life reinsurance program we initiated on January 1 causes a decline in premium income but will add more stability to this line of business over the course of the year. We did see some noise in the quarter with a small amount of prior year life claims that were not covered under the reinsurance program. But I would say otherwise, the 2013 group life claims experience was stable this quarter.", "Beyond the claims experience, we continue to make good progress on repricing and repositioning our group life block and tactically increasing renewal rates for our group disability business. Average rate increases for group life will continue to run in the low-double digit range and persistency remains within our expectations. First quarter group life persistency was 83.5% compared to 82.5% for all of 2012. It will take several more quarters to fully implement our repricing actions, but as I said, we're pleased with the progress we are making so far.", "Colonial Life, again, produced solid results for us with earnings of $75.4 million for the first quarter, an increase of just over 8%. The benefit ratio of 52.5% was consistent with the trend we've experienced over the past several quarters and is within our range of expectations. We saw a less favorable claim experience in both the cancer and critical illness and accident, sickness and disability product lines, which was mostly offset by an improved risk experience in our life line of business. This quarter, we did see a higher level of miscellaneous net investment income in this line that helped earnings by about $5 million.", "And finally, overall results in our Closed Block improved to $27.3 million this quarter compared to $15.4 million in the year-ago first quarter. Operating earnings in the individual disability line were generally consistent with the year-ago quarter. The interest-adjusted loss ratio improved to 81.5% this quarter compared to 83% a year ago, reflecting lower submitted claims.", "Looking at long-term care results, we saw improved results with the interest-adjusted loss ratio at 89.5% for the quarter compared to 91.2% in the year-ago quarter and 89.9% for the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting more favorable recovery and mortality experience.", "Now I'd like to move to a discussion of our sales and growth trends, first looking at Unum US. Overall sales increased by 1.3% in the first quarter with sales in the supplementary and voluntary lines increasing 3.6%. Our group sales declined by 1.6%, with sales in the under 2,000 life market declining by 12% this quarter as the market environment remains competitive and we think our corporate customers are distracted as they focus on the implementation of health care reform.", "Growth in the group large case market increased by 21%, primarily driven by sales in new lines of business to our existing customer base. Our mix of group sales is within our longer-term objectives as 62% of sales were in the core market and 38% were in the large case market. Premium persistency for our group lines was slightly lower than last year's first quarter but remains within our expectations at 88.9% for both group LTD in group life. We continue to see little to no benefit to premium income from the marketplace. And in total, premium growth was 2% in the group disability line and 3.5% in group life and AD&D. While we would certainly like to see an acceleration in these levels, we remain diligent to protect our profit margins.", "In the U.K., sales results again this quarter reflect the actions we're taking to improve the profitability in this business. Sales were down 46% in total with a sharp drop of 75% in group life sales. Clearly, this reflects our aggressive rate actions and decisions to pull back in certain market segments.", "Sales in group disability were flat this quarter at GBP 7 million. Total premium income for the overall business declined 14.5% in the first quarter, largely reflecting the 50-50 quota share reinsurance referenced earlier that we put in place beginning this quarter in the group life line of business.", "Finally, at Colonial Life, sales began in 2013 with a 4.9% decline. Sales declined by 3.8% in our core commercial market, but did increase by 5.6% in the larger commercial sector of the market. Persistency for our 3 primary product lines all showed a slight improvement over the first quarter of 2012. Premium growth remains positive at 3.6% for the quarter.", "Transitioning to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio, there's little change to our recent trends of strong credit quality in the midst of an ongoing challenging environment for new money yields due to the low level of interest rates, as well as tight corporate bond spreads. On credit quality, the net realized gain position of our fixed maturity securities portfolio stands at $6.8 billion. Our credit quality remains in very good shape with a minimal level of credits on our watch list.", "New money yields, however, continued to present a challenge, and for the first quarter, we had a 6 basis point reduction since December in our overall portfolio yield to 6.41%. We continue to manage through this environment by being selective in our asset purchases and look for the best relative value with the cash flow we have to invest. We have been running a higher-than-normal cash and marketable securities balance, which created a drag on our net investment income for the first quarter as we look for the best possible investment opportunities.", "Additionally, we continue to make pricing adjustments on our new sales and renewals to reflect the lower interest rates. As we mentioned at Investor Day back in December, we estimate that the low interest rate environment will impact our operating earnings growth by 6% to 8% in 2013 at which we expect to recoup 1/3 as price increases work their way through our books.", "A good example of this is our U.S. LTD business. We did experience a widening in the interest reserve margin of 5 basis points from 87 basis points at year end to 92 basis points at the end of the first quarter. Given the low level of cash to investments portfolio this quarter, the portfolio yield remained stable while the aggregate discount rate declined as a result of the reductions we made to the new claim discount rate in the third quarters of 2011 and 2012.", "Moving onto an update on capital. We continue to be in a very strong position. The most important driver of capital management is statutory net income, which totaled $175 million for our traditional U.S. life insurance company in the first quarter, an excellent start to the year. Given this strong performance, the weighted average risk-based capital for our U.S. traditional life insurance company was consistent with the year-end level of 396%, at the top end of our 2013 range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash and marketable securities totaled $652 million at quarter end. And share repurchase activity in the first quarter totaled $95 million and we continue to expect approximately $500 million of repurchases for 2013.", "Finally, we have no change to our 2013 outlook and continue to anticipate growth in operating earnings per share to be within the range of 0% to 6%.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. As we move to your questions, I'll close by reiterating my opening comment. We're pleased with our financial and operating results for the first quarter. As a result of our strong risk results, we again generated solid profitability and returns and positive cash flow at the company. While generating profitable top line growth remains challenging in today's environment, we are maintaining our disciplined growth strategy which has served us well in the past.", "Importantly, too, our balance sheet and capital position remain strong, which enables us to continue to supplement our operating performance with consistently returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend increases.", "This completes our prepared remarks. And operator, let's move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jeff Schuman with KBW.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to drill in a little bit on some of the market dynamics, I guess, in the U.K. and the U.S.. In the U.K., I think you said the group life sales is down 75%, but persistency sort of hung in. So I guess, that might suggest maybe that the rate increases are maybe sticking up some of the renewals but things are pretty challenging, I guess, on the sales front. So I guess, the sales down 75%, very good to see you're disciplined but is there any -- do we see any hope that the market is going to start following you at some point?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, you want to touch on that?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. I think the persistency does reflect that rate increases, so far at least, are sticking to a reasonable degree. I think that the decline in sales is primarily driven by 2 things. One, we discontinued sales of certain products within our group life portfolio that we deem to be just too unprofitable for us to continue to pursue. And we significantly ramped down our large case group life sales, where we saw significant profit deterioration during 2012. That's primarily what's driving down the sales comparison.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So you weren't necessarily losing head-to-head, you just weren't competing for as much business essentially.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Right. I think we're very competitive still even though we're moving rates up in the core market but I think we've, much like we did in the United States, backed away from the more volatile and more difficult profit picture of the large case market.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "But then once again, kind of get back to the key points, so you do see there's some hardening of the life rate across the market?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, to some degree. I mean, we're certainly moving them up and other competitors are moving them up to some degree as well, although not to the rate or the extent that we are.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then in the U.S., I was interested, I think the group sales being limited, I think you attributed to the uncertainty around reform and I guess the idea maybe is that business maybe isn't churning as much. But then, I guess, if that's true, I would have thought maybe that would have been a kind of a help to persistency. I think persistency was a little bit off there. So is there actually less market churn or what's going on there?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Persistency is off but not by very much. And when you take into account that is driven by the fact that we're moving rates up in the sort of mid- to upper-single digit range, I think we sort of expected that. Last year's persistency also was sort of incredibly high. I mean, maybe historically high over the last 7 or 8 years. So I think it's operating pretty much in the 88% to 89% kind of range or 87.5% to 89% range that we expected to operate at. And I think we're feeling quite good about our ability to place rate increases. But then in the marketplace, in terms of health care reform, most of the pressure, I think, is in the smaller end of the market and that shows up in our sales results. Our small case sales were down 19% but our mid-market sales were up 6% and our large case sales were up 18%, primarily driven by the vast majority of new sales to existing large case customers. And so I think -- and I think that the dynamics that we're talking about are reflected in other competitors' results as well. Small case market, I think, is a little bit sort of under the gun in terms of what are we going to do by January 2014 around health care reform, how are we going to work with exchanges. And I think that's driving activity levels down. And that's probably increasing some inertia in terms of movement of sales.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "This is pretty much a 2013 phenomenon that kind of has to get sorted out by the end of the year, is kind of what you think about it?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, I would think about it that way, yes.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Suneet Kamath with UBS.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So I wanted to start with the benefit ratios across your segments. I mean, if I just look year-over-year, it looks like pretty much everything is moving in the right direction. And we've had a couple of other companies report last night and I would say that things have been much more mixed on the underwriting side at some of those names. So I guess I'm trying to understand if what you're seeing is sustainable or did you just have a really good quarter and maybe things just start to revert a little bit as we move through the year.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, why don't you start with that one.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. I think it's a mixed -- in answer to your question, Suneet. I think on group disability income, that was a particularly good quarter, sort of everything went well, submitted incidence are slightly down, paid incidence remained flat, actuals expected incidence was better than pricing assumptions, STD incidence was moving its way down. Hopefully that continues. But I think the loss ratio, we've always said, would be sort of in the 84% to 85% kind of range. And there might be little movements here and there inside of that range, but we're pretty happy with the quarter, that's for sure. In group life, we had favorable mortality and favorable severity and that helped us out and moved that loss ratio down a bit. But again, that loss ratio tends to be in that 70% to 72% range. And it's sort of at the lower end of the range but above we expect it to be. And then in voluntary, the loss ratio was lower than we would normally expect. We'd expect it to be closer to the 50% to 52% range, but that was primarily driven by the, I think, the life reserve releases as result of the large case terminations of voluntary.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then are you expecting, on the voluntary, I mean, as you peer in the second quarter, this issue around large terminations, I mean, is that going to persist, do you think?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "I think we'll get some of that throughout the year. We're trying to be more disciplined in our underwriting, particularly around large accounts that have high employee turnover rates and low re-enrollment rates, and where profitability starts to decline and we can't get it back sort of on the volume side, we can't get it back on the repricing side either, so we're just not interested in continuing to pursue those accounts. The majority of that, I think, would be more focused in the first quarter in terms of renewal activity than throughout the rest of the year. But you'll see some continued effect of that throughout the year, I think, in voluntary as we work our way through that. And I also think, on the voluntary sales side, the voluntary market is going to experience some of that same health care reform pressure as companies -- I mean, employers and voluntary carriers try to figure out what exactly is the nature of the voluntary wrap-around sales is going to work with a yet undefined health insurance exchange program. So I think in both cases, you're going to see that kind of pressure.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Maybe, Kevin, I could add to -- I think if you look at both our Unum US performance, as well as the Colonial performance from a persistency point of view, I think, historically, we've always had a much higher persistency than the marketplace. And I don't think we see any changes in that as we look forward.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Right. I would suspect that the persistency will eventually revert back to the median, close to the 79%, 80% range as the year goes forward.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. And then a question for Rick on the long-term care Closed Block. So good to see that interest-adjusted loss ratio kind of came -- stayed below 90%. I think it's in line with what you guys built into your reserve build at the end of 2011. I guess my question is are we yet seeing the benefit in terms of the price increases in the denominator of that calculation? I know in the past, Kevin's talked about being x percent of the ways through the price increases but I think there's also been this commentary around it's going to take a while for that premium to actually emerge through the income statement. So I just want to get a sense of where we are on that.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Good. I think you characterized it well. I think we are tracking that process to our expectations and working with our regulators to go through that process. So to date, that's working reasonably well. But you're right, it does take some time for that to come through the premium line, through implementation and the different things that have to happen there. So we haven't really felt that impact yet. And in fact, some of the benefit we see is from previous price increases going back several years. So this is a longer-term trajectory that we have to work through, but I think that, in terms of actions that we can take, we're doing reasonably well and tracking to our expectations.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "In Colonial Life, what is the outlook for recruiting and the overall size of the sales force in 2013?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Randy, you want to touch on that? And maybe even, as you do, to maybe talk about just some of the strategy adjustments we're making I think in terms of how to position the sales force.", "Randall C. Horn", "You bet, I'll do that. We have ratcheted down our recruiting, Mark, here in the first quarter, that was intentional. We were dropping it from roughly around 1,500 agents recruited in the first quarter a year ago down to -- it was in the 900 to 1,000 range. We think that's a much better balance of quantity and quality. We're very focused on training these new reps effectively and getting the best possible return out of that effort. So I really see the size of our sales force stabilizing in that probably 11,000 to 12,000 range by year-end. Don't see any dramatic decreases but won't see it significantly increasing either. But I think, well, really our strategy is around getting better return, higher levels of productivity per rep. And I think that's going to serve us well over time.", "Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. How about on the U.S. Group business, you said there's some delay-related health care reform. How about competition? You've obviously taken some pricing actions? Do you think you're ahead of the market now in that and it may take some time for the market to catch up with you?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. Mark, I mean, I think we've been consistent over the last several years in moving prices up. I think a number of competitors, in the recent 12 to 18 months, have started to move prices up as well in response to some of their deteriorating loss ratios. But I think we were certainly ahead of the game. And I think when you look at industry pricing statistics, we still tend to be sort of priced somewhat higher than the majority of our competitors in the core market. I think every carrier is faced with the same low interest rate environment and ought to be moving their rates up to some degree. Everyone's, I think, faced some deterioration in loss ratio, except for us pretty much, and so ought to be taking that kind of action. And everyone's got the same sort of effect of an aging population with the expectation at least of claims sort of following the aging of the population and if you can continue to price for that, then you can stabilize your loss ratios and continue to generate your proved return. So competitively, I think, the market is, I think, a little bit harder than it was maybe 2 years ago, well, but I still think we're ahead of the market on that.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And, Mark, if I could add to that, too. I think, as you know, you have to think about every carrier has a different starting point as they think about repricing. And I think, Kevin, in Unum US, we have about a 13% ROE for the group disability line of business. So therefore, when we talk about price adjustments, they're really to reflect primarily the increase, or the lower discount rates that we have and the lower interest rate environment. I'm not sure if every carrier is finding -- find themselves in that same situation as they talk about repricing strategy.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Right. I think if you looked at the industry margins, they're considerably lower than the margins that we're throwing off.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So first, a question on buybacks. I think you did $95 million this quarter. That's lower than what you've done in the last few quarters. So is there any reason for that? And how do you expect buybacks to ramp-up as the year goes on? And then on the sales, you discussed this a little bit in the past few questions, but how much of the sales weakness is because of just a disruption on health care reform or is part of it that, there are still competitors out there that are somewhat aggressive on pricing?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rich, you want to take the first one?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. When you look at our buybacks of $95 million in the first quarter, one, we're very happy with that. We think relative to our market cap, we still continue to return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. When you look at our trend line, what we've done in various quarters, we've been in and out of the market and so I wouldn't read anything into a $95 million a quarter other than that how we get into the market. But the bottom line is we still look at $500 million for the year. We think that's consistent with our capital generation model. And that, in conjunction with dividends, we think is a very effective way to return capital to our shareholders.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, want to pick up on the sales question?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Jimmy, it's hard to quantify how much of it is from health care reform. I expect...", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just not -- just in general terms, is that more or is it that you're like in some parts of the market, you're losing share or losing cases to other companies?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes, activity's down about 10% year-over-year. So you'd expect that, the stable closing ratios to sort of translate in that similar kind of pressure on your sales. There certainly are some aggressive competitors out there. I don't think we're winning or losing much more than we have been in the past. But always in this marketplace, regardless of how many carriers are acting some of the prices up, there are always several carriers that are acting to take advantage of that and trying to drive their sales up. And you just got to look at sales numbers to see that.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then in the U.K. business, what was the benefit? And then what would the results have looked like had you not had the reinsurance contract in place? And what are your intentions as to potentially renew this for next year?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Okay. Certainly, when you look at the reinsurance contract, in the first quarter, I'd say it's kind of a wash so the underlying results in the quarter were actually pretty good in our group life line, so all else being equal, I think we may have a lost a little bit by having that reinsurance but I think we still are very happy that we're in that structure going throughout the year. As we mentioned, we did have a little bit of carryover from previous year claims that came through that weren't covered, so it elevated the loss ratio a little bit. But that's the structure that we like relative to our business and the size of our business and the volatility that we want to see. So I wouldn't speculate in terms of how we take that out over time, but certainly still happy it's in place here in the first quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I just wanted to touch on the UK and see how we should be thinking about earnings once we sort of get through the pricing changes. So -- and the reason I asked is the reinsurance transactions appear to be doing what you've really targeted, which is reduce some of that earnings volatility we've been seeing the past couple of years. But presumably, it's going to give up some of the upside so when profitability improves. So versus sort of the low $30-million-or-so you're trending versus maybe what we saw a couple of years ago, which was consistently in the $50-million-or-so of quarterly range there. I mean, I guess, where should we kind of end up here once you get through all your pricing actions?", "Richard P. McKenney", "It's difficult to talk about in terms of where we end up much longer term when we talk about this year or maybe as we get out into next year. This year, we expect the business to be flat relative to year-ago period. So as we take through price, as we take through driving stability, and as Kevin mentioned, these lines that we are not continuing to write in that business, we'll see 2014 -- or '13 to be relatively flat. As we get past that period of time, and I'm not sure exactly where that inflection point will be, we'll start to see those price increases come through in the overall profitability of the business. So as we get out to 2014, we expect to see that trend line starting to increase but I don't want to leave the expectation that we'll get back to those levels that we were at several years ago. It will be one that's slowly increasing beyond 2013 as prices take hold and growth takes hold in that marketplace.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then your guidance, I guess the operating earnings piece you kind of pointed to down 2% to 5%. And then that would be offset by 6% to 8% of accretion from buybacks. So just trying to think how we should be thinking about the guidance given, I guess, the more measured pace of buybacks in 1Q. But then less, I guess, accretion and reduction of share counts based on the 30% increase in the share price here year-to-date. So should we be thinking about  towards the lower end of that range, just given less accretion from buybacks, or am I missing something in terms of the moving parts?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I think those are all the right moving parts when you look at it, Chris. But I think when we take all those different pieces together, I think we still expect to be squarely in that range. So as we buy back over the course of the year, and as I mentioned, a little lighter this quarter but we expect to catch up on a reasonably quick pace, we still expect the benefits coming through on that front. And we will buy back a little bit less shares. The share price sits at these levels but nothing that will materially alter what we see over the course of 2013.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And if I can just sneak one more quick one and just in terms of the sales mix for Kevin. Obviously, you'd wanted to see -- you'd want the mix to be better on the core piece but, obviously, you've pointed to a number of the competitive dynamics there. But I just want to try and get arms around how we get comfortable that the larger end of the market that you have -- what -- how do you basically assess the business that you're putting on to make sure we don't see loss pressures down the road from maybe greater share within a more volatile segment of your group business?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. As we've always talked about our large case business, we're pretty disciplined about how we go at it. We're opportunistic when we see the chance to get the price we want. And we tend to have off quarters when we can't get the prices we want. This quarter particularly was driven largely by new coverages added to existing accounts. So we're already familiar with the profitability of those accounts and we're pricing the new lines of coverage consistent with what we already got on the books. And so to the extent that they were already profitable customers, we're adding lines of business. If they weren't already profitable customers, we probably wouldn't be adding those lines of business unless we're adding them at a higher pricing than we'd have in the existing lines. So actually I'd view the quarter as quite an opportunistic and successful quarter in that regard.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Erik Bass with Citigroup.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just one on kind of the health care reform. I'm assuming that, that is also a pressure for Colonial. But could you talk about maybe what you see as the potential impact on sales and demand for voluntary products once health care reform is implemented? And do you see this as a potential catalyst or, vice versa, a challenge for sales?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Actually, Randy, why don't you get started on that because again, I think, you've, as Eric mentioned, you have a window into that with your business as well. And then I'll maybe ask Kevin to pick up from that.", "Randall C. Horn", "Yes, absolutely. Yes, certainly, some choppiness, as Tom and Rick and others, Kevin, have talked about in the current timeframe. But we're doing a lot of work in terms of training our field force who are providing guidance for employers regarding the overview of the health care reform requirements, we're providing recommendations on how employers need to prepare and respond, doing a lot of benefit counselor, certification type training in terms of public exchange requirements in their respective states. So you pull all that together, once we get through this implementation period, help employers get over the hurdle of just understanding the legislation or what the requirements are, we really see a very robust opportunity in terms of product solutions, benefit communication needs, that type of things. So yes, some challenges in the short-term but a lot of opportunity, a lot of need for what we provide and just a lot of opportunity for the BB market in the post health care reform world.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, you want to add to that, too, especially, again I think we have some company-wide initiatives that we should -- we actually developed a strategy which I think is a little different than some other companies around making sure we can connect with some of those new emerging distribution channels within health care reform.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "All right. Randy covered it really well. I would say that I agree with Randy, I think the opportunity -- the situation right now is sort of choppy because of a little bit of confusion and the need for education and the need to understand how exchanges are going to work and there is not going to be just one size, there's going to be many sizes and differences in exchanges depending on federal versus state versus private. In that context, I think there's a real opportunity to design wraparound products that fit with those exchanges. We're going to be introducing a new group of hospital indemnity product during the course of 2013, for example. I think there's a real opportunity, as Randy said, for new enrollment support and benefit communication support. And Unum US, in working with Colonial, we're now in the process of connecting on a plug-and-play basis to over 40 different platforms out there for benefit administration and health exchange administration and enrollment management. So I'm really optimistic about the future for voluntary given health care reform.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got you. And is it right to think about you see the opportunity primarily in sort of supplemental products and kind of gap fillers that supplement what major medical would do?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. I would say the greater opportunity will be there. I think I don't see much disruption effect longer-term on the traditional group insurance marketplace. I think that will continue to sort of operate the way it has. Although you'll see I think a steady shift of employer-paid to employee-paid products over time, much as what we've already experienced. But the big growth opportunity I think is in voluntary.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And just one quick follow-up on voluntary as well. Are you seeing any changes in the number of people that are electing voluntary benefits that, I mean, you could possibly attribute to the economy? Or, I guess, just generally, has there been any change you've seen in election rates over the past few years?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "I'll answer for -- maybe Randy can supplement but participation rates have been very steady for us during the course of 2011, 2012. And actually in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had quite high participation rates in our voluntary enrollment, so we haven't seen any deterioration in that at all.", "Randall C. Horn", "Yes. And, Eric, on our side of it, the same story. We've seen very steady participation rates. In the first quarter, saw a little bit of pressure in terms of the sales premium per application. I think there was some pressure there just with the general economy. The payroll tax increase had a little bit of an impact on things. But in terms of overall participation, very, very stable. It's even up a little bit.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Two maybe different -- I think we've sort of beat sales and that sort of stuff to death at this point. I'm interested in the pace of the Closed Block disability premiums declining? That pace of decline has really slowed down versus what we've seen in prior years. And probably, at least I think it's slowed down versus what you guys were expecting to see. Any explanation there? Is that something that's just an anomaly here?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, you want to touch on that?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, certainly. I'll give it a try here, John. In terms of closed disability block slowdown, what you're going to see at that time, and we're talking about a pretty long timeframe, so nothing you'd see in any particular quarter, is as people go through that process and stay on claim for a longer term, you will see a little bit of slowing but I'd have to go back and look. I wouldn't expect you to see anything dramatic here over the last several years. I believe you will see it slow down as you look out over the course of 5 years to a decade. So we'll have to go back and look at that, John, and get back to you on at the same point. There shouldn't be anything particular that will cause any quick deterioration in the runoff. We'd expect them to be pretty steady.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "So Rick, if I can add to that. I think as everyone knows, the Closed Block includes the IDI business, as well as the long term care, and each different characteristics from a premium point of view. The IDI business was continuing to, and has continued to decline. At the same time, the long term care business is actually continuing to grow. So you've got 2 sort of offsetting activities actually within that block.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And maybe that's just what I'm missing is focusing on one versus the other. The other question I have for you is just, a lot of moving parts, right? I mean -- and rates and new money rates are lower now than they were, let's say, most of last year. You're getting some pricing approvals on the long term care Closed Block business. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense for, with all the variable inputs here, how we ought to think about the risk of some sort of reserve strengthening later this year? I know your 10-K indicated that there was potential for as much as about a 7% reserve strengthening based on a lot of different factors. As we get through 3 or 4 roughly months of this year, how is the combination of all those factors trending?", "Randall C. Horn", "Surely. John, if I were to take that and talk about where the reserves are relative, they really hasn't changed from what we've been talking about over the course of the last year. The pressure that we're seeing on interest rates is one that will take place over a period of time. We talked just over a year ago about a 3 to 5 year time horizon. And I think we've consistently said we're probably on the shorter end of that given where rates have gone, back to that initial look. But that still take us out a couple of years from now. With regards to other things that we're seeing and the morbidity, we've talked about our range of loss ratios in the 85% to 90% range. And as you've seen this quarter and last quarter, we're in that range. So its a dynamic business but I wouldn't give you anymore there that would say that there's something imminent in the course of 2013 different than anything we've been talking to you about over the course of the last year.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.", "A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Sorry to do this. Back to health care reform and the impact on small case. We haven't really seen any impact, at least noticeably, on persistency. Do you have a view on whether there should be any persistency impacts?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "I think so far, it's probably positive generally speaking in the sense that activity levels are down and therefore, take over account possibilities are down. And I think that's probably even a help maybe to persistency in general as brokers and employers focused their attention on health care. They're not necessarily focusing on moving their ancillary lines of coverage. So it's probably been a marginal benefit. Down the road, it's hard to tell, I think you might see, as I said earlier, some shift down the road as health care reform gets put in place from employer-paid products to employee-paid products and that may move lines of coverage from what we call our group lines to our voluntary lines even though we're retaining the customers so you may see some voluntary growth offset a little bit by some group persistency pressure in the industry in general. But right now, I'd say it's probably a net positive.", "A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, interesting. And then I guess just on the sales side, does it get worse before it gets better?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "No, I don't think so. I mean, I think it probably sort of stays as it is at the moment. It depends a little bit of course on competitive pricing dynamics too. And it depends on how much emerges. There's going to be a lot of activities during the second quarter from HHS and all those around health insurance exchange regulations getting sorted out. And as that happens, the pressure on brokers to communicate will increase. Hopefully, by the time we get into the third and fourth quarter, brokers will be starting to pay attention to understanding what's going to happen with their client base and what kind of health insurance coverage they're going to put in place and what exchange. And then they'll start to take a look at what they want to do with the group coverages. So I'd expect that this phenomenon might last for the second and into the third quarter, but hopefully, hopefully reverse itself in the fourth quarter.", "A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the voluntary side, if you've already addressed this, but what is the follow-on effect beyond the first quarter of the surrenders? And is there a way of framing out kind of an earnings impact normalizing for all the kind of the one-timers, just kind of an ongoing impact?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, you want to touch on that?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. The ongoing impact that you'd see, Mark, of that is most -- basically like any other premium loss. I think it was just a little bit accelerated in the quarter and that's why you'd see that onetime noise coming through as you wrote off the deck and as you wrote off that. So we'll use the margin on those cases that are left, and we'll replenish it with the new 2 cases that we bring on. So I don't think there's anything special going on there between -- except for just general block migration that you'll see.", "A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just, I guess, continuation beyond this quarter on that activity?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "I probably wouldn't look at that activity relative to I'd look at the overall premium size and the good margins that we see coming through on that. So, yes, there will be a little bit less margin that we would have anticipated but we want to replenish that with new sales and good margins as well.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So on the voluntary area, what is causing this attrition of business? Can we start there? Was it, again, was it a pricing and competitiveness issue? Or what exactly happened that led to this large loss of premium?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, why don't you start on the strategy side a bit because I think that's really where we're...", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "I mean, just basically for the most part comes down to being disciplined about where we want to play in the voluntary market. And we had several large accounts that we were -- that had high employee turnover rates and if we weren't going to get the necessary re-enrollment premium to bring the cases back to profitability. So it's not very different than the process that we've gone through on the group business. We're just -- we're focused on managing our in-force business effectively and making sure that we're focusing our in-force management and our sales management toward where we think we can get the best participation level, the longest sustainable relationship with the client and the most lines of coverage to deepen that relationship with the client. So strategically, that's where we're focused on.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And, again, Kevin, I think when you start with the fact that this reporting segment had a 12%, 13% ROE. We're not -- when you talk about going through some of those initiatives, they're not really designed to deal with the real fundamental issue. This is more strategic about positioning in the marketplace and with certain customers.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "And basically making sure that we can maintain and even grow those margins by having the right mix of business.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Absolutely.", "Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "My second question relates to long term care. And I think you've touched on this in detail so I'm just looking for modestly more perspective. My question is this. When you originally, I think it was end of 2011, decided to exit to the individual long term care business and took your large reserve increase, you cited the fact, I believe, that your data were not statistically credible because of the small number of individuals on the claims. And you referenced a Society of Actuaries study that came out the prior summer that it provided a basis for the reserve charge that you took. Where do things stand now? And by that, I mean, what percentage of your policyholders are on claim? And in particular, would it still be the case that the data is not statistically credible, Unum's data alone is not statistically credible?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes, Eric, I think the short answer to that is that it's still the same. The statistical credibility of our data is quite small. We're a small piece of the market and I think even the market is still working into statistical reliability so that has not changed at all. And that won't change for many, many years into the future, so we will look to the overall industry, Society of Actuaries, to give us some guidance in terms of how the world is shaping up on that front but don't expect that, that will take days for us in the near term or even in the medium to long term.", "Thomas White", "I think out of respect to the fact, we know there's another call coming up beyond this, we'll just -- we'll limit it to one more question please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Maybe to follow up on Chris's question earlier about the growth in the large case business. If I understand correctly, the growth is also, and even in the core business, it's in the larger case businesses. So should we expect some additional volatility going forward through that in underwriting results?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yaron, no, I don't think so. I mean, the large case business, the national client group business as they said a vast, vast majority of that was sales of new lines of coverage and expansions of benefit coverages to existing clients. So I wouldn't expect any volatility, in fact, from that. The growth that we're seeing in the mid-market, which I'll characterize as sort of the 100 to 2,000 life or so kind of marketplace, that's strategic for us. We want to focus our sales authorization where we can get the best sort of productivity return for the sales ever given the margins that we have in our business. And so we tend to try to focus our efforts more in that sort of over 100 life marketplace. And I wouldn't expect that to have any negative effect on the risk side of the equation.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe one more. Listening to the call today and your answers especially around health care reform, sounds like if everything else holds kind of the status quo holds employment levels, interest rate levels and so on but health care reform goes through and there's this release of pent-up demand, sounds like there should be potential for both revenue growth and earnings growth next year from that alone. Is that a fair way of thinking of it?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin, why don't you think about it from the sales point of view, and just the market acceptance point of view?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "As I said earlier, I do think that when health care reform gets sorted out, the relationships that we are building with exchanges and benefit administrators, the products that we're designing to wrap around health care reform ought to generate upward trend, I think, in the growth curve for our voluntary lines of business. And I think that's -- I mean, the marketplace is confused right now. And in a state of confusion, it's sort of disrupted and there's lots of scrambling around and there's a lot of inertia. I think once health care reform gets put in place, I think there'll be brokers that will move more aggressively into voluntary. I think companies like ours that are well positioned on the enrollment communications and product portfolio side will be well positioned for growth.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And I think many have heard me talk about this before but I think there remains a significant need for the things that we sell actually. And that very basic need for that protection hasn't changed with health care reform. I think what we're seeing at both with Unum US and with Colonial is it's obviously distracting brokers, agents and those that are involved in making the buying decisions. But that very basic need still exists. And I think it's becoming more clear to the market to public policymakers and others to that effect. And so that's why I think if you could sense some optimism beyond some of the disruption we're going through, it's because the basic need is still very much there.", "Well, thank you, all. We know it's certainly -- as I said before, there's been a number of companies that have recently reported which creates challenges for all of you. So we thank all of you for taking the time to join us this morning. And this will complete our first quarter 2013 earnings call.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

As well as the CEOs of our core business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum US, Peter O'donnell for Unum UK and Randy Horn for Colonial Life. And I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. The second quarter was a strong quarter for the company, with growth in operating earnings per share of 3.8% to $0.82 per share; and book value per share, excluding AOCI, increasing 11.4% to $30.97. And let me highlight a few things before turning things over to Rick and Tom.", "First, I'm very pleased with the strength of our operating performance for the quarter, with our favorable risk results generating stable to improved benefit ratios across most of our core business lines. As we've discussed in the past, our focus has been on generating not just growth but profitable growth through disciplined pricing, both new business and renewal, through disciplined underwriting and through our commitment to maintaining very high quality service levels, so that we retain our customers and hopefully expand our relationships with them over time. We are clearly benefiting from this strategy. This past quarter, for example, we generated a return on equity in our core operating segments of 14.6%, well above industry averages. The operating return on equity for the entire company, including our Closed Block, was 11.6%, also a very respectable level.", "Secondly, I'm encouraged by the performance we are seeing in those areas that have been operating below our expectations. The margins in our Unum UK business, for example, improved again this quarter, as we continued to make progress repricing and repositioning the group life block. That, along with our solid results in our group long-term disability line of business, helped us strengthen the profitability in this segment.", "In addition, our Closed Block segment was generally in line with our expectations this quarter. This segment, particularly the long-term care product line, will continue to be an area of focus for us and I might add the whole industry, and we will continue to devote more resources to this area to ensure that we are effectively managing all the levers we have in this business.", "Third, it continues to be a challenging environment to profitably grow our business in the U.S. The combination of still weak employment growth, as well as the distraction resulting from the implementation of health care reform, has slowed quote activity and intensified price competition in certain segments. As a result, you will see that sales in Unum US in the quarter declined 19% and in Colonial Life declined about 2%. While sales declined 7% in Unum UK in local currency, that was driven more by the significant pricing actions we are taking in our group life business, more so than the broader market conditions, which certainly was the case here in the U.S. We believe these headwinds in the U.S. are likely to continue, but we are committed to maintain a disciplined approach we have taken in the market, which has allowed us to produce strong margins and returns. Returns, as I mentioned earlier, considerably above industry averages.", "Turning now to investments. We continued to deliver solid investments results, and the quality of our portfolio remains excellent. The rise in interest rates during the quarter was certainly welcome, and today's new money yields still remain below our overall portfolio yield. The move in rates has not caused us to change our strategy. We will not stretch for yield by lowering our investment quality standards, but instead, continue to raise prices in the products that are most impacted by interest rates.", "And lastly, our strong operating results have resulted in continued solid statutory earnings, which allows us to maintain a strong capital position, and importantly, financial flexibility. Our risk-based capital level, which was approximately 398% at the end of the second quarter, continues to be at the upper end of our target range for 2013 of 375% to 400%. In addition, our holding company cash position continued to be strong at just under $600 million. We continue to balance this high quality -- this healthy capital position with returning capital to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased just under $100 million of our shares, in addition to raising the dividend by 11.5% effective with our third quarter payment.", "So to summarize, before we move to a more detailed discussion of the quarter, we are pleased with the strong operating results we saw in the second quarter. We continue to be cautious in our outlook for the business environment in the second half of the year, which will likely to continue to challenge our ability to profitably grow our business, especially here in the US. However, we are continuing as a company to take the actions necessary to ensure that we maintain our solid margins and financial flexibility and position our businesses for what I continue to believe our excellent long-term growth opportunities.", "Now I'll turn things over to Tom for a review of our operating results. Tom?", "Thomas White", "Great. Thanks, Tom. As you can see from our press release yesterday afternoon, we reported net income of $218.6 million for the second quarter 2013 or $0.82 per diluted common share, compared to net income in the year-ago quarter of $216.4 million or $0.76 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the second quarter is an after-tax nonoperating retirement-related loss of $8.5 million and an after-tax net realized investment gain of $8.6 million. Included in the year-ago second quarter was an after-tax nonoperating retirement-related loss of $7.5 million and an after-tax net realized investment loss of $1.4 million. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $218.5 million for this quarter or $0.82 per diluted common share, compared to $225.3 million or $0.79 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.", "Moving to an overview of our business segments. Operating income for the Unum US segment increased by 0.6% to $214 million in the second quarter, with premium income increasing by 1.5%. The segment benefit ratio was essentially flat at 72% in the quarter and other expenses were also stable at 22% this quarter. Within the Unum US segment, operating income in the group disability line was $73 million for the second quarter compared to $70.4 million last year. Premium income increased 1.5% over last year, and the benefit ratio improved 83.9% from the year-ago 84.7%.", "In the group life and AD&D line, operating income was flat at $57.3 million, with premium income increasing by 3.4% and the benefit ratio improving slightly to 71.1% from 71.9% a year ago. In the supplemental and voluntary line, operating income declined slightly to $83.7 million compared to $85 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income declined by 0.8% to $273.8 million, primarily, reflecting the reinsurance of a small block of individual disability business, which is partially offset by a slight increase in premium income in the voluntary benefits line.", "Moving to Unum UK Operating income in this segment improved to GBP 21.8 million from GBP 19.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Margins in this business continued their improving trend over the past few quarters, as risk experienced in both the group disability and group life lines of business improved.", "Wrapping up our core operations, Colonial Life reported an increase in operating income of 5.2% in the second quarter to $71.1 million. Premium income increased by 3.7%, and the benefit ratio improved slightly to 52.1% compared to 52.5% in the year-ago quarter.", "In the Closed Block segment, operating income totaled $29.6 million for the second quarter compared to income of 24 -- excuse me, $25.7 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher net investment income from an increase in assets supporting this segment. Premium income declined by 4% relative to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the expected runoff of the individual disability block.", "And finally, for the Corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $37.1 million for the second quarter compared to a loss of $25.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Net investment income was lower due to lower yielding assets and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships. Keep in mind that this negative impact is offset by a lower income tax rate due to the tax benefits recognized as a result of these investments. Interest to debt expense was higher at $35.2 million compared to $32.2 million in the year-ago quarter due to the issuance of $250 million of debt during the third quarter of 2012.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis of the second quarter results.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Tom. Today, I'll cover the profit trends you saw in our business segments in second quarter, provide additional detail on our growth trends and also update you on our investment results and capital position.", "As we look across the company this quarter, we saw a generally favorable risk trend in all of our lines. First, on operating results in the second quarter, Unum US operating earnings increased slightly with favorable risk experience in the group disability, group life and AD&D lines, offsetting a slightly higher benefit ratio in the supplemental and voluntary lines.", "Focusing on our group disability business. The benefit ratio continues to perform quite well at 83.9% for the second quarter of 2013, which compares favorably to the 84.7% in the year-ago quarter and 84.3% in the first quarter this year. The underlying experience continues to be favorable with stable to lower overall claim incidents and continued strong claim recovery performance. This also reflects the benefit that we realized in our margins from the pricing discipline we show on new sales and renewals. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business line.", "Group life and AD&D also produced strong results for us this quarter. The benefit ratio improved slightly in the quarter to 71% compared to 72% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting more favorable experience. Earnings in this line was flat at $57.3 million for the quarter, with premium growth of 3.4% being offset by lower net investment income.", "And finally, in Unum US, the supplemental and voluntary line produced a good recovery from the first quarter when higher terminations in the voluntary benefits line resulted in a higher than normal level of DAC amortization. For the second quarter, earnings were $83.7 million, still lower than the year-ago quarter of $85 million, but much improved compared to the first quarter of $72 million.", "Persistency was better during the second quarter in the voluntary benefits line, as we anticipated, but it is possible that we will still see some continued volatility. As a result, the accelerated DAC amortization from policy terminations likewise improved in the second quarter from the higher than normal level we experienced in the first quarter.", "As for the underlying risk trends for the supplementary and voluntary line, the individual disability recently issued product lines saw a generally stable claim experience with the year-ago quarter. The voluntary benefits line saw a good risk results, but were down slightly comparing to the very good results we saw a year ago. All in all, it was a good bounce back in earnings for this line for the second quarter, as voluntary benefit [indiscernible] stabilized.", "Moving to Unum UK, earnings were GBP 21.8 million, improved from both the year-ago quarter and the first quarter. As Tom highlighted, we're pleased with the margin improvement that is developing in our UK business as the group life repricing and repositioning further develops, and the results in our group long-term disability line remain favorable.", "From a risk perspective, our group disability results in the second quarter were favorable due to both favorable claim incidents and claim recovery rates. For the group life block, results were favorable due to lower claims in the business that we have retained. We continued to take aggressive rate action in our group life pricing and expect to continue to do so over the next few quarters. As a result, persistency for our group life declined for the first 6 months of 2013 to 74% compared to 83.5% for the first quarter of the year. As we go through repricing this book, this is not expected to see this level of volatility.", "Colonial Life's results were solid again this quarter at $71.1 million, an increase of just over 5%. The benefit ratio of 52% was slightly better than both the year-ago quarter and previous quarter, but a decreased level of claims in our accident, sickness and disability line and favorable mortality in the life line of business.", "And finally, overall results in our Closed Block improved to $29.6 million this quarter compared to $25.7 million in the year-ago second quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was stable on a year-over-year basis at 82.7%, reflecting lower paid claims, offset by a less favorable claim incidents and claim recovery rates.", "Long-term care earnings were higher on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher net investment income. The interest adjusted loss ratio was 90% for the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter, and 88% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in the loss ratio on a year-over-year comparison was driven by an increase in the level of new submitted claims and higher group long-term care persistency, driving higher buildup in active life reserves.", "Now I'd like to move our discussion to sales and growth trends. We saw a challenging quarter on the sales front as market activity slowed. We attribute some of this to the discussion and distraction to our market from health care reform. As a result, we saw a lower numbers of cases coming to market, but we also saw higher persistency in our own book. Therefore, premiums held in rather well. Overall sales in Unum US in the second quarter were lower by 19% compared to the year-ago quarter, group sales were down 20% and the supplemental benefit sales declined by 16%.", "In addition to a lower number of quotes, the competition for those cases that do come to market can be extremely intensive, and our discipline may keep us out of the running in the short term. As I mentioned, a negative impact to sales is offset somewhat in that persistency has remained at very healthy levels, which is 89% for group LTD and group life for the first half of the year. We continued to see little to no benefits to premium income from marketplace growth. And in total, premium growth was 1.5% in the group disability line and 3.4% in group life and AD&D. To echo Tom's introductory comments, while we would certainly like to see an acceleration of these levels, our priority remains to protect our profit margins.", "In the UK, sales results again this quarter reflect the actions we are taking to improve the profitability in this business. We were happy to see sales in the group disability line increasing by 5%, while as expected, sales in group life declined by 22%. I would remind you that the premium income was affected in the second quarter, reflecting the 50% quota share reinsurance agreement we have. Without that, the UK would have seen premium growth of above 3%.", "And finally, Colonial Life sales declined by 2% in the second quarter. While we saw an encouraging trend with higher sales from existing accounts, we continue to see slower sales and activities with new accounts. And specifically, we're seeing very slow activity in the under-50 life market, a trend consistent with our Unum US segment, driven again, we believe, by disruption from health care reform. Persistency showed a slight improvement for the first half of the year, and premium growth remains positive at 3.7% for the second quarter.", "So let me transition to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very strong shape. The increase in treasury yields and the slight widening in corporate bonds spreads were welcomed development in the second quarter, even though this decreased our net unrealized gain from our portfolio by roughly $2 billion. The higher new money yields helped us to get the cash balances in our product portfolios fully invested during the quarter. This helped to reduce the drag on net investment income we saw in the first quarter from holding higher cash balances, and positions us better as we move into the second half of the year.", "While interest rates are up from the historic low levels over the past several months, we are still seeing new money yields well below our portfolio yields. So the pressure on yields will continue. In the second quarter, our overall portfolio yield declined by 6 basis points to 6.35%. It is difficult to draw conclusions from the overall portfolio though, and we look at it product by-product basis. We continue to make pricing adjustments with our renewals and new business pricing to reflect these low interest rates.", "A good example is evidenced in our Unum US LTD business, where we experienced a 1 basis point decline in the interest reserve margin to 91 basis points. This was caused by a 4 basis point decline in the portfolio yield, while the aggregate discount rate declined by 3 basis points. As a result of the adjustments, the new claim discount rate remained in 2011 and 2012. We made no adjustments in new claim discount rate in this quarter.", "As related to our balance sheet, in June, we announced that we will be freezing our US-defined benefit pension plans effective December 31 of this year and replace it with a defined contribution plans. Because this eliminates all future service accruals for active employees in the plans, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations to our plans during the second quarter. Combined with the $50 million contribution, this decreased our net pension liability by $327 million. This has a beneficial impact of approximately $0.80 to our reported book value per share, which increased by 6.2% on a year-over-year basis to $31.80. These changes are helpful in managing our retirement benefits in our risk profile going forward, but will not change how much we contribute to our employees on behalf of their overall retirement package.", "Moving to an update on our capital position. We continue to see very good trends. Statutory net income remained strong at $173 million for the second quarter and $348 million for the first half of the year, which has been higher than our run rate over the last several years. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. life insurance companies was approximately 398%, again, at the top end of our targeted range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash and marketable securities totaled $579 million at the quarter end and include the impact of $50 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan I mentioned. We also increased our dividend by 11.5% and share repurchase activity totaled $98 million in the second quarter. We continue to have strong financial flexibility as we head into the second half of the year.", "Finally, we had no change to our 2013 outlook, and continue to anticipate growth and will have operating earnings per share to be within the range of 0% to 6%.", "I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments. Tom?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. Before I move to your questions, I want to close by reiterating that we are pleased with our operating results for the second quarter. Driven by strong overall risk results, we again generated solid profitability and returns and positive cash flow of the company. There is no doubt that producing profitable top line growth will be a challenge. However, we are maintaining a disciplined growth strategy that has served us so well in the past.", "And with that, this completes our prepared comments. And operator, let's move to question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A couple here, if I may. Tom, in your opening remarks, you discussed competition, and you said it was in certain product -- I'm sorry, pockets. Hopefully you can fill that out for us?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes. Maybe I should ask Kevin to respond to that because I think much of that actually is within our Unum US business actually. Kevin?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. I think the environment, in general competitively has softened a bit over the last 6 to 9 months. I think as both Tom and Rick mentioned, cases coming to market are fewer, activity levels are down, incumbents are defending in-force case as well. That's reflected as well in our own high levels of persistency. And I think a lot of employers, particularly the smaller end of the market are dealing with health care reform and maybe putting off some benefit decision into 2014 perhaps. That said, I think that companies have a couple of choices. They can defend their margins and defend their in-force business, and back off on the aggressive pricing on the new sales side, so they can decide that they want to take share. In our case, our margins, as Tom mentioned, are considerably higher than the industry averages, and we're just unwilling to sacrifice the pricing discipline in margins in pursuit of market share. We'll just let the market settle down. I think Mike Simonds' here with me. Mike, you want to add anything to that?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "No. I guess, what I want to add is 2 quick things. One is, you probably feel the slowdowns in proposal activity, most acutely as you move down market, the small employers have less resources to deal with important decisions around reporting requirements from client's requirements, essential benefits and so forth. The second piece will be more thinking about the long term. I mean, as it's taking a great deal of time for employers and their advisers to sort through health care reform, as their sorting through it, it's playing out in ways that I think are very advantageous to us. So employers are not moving to drop benefits rapidly. They're keeping them in force. In general, employees probably have a bit more financial exposure that creates gaps for our products. So we think as they're moving through health care reform, it is a short-term distraction. But I think long term bodes real well for us.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "If I could follow up on the small end, the less than 50, my understanding is that these firms are not going to have to provide insurance. So I guess, I don't quite -- and maybe I'm wrong on that, but I guess I don't quite understand what the decision process is for these guys. If I'm an employer, everything is pretty much status quo. What am I so concerned about?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes. Great question, Steven. This is Mike. I mean, I'd day, first and foremost, many, if not most, from Unum US standpoint the employers we're doing business with are offering health care benefits today, right? So one of the key positions they have is that public exchanges come online, they've got to decide are they going to continue to provide health insurance or they're going to take advantage of public option. They're going to think about their contribution strategy, whether they're going to stay on DB or go to a more DC strategy under 50 level. It's kind of a great deal to sort through. I think compounding that is, is the brokers and consultants that are serving the market have clients that run up and down the spectrum. And so where their top energy is going to be focused maybe pulled up-market and where they might have been spending more time helping on our lines of business down market, they've got less time to do that.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And that's also been reinforced, I think, Randy in Colonials business, too, because I think you've seen the greatest weakness actually is in the very small case start at the end of the market. You may want to speak to that just for a second.", "Randall C. Horn", "Yes, Tom. In addition to what Mike Simonds mentioned about employers, small employers that do offer health plans today, just having to sort through the requirements of the legislation and make that very basic decision as to whether they should continue to offer a health plan going forward there. For those that do not, I think a lot of those employers are wanting to see what the impact of the public exchange is going to be in terms of costs, payroll impact to their employees, that type of thing. So just a lot of things for them to sort through, we are positioning our agency force to help those small employers deal with those questions and position their plans appropriately. And as Mike said, certainly, some short-term headwinds, but I think some real opportunities for us going forward.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Robert Glasspiegel with Janney Capital.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Just staying on Steven's question on the sales distraction from ACA. Is this a surprise to you, or that this is causing slow decision-making by customers and no new cases coming on? Or was this sort of as you expected?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Bob, I would say no. It's not a surprise. I think what's been a little bit different is sort of the delay in implementing health care reform and the sort of the consistency of inconsistency around the administration's -- the way in which administration is dealing with. And so I think it's sort of prolonged the impact. I was noticing in ALM's [ph] reported results that they're consulting revenues from health care reform consulting were up, but their brokerage fees from commissions were down. And I think if you think about that from our standpoint, we're not on that consulting sides. So the consulting side benefits there on [ph], but the brokerage commissions directly are reflective of the sort of what we're experiencing as well. So not a surprise in terms of its effect, but it sort of flowing through at a much slower pace than I think many had originally predicted.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Bob, I think Mike's going to answer this, too. I think Randy mentioned it, but it's Mike it's true with your business as well. We actually made a substantial investment in our field infrastructure and help equip them to deal with these health care issues. I'm probably a little surprised, Mike, how much actually we've been a resource to people trying to help them through that process.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, it's put us in an interesting position that were a little bit outside of the fray, so we've seen this as an objective source of information. So that's been an add for us. I guess probably, what's been a bit more surprising has been the compounding effect, not just less activity in the market, but when you compound that with, as Kevin alluded to, some softening in prices, that's probably been the amplifier. That's been a bit higher than expected here in the second quarter.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Got you. If I could just zoom in on the group life repricing, what did you see that caused the need to do that?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "You're talking about the UK business?", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I thought you were talking about repricing the US, but maybe I misunderstood.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "No, actually most of the emphasis is really on the UK, Bob. So really, I think as you know, we -- that there was a concerted effort, I think, as we learn more about the underlying profitability of that business, that we need to put some rate into the marketplace, and I think you saw the impact of that this quarter, both on sales and persistency. But we're really in a very nice position relative to where we thought we'd be in terms of enhancing the margin.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So that's old news there. You've been talking about that for a while. Appreciate it.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Good. Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Suneet Kamath with UBS.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of things. First, I guess maybe for Rick, on the capital situation. So year-to-date, the share repurchases are, I guess, $193 million. I think on the first quarter call, you said that you're still pretty comfortable with the $500 million guidance for the full year. So I guess my first question, is that still your expectation?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Let me see if I could -- let me just interject a little bit. This is Tom. Just to sort of kind of refresh everyone's memory about our capital strategy, because I do think it's always good to sort of start at that high level, then certainly Rick can speak the specifics of the share buyback. But I think nothing has really changed. I think with the company in terms of our commitment on one hand to focus on generating solid, consistent profitability, which generates very solid cash flow. I think that part of the machine, as you saw with the first quarter results, continues to work very, very well. I think the other [indiscernible] thing you've seen us over the last 5 or 6 years is I think good stewards of that capital. And you think about it from our position, we have a range of things that we think about as we think about how to deploy that capital. It's everything from the business needs, to some corporate needs, like the pension -- the contribution that Rick referred to in his comments, the debt repurchases. Plus obviously share buybacks of which we done about $2.3 billion at an average price of about 85% of book value and dividend increase. And I just give you that piece of backdrop because I think, Rick, it's safe to say, as we think about it, we think about a whole series of different deployment options for that capital, which obviously a lot of the focus in the short term has been on share buybacks. But remind everybody there's a whole host of things I think, Rick, we think about as we think about how to put capital to work.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes -- no, I'd add, Suneet. We\u2019re active capital managers. So as we come into the year, we have a range of options. We've executed on multiple of those options, including share repurchase to the first half of the year. As you look out through the second half of the year, we'll be active capital managers. And I think the most important thing, excuse me, as Tom alluded to, is our capital generation is extremely strong. So if you look at our stat, earnings are some of the best 6-month numbers we've put up in a while for the first half of the year. So it gives us a lot of financial flexibility, and we'll capitalize that in a variety of forms just like we did in the first half.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess the other question I have was about the long-term care business. Again, just kind of revisiting history a little bit here. I think when you took your charge in 2011, you talked about maybe 3 to 5 years of cushion before you might have to revisit that was sort of -- the time frame was narrowed to close to 3 years given the drop in interest rates, which I'm guessing would put us into the 2014 kind of time frame. So again, I don't think they moved around a little bit here. I just want to see if that's still kind of how you're thinking about it? And I think in the past, you've also talked about order of magnitude maybe $250 million after-tax. I want to see if that's still in line with your current thinking.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Sure. Let me give you a sense of what's happened in the market. In terms of rates coming up in these near-term periods, so we certainly have been happy to see, particularly the longer end. And we think about 30-year treasury rates and credit spreads on that end of the curve over time.", "Now they have come up recently, but I would take you back when we first communicated out those numbers and those ranges in terms of years and things like that. We actually were in a similar position that we are today. So we saw it moved down. We communicated that our range kind of narrowed or came to the shorter end and now we moved back up somewhere in the middle of that range. So we feel similar to what we disclosed back at that time in terms of how that looks, and we think those ranges probably still hold rolled forward by the amount of time that we've talked about.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Right -- well I -- just when you say back at that time, are you talking about back to end of 2011?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Correct. It's correct. So back then, we would have said 3 to 5 years given where rates were. Today, our best view -- as rates compressed, we said that time frame probably got shorter. And now as rates have come back up to those similar levels, we'd be back into that range that we talked about originally.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes. And then the order of magnitude of the charges, is that kind of in line with what you were thinking back then, the $250 million?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes. When you think about that, that actually on an after-tax basis would have been what we took into account back then, which took us out in that 3- to 5-year range. It might be slightly different than that given hedges and other things that go into the calculus, but I think that somewhere in that range is probably reasonable. It depends on what we're seeing and what the outlook is and what the forward curve looks like in terms of how we'd go through that process. So I don't want to speculate too much in terms of quantum, but I think the -- what we did last time is good indicator of what that might look like.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "That's great. And then just my last question is just on the Unum US business. The sales, as you noted, were down about double digits, but given your renewals and the price increases, I think your premiums are kind of holding flattish. So based on kind of where you are with those price increases, do you think that if 2014 is another year of pretty challenging sales, we'd still be looking at sort of a flattish premium line or are we going to start to see that premium line come in?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Well, trying to be optimistic here, I think as health care reform goes into implementation in the beginning of 2014, we should start to see some dampening of that negative effect on sales. So that should help us. I think cautiously, we might start to see some of the improvement in employment. We start to see some of that improvement in the U.S. economy this year although most of the employment improvement has been concentrated in sectors that aren't necessarily target markets for us in sectors like construction and retail and recreation and things like that, whereas industry sectors that are more in our wheelhouse like health care haven't seen growth in employment. So when we look into 2014, hopefully, the economy continues to improve. Sales environment starts to improve. I think if the interest rate environment improves, we won't be having to move prices up as much as we've had to in the last couple of years. So all in all, I would say 2014 ought to be a better year than 2013, but that sort of the best I can do at the moment.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So I had -- just with the first question, I just had a follow-up to Suneet's question on buybacks. I still wasn't clear what your answer was. Are you committed to the $500 million or are you not for 2015? I recognize that you've retired some debt and put money into the pension plan, but could you clarify that?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, yes, go ahead, Rick.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. I think when you look at the full year, I think as you look at the back half of the year, we're going to look at the different alternatives that we have looking out there. And so when you say, \"Are you committed to that?\" We're committed to the active capital managers over the back half of the year and I'd leave it at that. We will have a variety of forms to put it to work in, as Tom alluded to. And if we can keep generating like we do, we have no reason to believe we won't be generating the way we do and we'll be putting that to work.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. But not necessarily $500 million, like you look at buybacks, but you're just not willing to outline an exact number?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. And I think, Jimmy, if could add to that, even though it's not the only determinant, I mentioned the series of things that as you know, we think about as we think about the deploying the excess capital. Again, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at an average price of about 85% of book value. Our stock is trading at a much different level to that even though again that's not the only variable as Rick said in the way we think about these things. It has to be something we take into account. So...", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Now, and that makes sense. You're still even if you still do less. It's still a descent amount. I'm just -- I was just not clear on what your answer.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "[indiscernible] that brings a new piece you're hearing from us a little bit this quarter actually. As you know, many other companies have been saying very much the same thing. We were fortunate -- if I can digress just a moment, we were fortunate enough as you know to have the wherewithal to be buying back stock in incredibly low prices over the last 4 or 5 years. And so we're very conscious of looking at the ROI in those investments. And so again, I want to reiterate, it's not just a price-sensitive decision here because of the series of variables that go into that, but I think Rick, that's embedded in, I think, your comments.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then on the U.K. business, you've had stable results for the past couple of quarters. Should we assume that if they're stable for the second half of the year that you would not renew your reinsurance contracts or what are you thinking there?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Kevin?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Yes. I would -- I expect the result to be stable and improving going through the second half of this year and into 2014. But I think the reinsurance program has served us well. I think there is still a lag in reporting of group life claims that makes the existence of the reinsurance program valuable to us. And I think our intent would probably be to continue it. Although, we're not yet at that decision point.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly on the disruption because of health care reform, any reason to believe that, that would dissipate as you get to the end of the year or will that continue because there's still no clarity on how the exchanges are going to be set up and what the various states are going to be doing?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes. I think it would -- I mean, people are approaching the January 1, 2014 execution deadline. Exchanges are supposed to be up and running by then, although I have my doubts as to whether that's going to be the end result. So I would expect a slow dissipation into 2014.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Erik Bass with Citi.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So I guess going back to Kevin for a little more detail here maybe, but we've seen reported job growth in the U.S. now for a number of months. But it sounds like you're yet to see any benefit in terms of the natural growth factors. Is this because of a lag effect or is it really more because the job growth that we're seeing is in sectors where Unum is less of a presence?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "I think it's both things. I think there's some lag effect. You wouldn't see it start to show up in the benefits-related payrolls for several quarters after, so you get that growth. Most employers have some sort of waiting period before you get your employee benefits, especially those paid for by the company. I want to make sure that you're locked in and embedded in the job. And then I think, as you've said and as I said earlier, the growth has been much more in the construction, retail, recreation, lower-cost service end of the -- in industries in the United States as opposed to sort of maybe the more highly paid financial sector or the health care sector. Health care, actually, I think it might have seen sort of a slight decline in the second quarter.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then on, I guess, also on the rise in interest rates, how does that impact your thinking about needing to potentially make any further reductions to the discount rate?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "And certainly, with the rising rates that we've seen, it certainly takes off some of the pressure around that. As you've seen over the last several years, we managed our discount rate over a period of time, taking a forward look to that in terms of how it plays out. But certainly, this rise in rate has been helpful so I don't want to take it off the table, but certainly a much better environment in terms of matching up. As I had in my prepared remarks, our margins, particularly in our long-term disability line, remained very healthy at just over 90 basis points, so it gives us a lot of flexibility around that.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And maybe just a follow-up on Erik's question on the rising interest rates and going back to the December Investor Day. When thinking about that 6% to 8% headwind facing from lower rates, I realized we're still in the low rate environment today, but it's pretty different than the 1.6% 10-year rate we had at that December time. Maybe you could just help us think about kind of that headwind as it relates to 100 basis points movement in the general environment?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Certainly, if I could take you through, I think when you think about the charts we laid out, which were the downward pressure we have on our earnings from an interest rate environment, and then how we're offsetting that with the price increases, so we're certainly still out there on a price increase front. In terms of how that downward pressure plays through, it doesn't snap back. So it's going to play out over a period of time as we put cash flows to work in the investing side, as we think about how our discount rates work over time. And so we'll certainly give a better look at that as we get out towards the end of the year, but I won't expect a material change certainly as you look in 2013 from that snapback in rates. But we'd echo what many others have said out there, which is this rise in rate is certainly helpful, but it's something that we still are in a low rate environment and something we're going to have to work through as a company.", "Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a one quick follow-up on that. When thinking about that pressure, it's obviously relative to a more normal rate environment. Maybe you can help us think about when you set that out in December, kind of what 10-year rate that would be sort of in reference against?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "I think back then, it was probably $190 million, something like -- wherever the spot rate was at the time is what we're referencing and so you'd have to look at it. It wasn't as quite as low as the lows we've seen here in the first half of the year, but it was somewhere in that range. I just have to give that back to you exactly what that was.", "Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right. I'm sorry, I mean, the $160 million or $190 million relative to what, in terms of where that goes this year?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "That would've been -- yes, all of that analysis was year-over-year, so it would've been to the prior year.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to follow up just on the capital. I mean, obviously, you have been one of the better capital return stories within the group and a lot of that has been attributed to what you guys have talked about in terms of the strong free cash flow that you generated. So, I guess, as that continues to kind of build here and maybe the pace of share repurchases moderates, you could have an issue where you have maybe more capital than what you want, and I think you've been pointing to that here for the past number of years. So can you -- maybe as we think about the competing sources, can you talk about size of deals, if that something you would consider? Is there anything in the pipeline? And then maybe where you'd potentially look to take your dividend to?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes, Chris, let me introduce it, but then maybe have Rick really more to speak to it. But you're right, again, I think we have many different potential uses of capital. I think one of the messages we're trying to get across here is beyond just share buybacks. There are other things that we have in our quiver, so to speak, to think about deploying that capital. I think we've made some good decisions in the past. M&A is certainly one of them. Rick and I said that we'll continue to look at things, but I think this group knows we've been very, very cautious about being sure that we don't get our -- get extended into things that we don't know well and don't have the financial characteristics that we work so hard to protect. But anyone who speak, too, about the M&A environment?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I think what I'd add to that is something we've said in previous calls as well is that when our shares are trading at a steep discount that they were, it was a very, very high hurdle to have any deal clear to that. So we chose to buy back our stock. As our stock prices moved up, I think that the other things come into play. Particularly to the M&A markets, we've been active throughout this period of time so even as we've been buying back shares, we have been on the look in terms of different pieces that we have out there, capabilities out there, things that are in our space, and so things that are definitely on strategy is what we've been looking at, and we continue on that front. I certainly don't have anything to announce. The flow externally is particular to what we look at. It's still, I'd say, medium to slower, but it's certainly something we'll be active on.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then if we think about the move up in rates, curious if you're seeing any potential opportunities to reduce your exposure to the closed block? And could you potentially use some capital to shore up further pieces of the closed block to make it more enticing for a potential buyer or reinsurance solution?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Let me start and again ask Rick to speak. But I think as you -- you've heard, I think, Chris in my comments at the front end of the call, we are putting more resources behind our closed block in terms of moving additional individuals and people over there to be sure that again, we're actively managing every lever that we have in that particular part of the business. And I think you're right, there's one element that this is capital-related, but I think Rick, it's not at the exclusion of other things. We're certainly working rate increases through the process . We're doing a number other things operationally to continue to improve the performance to that block. But again, I think the key message is we are actively managing that business and using all the levers, I think, we have. I'm not sure we're prepared to talk about doing something in terms of like we did with the disability block of business. I don't think the environment is not necessarily right for that, but if and when those things change, we're certainly going to be looking at those different kind of choices.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just one last quick one on LTC specifically around the charge in 2011. We've talked a little bit about the interest rate environment, but from a sort of policyholder behavior experience, recognizing it's just 1.5 years out, but anything that's mainly deviated meaningfully from the assumptions that you guys made at that time?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes. So we've seen inter-quarter volatility on different elements. We've reported that and talked to you about them. As we've seen, incidents have been -- tend a little bit higher than we expected early on, but I think the most important thing that you laid out is it's still very early in this block of business. Reserves are based on very long term assumptions around that so inter-quarter volatility that we see out there really doesn't influence that in a material way. It's more trends that we see out there, and we continue to watch all of those as does the rest of the industry.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I wanted to come back to long-term care. Can you just remind us the 90% in interest adjusted loss ratio. Just remind us where you would need to get to before you'd be out of harm's way? I know 90% is too high, but is it 85% or -- I just want to get a better handle for what the goal is and where you need to get to. And then I guess a related question, how much -- at a 90% interest adjusted loss ratio, how much margin would you have right now in the block?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. I think the 90% really relates to my last question, which is that's a fairly short-term measure around what it's running at. So we've said previously that we'd like to see ranges below that over time and -- but it is over a long period of time, and rate increases come into play in that and how that influences that, and so I think that, that's something we'll actively manage and actively communicate to you where we've seen. So I think that 90% is probably okay for the time being, but certainly, it's something we'd like to work down with price increases, et cetera, over a very long-term period of time.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "You're asking a question about margin relative to that, so that's a multifaceted type discussion around how it is. We talked a little bit about the interest rate environment in that. The business is still -- the business line is still generating money. You would've seen closed block results, which were quite good in the quarter at about $30 million, and that was driven by pretty good results in long-term care. So we're still clipping along on that front.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "But where do you need to get to from -- in interest rate adjusted loss ratio longer-term to be at a comfortable level? Is it mid-80s, low 80s? I just want to get a better handle on that.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes, I think I'd probably keep it more near term in terms of where we can run and look at it. It's going to be right in that 90% range, so where we like it to be lower and we're talking about multiple years and time frames around which we like to see that trend down, but we're comfortable with where we are right now.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And Tom, that gets us to really the back. But again, we are using every lever we possibly have to improve the operational performance of that block. And I guess, it's been a while maybe since we've given Kevin an update on just some of the rate actions that we're putting in place. But people shouldn't assume that we're not doing we shouldn't-- permit and I think we're doing all the things we can on that front. Maybe a quick update there might be helpful.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Back in when we took the charge in sort of fourth quarter 2011 and put the block into closed block status and established gross premium valuation reserves, we anticipated and planned for the execution of rate increases in the upwards 25% and above on the block of business. We've been going through the approval process with all the states over the last year. We're basically through that approval process now. I think we've only got 2 states outstanding still, Florida and New York. I think it's Florida and New York. They're still outstanding. And we're exceeding our expectations in terms of the rate increases approved. That said, as we said in the past, it's going to be an interim[ph] process and we'll be going through that a number of times. We've started implementing those rate increases. That cash flow will start to flow in primarily in 2014 more than in 2013. We'll have to see what policyholder behaviors as a result to that, whether that take -- except the rate increases, they could buy down their benefits instead of the rate increase or they could lapse all of those. We've got assumptions about all of those things built in and right now, I'd say we're running better than expectations, which over time should, as Rick alluded to, should move the loss ratio down, but it'll take time for that to occur.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And Kevin, just to help us understand what the whole dynamic of re-rates would mean. Is that likely -- is that something that's already factored into reserves or is that going to be a benefit as we think about it going forward in terms of that flowing through?", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "A significant amount of the rate increase was factored into the original assumptions. What we've achieved so far is slightly above what we factored into those assumptions. But also, as Rick said, those assumptions include assumptions about interest rates. They include assumptions about incident rates, mortality, all of those things over the life of a long-term care block that's going to build 20, 30, 40, 50 years. Those assumptions are going to move around with changes in medical technology, with changes in interest rates, et cetera, so that's why the rate increase process has to be an interim [ph] one.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then my last question, I guess, for Rick, the Unum Provident International Limited had a modest loss on a stat accounting basis this quarter. Was this being driven by long-term care and what would the outlook be there?", "Richard P. McKenney", "No, we don't get into that, we don't actually talk too much about our detailed entities because it really can get lost in the details of volatility you might see in any one entity. We did have a loss and it's actually in our supplement around UPIL, which is our Bermuda subsidiary. On the quarter but actually we made money in the last quarter so you're going to see inter-quarter volatility and I really don't want to get into drivers and attributes by each one of our legal entities.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And sorry one last one if I could sneak in just for Tom Watjen. So Tom, I just want to get a better handle for broad capital management, the way you're thinking about it. I totally hear what you're saying about considering where the stock is in valuation as it relates to buyback, but I want to get a better sense for, are you guys now thinking a bit more defensively with capital management, considering what could go wrong? Or is it more still pretty offensive-minded in terms of, if you're not buying back shares, then you'd be doing something more offensive-oriented?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Maybe, Tom, the word I prefer to use is balanced. I think we've always had a balance approach. As I mentioned, there were a number of different things we thought about as a potential use of capital that we've both created, as well as the excess we've had on our balance sheet. And I don't think that balance point has actually changed at all. As I said, we want to continue to do the right things. We've proven as a -- I think as a management team, we've done the right things in terms of allocating that excess capital across the different set of dimensions here. And I think those areas that we can potentially invest in that are no different today than they were 2 years ago or 5 years ago, frankly. The relative attractiveness of those can actually change as we said based on market conditions and strategic considerations and those kind of things. But I don't think anything has changed, Rick, as it relates to how we've gone about this in a very, very balanced way, in a very disciplined way. And if we end up accumulating more capital in a period of time -- periods of time like this, that's not a bad place to be either, if we don't find a good way to deploy it. So I think that's where I actually tend to -- I'd like you to think, Tom, about the approach. It's still remains very, very balanced, and we continue to have that full menu in front of us.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to touch base about the earnings outlook for 2013. Operating EPS was up 6% for the first half of this year. You're still guiding to 0% to 6%. Does that sort of imply flat operating EPS for the back half of this year?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. I think that when you look at it, Jay, when we think about our 0% to 6% we went into the year, we're not going to adjust that range until we see something material that takes us either one way of the range or outside of the other. So we still see ourselves relatively in that. We're not intoning anything by leaving it where it is today. We still feel comfortable in that range, and we'll continue to execute through the second half of the year. So I wouldn't read anything into the fact that we didn't change it.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. On a separate issue, given the decline in year-over-year sales in the U.S., probably greater than a lot of people's expectations, can you talk to us about how things are going so far in 3Q?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes. Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I guess, my answer to that will be we won't talk about 3Q already. So we're early into it and so we'll take the long term and we'll talk to you in next earnings call about that.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Last issue on the improvement in the U.K. earnings. Should we anticipate that, that trend continues, not just on a year-over-year basis, but quarter-over-quarter?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. Certainly, when you look at our U.K. results, we were actually quite pleased with where they are today. I don't we've gotten to the point. It's still pretty early in our repricing process. The reinsurance that we talked about and all those different pieces, so I think we're optimistic about where that trend line lands. But I think that we'll wait and see a couple of more quarters into that process before we declare a victory. So I'd say we're happy for now and we'll watch third and fourth quarter, how it plays out, but the teams are doing great job there.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jeff Schuman with KBW.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to go a little bit of detail maybe on the investment portfolio. I think the portfolio yield is about 6.35% now. Can you give us a little perspective on new money rates, and also what kind of coupons are rolling off the portfolio at this point?", "Richard P. McKenney", "It's a good question, Jeff. And I think when we look at it, we really don't spend a lot of time analyzing our portfolio at the macro level. It's a product line by product line thing. When we invest, it's really to back up our liabilities and how we look at it. So when we manage line-by-line, we actually see the portfolio runoffs being reasonable over their time frame, and so if you see that overall yield come down, which in a macro level, I would expect you would, we're taking offsetting impacts and pricing that we've talked about in the past on the other side of that equation. So it's good discussion, good analysis, but the new money rates that we're seeing today, whether it's the 30-year, which we back up on our LTC business are closer to the 10 with our disability business, we're happy to see those moved up, but we'd still like to see a little bit more of an increase here over time and going through that. So it's a good discussion, certainly, happy where we are today. And I'd reiterate that the credit quality of that portfolio is in extremely good shape.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the U.K., obviously, you're taking the pricing actions that you've needed to take and have a lot of discipline there. I guess, the hope would be at some point that the market firms along with you. I guess, still based on what we're seeing with persistency, so far, it doesn't appear that maybe there's a lot of market firming. Is there any reason to hope that maybe the market is turning yet or not?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Jess, maybe I'll ask Peter O'Donnell to talk about that. And actually, one of the things, you look at headline result, you look at the declining sales position, there's a piece in there, Peter, we should talk about, which is that's really largely of group life. The LTD business actually has some good growth. And actually, most encouraging, we also assume soft -- wonderful growth trends among first time buyers. But maybe, Peter, just maybe embellish a little bit on that.", "Peter G. O'donnell", "Thanks, Tom. Thanks very much for the question, Jeff. So if I start with the LTD line, our sales year-on-year are up 5%. And we do see price competition also in the LTD line. Our customers and brokers really value Unum's expertise and our focus. However, some of our competitors aren't as disciplined. And we do see a lot of competition at the large case. The big strategic change for us is through the last 12 months to 2 years, we've been looking at a new to market and getting new employee classes, and almost 50% of our sales in the second quarter are actually came from either first time buyers or people deepening penetration, bringing new class of employees. And that gives us momentum to be able to sort of get momentum behind the sales and not be so dependent on price in the switch business. On the group life side, where we are there is there's a bit of portfolio cleansing going on there, I would say, Jeff. So there are some schemes that we didn't like to look at. We were putting some large price increases through our group life book, double-digit plus. We expect that to continue for the next 6 to 12 months really and really some of our competitors, as you know, people get around and they chase volumes. They're not as interested in margin. And I think they'll experience some pain on that so we would expect that market to sort of move to a more rational level over that 2014 period, really.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just wanted to dig in yet again into the U.S. sales. And if I understand correctly, the 3 main drivers for the decline were ACA, the economy and increased competition. If I look sequentially, really, things like this quarter was the first quarter where you really saw a very significant drop, where I'm thinking ACA, that was kind of a headwind for the last 2 quarters as well. The economy has certainly been headwind for several quarters. So is it really competition that's changed so much?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And Mike, maybe you should take that because especially though when you do have fewer at-bats how much that can change people's competitive spirit.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, thanks, absolutely. So yes, you actually have seen that with your clients in the market that are actively looking to evaluate different benefits providers. You see many more competitors that are more aggressive competition, and we're going to hold the line there. I think as you talked sequentially quarter-over-quarter, one thing that we've talked to, Kevin has spoken to, is the fact that in the large end of the market, we're actually towards -- or better suited to be able to sort through health care and move some things on the ancillary side. We've got a couple of good quarters and that's an opportunistic segment for us. So for the last few quarters, we've -- through our partnership with UnitedHealthcare, through our focus on a couple of targeted segments, we've had some good wins there that we've been able to bring clients on board at acceptable pricing levels. So that's covered on the disability side, where we've seen a little bit of a downward trend over the last couple of quarters. And when you see that, it's primarily ACA and economy-related. As we look forward, again, as Kevin said, I think as employers push through and get health care changes sorted, we're cautiously optimistic that we'll start to see improvements in our sales results.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And about that cautious optimism, so given the increased competition that we see in certainly almost any management team that we talked to these days is focused on U.S. group or voluntary supplemental. What gives you the confidence, I guess, that, that headwind of increased competition will not overcome the offsetting tailwind of -- at the release of ACA demand?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, I mean that's a couple of things. One is I think the long-term trends are very positive for our business. I think we see strong need and actually increasing need for the products we've got. U.S. workers, 60% of which live paycheck to paycheck. We see increased exposure appearing as gaps, appearing health care plans as employers settle kind of DC-type approaches. I think health care is getting more standardized. As the Federal Government defined health care, more and more employers are picking standards of design. So if you want to differentiate with a perspective and current employees on the benefits front, increasingly, it's our lines of business that are going to make a difference. So I think those are long-term, very positive trends. And in fact, we've been focused on consumer-driven benefits here for the last 4, 5 years. It enabled us to get ahead of the curve whether that's offering design or whether it's 40-plus technology partners that are now forming the backbones of private exchanges, we feel like we've got a pretty good head start that as sort of the temporary distraction, we'll work through that as the economy begins to pick up a bit. I think that bodes quite well for us.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And if I could add, I think we feel very good about the quality of our operating and our stickiness of the -- our offering in the marketplace. We see repeatedly, I think, whether it's Mike's business, Peter's business or Randy's business, the things we really do are very competitive in the marketplace. You see that with persistency. You see that, as Peter said, with sales to knowing new customers. The one thing we, unfortunately, can't address is the fact that some competitors are still willing to price business at substantially below their cost of capital and we've all talked about returns throughout the discussion today. Our returns for our core businesses are in some cases, 2x, in some cases, 3x times the industry average actually. And we're not prepared to compromise those pieces. So again, the good news is, I think, our operating throughout all our businesses are very competitive. But again, as people compared to buy business, I think you've seen us as a management team unwilling to do that. And I think that's proven to be the right thing over the long term.", "Kevin P. McCarthy", "Well I think Tom that was the last question, and I think let me just thank you, all, for taking the time to join us this morning, and this completes the second quarter of 2013 earnings call.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead.", "Thomas White", "Great. Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2013 earnings conference call for Unum.", "Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and our subsequently filed Form 10-Q.

A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found also on the website in the Investors section.", "So participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, the President and CEO; Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kevin McCarthy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; as well as the CEOs of our business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum US, Peter O'donnell for Unum UK, Randy Horn for Colonial Life and Jack McGarry for the Closed Block.", "And now I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was another strong quarter for the company with growth in operating earnings per share of 6.3% to $0.85 per share and an increase of 10.4% in book value per share, excluding AOCI, to $31.63. And let me touch on a few items before turning things over to Rick.", "First, I continue to be very pleased with the strength of our core business operating results. Unum US had another very strong quarter overall with profit margins for this business segment continuing to improve as we stay focused on disciplined underwriting, pricing and risk selection, often at the expense of top line growth. These strong results were driven in part by another quarter of solid risk results in our group disability line, where the benefit ratio improved again to 82.9%. Colonial Life's operating results remain strong as well with solid risk results and sound expense management driving another good quarter for this business.", "Lastly, while still below our long-term expectations, Unum UK showed strong improvement over the third quarter of last year as the aggressive group life repricing and repositioning actions we began taking late last year have begun to have a favorable impact on our results for that line of business. I continue to feel very good about the results of our core businesses where our disciplined approach to the business has resulted in consistently strong margins, cash flow and operating return on equity, which was 14.5% for the quarter.", "Secondly, our Closed Block segment was also in line with our expectations this quarter. As we have said in the past, this segment, particularly the long-term care product line, will continue to be an area of focus for us for some time to come. I mentioned last quarter that we had taken steps to devote additional resources to this critically important area, and I can see early signs of the benefits we'll derive from this increased management focus on this challenging line of business. As Tom White mentioned, Jack McGarry, the CEO of this business, is with us today on today's call and available for your questions.", "Third, while it continues to be a challenging environment to profitably grow our business in the U.S., we saw improved sales trends this quarter within a number of important segments of our businesses. Most notably, LTD sales increased 9% in Unum US, while core market sales in Unum US, which includes our STD, LTD and group life lines of business, increased 2%, and voluntary benefit sales in Unum US grew 6%. We also saw sales in Colonial Life increase by 1% in the greater-than-50 life area of the marketplace.", "As we've discussed last quarter, the biggest challenge for Unum US and Colonial Life remains in the very small end of the market, which we define as the less-than-50 life employer. This market segment continues to be impacted by the soft pace of economic growth, the political environment and distractions brought on by the implementation of health care reform. While we believe these headwinds in the U.S. are likely to continue, we expect to continue to see pockets of growth, and we remain committed to -- we remain committed to maintaining our disciplined approach to the market and not chasing business, but instead, protecting the strong margins and the returns we have worked so hard to build in our core business segments.", "Rounding out my review of sales trends, I'm also pleased that we're seeing somewhat better pricing trends in the U.K. market where sales in local currency grew by just under 4% for the quarter.", "Moving to investments, I continue to be very pleased with our investment results, including the credit quality of our portfolio. Interest rates and investment yields remain a challenge, but we continue to maintain our investment quality standards and remain focused on raising prices in those products that are most interest rate sensitive.", "And finally, our capital position remains very strong with our continued solid statutory results and cash flow providing us with significant financial flexibility, financial flexibility which not only allows us to continue to repurchase stock but also, as Rick will touch on further in a moment, financial flexibility that also allows us to evaluate alternatives for moving our Bermuda-based insurance subsidiary to the U.S. and still operate comfortably within the capital outlook we've given you last year.", "We closed the third quarter with a risk-based capital ratio of 397% and a holding company liquidity position of $678 million, both on the higher end of our target range for 2013.", "So to summarize, before we move to a more detailed discussion of the quarter, we're pleased with the overall results we saw in the third quarter. The current business environment presents top line growth challenges, but I'm very encouraged by the growth we did see in certain of our markets. Our risk results remain very strong, and we're committed to maintaining our disciplined underwriting, pricing and risk selection practices to protect the solid margins, returns and cash flow that we have consistently produced in our core business lines. I believe that this strategy, along with our strong brand and market position, continues to position us very well to both operate effectively in a still difficult environment while capitalizing on the long-term growth opportunities we continue to see in our marketplace.", "Now I'll turn things over to Rick for a review of our operating results. Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned in his comments for the third quarter, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.85, an increase of 6.3%, which brings our growth in operating EPS to 6% for the first 3 quarters of the year. As a result of this, we're refining our outlook for the full year to the higher end of the 0% to 6% range as we look to the fourth quarter.", "Again, in the third quarter, across the company, we continue to see positive trends. Drilling in a little bit deeper to the results, first on Unum US, operating earnings increased year-over-year with favorable experience in the group disability and group life and AD&D lines, offsetting slightly lower earnings in the supplemental and voluntary lines.", "Focusing first on our group disability business, we continue to perform very well with the benefit ratio at a tick under 83% for the third quarter of 2013, which compares favorably to an almost 85% in the year-ago quarter and 84% in the second quarter of 2013. The underlying experience continues to be strong with stable to lower overall claim incidents and continued strong claim recovery performance. We didn't adjust discount rates as the interest reserve margins remains comfortably above our target range and consistent with the margin in the year ago quarter. The profitability of this business also continues to benefit from the pricing discipline we show on new sales and renewals. We are very pleased with the performance of this business and the strong return it continues to produce.", "Group life and AD&D also produced good results for the quarter with operating income increasing by 4.3% to $58.5 million. The benefit ratio was steady in the quarter at 71.5%, reflecting favorable underlying risk experience.", "And finally, in Unum US, the supplemental and voluntary line reported operating income of $82.7 million for the quarter, down from the $85.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratios for the primary lines of business were slightly higher from the year-ago results but very much within our expectations as the underlying risk results remain generally stable. Persistency trends also tracked with our expectations in the third quarter.", "Moving to Unum UK. Operating earnings were GBP 20.1 million for the third quarter, improved from the year-ago quarter, which was GBP 17.3 million, but off slightly from the second quarter of GBP 21.8 million. We're pleased with the overall progress we're seeing in our U.K. business, particularly with the repricing and repositioning of the group life block of business.", "In addition, the underlying claim experience for the group life business improved in the quarter. We did have softer sequential results in the group disability product in the quarter. However, this is not too surprising given that historically, we are subject to seasonal volatility with disability claims in the quarter. Overall for the U.K., this quarter's results are within our anticipated range, and we continue to make solid progress on restoring the high-margin expectations we have for this business.", "Colonial Life continues to produce solid steady results with operating income at $69 million for the third quarter. The benefit ratio is slightly higher at 53% for the quarter as we experienced slightly unfavorable risk experience in life product line and the accident, sickness and disability product line, which offset improved claim experience in the cancer and critical illness product lines. Overall, the underlying profitability of this business remains strong.", "And finally, the Closed Block generated operating income in the third quarter of $25.7 million, consistent with the year-ago quarter. The slight improvement in the interest adjusted loss ratio is attributable to a lower average claim size in the individual disability line and more favorable development in the active life reserves in the LTC line.", "In addition, the Closed Block is slightly less than for our miscellaneous net investment income in the third quarter relative to both the second quarter and the year-ago quarter. Overall, the results of the Closed Block this quarter are also in line with our expectations.", "Wrapping up the earnings picture, I would quickly highlight an item related to our tax rate. There was an income tax rate reduction in the U.K. enacted in July, and we adjusted deferred tax assets and liabilities through income on the date of enactment of that change. For the third quarter of 2013, this resulted in a $6.3 million tax benefit. This lowered our effective tax rate by about 2 percentage points. You'll recall that in the year-ago third quarter, a similar U.K. income tax rate reduction was enacted, which resulted in a $9.3 million benefit.", "Now let me turn to our -- move to our discussion of our sales and growth trends. We saw some challenges in the first half of 2013 for new sales driven in large part by the pace of economic growth, the political environment and disruptions in certain sectors of our markets from health care reform implementation. However, we did see good progress in the third quarter.", "In Unum US, as Tom highlighted in his introductory comments, we saw improved sales trends in the core employee benefits markets and involuntary benefits. That combination of businesses, the focus areas of growth for Unum US, produced sales growth of 4% in the third quarter following a decline of almost 18% in the second quarter. Persistency trends in our Unum US lines remain in line with our expectation, helping to produce positive premium growth for Unum US in total. I would add that we continue to see little benefit to premium income from the overall economy and employment trends on our business.", "In the U.K., sales are up by 3.7% this quarter in local currency. Disability sales in the core market showed an increase year-over-year, while sales in the group life market increased due to higher enrollments on existing cases. In short, we are very pleased with the underlying quality of these sales.", "Persistency in the U.K. continues to be impacted by the pricing actions we are taking, particularly in the group life line where the lapse of an unprofitable large case during the quarter helped contribute to a reduction in persistency to 65%. These are all driven by the actions that we put in place to improve the profitability of the book and is trending as we expected. Persistency in the disability line remains relatively stable at 82%.", "Finally, at Colonial Life, we saw aggregate sales down 3%, but premium income grew 3.2% for the quarter and 3.5% for the first 9 months of the year. The decline in sales is primarily attributable to the ongoing slowdown in activity in the small end of the market. This is particularly true in the less-than-50 lives market where the most disruption seems to be going on from the implementation of health care reform. In fact, we're seeing new account activity down by as much as 28%. Despite this trend, we did see better sales results in other parts of Colonial Life's markets with large case sales, which we define as greater than 1,000 lives, up by 17% and public sector sales up by about 2%. In general, we're seeing continuation of the same trend of fairly stagnant new account growth offset by better sales activity with existing customers. Persistency remained steady with last year's levels.", "Quickly moving on to the investment portfolio. The credit quality of our portfolio remains in excellent shape, and the watch list of potential problems remains quite low. Treasury yield and corporate bond spreads were more favorable during the early part of the quarter, and since our investment team was more active putting money to work in the early part of the quarter, we were able to achieve higher new money yields for the third quarter than the yields we realized in the first half of the year.", "Fortunately, by the time those higher rates reverse themselves in the final weeks of the quarter, we had put most of our cash to work. In addition, during the early weeks of the third quarter, we sold approximately $400 million of our lower coupon corporate bonds, and in a tactical trade, reinvested into higher-yielding mortgage-backed securities and corporate securities to take advantage of the move-up in interest rates at that time. This activity resulted in the net realized investment loss, which came solely from interest rates and not credit. The trade enabled us to slightly enhance the investment yield while improving the credit quality of the portfolio.", "Moving to an update on capital management. We continue to see very positive trends, which produce a strong overall capital position. Statutory net income remains healthy at $153 million for the third quarter and $500 million for the first 9 months of the year. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies was approximately 397%, at the upper end of our target 2013 range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash and marketable securities was also up, totaling $678 million at quarter end. I would also note that during the quarter, we entered into a 5-year credit facility of $400 million, further solidifying our capital structure. Share repurchase activity totaled $75 million in the quarter, which brings the total on a year-to-date tally up to $269 million or 3.6% of our outstanding shares.", "As we approach year end, we're evaluating various options for our Bermuda-based insurance subsidiary. As a reminder, we've had the Bermuda entity since 1996. In this entity, we reinsured certain long-term disability and long-term care blocks. As we look at it today, it does not provide the benefit worthy of its structure. Therefore, we have a goal of moving the business onshore under a domestic regulator in a subsidiary with a financial profile consistent with our traditional U.S. insurance companies. I would stress that the move will not have an impact on our consolidated GAAP fourth quarter earnings.", "We expect to keep our year-end capital metrics within the target levels we have previously communicated. That is RBC in the 375% to 400% target range and holding company liquidity in the target range of $500 million to $800 million. I would also stress that this move will not preclude us from repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter. Right now, we're pushing to complete our work before year end, and we'll update you with our progress at our Investor Meeting that we have scheduled for December 16 in New York. We look forward to taking you through this, as well as our outlook for 2014, at that event.", "And now I'll turn my comments back to Tom for his closing comments. Tom?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. Before we move to your questions, I'll close by reiterating how pleased we are with our operating results for the third quarter. We continue to generate solid profitability and returns by focusing on the basics, disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management, along with the sound risk management and managing our investments and capital. That focus on the basics will not change.", "This completes our prepared remarks. And operator, let's move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A couple of follow-up questions. So the move for the Bermuda operation back onshore, how much capital do you feel that will deploy in the course of doing that?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Certainly, Jay. This is Rick McKenney. Just let me answer a couple of things. One is we're still working through the details. So we brought that out to you today. We do expect to have more details around that by Investor Day, but we're still working through the structure. What I would -- how I would highlight that is actually, we're going to be within the ranges of capital that we -- our outlook that we really put out to you over the course of this year. So we feel good about that and now we take it out. And as I mentioned in my notes, we'll also have the ability to buy stock in the quarter and get to those levels. So I think this is going to be a good move for us, and we'll give you more details as we get to Investor Day and the structure solidifies.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "On that topic of buybacks, it's been running $100 million a quarter in the first half down to $75 million in 3Q. Just trying to get a sense of what a decent run rate is on maybe a quarterly or annual basis absent that shift?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Go ahead, Rick.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Let me take you through how we're thinking about our capital. First, I'd start out with saying our capital generation this year has been excellent. We mentioned even through 3 quarters, $500 million of statutory earnings, which is better than I think we've anticipated, certainly better than our run rate that we've had. As we've talked about before, we think about capital deployment in many ways, in terms of what are the best uses of our capital as we take that out. Now we've certainly have done it through share repurchase, and that is an important piece of how we deploy capital. But I'll also take you to other things that we've done in the course of the year, retiring debt in the first quarter, solidifying our pension position in the second quarter, and now we're talking about redomesticating our Bermuda business, which as I've just mentioned in my last comments, we'll adjust some of that capital that we take in. But we think those are all good uses, and certainly, we'll continue to do that. Specific to share repurchase, I think that as we mentioned in our comments last quarter, there are a lot of factors that are going into how much stock we will buy in a given quarter, when we will do that in the quarter and how we'll go through it. So I think that those still hold, but I'd take you back to how much capital we're generating, and we certainly will put that capital to work on an active basis.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then finally on the strong recovery in group LTD sales in the U.S., what's changed relative to the prior 2 quarters? I know a significant focus by some benefit managers at large corporates on the looming Affordable Care Act implementation had been a drag in the first half. Did that ease off in 3Q? I'm trying to get a better sense of what changed.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes, Jay. I'll let Mike Simonds speak to that. Mike?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, thanks. Jay, I'd say the headwinds that we've been feeling through the first half of the year are definitely still out there in the market when it comes to health care reform. That being said, we did see that abate just a bit as a number of health care decisions, particularly for large employees, get made around midyear, and so they can now turn their attention a bit to some of our lines of business. So we were encouraged to see the increase in disability. We're encouraged to see the increase, as Tom mentioned, in our core and in our voluntary benefits sales. But we're still cautious around the outlook given that employers still have a great deal to work through, particularly in the small end of the market. And with fewer prospects out there, fewer employers looking to make changes, we continue to see a pretty aggressive pricing environment as carriers are looking to meet sales goals with fewer prospects available.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And if I can add to Mike's comments, too, I think he said it well. I think the big challenge for us is still in the small end of the marketplace. And so I'm not sure we saw a real swing in sentiment over the course of the last quarter. We're still cautious as we look forward, and that obviously affects both the sales activity within Unum US but also in Colonial as well. But again, there were some encouraging signs. But as you see, we're not going to deviate from that more disciplined approach. If the business is there to be done at a profitable level, we'll certainly be getting more than our fair share. But if not, we'll sit on the sidelines. But I don't think there's been a real fundamental shift in the quarter, especially amongst that small employer piece, which is affecting both Unum US and Colonial.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Erik Bass with Citigroup.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just one follow-up on the Bermuda captive. And I guess how are you thinking about kind of the long-term care statutory reserves? And am I correct that as part of the redomiciling process, you might have an opportunity to increase those reserves?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. The way I'd answer that for you, Erik, is that when we bring it back onshore, we are expecting that we will have a company and a business that is actually similar in its reserving and capital processes that we have in the U.S. So that is a key part of that, and we'll take you through the details on that. But it will look very similar to our other practices we have for other U.S. businesses.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And would that be a higher level of reserves than today on a statutory basis?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I think, Erik, that gets you to some of the discussion around capital we just said. So we're going to have to bring you those details to you on Investor Day, but I think that those will all be coming to play in terms of how we look at what reserving levels look like, as well as what capital levels look like. But we'll give you more of those details at Investor Day, and quite frankly, when we're done with the process, which we aren't not done yet.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And Rick, if I can answer that, again, this is -- I think that you said this before, but this our decision to do this. This doesn't have to be done. But as we just look at just our own capital structure, the quality of our capital, looked at obviously some of the themes that are happening in our industry, we just think this is the right time to entertain this. And fortunately, we have the financial flexibility to do so. And I think you just said Rick, when the dust settles, we'll have this back onshore at a level most likely with reserves and capital equivalent to the other parts of our business.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then you mentioned the increased resources that you've allocated to the Closed Block. Can you just talk a little bit more about -- specifically about what you're doing, particularly for the long-term care block?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes, let me turn things to Jack. But just to remind others, what we did talk about last quarter was the fact that this closed block, and especially the long-term care component of the block, is going to be with us for many, many, many years to come. And so this will be an ongoing focus that we're raising our focus, frankly, to be sure that we're managing that business for the long term. And we appointed Jack to run that business, and Jack has certainly added to its resources. Maybe, Jack, maybe take people through a little bit some of the early things that you've been involved in.", "John F. McGarry", "Yes. And the big piece of what we've done with the resources is we've really consolidated resources around long-term care. We're running it as a strategic business unit. So long-term care currently has basically all of the functions within it that affect its outcomes. In addition, we've significantly strengthened the actuarial resources that we're bringing to bear on long-term care. As many of you may know, I'm an actuary running the long-term care line. We have selected some of our best actuaries in the company to come into the unit and work on reserving, repricing and capital management. We're underway. It's going to be a process in terms of building the tools and doing the analysis, but we feel like we're off to a great start. And that really is the focus of the unit, continue to do the operating things that continue to produce stable results, but a big focus on reserving and financial modeling, a big focus on rate increases and making sure that we get those in the best way possible and then the final focus on capital management.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just finally, any updates in terms of how on kind of the repricing kind of the environment for getting rate increases through on long-term care?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes. In essence, for the last couple of quarters, I think we've been saying that we believe the environment is getting better for rate increases. We've had great success with our last round of rate increases. We are above kind of our planned level that we had built into our reserves. Previously, and one of the things that's happened, actually, is that there's been some movement at the NAIC, particularly at states that have awarded rate increases, understanding the inequity of them awarding rate increases where other states haven't. And there's been -- begun to have some internal pressure among regulators to have a more consistent approach to rate increases, and we think that's been a very positive development. We're very optimistic about the next round of rate increases that we're working diligently to get out there that we will continue to have good success.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Suneet Kamath with UBS.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of follow-ups on UPIL. Rick, in your prepared comments, you said that part of your decision to bring it onshore was that it was not producing the desired benefit that you were looking for when you originally set it up. Can you just talk a little bit about what you had expected it to do and why it wasn't producing what you thought it would?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure, Suneet. I'll take a shot at that. I think that in my comments, I also mentioned it was up in 1996. So I don't have a good insight in terms of those details. But when you look at it, where it is today and the environment that we're in today, there is benefit there in a sense, but I think from the way we look at it, as Tom mentioned, the quality of capital, the structure, the simplicity of the structure of the company, those benefits are outweighed by the simplicity that we can have by having it onshore, whether it's similar reserving and capital process we have for the line. So I think that's when we get to it. It's not dollars and cents benefit. I think it's much more about it had outlived its usefulness as a structure.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess as we think about your capital generation model, the slides that you typically show us excluded, I believe, UPIL because it was just the Unum US businesses. So I'm assuming that once you bring it onshore, we're going to have to roll in what is now UPIL into that capital generation model. And I think on a year-to-date basis, UPIL is losing maybe $30 million, $40 million of statutory earnings. So my question is, am I right in terms of rolling it in? And how should we think about the impact on that capital generation going forward once it's brought onshore?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. I think we're getting a little bit out there, which is some of things we'll probably talk to you about at Investor Day. But I think that when you think about the consolidation of it, one, the UPIL results have a lot of factors that go into it. It is a reinsurance entity. So there's a lot of timing differentials, different treatments of how investment income, capital gains and losses are treated. So there's more noise in there than it would be actually onshore. If you think about that loss, I think you would be looking at $30 million relative to the overall capital generation, which has been $500 million year to date, it's somewhat immaterial. So I probably won't focus on that too much. But we'll give you better insight to that as we get to Investor Day.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then my last question on this was I just want to follow up on Erik Bass's question because I think where he was going was to try to understand how this change might impact your prior discussion of statutory reserves on long-term care. So If I go back to last quarter's call, I think you had originally talked about sort of a 3- to 5-year time frame before you need to take a charge with a starting point of 2011. I think you said with the improvement in rates, maybe we're closer to the 4-year time frame. So I guess my question following up on Erik's question was, does this decision alter that guidance from a timing perspective or from a order of magnitude perspective? And I think you've talked about a $250 million after-tax kind of charge. So I know you said this is your decision to do, but how does that affect the prior guidance? Can we still rely on that? Or is that something we'll have to address?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, certainly, Suneet. And let me clarify, we've never talked about a $250 million charge related to anything and certainly aren't going to talk about that. What you're talking about is GAAP concept, so when you look at the reserves that we've talked about in the past and what we're evaluating is purely GAAP. It's had 0 impact in terms of our GAAP processes. This is purely a structure, a capital structure, a statutory structure that we're dealing with here. So those 2 are not correlated things in terms of one impacting the other. They're very different things. And I said in my comments, to be very clear, this has no impact on U.S. GAAP, the structuring that we're doing here.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes, okay. All right, I'll follow up. I mean, I thought that now that GAAP and stat LTC reserves were kind of the same number, that changes in one would probably drive changes in the other. And I guess that's -- what you're saying is it's not the case.", "Richard P. McKenney", "That's not the case. I think the buildup on the reserve basis and how they move can be very different and have been very different. And so I think that was more of a guidepost to say where they were as opposed to one change will drive another change. That's not the case.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Maybe one other attempt at the Bermuda restructuring and then the capital deployment question. So if I hear you correctly, cash generation is tracking a little higher than you estimated at the beginning of the year and yet guidance for share deployment has come down a little bit. So would it be fair to assume that, that gap of, call it, maybe $150 million is roughly what you expect to invest in, as you think of redomesticating that business unit or that subsidiary?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. Well, let me say I appreciate you trying to work backwards into details. But until we actually get to the year end, we still have more details to work through. We'll give you a lot of those movements as we get there. But when you think about capital generation and deployment, I want to reiterate capital generation has been quite good, and we've been very active deploying capital, including, I don't want to lose the fact we bought back $75 million in the quarter and I also mentioned in my comments we expect to probably buy back shares in the fourth quarter as well, depending on all the factors, including whereas we mentioned last quarter where the price is, what's going on overall in the company, we will buying back shares in the fourth quarter. So when you get through all those different pieces, we'll give you what we're doing as part of Bermuda structure and we'll also give you a view in terms of where we are from a capital deployment perspective, both generation-wise and what we expect to put back through multiple channels.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. I guess I'll just have to be patient one more month. And then if we switch over to sales for a minute, if I understood the comment to Erik, it was that there was some uptick in the focus for management teams on benefit purchasing in the second half of the year. Do you think that's a temporary issue? Or maybe are we now past the most severe pressure period that we saw kind of in the first half of the year?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Mike, why don't you take one, please?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, sure, happy to do it. So I'd say we did see a little bit of that particularly in the over-50 life market where you think about employers having a few more resources to be able to sort through decisions on multiple fronts. So we see that abate just a bit. I do expect that with things like the employer mandate being pushed out a year, that in the coming quarter and in actually, frankly, the next few quarters, we'll continue to have to swim upstream a bit as employers and their broker advisors help them sort through their ultimate health care decisions. That being said, what I would say is what's coming out of those health care decisions continues to be a couple of important things for us, one, the employer remaining very engaged in the overall benefits process and the other being a constant push towards a more consumer-driven benefits with more employee engagement, and that's the trend that we started to see 6 or 7 years ago that's been the basis of most of the investments we've made in our capabilities is this idea of choice products enrollment, education and communication. So even as I think we're going to continue to see some short-term headwinds, it plays into a longer trend that I think we're very well positioned, both actually the Unum and the Colonial Life brands here in the U.S.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Maybe one last crack at the Bermuda situation. If I just look at it, nothing economically is changing. The risk is the same, kind of how you have to fund it, really doesn't change that much other than maybe just some cosmetic impacts of capital and reserving, et cetera. But just in that context, should we be thinking about maybe some easing of kind of holding company cash positions or even RBC down the road? Or should we be thinking about historical levels of margins, above margins that we've been talking about?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, certainly. I'd like to take that one on, Mark, in terms of how we're thinking about this longer term, because I think that when you evaluate this structure and as we talk about simplification that we'll get is bringing this back onshore, it does get better clarity in terms of the different pieces that we have out there, the cash that we will hold at the holding company, throw into that as well the credit facility that we just put on, as well as our RBC levels. So all those come into play. And as we look forward and I think having that clarity and taking you through that is actually going to be helpful as we get out into 2014 and beyond.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So no real clarity at this stage on whether we can assume reductions or changes in how you've been thinking about it?", "Richard P. McKenney", "No, not even over the structure and I think that's more of an outlook-type conversation that we'll have in December.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. You should have some clarity, I think, on January 1 renewals. So I'm just curious in the light of maybe the prior conversation about kind of how employers are looking at the situation, are you seeing anything that fundamentally changes your outlook on what persistency is going to look like as you head into 2014?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Mike, I think it's directed to you.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, sure. Thanks, Mark. We do have a pretty good line of sight, particularly towards the larger end of the market where employers are making decisions with a bit more lead time for implementation. And I think, on balance, actually feeling pretty good. As you know, we've been consistently, over the last couple of years, looking to modest rate increases in the 5 to 8 sort of mid- to high-single-digit ranges. We're having good success with that placement. Persistency is tracking well within our expectations going in. So feel very good about that. That's sort of the flip side of the malaise of health care reform, is when employees are sorting through health care decisions, it does add to the stickiness of existing programs, so it helps facilitate, I think, a pretty successful renewal approach here.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So I guess just maybe pushing on that a little bit, if I think about what this line might look like when we get to Q1 '14 earnings, you've been kind of trending in the high 80s percentile. Based on what you know today, you're not seeing anything that would fundamentally alter that to the downside?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "In terms of persistency?", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Correct.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, but I think that's reasonable fit. I mean, there's still a lot of work to be done in our core markets, that's a big business for us, so we've got our heads down, working closely with brokers and with clients. Service levels are very strong for us right now, that usually correlates pretty well with strong persistency. So we're optimistic, but also want to be clear that we've got real work to do in placing January renewals yet to go.", "A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then just one final quick question, U.K. persistency on group life kind of been 65%. Looks like if I average the second quarter and the first quarter, you're kind of a net level for the second quarter as well. I know you're going through a pretty exhaustive group life repricing process. Does that get better from here? How do we see that persistency level playing out? Because interestingly, you actually had better sales in group life in the U.K. as well.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes, I was thinking of Peter. Maybe you just step back a little bit, too, and just remind everyone what your renewal program and repricing program is, what you're undertaking actually at this point. And to Mark's last question, to where you're seeing the sales before we get into the persistency.", "Peter G. O'donnell", "Yes, thanks, Tom. And so let's just take the sales, first of all. So just taking the group life sales, it's actually come through to selling to -- basically expanding coverage with group life schemes. So basically, we've been [indiscernible] in keeping, say, the order enrollment, which is a pension change in the U.K., means that more people are taking up pensions. We're seeing an uptick in group life sales off the back of that. So pretty comfortable about the profitability of the new business arising on the group life schemes, the new stuff coming in. So which business does remain competitive? So we haven't been successful in the large case markets. I think that's going to continue for a little while. We're waiting for some of our competitors to digest that business. And that indigestion problem, perhaps that will come back at a more amenable economic return from our perspective, but that will take a while to go through the system. In terms of renewals, thanks, Tom, what we're doing there is we're putting double-digit rate through the book. And so that is either getting the rate through, so we're repricing that to our appropriate hurdle returns or we are losing, particularly at the large end, some pretty large schemes. Again, to our view, it's a pretty rational pricing in general that's taking us. But our intention really is to come out of this with a smaller group life book but a more profitable group life book. So that will be the intention. I think the persistency you're seeing at the moment will continue this year, and we'll see a bit of an uptick next year because we've got through more of the books. So it's going to remain at lower ends of the long-term range through 2014 as well.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar at JPMorgan.", "Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "On the buybacks, remember beginning of the year, you had mentioned something around a $500 million number, and you bought back a decent amount of stock but still lower than what you had expected at the beginning of the year. So just wondering if you could talk about what's changed since then, is it the higher stock price or is it other things that are dissuading you from buying back stock? Because your stat income's been fairly healthy. And then secondly, on U.K. margins, they've been pretty stable the last few quarters. What the drive -- how much of that is just better pricing and loss trends versus the benefit of the reinsurance transaction? And also, what your expectations are for renewing the reinsurance contract next year?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, do you want to start with the stock repurchase?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, certainly. Let me give you a little bit of a different angle on it, Jimmy, too. When you go back to the beginning of the year and you look at our capital generation model, which has actually been intact for the last several years, we talked about good steady capital generation and redeploying that in multiple means. So it's putting it back into our business. It's actually looking to acquire, which we haven't talked too much about but that's certainly a place where we'd like to deploy capital, raising our dividend, which we've been doing very consistently and then share buyback. We've talked about $500 million of capital generation. And I think given other choices and particularly given where our stock price was, going back even earlier in the year, share repurchase was a perfectly sensical thing to do at quite good volumes. As we've gotten through the year, we've seen other opportunities to use that capital to be redeployed wisely, whether that's retiring some of our debt, whether that's solidifying the pension, whether that's continuing to buy back shares. So we say when we're dissuaded from capital, I think we've just had other choices that we can choose to put that capital to work. Good choices, good for the overall company, good for our balance sheet, and we'll continue to do that. So I think that share price played into that. I think Tom talked about that last quarter pretty extensively, but there are other uses of that capital that we certainly will put to work. So we don't feel dissuaded about share repurchase. I'd remind you, $75 million that we bought back this quarter is 1% of our outstanding, so they're meaningful numbers that we continue to buy, and we'll always continue to do that in the future.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And Rick, if I could add to what you just said, I don't think any of our -- the way we think about the options that are available to us have changed at all actually. Those are the same options that have been in place actually since we began the aggressive share buyback program 5 or 6 years ago, over which time we've purchased over 25% of our shares. So those options are the same. It's always looking at relative value of each of those choices. And as you can see, we sort of rebalanced a little bit those priorities over the course of time just based on prices and other considerations. But those options are still the same. So no change there. As Rick said, we'll certainly provide a little more feedback on the upcoming investor meeting. Jimmy, as it relates to your U.K. question, Peter, you want to touch on that in terms of just not the margins but a little bit of the recent experience and then how that affects both margins but also some of your thinking about reinsurance?", "Peter G. O'donnell", "Yes. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Jimmy. So in terms of the group life book, we're getting through the renewal program. So you are seeing the benefit of some of the repricing and some of the shedding of the less profitable schemes, so definitely some of that coming through. There are 2 aspects to the reinsurance. One is the retention level, which we brought down. So any claim, we brought down to taking it from GBP 1 million per claim to GBP 0.5 million. That's been very helpful during quarter 3. We saw a number of large claims come through, which the reinsurer took their share of. So that's helped manage the volatility and made the margins more stable. There's also an element, which is the quota share, which is whilst we're repricing the book, what we found in the marketplace, the reinsurers were -- their appetite for this and what the returns they want to put on was competitive relative to what where we thought the book was priced. As we took advantage out in 2013, we're currently going through the renewal program in 2014. And looking at that, I'd expect to retain a bit more but we'll probably sell some of the quota share in place for 2014 given what we're seeing on quotes at the moment.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "While I understand your desire, and you've made it clear that you're not going to get into the details of this movement of the Bermuda operation back to the United States, one thing to me seems apparent and I just want to check whether you agree that this is apparent, because Bermuda accounting is essentially the same as U.S. GAAP accounting, and because U.S. GAAP accounting tends to be more generous, aggressive than statutory accounting, doesn't it stand to reason we don't need to get into any discussion, I don't think, that the statutory reserves that you will be establishing in the United States will be higher than the effectively GAAP reserves that you have established in Bermuda? And that rather than -- and that therefore there's going to be some sort of hit to your statutory capital in the United States on a sort of -- on an enterprise-wide basis? You will have less statutory capital and more reserves than would have been the case if you didn't make this move, given the difference, given the more conservative accounting in the United States than in Bermuda. Isn't -- doesn't that stand to reason? Isn't that obvious?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Right. Yes, Eric, if I could -- I won't repeat everything you just said, but I would say what you say very much holds true and I think that's why when we talk about the structure, we say that we take you back to where we were in the ranges of our capital outlook. But everything you say is true and logical and we'll take you through how that impacts us and the magnitude of those when we get there. But I'll just take you back to the answer, is that we'll be in line similar to our reserving and capital processes we have with other companies in the U.S. and we will also be within the range of the capital outlook we put out there while still having the ability to buy stock.", "Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. My second and final question is -- could be directed to Jack or whomever feels it's -- that it's appropriate for that person to answer it. It has to do with long-term care. Because Unum has stopped writing new business, both on the group side and the individual side, I would think that you would be disadvantaged vis-\u00e0-vis regulators in the sense that I would think regulators would say, \"Well, these Unum guys, they sold the business. They did their best to get the pricing correct. It's underpriced, but it's not our problem.\" And you don't have a lot of leverage because you can't threaten to quit the business because you already have stopped writing new business. Why isn't that the case? Why have you been -- I'm a little surprised to describe -- that you described your repricing results as excellent because, again, I would think regulators say, \"These are old people. Unum made a mistake. That's his problem, not our problem.\" I would think that's how the discussion would go. Why hasn't it gone like that?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Jack?", "John F. McGarry", "It hasn't gone like that because we actually have the results in our repricing efforts. Again, we're ahead of plan in our actual approval. I think there's lots of reasons. I think that the flip side of that is some regulators are saying, look, you can make it up on new business pricing, but we're giving you the rate that you want on new business and are using that as an excuse not to approve rate increases on the old business. So that goes in both directions. We have not found that being in the closed block status has affected our ability to get rate increases. I think regulators understand that if you are in a closed block status, rate increases is your only option and they are aware of that and empathetic to it.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Conversely, too, Eric, just from a company point of view, I'd say, Jack, actually the fact that we don't have existing customers we're trying to sell business to or brokers we're trying to sell through actually makes it a lot cleaner as a decision actually as a company. Because we actually don't -- we can actually be very specific to experience and allow the rates to just fall out of the experience as opposed to thinking about the fact that we're also trying to sell new business at the same time.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Mostly asked and answered. Just quickly, maybe I missed this, where is the company? Where is the U.K. in terms of repricing the group life business? What percentage of the book has been repriced?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, Peter, do you want to just touch on that briefly?", "Peter G. O'donnell", "Yes. So briefly, we're about 3/4 of the way through. So we'll be finished at about midway through 2014.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Robert Glasspiegel with Janney Capital Markets.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Quick question. Your RBC ratio looks like it's projected to be about 12 bps below where it finished in the third quarter at year end, if you take the middle of the range. Does that factor in the Bermuda impact? Or are there some other moving parts and dividends that are driving that decline?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, Bob, just to give you a sense, that range has been consistent all along, so that doesn't give you a different view that we expect it to come down or move up. And I take you back to the different structuring pieces we've been talking about a fair bit on the call in terms of there will be movement and changes relative to that, but we expect to still be in that range on the overall.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Just hammering Mark's. Mark said he was the last question on Bermuda. I guess I'm going to be the last question potentially. The Bermuda transaction, did that at all impact the buyback? You mentioned pension and bonds and stock price as [ph] other use. Was that at all a factor in keeping a little bit more capital?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I think when we look at it in terms of the very good capital generation we've had, there's a use of capital that we've talked about with Bermuda without being too specific, but I think that that's fair that, that will be a use of our very good capital generation that we had this year, and we'll get more specific in terms of what that looks like in December.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So on the margin, it could have been a consideration of buyback?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. No, I think it's very much a consideration on buyback.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jeff Schuman with KBW Investment Research.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I want to go to the U.K. first. The business has been resized a bit. Premiums, local currency are down, I think, 18% year-to-date. Is there any slight benefit in terms of being able to maybe execute a bit of capital in the U.K. given that it's now smaller?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Yes. Rick, do you want to touch on that?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. Certainly, Jeff. When you look at the U.K., that reduction in premium has been fairly from the quota share reinsurance that Peter mentioned in his comments, so that's kind of a onetime transaction. So we did it on a very short basis, so it was actually out there over a year. So it's something that -- we did free up capital as a result of that, but we didn't repatriate that capital at the moment. Our U.K. business, we don't talk often about the U.K. capital generation. It's been very consistent, very steady, very similar cash flow characteristics that we have in the U.S. and they've been very consistent in their dividend payments that have been upstreamed. We just didn't remove the excess capital that's created there because we wanted to have the flexibility to adjust that reinsurance structure at the end of this year and 2014.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And I know Glasspiegel declared an end to the Bermuda questions, but I don't think I'm going to yield to his authority on that. So I was wondering -- one sort of basic question. If part of the goal here is simplification, is one of the options to do -- maybe to do the ultimate simplification and just actually recapture the reinsurance? Or are there some basic reasons why you actually need to have another entity?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Go, Rick.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, Jeff, it's a great question. I think when we look at evaluating our Bermuda entity, and it's one of the reasons we talk about this, it's been a structure that's been in place for quite some time, just a pure recapture is not a simple exercise to go through, so it is an option out there. It's not one that we preclude. We still could get to that point in the future, but I think that we won't be doing that as part of this step because of some of the complexities that are built into the structure. But in the future, that very much could be an option. And I think the important part about that, too, is because it will be on a similar basis with our other U.S. businesses, that would be, from a financial perspective, basically a nonevent.", "Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, I know this is a fairly basic question here. Obviously, you're looking at different options, but is it reasonable for us to assume that many of these options might involve some third-party participation? Whether it's third-party reinsurance, letters of credit, third-party other financing, is that a reasonable assumption?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I think that I'd highlight it a little bit different. Those are obviously options to us. This will not look so much like structures you've seen around the industry, so that have different letters of credit and financing. It's going to look pretty basic like a captive reinsurance. And quite honestly, Bermuda today looks like a very basic reinsurance company. So I don't think we'll look like many of the other structures that you've seen out there.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sean Dargan with Macquarie.", "Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research", "Just following up on Jeff's question about why you aren't recapturing. I think there's going to be continued noise around the use of cap. There's just something on the Freakonomics blog yesterday about shadow insurance. Is there anything changing your thinking about your use of the South Carolina and Vermont onshore captives?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, well, I'll start with our South Carolina captive, which is our -- mainly our Tailwind reinsurance company. We did buy in the bonds from that. So from a structural perspective, that is now a simplified reinsurance structure we have in South Carolina. And then our Northwind transaction, which sits out there, is still performing very well and so we have no need to bring in the bonds that were issued on that in 2007. I think it's something straightforward, so no anticipation of changing that structure at all. And then also from a reserving perspective, that's reserved on a similar basis that we do in our all other U.S. entities as well. So I don't see much scrutiny there.", "Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And just one final question. There were some high-profile player groups who put large groups of their employees on private exchanges run by insurance brokers. I'm just wondering if you participated in that. And if you plan on doing so, Unum is not a household name among consumers. I'm just wondering what your competitive advantage is on a private exchange.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Mike, why don't you take that one from Sean.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, happy to. We mentioned it earlier, but exchange is very much a hot topic in the market. We very much see them as the latest manifestation of a long-term trend towards more employee-driven benefit. And so that really has been the thesis that our investments and capabilities have been based on. And so to your specific question, having made some pretty big investments in employee choice products and technology, people and process to sort of facilitate empowering employees has put the Unum and the Colonial Life brands in a really good spot in the marketplace. So as these private exchanges are coming on, actually, the demand for us to be involved has been pretty good, pretty consistent. It's resulted in us being connected into 40-plus different exchange mechanisms. And I think also importantly, it's allowed us to play in those -- on those exchanges where the employer remains very much involved. So to your specific question, where we've seen a lot of the activity on our front and in our product lines, the employer wants to stay involved. There is an element of funding that they're providing in many cases. So that actually positions us pretty well given a very strong brand amongst the brokerage and employer client community.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And if I could, Sean, just to add a little to what Mike said. I mean, the themes that you're seeing today in terms of more focus on consumer, as in giving people choices, didn't just start today or just didn't start as part of the Affordable Care Act or exchanges or the government website. This started a decade or so ago, moving from a defined benefit to a defined contribution environment. And frankly, we've realigned our resources and investments very much to participate in that. And if you look at our group business today, the vast majority of our group sales actually have some level of employee contribution. If you look at our voluntary benefit business, which is both Mike's and Randy's voluntary benefit business, the earned premium compound annual growth rate over the last 8 or 9 years is about 7%. A lot of that growth is, frankly, coming by providing GAAP products. Let's just use one example, high deductible health plans, I think has doubled between 2010 and 2013. That's presented great opportunities for our group hospital indemnity products, our accident products, our critical illness products, our medical bridge products. Just as Mike said, there's an awful lot there that we've already begun to see where there's a way to play very effectively there in that consumer theme. And again, you're right, our name may not be as widely known as some brands, but we're very effective in getting with the employers' cooperation in front of the right people with the right set of products, and the benefit communication tools we have actually help accelerate that. So as Mike said, we feel pretty good about the outlook here. And obviously, the health care reform and exchanges and other things are going to be a topic that we're going to have to deal with here in the next -- probably next year or so, but we're finding very effective pockets in there to grow and build with both of our 2 voluntary franchises.", "Operator", "We'll take our final question from Tom Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a question back on to beat the dead horse on Bermuda. How should I be thinking about what resources are available to you to fund it? And I realize you're not prepared to answer any questions to size it, but I know you mentioned the credit facility a few times. Is that something that might be used, U.K. capital? Or would it just be existing holdco cash current statutory surplus that would be used to fund that it and statutory surplus in the U.S. that is?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, Tom, that's a fair question. And I should highlight, the credit facility that we're highlighting here has nothing to do with the Bermuda process. We thought it was a good piece of structure to have in the company. So it's something we haven't had for a couple of years as we sat with high cash balances. But I wouldn't equate these 2 at all from that perspective. My U.K. comments around dividend there is just to remind people that it's a very, very strong high-margin operating enterprise. I'd take those 2 out of the discussion in terms of how we're looking at the process we're going through of making sure we're within the capital range of the outlook. So I take it back 2 points, which is holding company cash we're sitting on and then just statutory generation and capital that we have in our U.S. entities.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then the -- I guess, that entity has lost a little bit of money for the last few quarters. Is that -- when you recapture that, would you expect the earnings pattern to change there? Or are you still going to be using, in all likelihood, modified GAAP accounting because it'll be in the captive structure?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I'll try and answer that. It's a similar flavor to an earlier question, which is we have had some losses in that entity. If you look back over many periods of time, it's fluctuated a fair degree. Our reinsurance structures can be more volatile just by the nature of how the reinsurance treaties work. So I think that as we look forward, that's going to be woven into our overall capital view. And I think, Tom, you highlight a point, which is important, is as we've seen on this call, the Bermuda entity has caused a lot of questions. And quite honestly, we don't need to be answering those questions because it is a small piece of our structure. And then when we have it back onshore, the similar level of reserving capital or other onshore entities, we hope we won't be discussing those details in the future.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "To that point, I think, Rick, we want to get ahead of things. This has obviously been a focus of the industry and others within the industry and will continue to be. So I think by doing the steps and taking the actions that we, I think, begun to share with you today, we're getting ahead of those sorts of things. But do it from a position of strength because we do have the financial flexibility, and we do have the sufficient cash flow and the cash generation that, frankly, allow us to be in this kind of position. But I think as you just said, Rick, in your comments, we can do all that and not do it outside of the range that we provided in terms of capital guidance nor actually affect our ability to buy back shares in the quarter.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "No, I applaud you guys for doing that, too, from a transparency standpoint. And my last question just relatedly is, so the entity that will then be filed going forward, will we have full access? Will that be -- so that will be U.S.-domiciled entity that we can then have a full set of blue books that we can then evaluate?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. Tom, we haven't gotten to that point. So we'll have to evaluate a lot of different things here as we get to year end and all the details of that, which still have process steps to go through. We'll take -- hopefully, we'll have a better view of that at the Investor Day. But there's still a lot of work to do between now and then for our team.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thanks, Tom. And thanks, all of you, for taking the time to join us this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of you at our investor meeting in New York on December 16, and this completes our third quarter earnings call.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas White", "Great, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2014 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements.", "Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.

And now I'll turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter, and I think they were off to a strong start to the year. Operating earnings per share, which excludes realized investment gains and losses, as well as certain pension costs, increased 8.8% to $0.87 per share, which is consistent with our 2014 outlook for operating earnings per share growth of 5% to 10%. Our growth rate this quarter was more balanced than it's been in a while, with our after-tax operating earnings increasing 4.7%, the highest rate of growth since 2011.", "Once again, we have been able to augment our operating performance through capital management actions, which I'll touch on in a moment. Importantly, too, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, which I continue to believe is a strong measure of enterprise value, increased 9.2% year-over-year to $33.01.", "Now let me touch on a few specific highlights before turning things over to Rick. First, we continue to generate strong consistent operating results within our ongoing businesses with all 3, Unum US, Colonial Life and Unum UK generating higher year-over-year operating earnings. Unum US results continue to be driven by favorable risk results, reflecting our focus on disciplined underwriting, pricing and risk selection. Colonial Life delivered a very strong quarter with favorable risk result and strong premium growth. And finally, Unum UK continued to show solid year-over-year margin improvement, driven in large part by our actions to improve profitability in our group life line of business. Overall, our core ongoing business segments are generating consistent, solid margins with an operating return on equity of 14.8% for the quarter, which is towards the upper end of the outlook we provided for 2014.", "Secondly, the results of our Closed Block were again within our expectations this quarter. The loss ratio in the long-term care line improved relative to recent trends, continuing in -- at the lower end of the range of our expectations. This still remains a challenging business, but I am very encouraged by the actions that our team is taking to manage these blocks of business.", "Third, we continue to speak stronger sales growth in both of our U.S. operations this quarter and good growth in the Unum UK in our flagship group disability product line. In Unum US, total sales increased by 7.2%, with particularly strong results in our small and midsized employer markets, which are employers with under 2,000 lives, where group benefit sales grew by 16.5% over last year and our voluntary sales grew by 9%. We also, again, saw strong sales results in our Colonial Life operation. We're driven by strength in our commercial market business. Total sales increased 6.5% in the first quarter.", "Lastly, while our Unum UK sales were generally flat in local currency this quarter, group disability sales increased 6% in the quarter. Group life sales comparisons will remain challenging, as we continue to take aggressive pricing actions in a very competitive market.", "Moving next to investments. While the credit quality of the investment portfolio remains in very good shape, we continue to be challenged by today's low interest rates and tight corporate bond spreads. Frankly, these pressures increase in the first quarter and pose challenges for us and our industry. We are, however, maintaining our investment quality standards and are continuing to adjust prices in those products that are most interest rate sensitive. We are hesitant to invest fully in this environment; and as a result, we hold higher-than-normal cash balances, which is having a negative impact on our net investment income. You saw that in our Unum US and Closed Block segments this quarter.", "And finally, our capital position remains quite strong and continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility. Our risk-based capital position was approximately 400% in the first quarter, and our holding company liquidity position stood at $822 million, which includes the proceeds from our recently completed debt offering. We repurchased $100 million of stock in the quarter, and that's now 15 of the last 16 quarters that we have repurchased shares, totaling approximately $1.9 billion over this period.", "As you know, dividend actions are also an important part of our capital management strategy and has been the practice in the past. Our Board of Directors will review our dividend policy at the upcoming May meeting. I expect you'll see another increase at that time. Over the past 5 years, we have increased our dividend by 93% or about 14% per year.", "So in summary, the first quarter was a good solid start to the year. I'm encouraged by our stronger level of operating earnings growth, which, combined with our share repurchase activities, resulted in strong per-share growth in operating earnings and book value. Additionally, the combination of strong persistency and good sales growth has allowed us to generate modest but profitable top line growth.", "Lastly, our capital position remains very healthy, giving us the ability to invest in our business and markets while also returning capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividend increases.", "Now I'll turn things over to Rick for a review of our operating results. Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Thank you, Tom. Our first quarter results were solid, as we reported operating earnings per share of $0.87, up almost 9% from last year. We saw good underlying growth in our after-tax operating earnings, which accounted for roughly half of that growth with the balance coming through our ongoing capital management. We will continue to focus on driving growth in operating earnings, and our first quarter performance was the best quarter we've seen in the past 2 years.", "Looking first at Unum US, operating earnings increased 1.3% year-over-year, driven by favorable experience in the group life and AD&D line and the supplemental and voluntary lines. Group life and AD&D produced another strong quarter with $59.8 million in operating income, up 3.3% on stable risk experience and premium growth of just over 2%.", "Our supplemental and voluntary line reported operating income of $82.5 million for the first quarter, up 14% from a year-ago quarter, as our voluntary benefits experience stabilized from the higher lapses we saw in the year-ago quarter.", "Operating income in our group disability business declined to $68.5 million from $77.9 million a year ago, driven primarily by lower levels of miscellaneous net investment income and some pressure on net investment income from holding higher-than-normal cash balances in the quarter. I'd also remind you that we recorded a $4 million gain on debt ex [ph] last year's first quarter.", "Importantly, risk results in group disability remained quite strong, with a benefit ratio declining to 83% this quarter from 84.3% a year ago, as the underlying experience showed stable to lower overall claim incidence and continued favorable claim recovery performance, familiar themes for this line for the past several quarters.", "Looking forward, we expect a slightly higher level of earnings from group disability, with some incremental improvements in the benefit ratio, offset by some ongoing pressure from net investment income, given the lower-rate environment. We expect our margins in this line to remain strong, consistent with what we've delivered over the past several quarters. Overall, it was a solid quarter for the Unum US segment as return on equity was 13.4%.", "Moving to Unum UK. Operating earnings were GBP 22 million for the first quarter, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2013 and generally consistent with our fourth quarter earnings. We continue to make good progress in improving the profitability of our U.K. business, particularly with the repricing and repositioning of the group life business.", "The operating ROE for the U.K. has improved to about 18% for the quarter. In the first quarter, the Unum UK benefit ratio was 70.1%, which is slightly higher than a year ago but down from the fourth quarter. We continue to see improved performance in our group life line of business, while risk experience was a little bit weaker in our group disability line, reflecting higher claim incidence. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress Peter and his team have made in the U.K.", "Colonial Life generated a very strong quarter at $79.4 million compared to $75.4 million a year ago, one of the strongest quarters in its history. We saw favorable risk experience across all of its business lines, producing a benefit ratio of 50.5% compared to 52.5% a year ago. The underlying profitability of this business continues to be excellent with an operating ROE of 18% for the quarter.", "Rounding out the enterprise, the Closed Block also had a strong first quarter, with operating income of $29.1 million at the high end of our range of expectations for this segment. The interest-adjusted benefit ratio for the LTC line improved relative to our recent experience at 84.7%, primarily reflecting an improvement in claim incidence. We generally expect the LTC interest-adjusted benefit ratio to be in the range of 85% to 90%, so this quarter's experience was slightly under that. The interest-adjusted benefit ratio for the Closed Disability Block was consistent with a year ago at 81.5%.", "Looking at our sales and growth trends across the company, the positive sales momentum that emerged in the second half of 2013, following the slower half of last year, continued to build in the first quarter. And we're quite pleased with the sales results in our operations.", "In Unum US, total sales increased by 7.2% in the quarter, with solid contributions across our various product lines and market segments. Within our group benefits lines, LTD, STD and group life, total sales increased by 12.1%, with a 16.5% growth in the core market and 5% in the large-case market. Additionally, our voluntary benefit sales increased by about 5%, with particularly good results in the core market segment where we were up 9%.", "We continue to be encouraged as we look to the second quarter. And in addition to good sales, persistency for our Unum US employee benefits line ticked up to 89% for the quarter compared to just under 88% for the full year 2013. So bringing it all together, overall premium growth for Unum US was up 1.1% for the quarter, well within our outlook range of 0 to 2% for the full year.", "In the U.K., sales were down slightly at GBP 10.4 million for the quarter. We produced growth in the disability line of 5.7%, but the overall decline was driven by our group life line of business where we continue to be careful on pricing.", "Persistency in the U.K. improved over last year. However, persistency in the group life line continues to reflect the pricing actions we are continuing to implement. Premium income was also lower than last year's first quarter due to lapses resulting from our repricing of the life block.", "Finally, at Colonial Life, we saw a very good sales for the quarter, an increase of 6.5% with positive contributions from both new accounts and existing accounts. We also saw a very strong trends with re-enrollments in some of our larger account cases. Persistency was slightly lower relative to the first quarter of 2013, but premium income increased by 3%, which is consistent with our expectation of 2% to 4% for Colonial Life. Overall, we're quite pleased with the growth trend lines that we see in the company.", "Now moving to the investment portfolio. The credit quality of our portfolio remains in excellent shape, and the launch list of potential problems continues to be quite low. The decline in interest rates and the spread compression made for a challenging investment environment again in the first quarter. We saw A 10-year bond dropped by 36 basis points. At times like this, we will sometimes hold cash balances for our product portfolios at higher-than-normal levels, as we look for better opportunities to put the money to work. The net effect is some near-term pressure on investment income relative to our expectations, and we felt that across a number of our business lines. This would be similar to what we have seen a year ago, and our team will continue to remain disciplined in good asset selection.", "Moving to an update on capital management. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies was approximately 400%, and our holding company cash and marketable securities was $822 million at quarter end. Our statutory operating earnings of $130 million continues to be within our range of expectations, though it was on the lower side of what we have been experiencing. Statutory results can tend to be a little bit more volatile.", "During the quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate, tight corporate bond spread environment and did issue $350 million of 10-year notes at a 4% coupon. We are in the process of redeeming roughly half of the debt we have maturing in 2015. Total amount maturing next year is 279 -- $297 million at a 6.85% coupon. As a result, for the second quarter, we will be reporting debt extinguishment costs and a currency hedge gain related to the debt, and those numbers will net close to 0.", "We continue to buy back our shares with some of the capital we're generating, and the first quarter was a more active quarter for share purchases relative to the end of last year. Share buybacks totaled $100 million and keeps us on track for our $300 million to $600 million range for the full year. I would also affirm that our 2014 outlook for growth in operating earnings per share remains in the range of 5% to 10%. In fact, most of the first quarter trends we experienced were in line with our 2014 outlook for sales, premium growth and our ROE expectations; and I would say it was a good start to the year.", "Now I'll turn it back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. Before we move to your questions, I'll close by Rick reiterating how pleased we are with our start to 2014. Our focus remains on continuing to profitably grow our business through disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management, along with a clear need to maintain sound risk management in managing our investments and capital. We expect to continue to generate capital; and as we have done in the past, balance the deployment of that capital with the needs of the business, opportunities we see in the marketplace and returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend actions. This will complete our prepared remarks. And operator, let's move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Suneet Kamath with UBS.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just for Rick first, just to start off with long-term care, can you just give us an update in terms of how you're thinking about the guidance you've given us in the past around a potential reserve build? Obviously, there have been a number of moving pieces, UPILs come onshore, underwriting score was a little bit better, but interest rates are a little bit lower. So if we kind of put it all in the mix, how are you thinking about that original guidance that you gave us?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. Suneet, let me take you back actually a couple of years, and I don't think it's changed dramatically. As we look at our long-term care assumptions, these are long-term assumptions, we will see those change over as we look through time. If I were to highlight a couple of things that we continue to look at is one of the underlying experience that we see, you would've seen we actually had a good first quarter. That is one data point, but it -- it's certainly good to see that as we've seen volatility in the line. As you mentioned, the -- on the interest rate side, we are in a difficult investing environment. But as we come up of the year end, I would say that it's not dramatically different than what we've seen here over the last several years. And as we look out to the range, it's something that we have to evaluate as part of the overall mix in terms of our ability to invest those cash flows that we'll receive as part of the long-term care and the management of that. I think the big thing that we continue to work hard on, and Jack continues to work with his team, is on the pricing front. And maybe I'll turn it over to Jack to talk about the progress we're making on that front. Jack?", "John F. McGarry", "Thanks, Rick. We're really pleased with where -- the progress we're making on rate increases. We've exceeded what was built into the initial gross premium valuation reserve for rate increases. So far, we're continuing to file for additional rate increases. We're continuing to seek good success in getting additional approvals. And actually, I think the environment for rate increases has continued to improve somewhat within the state regulatory environment.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Any sense in terms of order of magnitude of how much better you're doing on the price increases versus what you thought?", "John F. McGarry", "I mean, it's in the 5% to 10% range.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. Okay. And then I guess for Rick, just to follow up on this, as we think about still that potential reserve build hanging out there at some point, is it fair to say that, given the capital contribution you made when you brought UPIL onshore on a statutory basis, that you've kind of handled what we might have otherwise seen as a statutory reserve build at the time that you take potential GAAP charge? Is that the right way to think about it?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Certainly, when you look to last year and the work that we did about bringing our UPIL business back onshore, as part of that restructuring, actually, statutory reserves were increased. So we've talked in the past about stat to GAAP differentials and how those were close to each other as we went back a couple of years, and our stat reserves have increased as part of that process. So there is some room there between our statutory reserves and our GAAP reserves, as we look out to the future.", "Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Right. And just a final question on this topic, so if there's a GAAP event that happens at some point, '15, '16, whenever it is, we should -- should we think about that as sort of a noncash sort of event since, perhaps, it might not be a statutory impact and thus potentially no impact on your capital management targets?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Well, I think I'd just repeat what I just told you that there is a differential between those 2 to project out that far in how things would play out. I don't think it's something that we want to do today. But I think the actions that we took at last year end to bring that back onshore were good proactive strong actions, and we'll continue to manage the block that way. And it's hard to isolate any one thing.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A couple more general, sales were very strong, and surprising -- I was wondering if you could put that in the context of maybe new accounts, new clients versus payroll.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. Mike, do you want to get started with the Unum US business? And then maybe, Randy, ask you to speak as well actually on that.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Sure, thanks. Yes, we've seen a good rebound, and I think Rick alluded to it earlier, but we saw health care reform and ACA implementations slow things down a year ago. So the first half, it was slow as employers and their advisors were sorting through the changes. We saw proposal activity down really across our market segment and sales declines in the third quarter. That started to abate a bit. We saw a little bit of growth in the fourth quarter. And so I'd see first quarter result as the next step on that continuum being up about 7%. Encouraging for us, we continue to see strong growth out of existing clients. So over 60% of our new sales, from a Unum perspective, came from those existing relationships. That's very important to us because we know those sales actually drive greater stickiness. It's a contributing factor to why I think persistency continues to tick up a bit. It also comes in favorably priced and with a slightly lower acquisition cost. So existing clients remain a really key growth opportunity for us. I would say, and maybe I'll turn it over to Randy with this, while in the mid and larger ends of the markets, we're seeing that increase in proposal activity continue at then a very small end of the market, say, under 50 life employers. There's still a fair degree of sorting out going on the health insurance side, so it's still a little bit sticky there.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And Randy, before you chime in, I just -- maybe Mike, I think it's worth saying, too, that the growth you saw in the first quarter really did not come from natural growth. We weren't seeing an emergence of that as a contributor to growth per se yet.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes. We think about -- when we think about the earned premium lines, Tom, that's right. We're seeing basically a flat level of natural growth. So the growth we see in premium from new employees being added or rate increases driving premium increases, it's really -- our growth is coming from new lines of coverage sold, new clients coming in and plan design changes and the like.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Randy, do you want to add to that?", "Randall C. Horn", "Yes. You bet, Tom. Yes, we saw good sales growth for both new accounts and existing accounts. As Mike said, there's still some ongoing pressure in that real small end of the market, under 50 employees. But -- so -- our number of new accounts was down a little bit in that segment. So on average, we were just writing larger cases. We are seeing good momentum, though, building. Things were kind of loosening up in that smaller end of the market, so we're optimistic with the trend lines we're seeing at the current time. But again, good solid numbers for both new accounts and existing accounts.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Randy, same for you, not really employment growth, but just offering more products to existing accounts?", "Randall C. Horn", "Yes, it's offering more products but just knocking on more doors, Steven, just getting them in. Our new rep count was up nicely in the first quarter. They're the ones writing a lot of the smaller new accounts, and we're seeing very good productivity from new reps so far here in 2014.", "Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. One more, Randy, for you, if I may. There was a -- there was an -- I think it was the Wall Street Journal, things are beginning to blur, but I think it was Wall Street Journal. There was an article with regards to changing definitions of cancer and maybe changing treatment. I don't know if you saw that or not. But if the definition of cancer was changed, would that affect your business?", "Randall C. Horn", "I did not see that specific article, Steven. But no, I don't think that would have a direct impact on us in terms of changing the definitions. I mean, I'd have to see specifically what you're talking about. But again, we sell purely indemnity products that lay out very specifically what we'll pay for certain types of treatments and diagnoses. I guess, if there was some broad-based change in the definition of what cancer is, it could have some impact on us. But I don't think it would be all that immediate. And of course, we'd have the opportunity to go in and change our product designs and our definitions, if that did take place.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "In the Colonial Life segment, the benefit ratio is under 52% for the first time in a while. Just wanted to get a sense of whether you feel that level of improvement, which is sort of at the low end of your range, is sustainable.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Randy, do you want to pick up on that?", "Randall C. Horn", "You bet. Yes, it was definitely in the lower end of our range. We had great results in all of our major product segments, very good mortality in the quarters, so everything just lined up very nicely for us. So that is lower than what we would anticipate for the balance of the year. Now our outlook is for stable benefit ratios. We feel really good about kind of that 51% to 53% range, so again, look for good stability there. But everything just lined up well for us in the first quarter, so a little bit on the low side there.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So Randy, as growth improves in Colonial Life, that will probably be a positive factor in the benefit ratio going forward, right?", "Randall C. Horn", "Absolutely, because you have better benefit ratios in that -- in those early durations of almost every product.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then switching gears to private exchanges, any update you can provide there in terms of the growth opportunity or product expansion potential, that would be helpful.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Sure. Why don't you, Mike, sort of pick that one up? And I think, Randy, you can add a little to it as well. But Mike?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Sure. Thanks, Tom. Certainly, activity and interest in exchanges continue to increase out there, but actual volumes of premium coming through on private exchanges is, it's pretty minimal to date. And really, we think about it regardless of the pace with the absolute level of adoption amongst employers. We're pretty well positioned, both Unum and the Colonial Life businesses. Being category leaders in each of these products is important, as intermediaries and technology firms create exchanges. They're coming to us. Our leadership in voluntary benefits has positioned us well and that we got over 40 connects into this technology companies, previously focused on benefit administration, now focused on private exchanges. So while it's early days, and I suspect it's going to play out, not over months or quarters, but over the next few years. We feel like we're well positioned. And I think the last comment I'd make before turning to Randy, in all of the exchanges in which we're participating, and in fact, in all that we've encountered in the market, for our lines of business, the carrier is selected by the employer. So I think, at times, there's a little bit of confusion out there as to whether individual employees are going to be choosing amongst different carriers for life insurance. But in fact, to get good spread of risk in the most efficient delivery, each of these exchanges is looking for the employer to select the carrier first. So our strong brand reputation with employers and with their advisors has played in the market traditionally and will play in these exchanges going forward. How about, Randy, if you have anything to add there.", "Randall C. Horn", "Yes. I guess, maybe Mike, the only thing I would add is in addition to the employer continuing to be involved in making account-specific decisions, the exchanges we're involved with today for a VB line of business, we would be the only carrier involved on that specific employer account for that selected VB line of coverage. So we're not -- it is -- it's not an open marketplace kind of situation where an employee would be selecting amongst several different VB carriers. We're also very focused on continuing to have our agency system involved, our benefit counselors involved on those accounts. So again, we are involved in a number of exchanges today. We're evaluating several others. Not seeing a lot of sales generally in the industry coming through private exchanges today, but we feel like we are very well positioned going forward, if that, in fact, does happen.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So we've been focusing on the sales in the U.S. for the first half of the Q&A. I want to switch gears maybe to the U.K. And I noticed that the large case market saw some improvement in sales after some pressure last year. I think that's also the market where the unit came into a little bit of a pressure in terms of underwriting results a couple of years ago. So maybe you could give us a little more color as to what's driving the sales growth there and what's different this time as opposed to kind of the 2010 there?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Peter, do you want to respond to that question?", "Peter G. O'donnell", "Yes. Great. Thanks very much for that. It's very different, I think. So as you know, we've seen sort of undertaking a renewal program across our book. What we are seeing is, in the group life area, where I think we were very competitive a few years ago in the group life market, that's where the life large cases where written around 2010. If you look at what we've written in group life, we're being very selective. We still see that market as very competitive. We wrote very little large schemes in the group life market. And it's a challenging market, we think, to make money in. Some of our competitors are writing cases there. But I'm taking some of our business, actually, on our persistency is a bit lower as well in that large case. So we're being selective in where we write that business and maintaining our discipline. Where we have seen success, though, is in our LTD market. We can compete very effectively with other carriers in that space. Our claims proposition is, in our view and in the brokers' view, more value for money in terms of what we do for the customers. And we can charge a bit of a premium for that claim service over and above the competition. And actually, our premium tends to be around 10% of the large end where the claim service works. And we've been successful in writing a number of large schemes in the first quarter versus the competition. And we've also been successful in bringing some new schemes to market in that space, where, particularly, the banks are looking at what the benefits are and offer. And now the economy recovers a little bit in the U.K., they're willing to invest a bit more in their employee base.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Got it. So it's mostly our financial institution banks granted?", "Peter G. O'donnell", "That's right. Yes.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then one more question, if I may. On the Closed Block, I saw that the individual disability premiums declined by quite a bit. And I was hoping maybe to get a little more color as to what was driving that decline.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Jack, do you want to take that one?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes. I mean, the decline is just a natural runoff of the book. That block has been closed for a long time, since the mid '90s. Those people are aging. Most people do not extend their coverage beyond age 65. So it's kind of like the baby boom retiring, if you will. So it's just naturally running off the books.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So that move, kind of maybe mid single-digit decline to low-teens, should be -- we should think of that maybe as the new run rate?", "John F. McGarry", "I mean, I think as the block ages, it's going to -- the decline is going to accelerate. So, yes, I would think that would be the -- I don't know whether this quarter is specifically the new run rate, but you should think about the run rate accelerating as the block ages.", "Richard P. McKenney", "But more in the mid single digits than the double digits.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Erik Bass with Citigroup.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "First question on expenses. Expenses have picked up across a number of segments the past few quarters. So I was just hoping you could talk about what's driving this and whether we should view it, your recent expenses, as a reasonable run rate going forward or if there's some one-off investments in there.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, sure, Erik. This is Rick. When you look at our expense base overall, as you would have seen over many years, we manage it very tightly. We think about it from an expense ratio, so relative to premiums, and manage that as well. Relative to last year, you would have seen a tick-up. But I would tell you it's basically we're right on our plans for this year. Included in those plans, include some investments that we continue to make in the company around technology, around brand and different things like that, but it's very much in line with our expectations overall. So I think what you saw this quarter is about a run rate that you should expect for the remainder of the year.", "Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. And then on long-term care, just curious, we saw the first noticeable reinsurance transaction this quarter with CNOs, Closed Block deal, but they didn't. I realize there are a number of significant differences between your block and theirs, but I'm curious whether you view this as a one-off transaction or does it suggest that a third-party market for long-term care risk might be beginning to emerge?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Good. Good question. This is Rick again, Erik. When you think about that, and we've talked about that previously in terms of what will happen, we think, in this market over time, as more data evolves in long-term care space, I think there will be more opportunities for other people to take on that risk at certain prices. This transaction you saw there might be one of those that actually bodes, that's out there in the horizon. I think you also look at a very robust reinsurance market for other blocks of business that you've seen out there. So those are all good things. What I wouldn't do is read across to our business that there'll be something of a large nature that's coming across our block anytime soon. But those are all good indicators that the market is getting better. But as part of the transition we would expect to see in this market, as data grows, as more information grows, as capital becomes available to it, it will be something we look at. And that points you back a number of years to what we did with our Northwind transaction, that it went through the same cycle around the individual disability space. And we hope to see that in the long-term care space as well. So good things but don't read across that there's something imminent on the horizon for us.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Christopher Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First question on the U.K. So it seems results are sort of tracking back in line with your expectations, with earnings clearly stabilizing, the sales and the life piece falling as you work through kind of that repricing process. And I think you're going to be through kind of the repricing of that book by the end of the year. So just wondering how you're thinking about the reinsurance agreement that you have in place when that's up for renewal and if you have an estimate for how much earnings you're kind of giving up with that -- with the reinsurance contract.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, why don't you start on that one, and then Peter can pick up a little color on it.", "Richard P. McKenney", "I think the way you characterized it, Chris, is right, that as we went through that reinsurance transaction, we're going through a major restructuring of the block, including the reinsurance, including pricing and what we're doing in the market. And actually, this year-end, we recaptured some of that business. So I shouldn't say recapture. We renewed reinsurance, but we didn't have the same amount that we reinsured out. We have retention levels higher of around 70%, 75% of the block. At the same time, on the reinsurance front, we did keep in place a volatility cover. So we actually, per life, we retain less. We think that's good volatility management for that block of business. And in both cases, we've been very happy with the pricing. And once again, this is a structure which goes out 1 year. So we have a lot of flexibility as we get towards the end of this year to figure out what type of retention we want to continue to hold on that block. But I put all that in the context of we're very happy with how the returns have changed and improved for our U.K. life business, and we think of reinsurance there as a tool to help us manage the return to good profitability that we've experienced in the past.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Peter, do you want to add a little bit, too, just in terms of where we are in the repricing actions and just maybe some of the market dynamics?", "Peter G. O'donnell", "Yes. Thanks, Tom. So in terms of what are the repricing actions, yes, in terms of the -- we're about 75%, 80% through. So I guess in U.S. terms, we're in the seventh innings. We've probably got eighth or ninth innings. So I expect to be done by sort of the end of the third quarter on the repricing. As Rick said, what we've seen is we're very happy with the business we're retaining. We're seeing those results come through. You can see that in this quarter's results, very evidently in the sort of group life product stream and the return on equity. And as we've reached the sort of third quarter, we'll take another look at the reinsurance. I suspect the per life looks like a good thing to do, and then we'll look at the retention level, depending on how it's performing. But it's certainly working for us today.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then a follow-up on LTC for Jack. So the repricing comments were helpful. Wondering if you could talk about conversations you're having in the marketplace. It seems like there's sort of increased focus from the NAIC around the repricing process and if minimum loss ratios should maybe be met before submitting price increases. So, really, just wondering how you're thinking and handling these dialogues. And if the type of loss ratios that have been proposed are adopted, any estimate for what portion of your book are already above those minimums and would be eligible for repricing?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes, we've been actually very active in dialogues with the NAIC and regulators. I've gone out personally, visited Scott Kipper, who runs the Senior Issues Task Force of the NAIC. I've been out to see him twice. The loss ratio that's being vented about are logically, prospectively on new business written. They don't necessarily apply to enforce blocks and particularly close blocks. But even with that said, the loss ratios are at a level that they wouldn't impact our ability to pursue rate increases.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then just one quick one for Mike or Tom. You've talked about kind of expanding partnerships as sort of the benefit marketplace evolves, and you've done a number of things with health care. Just wondering if there's anything else in the pipeline that we should have on our radar.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Chris, it's a great call. And Mike maybe talked about that because there is a lot going on that we probably can't get too specific. But we're in some interesting general dialogue.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Thanks. Great question, Chris. And I'd say the macro trend, as you are seeing health plans, continued to get less bridge and gaps get created, and that creates real opportunities for us, broad-based. And then finding new and interesting ways to get after those opportunities continue to surface. You mentioned the UHC partnership. That's been a very good partnership. We're about 3 years in. It's been a differentiator for us in that large part of the marketplace to have the world's biggest managed care company and the world's leading disability company working together. And we actually have a pretty healthy pipeline of other partnerships coming that attack actually different segments as well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Thomas Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Wanted to come back to long-term care. So first on the rate increases you're getting. Can you comment on whether or not you see a big enough benefit to offset the previous comments you've made and the previous disclosures you've had about potential charges, I think, mainly related to discount rates. So can you -- is there any way to quantify that? Is that a positive enough new development that there's a chance that, that could fully offset the potential need to strengthen GAAP reserves? That's my first question.", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes. Rick. Yes, let me take that again. And, Tom, maybe I'll recharacterize some of the things I'd say, which is just to say there are -- kind of if you think about it, 3 big moving parts, and they're constantly changing. One of them is going to be the experience in the block. And if you think about what we saw this quarter, that's good, but these are, once again, long-term views of how we see the experience in the block emerging. We've got the interest rate pressures. We've got to put these cash flows to work at certain levels, and we'll deal with that over a period of time. This quarter, a little bit tougher, but once again, these are our long-term views around how cash will get put to work over a very long period of time. And the third piece, as you say, is the price increases. And so that's a little bit better than we thought. And these pieces of how we see them, how we feel about them are constantly moving, are constantly reevaluating them. And as we look to establish the correct level of reserves to the block, we're going to continually reevaluate them. And it's hard to look at any one moment in time and say explicitly where they are. But like I said, we can only give you the best transparency, we give you the indicators that we see out there and how those are evolving over time. And that's what we'll continue to do with you quarter in and quarter out. And that's our best read that we have as we sit here in the first quarter.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And, Rick, can you comment on the -- I believe the last time you all took a charge in 2011, there was a difference between stat and GAAP, and you equalized those 2. What is that difference today in the reserve levels?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure, Tom. Actually, it changed over time as they do, but I will give you a number, probably safely say it's north of $500 million and why it sits out there today. So that will be the differential today. It's a little bit north of that, and that will change over time. But there is some differential between our stat and our GAAP books today.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And what's the latest update on if there is a strengthening, what kind of timing? Is it still a few years away potentially? Or is there any way to get timing clarity around that?", "Richard P. McKenney", "I think I'd take you back, Tom, to what I just told you, which is there's a lot of pieces and they're moving constantly. It's hard to give you clarity around the timing. It's because those dynamics are constantly changing. So I probably would just leave it at that, that we'll continue to reevaluate it and continue to give you some views on that. But particular to the interest rate piece, I think that we go through ups and downs in the interest rate cycle. And the original guidance we gave you back in 2011 still is pretty reasonable in terms of how we look at it.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a comment about not fully investing right now. How should we think about that? I guess interest rates remain a bit low. Should we consider or should we expect you all to have that same strategy for the next few quarters if rates remain low? Is there going to be a point at which if it goes on long enough, that you'll start more fully investing?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure, Tom. When we think about investing, this is actually something we did exactly how it played out last year as well, where there wasn't a good selection of assets. And sometimes it's rates, sometimes it's actually supply. So there's a lot of reasons why we wouldn't put our money fully to work. The dynamics look similarly today. If you look at last year as an example, we've got it all to work by the end of the second quarter. So how's that going to play out in the course of this year? I can't really tell you today. But our team looks at it very carefully, and we are in constant conversation about when to put money to work and when to sit on it and wait for what we think will be a better environment. A lot of dynamics going to that conversation, as they are right now, but I can't give you much more than that as we look out to the second and third quarter.", "Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Just my last question. Would you -- I know you had mentioned statutory earnings were a little bit lower this quarter. Is the full year expectation still roughly the same as it's been in terms of statutory? And was there anything in particular weighing on results in 1Q?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Tom, the statutory results in 1Q were a little bit lighter, but I'd put you within a range. Last year, if you went to first quarter, they were actually a lot better than we thought. So in stat, we will see more volatility, but that doesn't change our outlook in terms of where we think our stat results can come in. And importantly, it doesn't change our views around what our capital management programs look like. So although we see the volatility, we'll continue to watch it, but we don't read across anything to the full year yet.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "A couple of quick ones. Most has been answered already. In the U.K., I was just -- I was interested in whether you could give us some sense for the order of magnitude, as you think about the pricing today on the group life side, cases that you're actually willing to write, relative to the pricing, say, perhaps 3 or 4 years ago when you sort of cited that you are maybe a little bit -- a bit overly competitive.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Peter, do want to pick up on that one? Again, I think it's just -- it's a matter of just looking back, as John said, about just the pricing environment a couple years ago versus how you're sort of viewing it today and what -- where we're playing and where we're not playing.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I'm trying to get a sense. Is that 20% higher pricing or 100% higher pricing?", "Peter G. O'donnell", "It's in the 10% to 15% higher pricing, I would say. So -- whereas -- where you're writing pricing around about your cost of capital are slightly below even when you got pushed on competitive. We're now pushing for more of where we feel comfortable a good return on that business is. And so it's low-teen, double-digit increase, that kind of thing. I think the challenge -- what you've seen on the life book is -- so as you shrink the book, clearly, that gives you some -- a little bit of expense pressure. But we're more than happy that we're balancing that with a margin increase.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's very helpful.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "And, John, as you know, the group life business tends to be pretty price sensitive from a customer point of view, and you have far less ability to start differentiating your offering with service and claims processes and things like that. So those may seem like relatively small percentages, but they can swing business quite a bit.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I know. I understand, Tom. That's helpful, though. On the U.S. group disability side, we actually saw a couple of players in that market increase their discount rates this past quarter. I guess it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, given what we've seen on the rate side, on the interest rate side or yield side, but did you guys make any adjustments to discount rates? Or do you expect to make any?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure, John. Yes, when you look at our discount rates, it's something that we manage over a period of time. We did not make any adjustments this quarter. And we look at how we're investing money relative to the portfolio, and you've seen us over the last several years manage that carefully. To give you a sense, our margin between our asset yields and our liabilities is still 90 basis points, very consistent with where it's been. So we manage that all together and do it. And I would tell you, it is -- we did see it on the net investment income side. It is a challenging environment, and that line feels it. But we also have the ability to price for it, to manage it and work through it. So it's not a new story for us. It's how we continue to manage it.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I know. I certainly appreciate your commentary on the new money investment side. I think we're starting to see some companies maybe stretch for yield, and it certainly seems like you guys are being more conservative on that front. The last question for you, maybe for Rick, you had sort of mentioned that you've got this 2015 debt maturity, I think it's just shy of $300 million, that you've maybe already repurchased some of that. Can you just give us maybe a bit more detail on what's going on there?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Sure. We actually had about $300 million that was issued out of the U.K. It's part of -- they're not directly linked, but it's part of our issuance we did. We chose to actually tender for half of that. So that's actually in the process of being done. So that will happen probably in the mid-May time frame, a little bit later in the month. So you'll see that come through. We're actually paying to make a hole [ph] as part of that, so there will be debt extinguishment costs. But because this was U.K. debt, we also had currency hedges on. And so as we removed that, there was a gain associated with that. So they will be in a couple of different line items in our income statement, but those 2 roughly equate -- kind of thinking the $10 million to $15 million range on both sides of the equation netting close to 0.", "John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. So you'll get a head start on sort of interest expense coming down as a result of this?", "Richard P. McKenney", "That's correct.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sean Dargan with Macquarie.", "Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research", "Just to head back to Closed Block LTC, was there an element of the improvement in the interest adjusted benefit ratio that was attributable to group LTC?", "John F. McGarry", "We actually saw improvement in both individual and group, so yes.", "Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research", "Okay. It's my understanding, when a state approves a rate increase and the carrier goes to the policyholder, that they get 3 options. They can either pay the increased rate, they can keep their old rate with reduced benefit or lapse. And with individual policyholders, I think carriers have found that, overwhelmingly, the policyholders will pay the higher rate. Is that the same dynamic that you've seen in the group market?", "John F. McGarry", "It's a little different in the group market in that the premiums, first of all, are a lot lower. Our average premium in the group market is $400 versus like $2,000 in the individual. We are probably seeing more buydowns in nonforfeiture options in the group market than we see in the individual, and that tends to be positive from a reserve development perspective.", "Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research", "Right. And so I guess is that something that's sustainable? Or is that kind of a onetime benefit that you'll get maybe at the January 1 and July 1 renewal periods?", "John F. McGarry", "Yes, it will tend to spike in January and July when it happens. It only happens when you're going through rate increases. And so it will happen as long as we're continuing to implement group long-term care rate increases. And we'll be doing that for a while because you implement them in the order that states approved on at the next anniversary. And so there's -- we implemented the first batch of state approvals this year, but there are other batches that will be emerging next year as well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ryan Krueger with KBW.", "Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "A question about Colonial. You've had a lot better sales results over the last couple of quarters than one of your main competitors, despite probably facing similar headwinds in regards to health care reform uncertainties. So it begs the question, are you seeing any change in buyer behavior? And what I mean by that is, is there a shift -- has there been a shift in preference towards using brokers, which is your main distribution avenue, versus, say, using career agents [indiscernible] for these products?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "All right. Ryan, just to clarify, as you know, we really have 2 pathways into the voluntary benefit business. Certainly, the Unum US pathway, sales primarily through brokers and consultants. As you know, the offering we bring to market there is a more comprehensive full offering of group voluntary and executive benefit. The other avenue certainly is the Colonial offering, where we actually market a more limited set of voluntary benefit products, but those go through agents. And the agent may choose to actually use the broker. And so I just want to clarify, we've got sort of 2 avenues into the voluntary marketplace. We consciously chose to keep those 2 avenues because they actually complement one another as we come to market and, in our mind, actually give us a much broader array of choice in the marketplace, everything from the very small employer to the very large employer and in the public sector as well. So sort of with that backdrop, maybe, Randy -- maybe -- is it worth talking a little bit about what you're seeing actually from the broker side of things?", "Randall C. Horn", "Absolutely. Well, let me emphasize, first of all, that we are continuing to stay focused on our agency distribution system. We do not have different distribution channels here at Colonial Life. Again, our focus is on our career agency system. As they move up market, there typically will be a broker involved. And so we work with brokers through our agency system in a partnership manner. Really not seeing any big shifts in that. I mean, there certainly are growing opportunities as employees are given more and more responsibility for their benefits. And we're seeing more and more brokers interested in getting into the voluntary space, Ryan. So we're very optimistic and feel like the way to go is to keep focused on our agency system and have them work effectively with brokers.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Mike, would you like to add a little bit of that from your market perspective?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, just to echo Randy's point, we definitely see the increased interest amongst brokers. I don't know about the switch amongst employers going more towards accessing the benefits through the broker, but the brokers' interest. As they've seen some of their revenues capped from a health care perspective, they are looking for ways to build out their client relationships and diversify revenue. That drives interest in voluntary. To give you a little bit of a sense, Ryan, over 1/3 of our new sales in the first quarter came on an integrated group in DB basis. So we're seeing that same advisor bring multiple product solutions. That's also driving good interest in our executive benefits or IDI product line as well.", "Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. You talked about M&A a little bit in the past. I know, generally, there hasn't been a lot going on or a lot available in your markets. But wondering, are there any additional lines of business that you guys would be interested in longer term, say, something like medical stop loss that may benefit from more demand from health care reform?", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Rick, do you want to just touch the overall M&A strategy?", "Richard P. McKenney", "Yes, Ryan. Let me just give you a view. It's probably not going to be different -- significantly different than what we've seen, although the market is active. I think the M&A markets, in general, across the insurance space are active out there. When you get more specific to our lines of business, people still tend to like their benefits business and are not avid sellers. When you get to product line, we have a good product set. So we're pretty well filled out across the board, but we'll continue to entertain things that fit within our strategic sweet spot at the -- working at the employer to provide protection benefits. And then I'd also remind you that we look around the world as well. So it's not just different lines we have in the U.S., there's different geographies, which we'll be seeing similar dynamics of what we have today. So we're quite active out there in looking in terms of different opportunities. But the M&A markets, I think, within our lines, particular business probably have not changed that much as you look over the last several years.", "Thomas R. Watjen", "Good. Thanks, Ryan. Well, it looks like we've actually exhausted our questions. So thank you, all, for taking the time to join us this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of you at various investor conferences and events this spring.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas White", "", "Great, thank you, Danny. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2014 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements.", "Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and also Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, and our subsequently filed Form 10-Q.

A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website in the Investors section.", "So, participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, President and CEO; and Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO; as well as the CEOs of our business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum US, Peter O'Donnell for Unum UK, Randy Horn for Colonial Life, and Jack McGarry for the Closed Block. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?", "Tom Watjen", "", "Thank you, Tom and good morning everybody. I am very pleased with our overall performance for the quarter, with operating earnings per share increasing 11% to $0.91 per share, and for the first half of the year, operating earnings per share grew at 9.9%, which is at the upper-end of our outlook we provided for you for 2014 of 5% to 10%. Importantly, to our book value per share, excluding AOCI, continues to grow and increased 9.1% year-over-year to $33.80 a share. ", "Now, I think there are three key takeaways for the quarter, which Rick will just address further in his comments. First, all three of our core business segments; Unum US, Colonial Life and Unum UK, continued to produce strong results and higher year-over-year operating earnings in the second quarter. ", "Each of these business segments is generating consistent solid margins, and as a Group, generated an operating return on equity of 15% for the quarter, which is also at the upper-end of the outlook as we provided for 2014. I should add too that our overall results for the Closed Block were strong as well.", "Second, as I mentioned earlier, operating earnings per share grew this quarter by around 11%. What's more important to me though is the balance we saw in the quarter between operating performance and the impact of our share repurchase activities. This quarter, our after-tax operating earnings increased 7.5% and our capital management or share repurchase activities added 3.5% to our quarterly earnings per share growth rate. I like this balance and this is the balance we are seeking over the longer term.", "And lastly we saw very strong sales at improved premium growth throughout much of the company. I am very confident that these results have not come at the expense of profitability, but instead reflect the strength of our brand and the quality of our offering and people. ", "At the halfway point in the year, we are generally within or above the outlook for 2014 sales and premium growth we provided last year.", "So, in summary, the second quarter was a strong one for the Company. All of our businesses have showed solid year-over-year improvement. Our stronger level of operating earnings growth along with our share repurchase activities give us real operating leverage. And we are seeing excellent profitable top line growth opportunities, which we are expecting to carry into the second half of the year.", "Now, I will turn things over to Rick for a more thorough review of operating results. Rick?", "Richard McKenney", "", "Thank you, Tom. Our second quarter results were quite good, as we reported operating earnings per share of $0.91, up 11% from last year. We saw good underlying growth in our after-tax operating earnings, which accounted for roughly two-thirds of our operating EPS growth. We will continue to focus on driving growth in operating earnings. ", "And our second quarter performance continued to build off of the favorable trends we've seen emerging over the past several quarters. This growth will be additive to our underlying earnings growth per share that is generated as we steadily decrease shares outstanding.", "Looking first at Unum US, operating earnings increased 2.2% year-over-year, driven primarily by favorable experience in the Group Life and AD&D line. Group Life and AD&D produced a strong quarter with $61.6 million in operating income, up 7.5% on favorable risk experience, and premium growth of just over 3%. ", "Our supplemental and voluntary line reported operating income of $83.6 million for the quarter, basically flat with the year-ago quarter and operating income in our Group disability business increased slightly to $73.6 million from $73 million a year ago.", "Premium income was essentially flat this quarter, which is an improved result from the small declines we experienced over the prior two quarters, as we are seeing better sales trends and continued stable persistency. Net investment income continues to reflect the impact of the low interest rate environment. ", "Interest reserve margins remained solid, well above our targeted levels at 91 basis points, but lower asset yields continued to pressure net investment income for this line. ", "Importantly, our benefit ratio in group disability continued to improve, with the ratio declining to 81.9% this quarter from 83.9% a year ago, as the underlying experience showed stable claim incidence trends and continued favorable claim recovery performance.", "Looking forward, we expect the stable level of earnings from group disability, with some slight improvements in the benefit ratio and premium growth offset by some ongoing pressure from net investment income given the low rate environment. We expect our profit margins in this line to remain strong, among the highest in the industry. Overall, it was a solid quarter for Unum US, and the segment ROE stood strong at 14%.", "Moving to Unum UK, operating earnings were \u00a323.6 million for the second quarter, 8% higher than the second quarter 2013, and generally consistent with our expectations. Our Group Life results are much improved and reflect the aggressive pricing and repositioning activities of the past several quarters. ", "Group disability results were improved this quarter and our overall benefit ratio was 74% compared to 84% in the year-ago quarter. Our margins for the UK have actually improved back to the mid-20% area, which generates about an 18% of return on equity.", "Colonial Life generated another very strong quarter at $75.3 million compared to $71.1 million a year ago. We saw a steady, consistent risk experience across its business lines, generating a benefit ratio of 52%, in line with the benefit ratio from last year. The underlying profitability of this business remains excellent, producing an operating ROE of 17% for the quarter.", "And rounding out the enterprise, the Closed Block also had an unusually strong second quarter with operating income of $37.3 million, driven in large part by very favorable results in long-term care and higher miscellaneous net investment income. The interest\u00a0adjusted benefit ratio for the LTC line continued to run favorably at 80.8% for the second quarter, primarily reflecting a lower level of claim incidence rates. We generally expect the LTC interest adjusted benefit ratio to be in the range of 85% to 90% and the first half benefit ratio was 82.8% and has performed better relative to that expectation.", "The interest adjusted benefit ratio for the Closed Disability Block showed some negative volatility this quarter at 89.4%, due to higher claim incidence levels and unfavorable mortality, partially offset by favorable claim recoveries. The age of these closed blocks subject them to more quarterly volatility and in this quarter, it ran favorably for long term care, but negatively for our disability line.", "So now moving on to our sales and growth trends across the Company, we are particularly pleased this quarter with the results we are seen. In Unum US, total sale increased by 40% in the second quarter, a sharp jump from the year-ago quarter, when we were seeing the worst of the disruptive impact of healthcare reform on our market and our customers. ", "When we look at the longer-term view of sales going back to 2011, this quarter's results get us back on the trend line of growth in the mid-single digits, a more normal sustainable level of sales growth.", "Within our Group benefit lines, long-term disability, short-term disability and group life, total sales increased by 50%, with 40% growth in the core market and 80% in large-case market, much of which was driven by sales to existing customers. ", "Our voluntary benefit sales also increased by about 20% in the quarter with a good mix of sales in the core market and large-case segments.", "These are large increases across the board, but to give you context from a profitability perspective, of the $53 million of growth that we saw, half is coming from existing customers, and another quarter from sales to new core market customers which is our most profitable business. ", "In addition to the strong sales, persistency for our Unum US employee benefits lines remained strong at 89% for the quarter. Bring it all together, premium growth for Unum US was up 2.3% for the quarter, and we believe we are starting to see some of the benefit from better overall employment trends. ", "Also at Colonial Life, we saw very good sales again this quarter, an increase of 7.7% overall, with positive contributions from both new accounts and existing accounts. We also saw better trends in our core commercial markets, with quarterly sales growth approaching 9% in the under 1,000 life market. ", "Results in the large-case commercial and the public sector markets were also favorable this quarter, largely with growth coming from new accounts. Persistency remained slightly lower relative to the first half of 2013, but overall, premium income increased by 3%, which is in line with our expectation of 2% to 4% for Colonial Life.", "And finally in the UK, sales were down about 11% in the quarter to \u00a312.6 million. Much of the decline is in the group life market, down 29%, probably due to the competitive pricing conditions in our own actions, as we carefully priced this book of business. The pipeline does tell us that we should see this improve in the second half of the year.", "Disability sales were essentially flat with the year-ago quarter at $9 million. Persistency in the UK is trending higher, but remains below our longer-term expectations, premium income in total, increased by about 2% for the quarter.", "So, overall, we are pleased with the growth trends in the Company, and equally pleased with the pricing on the business that we're selling today. We feel we have largely moved past the disruptions brought on by healthcare reform initiatives, though some evidence of that disruption still remain to the very small end of the market. ", "Also, we are beginning to see some evidence of the improved top line growth from better employment trends. It is certainly nowhere near the pre-recession levels, but a welcome trend nonetheless.", "Now, looking at the investment portfolio, the credit quality of our portfolio remains in excellent shape, no changes there, and the watch list of potential problems continues to be very low. The decline in interest rates and the spread compression once again this quarter, make for a challenging investment environment. ", "We continue to look for the best opportunities in the investment markets and for the best relative value among the asset categories we have historically focused on.", "We are experiencing some near-term pressure on our investment income and product portfolio yields relative to our expectations similarly to what we have seen over the past several quarters. Our investment team continues to perform well, and we remain disciplined in how we manage through this low-rate environment.", "Moving to a capital update, the weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional US life insurance companies remain consistent at approximately 401%, and our holding Company cash and marketable securities was $616 million at quarter-end. ", "Our statutory operating earnings of $171 million are within our range of expectations and improved over the level of the first quarter this year.", "Following the first quarter issuance of $350 million of 10 year notes at a 4% coupon in the second quarter where we retired $145 million of the debt issues scheduled to mature in November 2015, which was issued out of our UK holding company. ", "As a result, there are two non-operating earnings that basically offset each other in the quarter debt extinguishment costs of $10.4 million after tax, and a currency hedge gain related to that debt of $10.5 million after tax, so no impact on this quarter's net income.", "Also, we continually and steadily buy back our shares with the capital we are generating another $100 million for the quarter which keeps us on pace with our $300 million to $600 million range for the full year.", "I would also note that our Board of Directors approved an increase in our dividend rate of 14% during the second quarter, which is the 6th year with a double-digit dividend increase.", "Wrapping up, I would also affirm that our 2014 outlook for growth and operating earnings per share remains in a range of 5% to 10%. In fact, most of the trends we have experienced thus far in 2014 are in line, if not at the higher end of our 2014 outlook for sales, premium growth and our ROE expectations. A strong first half of the year and we like the trends we are seeing as we head into the second half.", "And now I will turn it back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Tom Watjen", "", "Before we move to your questions, I'll close by just reiterating some of the things that were said before, but certainly we have a very strong start to the first half of the year. Our focus remains on continuing to grow our business while maintaining strong margins through disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management. We expect to continue to generate excess capital and we will continue to balance the deployment of that capital with the needs of the business, opportunities we see in the market place and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend actions. Now this completes our prepared remarks, and\u00a0Danny, let's move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Suneet Kamath with UBS Capital Markets.", "Suneet Kamath - UBS Securities", "", "I wanted to start with the Individual Disability Close Block. Rick, I think in your comments, you talked about the elevated benefit ratios as maybe normal fluctuations. But have you dug in to the Block to see if there's anything that's jumping out there?", "Richard McKenney", "", "Actually, as we look at the Individual Disability Block and I try to reference our remarks, we saw some elements which we surely attribute to volatility, things around mortality and incidence levels that we haven't seen in some time. So, it does not look like a trend. Certainly, it's something we would watch, but we would very much chuck that up to volatility in that line of business. And we have dug into that, yes.", "Suneet Kamath - UBS Securities", "", "And then, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but if we look at the sales growth now over the past three quarters, it has been generally pretty strong -- and I'm talking Unum US and Colonial combined. So, as we think about 2015, I think your 2014 guidance for premiums was relatively flattish for both of those segments, maybe a little bit stronger in Colonial Life, but how should we be thinking about the impact of these sales on your expectations for premium growth in 2015?", "Michael Simonds", "", "Yes, good strong sales in the quarter. Feel good about how the strategy is meeting the market seeking to broaden our relationships with existing clients and grow our employee pay business. Our sales and client management folks are doing a terrific job. Our turnover in both those roles is at historic lows. And so we feel really good about how we are meeting the market. That being said, in the pure second quarter, we have a little bit of an anomaly in the year-over-year growth metric, but Unum US was up 40%. That was again, as you will recall, probably the low point in terms of market activity that we'd experienced in the second quarter of last year. And so one of the things we do is look at it, skip over '13 and look back to 2012, where we experienced growth of about 12% or 13%. ", "So, a little bit of an anomaly. To your question about looking forward, I would expect those comparables will get a little bit more difficult when it comes to sales growth in the third and the fourth quarter. 2Q was really last year the low point. We saw it sort of flattened out in terms of sales growth, and then start to improve to your point in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year. So, certainly with the combination of building sales momentum probably closer in the second half of the year to the guidance that we issued last year around 7% to 10%. Combined with strong persistency levels that we are experiencing, we would start to see earned premium probably to the high-end of the guidance, and then, probably a tick or two better than that next year.", "Randy Horn", "", "Yes. We feel real good about our sales momentum at this point. We are coming in really right within our target range for the year, which we established at 4 to 7%. We think that's going to lead to good premium growth performance again, right around our targeted range of 2 to 4% growth here in 2014. So if we can keep this momentum going, which we feel optimistic about, Suneet, there is no reason why we shouldn't be in our targeted growth ranges moving forward and possibly even in the upper-end of those ranges. ", "Again, we had a range of 2 to 4% premium growth this year over the next couple of years, that was moving up more in the 3 to 5% range, and we feel our trend line is pointing us in that direction.", "Suneet Kamath - UBS Securities", "", "And then hey it's for Randy, just a quick follow-up on Colonial, Aflac US has obviously been going through some issues in terms of their field force, so maybe two-part question. One, is that having any impact on your business in terms of additional opportunities? ", "And second, can you maybe talk about how you managed your field force, because it doesn't seem that you're having nearly the same issues as they are? Thanks.", "Tom Watjen", "", "Especially with that last question about how we're managing that sales force, it might be good just for me to make a very brief comment just about how we are structured actually. Because I think you're right, there are different people in the markets who have different ways about going about the business.", "So I think as everybody knows, we have really two avenues into the voluntary market. So in the Unum US the avenue is very important to us, because voluntary provides -- allows us to have a very integrated offering of Group, individual and voluntary products in the marketplace. We actually market those to brokers and consultants. ", "And so, that brand is distributed in the market in a very different way than Randy's business for example, because Colonial has a more narrow voluntary benefit offering in the marketplace, but that's sold through agents. The agents may ultimately use a broker, but the agent controls that business. And so, from the Group point of view, we have two very good brands, two very different ways to come to market, and its proven to be very, very successful for us over the years.", "In fact, if you take those two businesses and look at just the results last quarter, our total VB sales were actually up 11% across Unum US and Colonial businesses. And so, that's a pretty strong performance. It's up 8% actually for the year. ", "And if you look at the last three years, by having this sort of two-pronged approach to the marketplace, as a combined business, the growth rates range from 2 to say 8% over that period of time. So, we had steady growth each and every year. I just want to give that piece of context, because we go to the market a little differently from some others by having two brands and two distribution systems, and they are very powerful. They give us a lot of access to different markets. They complement one another. And that's proven to be a good formula for us. ", "So with that, Randy, you want to pick up a little bit on just the Colonial part of the story.", "Randy Horn", "", "First of all, Suneet, in terms of opportunities coming from the Aflac side of things, I, of course, can't speak to the specifics of what they are doing, but they are undergoing a lot of change in their agency distribution system. And so, yes, in the short-term, that does create opportunities for any competitor.", "In terms of the management of our agency system, and how we go about things, just to give you the short story, and it is really a fairly simple story, Suneet, we are maintaining a very consistent focus on our agency distribution system. And this is the channel that we use to go to market both in terms of direct sales on the smaller-end of the market and then having our agents partner with brokers as they move up market. So through this approach, we really avoid any type of channel conflict and we have been very focused on that approach for a long, long time.", "Secondly, just gets back to sound execution of the fundamentals of our business; recruiting reps and managers, upping the quality level of that recruitment effort, developing our agents effectively, growing the number of producing agents and sales managers, and seeing very, very good results from that at the present time. We are seeing increased activity levels, more appointments occurring with the employers, a good surge in the number of closed cases, that type of thing.", "And lastly, we are seeing the market environment improving. So that's helping us. As Rick said, we are seeing gradual, continued improvement in the economy, still some pressure on the real small end of it, but that's loosening up as well. ", "I think most employers, as Rick said, are putting the Affordable Care Act implementation behind them, and that has really led to more new accounts being open for us, sales and product lines to complement the changes that employers are making in their medical plans, such as our Medical Bridge product, critical illness, accident, on and so forth. ", "So, it's really led to an environment, Suneet, a very broad based sales growth, and we are optimistic about reaching our targeted sales growth for the year based on what we're seeing.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Intrigued to hear you say you are starting to see some of the benefit from better overall employment trends. What do you think that means in terms of, I think you talked about the natural growth rate, how much has it ticked up so far and where could it go?", "", "Michael Simonds", "", "So, we would have seen through the recession -- actually a headwind there, where we saw contractions in the order of 1 to 2%, I'd say over the last four quarters or so. That leveled out to a push up a little bit in the quarter down a little bit in the quarter and now I think, through the first half of this year, we've actually started to see that move into positive range and think in terms of a percentage point or so.", "We are optimistic. Our business plans don't center on the assumption, but we're optimistic that we will continue to see that build slowly. It plays out in natural growth to our book-of-business as our premiums lever on hiring trends and salary increases, that premium comes in at very low acquisition cost, which is terrific. Also at play is the attitude towards benefits. So, as some of the slack comes out of the labor market, we are seeing clients with a little bit of a better attitude towards improving benefits plans, perhaps adding a new benefit or two and so, that's showing up in our MBOC results as well. ", "So, not likely to accelerate rapidly, but a gradual improvement over the last couple of quarters.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "And then the sales overall this quarter, understanding that you had an easier comp, but still for that you had excellent growth. Was there an adjustment in pricing strategy? ", "Obviously, your benefits ratios have been improving. Did you take that more into account when you were putting up proposals this quarter? It just seems like there was more of a step function that I am curious as to what drove that?", "Tom Watjen", "", "Mike, you want to take that? And also as part of just (inaudible) I think you dissected -- we dissected the sales in the quarter, where that sales are coming from is a good sort of indicator of that whole pricing environment actually.", "Michael Simonds", "", "So just to hit the question directly first and then speak to the mix of sales overall. Orientation around pricing is very consistent and actually has been for an extended period of time. We actually feel pretty good in each of our lines of business about having the market share that we do, having blocks the size that we do yield some pretty good insights around where prices need to move up a bit, where we can afford to come down a bit, but the aggregate level has actually moved not much at all. And looking at the quality of the business, it's one of those quarters, where everything broke our way across segments and products, which is good to see. But if you look at the strategy, we are very focused on building out the breadth of the relationships we have with the clients that know us and that appreciate the Unum brand. ", "So, 62% of all of our new sales came from those existing relationships, that's important. We see two points or three points more favorable pricing from a line that's added to an existing relationship. We know that as we build out the relationship, it drives persistency in future period and that's very important to us through the renewal program.", "One of the key drivers certainly was large case. And just to put that into perspective, if we look at large case it actually feel good about where that business is. It was up 80% in the quarter. But if you look at the last 12 quarters, seven times we've been up, five times we've been down, and we really don't get too caught up in what happens quarter-to-quarter, we look at the aggregate, long-term trend. ROE in that business is actually very comparable now to our core business, and we started to see a leveling of the earned premium, which is great and will bode well for earned premium going forward. ", "So, feel actually very good about the mix and the quality of the business that's coming in.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Sorry, one more follow-up. The 62% from existing relationships, what was it in Q1?", "Michael Simonds", "", "Well that would've been actually just a tick lower, 61% last quarter.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Erik Bass with Citibank. Please go ahead.", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "", "Just following up on a couple of the last questions, I guess in the group market, we have seen several competitors that continue to face the margin pressure and appear to be either pulling back or raising prices. So has this resulted in either less competition or provided a little bit of a price umbrella for you to ramp up growth?", "Michael Simonds", "", "Certainly, it remains a competitive market. At any given point in time, there is going to be some carriers that are retrenching and trying to improve profitability, and in others, there's going to be carriers that are trying to extend share. That being said on balance, I would say it is a pricing environment that is slightly improved over prior year. While I couldn't speak to any particularly competitor, our best insight is that the industry, when it comes to Group insurance, is currently running at a mid-single digit ROE, which would suggest there is some work to be done and I think we're starting to see the benefit of that in a little bit of a firmer pricing environment.", "As we look forward, again, so we're sort of cautiously optimistic that the market will firm or continue to firm up a bit. ", "But we also recognize that, as you come around the corner and you're headed towards the second half of the year, it is not easy always to maintain that pricing discipline in the face of decreased sales and so it's somewhat of an open question, as to whether industry players will stick their guns when it comes to improving the margins of their book of business.", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "", "And you mentioned the sales to existing clients. What products are they adding? Is it a move to adding more voluntary products? And how much additional opportunity do you see the cross-sell? Is keeping it in that 60% range of sales of reasonable target?", "Michael Simonds", "", "Yes. Great question. We actually think we've got a pretty long runway there. So if you think about Unum, we have built a very broad franchise, primarily around disability insurance. So we've got a large number of important clients where we've got a line or two lines in-force and we feel like absolutely voluntary is a huge opportunity. Over a third of all our new voluntary sales are coming in on in-force group relationships. We see the individual disability, which is typically a supplemental sale for higher earners, that's a big opportunity for us. And then actually, even within traditional life insurance, we a see nice opportunity for our voluntary supplemental plans that sit on top of, perhaps, an employer-funded base. ", "So really across the Board, we see a pretty long runway and a big opportunity to drive additional growth.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "", "Wanted to start off with a question on capital generation, I noticed that -- I think if I backtrack in that part of the $150 million of debt repurchase and the equity or the share repurchases and so on, I think it gets to roughly $100 million of excess capital generated this quarter. And I want to see if my math is correct, and if so why it's a little bit late compared to the $550 million to $650 annual run rate that you guided to?", "Richard McKenney", "", "It's a good question on our capital generation, and I think this quarter we saw a good, you've to go back to our statutory earnings, which actually were back on track that we have seen over many, many quarters on average, which is right around $170 million, and you would note as well, that's up off of what was a lighter quarter in the first quarter. So you have to take that into account first.", "As you look at the excess generation that we have, we continue to generate at a clip that I would expect overall. You have to take out of that, I think we're trying to do that, take out of that some of the work with debt issuance and repurchase and all the different pieces. But if you do take those different pieces out, we feel very good about our generation, where that lands and our ability to redeploy that. So, you would have seen in the quarter that we actually bought back $100 million of our stock. We feel good that we're continuing to retire some of our shares. ", "And in conjunction, you would have seen our dividend increase that we did as well. So, we go through and you could reconcile the numbers a lot of different ways, but I would say very much that our capital generation plans are on track and very consistent with what we would have talked about last year at investor day and how we look for the rest of the year.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. I guess I'm still little confused, because I guess, if I take out the $100 million in buyback, $37 million dividends, $35 million interests, I get to the $505 million remaining, and then ultimately you came at $616 million. So, I guess that means about $100 million of excess cash generation. Again, it seems a little low relative what you had guided to on an annual basis.", "Richard McKenney", "", "So, I'd add one add in there, but I'd not spend the time on this call to go through it. We could take you offline with that. But add in the UK capital generation as well, which has been very consistent over a period of time. But we're happy to take you through that offline, Yaron.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "", "And then switching gears to long-term care, clearly you had a good quarter there, yet one of your competitors seem to have to run into some trouble there and is reviewing assumptions, just want to hear your thoughts on as you look at your legacy book and the older vintages, what you are seeing there and how comfortable you are with results there?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. We had a very favorable quarter in the second quarter. We also reported a favorable quarter in the first quarter, driven by favorable submitted new claims, both the incidence rate was favorable as well as the severity with good claim resolutions during the quarter. So, we really didn't see some of the things that perhaps some of our competitors saw in the quarter. I'd note that it's a small immature block. It's going to be volatile. We don't -- we aren't changing our long-term outlook of a loss ratio in the 85 to 90% range, but it was just -- was a good quarter. It's good to see it. It's good to put it in the bank. And we continue to very aggressively manage and monitor the block going forward.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates", "", "Mostly asked and answered, but I do want to go back to the sales in Group DI. I understand ACA or whatever, and maybe that has something to do with it, although I find it hard to believe. But just my question is, why 2Q? Usually, things are very, very flat. There is not -- in my sense, there's not a whole lot of activity, flat between 1Q and 2Q, and all the big activity happens in 4Q. That's where you tend to see the surge in business being done. So, is there anything to say about why now?", "Michael Simonds", "", "Yes, sure. I mean I think maybe one of the things that you're getting to, Steven is right. So, fourth quarter is going to be the biggest quarter from a sales perspective in group insurance, because that's when you're one-one decisions are sorted. And so, actually, you'll see a little less volatility I find in the fourth quarter, because the volume is bigger. And so, second quarter not being the largest from historical pattern, quarterly, seasonality, being the biggest quarter you are subject to more volatility. ", "And that's where I think we saw was not our biggest sales quarter. A number of things broke our way, and when that happens, I think good things can happen. So, seven ones are the primary - July 1, effective date for the primary group sales that are getting submitted in the second quarter here. ", "Again, strategically feel very good about where those sales are coming through. But because it's a smaller sales quarter, it is subject to a bit more volatility.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach", "", "The 26%, I think, effective tax rate in the quarter, Rick, what should we be thinking about as it relates to the tax rate for the remainder of the year?", "Richard McKenney", "", "Actually, John, we would, say calculate right out of 30%. So we may be moving some of the non-operating items in and out that are --", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach", "", "Oh, maybe I did. Okay. That's fairly --", "Richard McKenney", "", "30%, that's our expectation for the year. So it's tracking very much for our expectations.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach", "", "Okay. And you mentioned miscellaneous investment income, maybe, a little bit high in the Closed Block. And, overall was there anything notable in miscellaneous investment income relative to sort of the run rate in the last several quarters?", "Richard McKenney", "", "No, I think that when you look at it, on average it was maybe a tick or two higher than normal, but nothing that was out of a reasonable range of expectations.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach", "", "Okay. And then, just an overall question on guidance. Yes, I recognize, maybe we all recognize that there has got to be some allowance for volatility in underwriting results and that sort of thing but clearly some real strength in the first half of the year. ", "Even the upper-end of your full-year, 10% EPS growth suggests the back-half of the year would be a lower earnings period relative to the first half. Affirm the guidance instead of maybe slightly raising the range. I am just wondering if you guys have contemplated that, and if you had and decided against raising the range, what was the key reasons?", "Richard McKenney", "", "Certainly, I'll split that into two parts for you, John. One is, how we think about it from our process perspective; our outlook. As we talked about a number of our things we have seen here, we really do refer back to what we're doing last year, and we looked at 5 to 10% and it will be very unlikely that we would change that, unless we saw something taking that out of the range through the first half of the year. So, I don't want to discount. We're very happy with our first half results. We've had some things that went in our favor, certainly. But there's nothing, as we look to the back-half of the year, that I am overly concerned about and in bringing that down. But it's just almost from our process perspective, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily adjust that unless we saw something taking us outside that range.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "", "The first question is on group disability. Your performance there continues to be quite strong, especially relative to peers, with the benefit ratio now sub-82%. Can you comment at all -- I am sure you've looked across the industry to decipher broader trends. But can you comment at all about why you think your book has performed so differently, because I think, virtually, everyone else in the industry has seen some level of deterioration. And the one thing that comes to mind for me is, you have consistently flagged better claim recoveries and maybe that's where you're outperforming, but anyway, any help on that would be appreciated.", "Tom Watjen", "", "And let me actually take it (inaudible) Tom, but then actually ask Mike to speak to it in more detail. But sometimes we try to get too cute about what distinguishes us from everybody else. I think as you know, we've prided ourselves for the last six or eight years around a very disciplined approach to the business. And that's word gets oftentimes overused. But I think it's very important here, because we have a very disciplined plan of attack for all of our businesses, we have very disciplined pricing and underwriting in all of our businesses. And as you know, if we look over a longer period, that means, at times, we haven't grown as fast as some of our competitors actually have grown, because we put a higher priority on margin and manageability and risk management frankly, than some have done.", "So, I think to a degree, just, as Mike makes his comment, I think as an overall institution. We've put a lot of priority on the importance of disciplines, staying focused and being sure we incent people to do the right things as it relates to those things.", "So, there is certainly probably some nuances about why we can do a little better, but I would say, first and foremost, it's that disciplined approach to the marketplace, I think, that frankly all of our businesses benefit from. And Mike, want to pick up on that little bit?", "Michael Simonds", "", "And so, just to build on Tom's point, what you would've seen from us over the last several years is earn premium that's relatively flat to a tick or two down in long-term visibility. And I think part of that is the pricing discipline out there. ", "In the market, it was good to see the segments start to grow just a little bit here, but I think it is reflective of front-end acquisition pricing, as well as on the backend. And so, even here in the second quarter, strong sales, but we continue to look through the Block. ", "On cases in the renewal program, we achieved increases of the 6 to 8% range, depending on whether you're talking about core or large-case, where we've had strong persistency, 89%. The business that's turned has come off and has been performing at five points to eight points lower than the active blocks. So it's a continuous active pruning process in terms of the pricing. But then, yes, absolutely, we sort of look at, okay, what are the investments that we've made in underwriting and then in benefits organization in general.", "So to give you a little color, LTD submitted incidence, for instance, was pretty much in line, but a little bit volatile, paid incidence was rock steady. And so what actually comes through in terms of our liability acceptance rates, in terms of paid incidence, recovery trends, what we've been able to achieve in terms of settlements and offsets, all those operational metrics have been in line with expectation to slightly improve. So again, can't comment on any particular competitor, but feel very good about the position of the block and what our anticipated trends would be going forward.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "", "The next question is stat earnings looked solid. Can you comment on a more consolidated enterprise-wide basis? How did they -- how were the captive results this quarter? I presume based on the performance, at least the gap numbers on the Closed Block, those probably were additive, because just wanted to see what that adjustment would be that the 171.", "Richard McKenney", "", "When you think about our different captives that we have out there, I think the one that I would note is Northwind was probably a little bit lighter this quarter, but that goes back to what we saw from the individual disability results in our Closed Block. So that's the only of note, that I'd it was really off of from that perspective. And as you know, the capital results in there are for a very different operation and structure, and everything else and so that's why we exclude it from our normal stat earnings, and I think that's still appropriate.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "", "And Rick, did Northwind lose money this quarter and if so, how much?", "Richard McKenney", "", "Yes. I don't think I could quantify that at the moment, but I think that it's going to be pretty breakeven I think is ultimately where it came down to.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "", "Okay. And I guess, my last question is on long-term care, which would be for, Rick. So, the favorable claims that you're seeing right now and I know it's doing better than your longer-term expectations. But if we assume that it continues to remain anywhere, let's say, couple of 100 basis points around this level, does this -- would this get you out of harm's way with the potential risk of a GAAP balance sheet charge, if you look out over the next few years? And I know the GAAP balance sheet issue is more -- I know there's a heavy-duty interest rate component to that. But I just want to understand the sensitivities based on where we're trending right now and whether that might actually alleviate the need to strengthen GAAP.", "Richard McKenney", "", "Sure. Tom, when you think about the claim trends that we are seeing right now are certainly very good and much better than we would have seen a year ago. The question is, how do those influence our longer-term expectations around the block of business? And that's a little bit more challenging. So, if time is in dimension to that, so instead if we continue to see this for a long period of time and becomes a trend, that's certainly quite helpful. But the question is, how it would that inference our long-term trends.", "And we're going through a process, and that's where I take you back, you highlighted another aspect that we obviously have to continue to look at. Price increases continue to go well out there in the marketplace, so I'd iterate that. The liabilities of our book of business, which include this claim, trend that we're seeing right now, pretty good, happy about what we saw here in the second quarter. ", "And third piece is interest rate, and interest rate is obviously continuing to be quite challenging. So, you take all those different pieces together, we will continue to look at them, and monitor them and work through that as we get closer to our year-end process.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "", "And so, Rick, would an update on all that likely occur in 4Q of this year?", "Richard McKenney", "", "I think that's probably realistic. We don't like to talk about the specific quarters, because we reflect it as we know things. But I think that fourth quarter traditionally, has been where we've brought all that together in a comprehensive look.", "Tom Watjen", "", "And right not just this block, but all the other blocks.", "Richard McKenney", "", "All of our blocks. That's our normal processes as we get to closer to year-end.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Christopher Giovanni with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "", "In the UK, I believe you noted you retained more the group life reinsurance program you had. If that's the case, just wondering what percentage of that program you recaptured? And where you think that could trend to, now that it appears -- you've stabilized and improved the profitability there?", "Richard McKenney", "", "Yes. So, I'll take you back, Chris, to the process we went through actually two years ago, and actually reinsuring the majority of the or I should say the half of that block of business and other bloodlines of business. I think that was a good move. We were seeing volatility at that time and we're going through re-pricing. And so, I think we're happy we did that. ", "At the beginning of this year, we retained 25% of that. So, we actually recaptured a quarter of the block back. As we get into year-end, we will have to make those decisions, in terms of where our pricing in the market is, where our profitability levels are, etc. But I think the actions we've taken and the team in the UK have taken are very prudent to-date. And we will evaluate that as we get closer to year-end.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. And then, wondering what impact the strong sales growth is having on RBC strain? And if it's not that material, just given the continued favorable trends you guys are seeing, the potential for buybacks maybe to accelerate, maybe, towards that the top-end of the target you provided in December?", "Richard McKenney", "", "I'd like to have a discussion, because as we see this growth, I think that we've always said that the first thing we want to do with our capital is continue to grow our business. And I think we're seeing that. We are very happy about that. The second piece of that is when does it become material to change our capital outlook and we're not near that yet. So, thinking about it from a premium perspective and the growth that we're seeing, it's certainly something we will continue to update you on. ", "But that's something we'd like to see, but we're not in the any point where we're changing our outlook around how we deploy capital in the near-term. But that will be a great discussion to have if we continue to grow at a more rapid rate than even what we are seeing today from a premium perspective.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. Then last one, don't even know if there's a discussion to be add here but for Jack, any evolving thoughts or developments around potential reinsurance or risk reduction opportunities in long-term care?", "Jack McGarry", "We continue to stay abreast of the market. We continue to talk about it. I don't think there's been a material change where the marketplace is. Still a lot of interest in the asset side of long-term care and much less interest in the liability side of long-term care. And so, I think until we get more stability in the marketplace and those two views come closer together, we will continue to do to look at it, but it's not a short-term option right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "", "I just wanted to again return to sales and maybe just baseline my understanding of what the outlook was, and when you were talking about the strength in two quarters sales, you spoke about anomaly in terms of the easy comps and skipping over 2013 and looking back to 2012, does that extend for the entire year's 7 to 10% sales growth? And the reason I ask is, suppose if I was looking at this over just 2013 levels, which was, of course, a lower sales year, the 7 to 10% would imply, I believe, flat sales growth for the back-half of the year. ", "But if I am looking relative to a compounded rate of growth over 2012, which was obviously a higher rate of sales, we are talking mid double digit growth in the back-half of the year. ", "So, just trying to baseline what the expectations are?", "Michael Simonds", "", "So, I we will run into tougher comparables as momentum picked up over the second half of last year and we talked about it earlier, there is a lot of work to do between now and the end of the year, we have 55 to 60% of the sales here yet to book. So, going to be a little bit cautious about making predictions, but I would anticipate that, we put guidance on the 7 to 10% for the year, I think that's actually a reasonable guidance for the pure second half as well, sort of in that mid-single digit approaching 10%; all that with the caveat that there is a lot of work to do. And as we talked about numerous times, part of the determination will be with the pricing environment out there, because we will stay pretty consistent. And if the market allows us to do that, we will certainly take it if not we'll live with the lower number.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. So, the full-year sales growth outlook, though, relative to 2013, at least in the US, you would expect to exceed that 10% range?", "Michael Simonds", "", "I think it's right at the top of the range, maybe a bit over it potentially; but again, a lot of work to do between now and then.", "Tom Watjen", "", "So, I think what you hear is a sense of optimism about the things that we can't control. And I think that's where Mike, is right to point to the fact that, listen, we've got some good pipeline activity underway. We always do worry about a second half and competitors are behind sales plans that they do crazy things in the marketplace. So, please don't misconstrue anything we're saying for a lack of confidence in the second half. We can't control what happens in the marketplace, and we've seen times where people have done some crazy things when they get behind sales plans.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "", "No, that's helpful, and was mainly looking to baseline expectations here. ", "And in terms of premium growth, I think you also mentioned this year, maybe to hit the upper-end of that range, and next year maybe get a tick or two higher than the 2% premium growth. ", "Given a normal sales environment, is that type of topline growth we should be looking for or as we look out farther in a normalized environment, we see premium growth maybe a little more than 3%?", "Tom Watjen", "", "Yes. Rick, why don't you take that? Because I think maybe it's also a reminder. I think you said it in your comments, we try not to go back and redo the outlook sort of midpoint, unless there something really significant going on. But obviously, our Investor Day meeting is a chance to recalibrate everything. But maybe just talk about how (multiple speakers)", "Richard McKenney", "", "Yes. And I think that the - actually, well, Seth, we would look to recalibrate that as we continue to go. And couple of things I'd highlight from the overall Mike said it very well as has Randy, I think when you look at where we are, our sales look good today. Our competitiveness feels pretty good where we are today. Importantly, our persistency is holding very well, and I think that's something we don't talk probably as much about, but that's very good. Our customers are certainly keeping us on the books. And the last piece, which is something we don't know yet today, but I think we're giving you the indication, that we are seeing better employment picture out there. And that's the first time we really have done that. And if all three of those things work in concert, I think you will see some good premium numbers as we take you to our outlook at the end of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Colin Devine with Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "", "A couple of questions. One, if I think about the US business, really for the last eight years, if I look at the benefit ratio on a trailing 12 month basis, and including this quarter, it's been a very steady turn down. And yet if I look at the expense ratio, for the most part, it's been fairly flat. There's been some improvement, but not a lot. Is that something, as you look ahead, where you might be able to leverage technology to drive some change there? So that's one question.", "Second, for Rick, with respect to capital, I look at every one of the businesses, the US, UK, Colonial, all solid 15%, at least the ROEs this quarter, and yet we still got the Closed Block, obviously, probably producing about 4. ", "When I think of the IDI piece of that, which I assume is still about half, about half of the debt has been retired from when you did the securitization a few years back. Is there an opportunity to roll that, so we can get a little bit more leverage on that to help boost the overall ROE? Thanks.", "Tom Watjen", "", "Thanks, Colin. Mike, do you want to pick the first one up about the US business and the component piece of benefit and expenses?", "Michael Simonds", "", "And I think there's actually a relationship that's worth pointing out between the two, benefit ratio and expense ratios. So, one of the drivers that led to that pretty steady improvement in the benefit ratio is the shift in the mix of business, where we moved with greater growth rate in the core smaller end of the market, and we shifted more towards employee pay. Both of those businesses tend to have lower loss ratios, but they also tend to be -- have higher operating expense ratios.", "You are dealing with more transactions to get at the same number of insurance. So, actually it's taken a series of investments in technology and business process to maintain the operating expense ratio\u00a0because without the actions, we would have naturally seen the operating expense ratio drift up a bit as we shifted the mix the way that we have. And as we look forward, we will continue to look for stronger growth in those businesses in particular and I think feel confident that we can offset that natural mix shift and the pressure that it creates on the operating expense ratio, and maybe do a little bit better than that as we look at, probably not quarter-to-quarter, but over the next several years, continue to find some ways to improve that operating expense ratio.", "The priority though is about better serving clients and finding ways that we can grow that top line, because as you pointed out, we feel actually pretty good about where benefit ratios are. We see a little bit of improvement but we're looking to generate operating earnings out of disciplined top line growth. And that's where the priority is going to be. ", "Tom Watjen", "", "And then might I add, that investment in certain expenses, which ultimately helped the service levels improve our ability to cross-sell, which we talked about earlier.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "", "That's right. That's right. That's good.", "Tom Watjen", "", "Rick, do you want to pick up on the capital question?", "Richard McKenney", "", "Yes, I'd like to, Colin, actually, I think that it's a great question. And we think about all of our liabilities including those at the back -- to liabilities and others in terms of what we can do. We try to be very active in terms of how we manage that. You would have seen that in this quarter with the retirement of our UK debt and looking at that.", "And particularly to the instruments that you're talking about that are backing our Closed Block. You're about right, it has run down over time and has halved. The liabilities have run down as well over that period of time. I would tell you that the team that put that in place prior to my time here, did a very good job and got a very good structure. ", "It is floating rate in nature, so they actually -- the interest rates being down don't help you from a refinancing perspective, but it's certainly something we look at, just like we look at all of our liabilities in terms of, is there opportunity there.", "But the more ideas you have like that around our capital, Colin, we'd be happy to take them on and look at them. Because I think it's something we have tried to be very active on, is managing the balance sheet and on an ongoing basis. Thanks for the question.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "", "Yes. Just one quick follow-up, is the old IDI block still running, I guess about a cash flow neutral where you just don't have the interest rate sensitivity there anymore, or what's coming in in premiums is just paying the clients?", "Richard McKenney", "", "That's exactly right. Still like that. I think the only place that you have to watch that as bonds get called in in this low-rate environment, but to-date, it's run very much cash flow neutral.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn things over to Mr. White for any closing remarks.", "Thomas White", "", "Let me just finish up here, Danny, if I could. We - certainly for those on the line, we know there's a lot going on this morning, and thank you all for taking time to join us, and Danny, this will complete our second quarter 2014 earnings call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tom White", "", "Great. Thank you, Dana. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements.", "Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, and our subsequently filed Form 10-Qs.

And now, I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning everybody. For the third quarter, we reported $0.87 per share in operating earnings, a 2.4% increase over last year and a result generally consistent with our expectoration. Our third quarter results reflect the continuation of many of the positive operating trends we have seen over the past few quarters, including continued strong sales growth, accelerating premium growth and stable risk experience, all of which are helping us to produce solid margins and profitability on our core business lines.", "For the first nine months of the year, our operating earnings per share increased 6.9%, which is consistent with the 5% to 10% outlook we provided you at last December's Investor Meeting. Book value per share excluding AOCI continues to grow nicely, increasing 9.1% from last year's third quarter level.", "Now let me highlight a few things before turning the call over to Rick for his more detailed remarks. First, we continue to see good sales momentum in our key business lines, a trend that emerged a year or so ago. Unum US sales increased by 13% this quarter with particularly strong results in our sales to existing customers. Colonial Life also continues to generate strong sales growth with third quarter sales also increasing 13%, reflecting solid results across all of our market segments and growth from both new account sales and sales to existing accounts.", "And finally, as expected, Unum UK sales rebounded this quarter increasing 15% year-over-year in local currency. I'm confident that these results did not come at the expense of future profitability but instead reflects the strength of our competitive position and today's generally more favorable benefit market conditions.", "Second, we are also seeing accelerating premium growth, with a 4.1% increase in premium in our core operating businesses. Premium growth has certainly been favorably impacted by the positive sales trends but also reflects the strong persistency in most of our lines and the targeted pricing actions we have taken in selected product areas.", "And finally, driven by our strong risk results, we continue to generate excellent operating margins and returns in our core business segments. As a result, we again reported solid statutory earnings in the quarter, which continues to give us the financial flexibility to support the expected capital needs in the business while also returning capital to our shareholders.", "Now looking ahead, while today's interest rates are certainly a challenge and are likely to remain a challenge, over the past few years we have successfully managed through a pretty low interest-rate environment and I am confident that we will continue to do so. More importantly, I do expect the positive operating trends, specifically our sales and premium growth along with our strong risk results, to continue into next year, and we'll have more on that at our Investor Day meeting in December.", "Now let me turn things over to Rick for a more detailed review of our operating results. Rick?", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Tom. Following on Tom's comments, I'd like to provide additional details on the drivers of our operating performance this quarter as well as a deeper look into top line growth and a view of our trends in our investment portfolio, and I'll close with an update to our capital management position and our capital management plans.", "Looking first at Unum US, we saw the continued favorable trends of improved premium growth, up 3.4% year-over-year and an improved benefit ratio which declined to 70.4% for the segment from 72% in last year's third quarter. This good product performance was not enough to offset the headwinds of the low interest rate environment and as a result operating earnings declined 2.5%.", "This general trend was consistent across the three business lines within the Unum US segment. Group life and AD&D results were favorable with operating earnings increasing 7%, driven by premium growth of 3.8% and lower claim incidents as the benefit ratio declined to 70% from 71.6% in the year ago quarter.", "In the supplemental and voluntary lines, operating earnings were relatively flat at $82.5 million. Premium income increased by 1%, while risk trends in both lines were improved relative to last year. Net investment income was $3 million lower than last year due to a decrease in yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous income, partially offset by growth in the asset base.", "Operating income in our group disability business declined to $69.2 million from $78.6 million a year ago. Premium income increased by 2.2% and the benefit ratio improved further down to 82.1% in the third quarter from 82.9% a year ago due to continued strong claim recovery performance, both of which are very encouraging trends.", "The headwind in the quarter in this line was net investment income which declined by almost $12 million on a year-over-year comparison. About one third of the decline was attributable to lower miscellaneous income, which can be volatile from quarter to quarter. The other two-thirds of the decline resulted from the slow decline in the portfolio yield in assets over many quarters.", "While this interest rate environment creates ongoing pressure, we continue to gradually re-price this business to reflect the current rate environment. So overall, despite the pressure from lower investment income, we could bring it back to a solid quarter for the Unum US segment as operating ROE was in the 13% to 14% range.", "Moving to Unum UK, operating earnings were \u00a320.1 million for the third quarter, flat with the year ago quarter and consistent with our expectations for this business. We have tended to experience a negative seasonality in our Group Income Protection line in the third quarter in our Unum UK results, which caused some pressure on earnings relative to the second quarter. Our risk results remain well within our expectations with the third quarter benefit ratio at 70.8% compared to 70.6% in the year ago quarter. Return on equity for our UK business continues in the high teens.", "Colonial Life generated another strong quarter at $71.2 million of operating earnings compared to $69 million a year ago. We saw favorable experience across our lines resulting in a benefit ratio of 52.7%, slightly improved from the 53.1% benefit ratio from last year. The underlying profitability of this business remains excellent, producing an operating ROE of 16% for the quarter.", "And rounding out the enterprise, the third quarter operating earnings of $26.2 million for the Closed Block was in line with our expectations of a range of $25 million to $30 million per quarter for this segment. Risk results were also generally in line. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for the long-term care line was at 88.5% and was higher than the very favorable experience of the first half of the year which was 82.8%, but within our expected range of 85% to 90%.", "And the interest adjusted loss ratio for the Closed Disability Block was 82.3%, improved from the second quarter level of 89.4% but slightly higher than the year ago quarter of 80.6%. As we have said before, these blocks will show volatility from quarter to quarter but this quarter's results were within our expectations.", "Net investment income was an important driver of results in this segment, especially relative to the very strong second quarter results, as miscellaneous investment income was $9 million less in third quarter of 2014 than the second quarter. Again, this component of net investment income will be volatile quarter to quarter for the Closed Block segment in showing a negative quarter to quarter sway.", "Moving on to our sales and growth trends across the Company, as Tom highlighted in his remarks, we are very pleased with the results we are seeing. In Unum US, total sales increased by 13% for the quarter, and for the first nine months of the year increased by 18% relative to the same period in 2013, which in our view gets us firmly back to a more normalized level of sales after last year's slowdown in the market.", "Within our group benefit lines, total sales increased by 21%, with 13% growth in the core market and 57% growth in the large case market during the third quarter. Importantly, 70% of the large case sales are sales to existing customers, giving us a high level of confidence in the pricing of this business.", "Voluntary benefit sales were relatively flat this quarter but are up 6% on a year-to-date basis. Along with the strong sales momentum, persistency for our Unum US employee benefit lines is encouraging and has been mostly improving throughout the year. In fact the persistency in the group long-term disability line has improved to 90.2% in the third quarter of 2014 from 87.4% in the year ago quarter. The net result is that Unum US premium income increased 3.4% in the third quarter, our strongest rate of growth in two years.", "At Colonial Life we again had a very good sales in the quarter, increasing 13% for the third quarter and 9% for the year to date compared to the same periods in 2013. Results remain encouraging across all of our sales metrics. Core market corporate sales are up 11%, large case corporate sales are up 35%, and public sector sales are up 11% for the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same time period in 2013.", "In addition, recruiting results have been strong, up 16% over the prior year, with strong production results out of those new recruits new to the Colonial Life agency system. Persistency remained slightly below year ago levels but premium increased 3.3% for the quarter consistent with our outlook.", "And finally in the UK, sales increased for the first time in several quarters growing 15% in local currency as we moved past the re-pricing and repositioning of our group life block. Disability sales contributed to the increase growing at about 8% to \u00a37.1 million and persistency in the UK continues to improve particularly in the disability block which is at 88.4% so far in 2014 compared to 81.9% last year.", "So overall we're encouraged with our growth trends and we are also pleased to see the pricing on the business we're selling today. We are continuing to see some evidence of improved top line growth from better employment trends, but is not yet close to what we saw at pre-recession levels.", "Now looking at the investment portfolio, the credit quality remains in excellent shape and the challenge of the low interest rate environment remains front and center. As I have indicated throughout my review of our segment results, the primary headwind in the quarter was the low level of miscellaneous investment income, primarily income from [indiscernible]. This amount tends to be very volatile from quarter to quarter and this quarter we had a total of $7 million of miscellaneous net investment income which was $12 million less than the second quarter and $9 million less than the year ago quarter. But beyond this volatility, the low new money yields continue to create incremental pressure on the portfolio yields that back our product lines.", "Now looking at capital management, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional US life insurance companies remained consistent at approximately 400%, and our holding company cash and marketable securities was $720 million at quarter end. This is all fueled by statutory operating earnings which generated $168 million and are within our range of expectations.", "Also we continue to steadily buy back our shares with the capital we are generating. We bought back another $100 million for the quarter which now brings us to $300 million for the year and into the range of our $300 million to $600 million range for the full year.", "So wrapping up, I also affirm that our 2014 outlook for growth and operating earnings per share remains in the range of 5% to 10%. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Outlook Meeting which we'll be holding in New York on December 16 and we'll begin discussing our outlook for 2015.", "Now let me turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments. Tom?", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Rick. Before we move to your questions, I'll close by reiterating that I'm very pleased actually with our overall results for this quarter, including our continued strong sales growth and premium growth, and once again this quarter excellent risk results. These all bode well for our future.", "While the current level of interest rates and bond spreads are challenging, we have managed through periods like this before and I am confident we will continue to do so. Our focus hasn't changed. We are continuing to profitably grow our business, to maintain strong margins through our disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management, and to generate capital which we'll continue to use to support the needs of our business including investing in growth opportunities we see in the market but also continuing to return capital to our shareholders.", "Now this completes our prepared remarks, and Dana, let's move to the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Seth Weiss with Bank of American Merrill Lynch.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "Can you give an update on the difference between your GAAP and stat reserves within the long-term care business?", "Tom Watjen", "Jack, would you like to take that one?", "Jack McGarry", "We said previously that the difference between GAAP and stat is over 500 million. It continues to be over 500 million. It gets wider as statutory reserves grow but it's in the normal course of things and it hasn't changed dramatically.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great, thanks. And apologies if I missed any updated sales goals guidance but can you comment on your goals for the full year in light of what's been strong growth across the businesses for the first three quarters?", "Tom Watjen", "Rick, you want to take that?", "Rick McKenney", "[Indiscernible] update our outlooks. We went back to the last year. I think what I'd tell you is, if you went back to our sales expectations going into the year, Unum US was 7% to 10%, we're handily outpacing that today and we feel very good. I think you would have heard that through the tone of all of our comments, so we can touch more on that. The UK is actually pretty flat year to date, so it's a little bit behind the goals but that's been one of the volatility from our life business, we've sold that, but third quarter results were pretty good and I think bode reasonably well for the fourth quarter.", "And lastly, Colonial Life has had great sales this year, up 9% on a year-to-date basis. We went into the year looking at 4% to 7%. So I think that Randy and team there are doing a great job in terms of sales front. So we're not going to update it for the fourth quarter, I think we gave you an indicator for the year, but needless to say I think we go on to the fourth quarter feeling pretty good about what we have accomplished thus far and how we see the year wrapping out.", "Tom Watjen", "Seth, if I could add something, once we adopted the format a few years ago of having a fairly open transparent sort of set of guidance tools and metrics that we put out there in December, we really haven't updated, I don't think Rick, any of these as we go through the course of the year. We stand by I think that guidance we provide for sales, for premium, for operating earnings and for return on equity, and I think that's kind of been our approach to this.", "So I think we don't do the updates as Rick said, not just by sales but by any of the elements of that and we stand by that outlook we provided earlier which we think was pretty comprehensive, it's pretty detailed, and as Rick said, I think if you go through all the measures we put out actually last December, you'll see for many of them we're certainly well within the range if not above the range. But again, I think we have always had a policy of just sticking with that guidance.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "That's fair enough, I appreciate the commentary. It's just fair to say that the initial guidance, it didn't contemplate some sort of slowdown in the fourth quarter, is that right, is that fair enough to say?", "Tom Watjen", "Look, actually you're talking about sales, actually sales \u2013 I don't think we had any [procedure] (ph) slowdown, I think look at all the business has I think \u2013 again, we're staying with the outlook we presented but as you can see even at this point in the year for the year to date results across many of these, we are certainly leaning very much to the high-end of that guidance if not above that guidance and we see nothing as I said in my comments that gives us any indication that some of the things we have seen with sales growth, premium growth and risk are anomaly. These are things that we have seen to have great momentum in and we think are going to carry into 2015 as well.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Erik Bass with Citigroup.", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "So you're going through your annual review of assumptions in the fourth quarter. Can you help us just think about the potential impact of low interest rates and tighter credit spreads on your long-term care reserves?", "Tom Watjen", "Maybe we do. Rick, if you don't mind, just give an overall view of interest rate management, because obviously as Rick said in his comments and I did in mine, this interest rate environment, both interest rate and spreads, is not particularly positive for our industry, and so maybe start there and then we can sort of talk about some of the other branches of that?", "Rick McKenney", "[Indiscernible] into the process, I would tell you that across the Company we go through \u2013 as you started into the question, we do go through our assumptions in a more detailed way in the fourth quarter and that process will happen as normal. You mentioned specifically interest rates across the board and I'll flip it to Jack in a second, but when you think about interest rates in the Company and how we manage them, the majority of our product lines we actually are able to price for them. So that comes into how we look at the overall interest rate management.", "One of the lines that also is impacted by interest rates would be our long-term disability line and we think about the reserves around that, and our discount rates we have talked in the past about a margin or at least a differential that we have between what we are getting from our earned yield and our discount rates, last quarter it was 90 basis points and this quarter I think it ticked up a basis point or two to 91 basis points.", "So it gives you an indication of how we manage interest rates through those different lines, and I'll flip it over to Jack to talk more specifically about long-term care, but interest rates I think broader management [indiscernible].", "Jack McGarry", "And so clearly long-term care is very sensitive to the interest rate environment, but I'd remind people that there are other important assumptions within the long-term care business as well. Morbidity and mortality are important, the ability to get rate increases in the future to respond to interest rate pressures are important. And so we are in the midst of a comprehensive review of all the assumptions related to long-term care. We are making good progress on that review. It will be part of our annual normal reserve adequacy studies. And so we expect to have more clarity on that in the fourth quarter as those studies are completed.", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "Got it. And I guess, and you didn't mention the IDI-Closed Block, is there anything we should be thinking about as it relates to that from an interest rate component?", "Tom Watjen", "Sure. Let me bring up the IDI piece which is important because when you look at our IDI block it is a significant block from an asset level perspective. The important thing to remember there though is that we are now getting effectively new cash flows. So the cash flows we get in both from premiums, coupons and bond maturities basically goes to pay claims. So when you think of the interest rate environment, we are somewhat indifferent to the interest rate environment around that because there is now new cash flow there to invest.", "And then when you talk about the Closed Disability Block, it's also going through a similar process around our reserving processes at year-end, so I don't want to leave that piece of it out, but as Jack said, these are normal processes and we continue to watch interest rates but I think there's a couple of areas where we watch it probably a little bit more closely.", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "Thanks. And just one last follow-up, because you mentioned the discount rate, I guess how should we be thinking about the decline in interest rate on your new claims discount rate, and to the extent you were to make an adjustment, how much of an impact would that have on your pricing and potential competitiveness within the industry?", "Rick McKenney", "Sure. When you think about the discount rates of that line and we have adjusted discount rates in the past, and so I'd tell you that on an annual basis 25 basis point move is a $12 million to $13 million impact. And so that's something we always look at, but once again it's highly managed that our assets relative to that discount rate, that's something we do over longer period of time, we have a healthy margin today but we have to be reflective of where we are today as well and manage that through a period of time. So discount rates are something that we always look at in that line. Maybe I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about how we impact that from a pricing perspective.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Thanks, Rick. So we would be looking at discount rate, we'd be looking at turns and incidents and severity when we're building new business pricing into a plan. So to give you a sense in 2014, because I think it's indicative of where we sort of look going forward, we are able to put about a quarter of our core group insurance business through the renewal program, about a third of our large case business through thinking as we always do pricing forward for things like aging and interest rate. We placed prices in the high single digits, and as Rick hit in his comments, overall block persistency is just about 90%.", "So we feel pretty good about the track record and the current environment to take necessary actions. As we look forward, certainly low interest rates is something that we'll factor into our pricing plans and we'll probably mean a modestly expanded renewal program in '15, but again I think the environment is one where we feel pretty confident going into that.", "Tom Watjen", "Let me add to that a little bit too. We started a pricing discussion like this on the back of still some strong returns and margins. And so maybe like, kind of like some others in our industry, our margins and our profitability are pretty strong in that line. And so therefore, pricing actions can be more temporary because they are actually only dealing with the interest rate comportment.", "The other thing I guess I'd say, Erik, too is when we go through our outlook in December that Rick referred to, we'll have this all contemplated in that outlook actually. And so I think we're obviously thinking as all you are about the fact that it looks like 2015 is going to be a difficult interest rate environment and a difficult spread environment, I think you are going to assume we start to build that in a way we think about the business, and as we share our outlook it's going to be embedded in that.", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Kind of asked and answered, I am kind of interested though on expense levels in general and what you're doing there, they did strike me as somewhat high this quarter. Did they strike you as high at all?", "Tom Watjen", "Rick, you want to touch on that at high level, and maybe we'll go to business units after that actually?", "Rick McKenney", "I don't think it struck me as high this quarter. I think it's something that as we continue invest in the business, the team here works very hard about balancing those investments with good productivity and what we saw. So you can see a little bit of volatility on a quarter to quarter but it doesn't strike me from an overall \u2013 one of the things I'd factor into that is, as we grow the business and we pay more commissions and compensation, you're going to see more expenses actually flowing through as a result of that. That's a good thing and so we can break some of that out in the future, but we feel fine about our expense there.", "Tom Watjen", "Michael, anything to that?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "For you if you ask me that I think, Tom, Rick just hit on one of the key points, it's just as we've seen sales growth accelerate, the acquisition costs associated with bringing that business on is a [indiscernible] pressure there and that's pressure that we are happy to have and deal with. The second is certainly we continue to make some capability investments in the business. So we think particularly about employee pay, those will pay really good dividends as we continue to build scale on that business. And the last one is not new in the quarter, it's a little bit more long term, but as we shift our mix of business and grow our core insurance and voluntary benefits business a bit faster, those tend to be higher OE but lower loss ratio type businesses. So we would see just a little bit of gradual movement there just natural mix.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. Rick, can you touch on the tax rate? It looked like it might have been a little bit low in the quarter.", "Rick McKenney", "Maybe a few checks. I think we have been right around 30%, Steven. I think if you go year to date, I think it's somewhere around 29.7%, 29.8%. So that's tracking within range of our expectations we would have gone for the year, so not much else to say there.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. And then one more. I realize it's volatile but the miscellaneous investment income obviously a big deal this quarter, you gave us numbers for 2Q and 3Q last year. Do you know off the top of your head what 1Q might have looked like and maybe 4Q, and that way we will at least see a run rate for the year?", "Rick McKenney", "Sure. I have that, I can give it to you. 1Q would have been around $13 million, we had $13 million, $14 million, something like that. And then year ago fourth quarter I think was closer to $20 million. So like we said, it's volatile. With $7 million this quarter you will see that volatility coming through. And although it causes a little bit of volatility on the margin, I think when you look in the aggregate, you really have to look to the underlying ROEs of our business lines which continue to be very strong.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "No, the risk results were very good. Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Suneet Kamath with UBS.", "Suneet Kamath - UBS", "Just want to start with the long term care review again in the fourth quarter. If I think back to the 2011 action that you took, part of the assumption change related to a Society of Actuaries study, I think it was lapse rates and persistency, my understanding is the next study from the SOA is not going to come out until 2015, but I believe you're getting some of that information currently. So I guess the question is, do you think that in your review this year you're going to have the updated information to take a good look at the lapse and persistency assumptions?", "Tom Watjen", "Let me object to this introduction. I think as you know, you have invested heavily in the infrastructure of your business actually. I would say today as we go through an analytical process like this, we're in a very different thought actually, and so obviously maybe we couldn't address any specific question, but let me just remind everybody what we've done to build a lot better sort of database and capability to do the work that we're doing right now actually.", "Rick McKenney", "", "Yes, and we've made a big investment over the past year and a half and the infrastructure supporting these studies, we built a state of the art modeling capability, we have invested in our data structures and our ability to access them to look at our actual experience. And so we are continuing to move forward. We are in a much different place today than we were even two or three years ago. We tend to be more reliant on our own experience, particularly related to things like lapses and persistency where we have a good exposure, we have credible data of our own. And so we will use it.", "There has been a recent publishing of preliminary SOA results on continuing some recovery trends. We have looked at that as part of our comprehensive process. We are taking that into account as we finalize our assumptions. But I would tell you it hasn't had a material impact on where we were and where we think we will come out.", "Suneet Kamath - UBS", "Got it, okay. And then I guess for Rick, with interest rates falling again, seems like we're getting into this conversation around discount rates for group disability and comparisons to other companies that have a more formula like approach to establishing the discount rate versus I think what your approach is. So I guess the question is, can you talk about the approach that you take, why you take it? And I think the other issue that comes up a lot is the fact that you use a duration weighted yield in that 90 basis point margin that you gave us. So can you talk about why you use that and what it would be if you didn't use duration weighted yield, what that margin would be?", "Rick McKenney", "Just to give you a view of just a couple of things taken into account, one is how we think about running the business too and we think about it on a basis where we are actually out in the markets, we believe in stability with our customer base and that would bring price to market and how we talk about that. I think we look at the interest rate management on a similar way where we think about it over the longer term, and you would have seen going back a couple of years ago we've adjusted discount rate a number of times to try and make sure that we keep a good spread between what our assets are yielding and what our discount rates need to be. We'll continue to do that. We're not going to do that quarter by quarter, we do it on a longer-term trajectory and you can continue to see us do that. It all comes back to just our philosophy, how we take that back to the market and introduce it through our pricing models and everything else.", "I'd also refer you back to a point in time where we were investing assets at much higher returns than our discount rates, much higher, and that's in the credit crisis when we were actually investing at high yields, we didn't let that flow through earnings, where theoretically we could have, we actually let that build up in our reserve margin. And so it's true on both sides of the equation, when things are harder as they are today and when things are better we maintain a similar philosophy around that.", "Second part of your question on the average weighted \u2013 duration weighted yields, that's a non-event for this line. This line matches up actually duration very well. So I can't give you specifically what the duration weighted and non-duration weighted is for this line but when you think about our assets and liabilities, they are actually pretty well matched in this line. We actually as part of our supplement put out a duration weighted yield. The reason is because we have so many different lines, we're trying to balance that to give you a good indicator in our supplement around what that runs like, but in a specific line such as LTD, that's really not a helpful or a differentiable metric around that. So I won't spend too much time on that, Suneet.", "Suneet Kamath - UBS", "Okay. So bottom line though, that around roughly 90 basis points or 91, I think what you're saying is if we looked at that without the duration factors, it wouldn't be dramatically different?", "Rick McKenney", "No, it would be the same. And when we actually go out and look at our 90 basis points, we actually look out over time and so we don't want to actually get to a point where we get \u2013 where that comes down too quickly and that's what you've seen us do over the last several years, is actually move on discount rate before we needed to in a sense, not getting down to a margin where we're uncomfortable. We'll continue to do that in the future.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Three quick questions on sales, specifically the non-core sales. So I think you mentioned that 70% of these sales are coming from existing customers. So the questions are; one, is that kind of true across the board, in the UK, Colonial and the US; two, what is driving the sales growth in existing customers; and three, what's driving the growth in the remaining 30% sales growth?", "Tom Watjen", "Why don't we go around each of the CEOs actually to speak that? Mike, you want to pick that one to start?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, sure. So we would have seen north of 60% of our sales for Unum US coming through and that's across lines of business and segments that we market under I'd point out, and Rick did as well, in the large end of the market it was actually a higher number than that, it was north of 70% that came from existing clients. So it's a big part of our strategy. To your question of what's driving it, it's investments in new lines of business, so building out our voluntary benefit in particular, it's individual disability line of business and it's capabilities around enrolment and re-enrollment.", "So we've got a good level of service delivery to those clients, they know us, know us well, and so our objective is to be there, be consultative and be able to grow over time. That growth we delayed for a couple of reasons. One is, it does tend to come in favorably priced to the new client acquisitions; two, it drives persistency for us. So we're quite confident that as we build out those relationships over time, it drives up our persistency. And I think that's reflected in the results that we're seeing here where any particular line we may need to take great action but we still see the overall relationship holding.", "Tom Watjen", "Randy, you want to give a little color on the Colonial rebuild?", "Randy Horn", "You bet, tom. We typically average about 65% or so of our sales in any given quarter being to existing customers. So that has not really changed much over time, and that's just a big part of our business model where we have our agency system going back to service, enforce clients, talk to new hires, introduce new product lines, that type of thing. So that's kind of just normal course of business for us.", "That being said, we are seeing very strong growth this year in new accounts sales. We were up over 20% in the third quarter, and I think that's a matter of the market conditions improving. Again we have implemented some new products here and continue to grow our agency system. So very good sales results across the board, but again a big part of our model is to keep going back and seeing existing customers and generating increasing sales growth on that side of it. So it's about a 65-35 split for us.", "Tom Watjen", "Peter, you want to touch on the UK briefly?", "Peter O\u2019Donnell", "Thanks, Tom. So sales in the third quarter were good but there was some timing switches between quarter two and quarter three. So when I look at year-to-date, as Rick said, we're sort of pretty much in line with last year. If you look at our GIP sales though, they were up about 3% which is a nice bit of growth there, and obviously our persistency is pretty good there. About one third of our sales comes through existing customers and that's pretty much a standard metric for us if you look on quarter on quarter or year to date, it's around about one-third of our sales to existing customers.", "Tom Watjen", "Did we touch the things, the issue?", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan", "Just had a question on the UK business, maybe if you could talk about market conditions there and your success in re-pricing the group life block? And then also related to that, on the reinsurance contract, do you increase your redemption this year and given that the margins there have been stabilizing should we expect you to recapture more or increase retention further in 2015?", "Tom Watjen", "Peter, you want to pick up on the market condition?", "Peter O\u2019Donnell", "So the market conditions in the UK, so we have been very successful at re-rating the block and feel very good about the business that's in force now. We still have what I would call sort of small rate increases to put through in some schemes, but I would put that into the business as usual. We are also able to be opportunistic at times where we see schemes that come to market where the competition isn't chasing volume where we can write those at reasonable margin. So you will see group life I think be volatile quarter on quarter as we pick and choose the schemes that we want to play on. So that would be the sort of overall perspective. What was the second question, sorry Jimmy?", "Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan", "Just on the reinsurance contract, you increased your redemption this year, do you expect to do or increase it further next year given that margins have been stabilizing?", "Peter O\u2019Donnell", "So we're very happy with the reinsurance contracts the way it's performed. So it's exactly what we would have wanted it to do over the past two years. Really the question comes as an economic decision for us and we are right to market at the moment, we are looking at the prices, and I will discuss that with group and the Board and say, look what's the deal on the table, and depending on how those economics look, that will drive that decision. So we will be able to update you on that I think in December when we come with our overall view of 2015.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Colin Devine of Jefferies.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "I've got three ones. Just first to clarify on the core large case, there hasn't been really any fundamental change in the strategy that Unum in any of its regions is going to become more aggressive in the large case market?", "Tom Watjen", "Mike, you want to take that one?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Sure. So actually I think Peter [indiscernible] up well. Where we see opportunities to write new clients in the [indiscernible] market here in the US, we will take advantage of it. If you looked back over six quarters, you'd see a fair amount of volatility up and down. We've put together a couple of good sales quarters here, but I would expect some volatility looking forward. I think to the heart of your question though, if you look at group sales in total for Unum US, you'd see that over three quarters of all our sales were in the core market. So while the variance was a little bit different here in the pure third quarter, we still are looking to grow the core at a faster rate.", "Rick McKenney", "Maybe I think I'd add to that actually, I think Mike, to the efforts of you and your team, we've actually got a very strong margin on our large case block now actually. So there's been quite a bit of work leading up to the last several years in terms of pruning the block. The other thing is again I think you used the statistic about 80% of our large case business was NBOC which we'll maybe speak a little bit to those two.", "Michael Q. Simonds", "Yes, so most of the growth we are getting is through expansion of the client relationship, and that's helped us along with our disciplined underwriting actually to get to strong and consistent risk returns out of that large case business. And so we're confident that we can really [grow with our] (ph) market rate, but again it's going to be opportunistic on the new sales front.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "With respect to IDI on the Closed Block, persistency seems to finally be trending down a little over last couple of years. What sort of [indiscernible] first, is that [indiscernible] just really been an aberration that we're seeing get a little weaker, we are finally seeing that block start to run off? And then I've got a final one on capital.", "Jack McGarry", "Persistency is an interesting term. Actually what's happening is as the block ages, people are retiring and [indiscernible] so they are no longer working, and we think that's going to continue to happen, that's been increasing pretty steadily over time, it will continue to increase as the block ages. So we think it's just part of the consistent maturation and runoff of the block.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "Okay. And then the final one with respect to capital management, clearly the Company is not growing exceedingly fast here, the core business lines are producing ROE, so if they don't lead the industry or is as good as it gets, Tom, can you talk about the dividend policy? I know the buybacks are fine but I think the other part of the payout ratio, it would seem to me you could support a payout ratio probably double the level that you are currently distributing?", "Tom Watjen", "Let me introduce it, Colin, then maybe I'll ask Rick to pick it up. I think as you know, our strategy on capital management has always been to have a sort of a two-pronged approach to it. Part of it is actually buybacks, part of it is actually dividend increases. I guess I've [indiscernible] by the point but I think that's always going to be our view as both of those are going to continue to contribute to our return of capital strategy to shareholders. I do think, Rick, it's safe to say that dividend has been an important piece to the puzzle, we have been continuing to grow it, but maybe you want to embellish a little bit.", "Rick McKenney", "Colin, I think the way you're looking at it is right and we look at it the same day which is our dividend policy what you would've seen the last several years, we have increased that payout ratio because we can support a higher payout ratio. And so we've seen that grow at double digits over the last five years. And so we'll continue to have that be an important part of the strategy.", "And the balancing item with that is as we look at the growth and the investment we want to have, I hear you on the growth front but actually as we look at the core operations, premiums are up 4%, we're feeling better about that, I'd like to put more capital there overall, and then as we don't see use for that capital on those two fronts or a throw in the M&A market as well, then we'll buy back shares and you saw us do that this quarter and that's been our ammo for the last several years and I think that will continue.", "But I don't want to minimize the fact that we do see an increasing payout ratio on our dividends to be important as it has been over last five years and going forward.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "First question, and I realize you are in the process, so there's not a lot you could say on it, but for the year-end review, I believe what I've heard you say over time is that expect this to be GAAP only, should not have a statutory impact. Is that still the right way to think about it?", "Tom Watjen", "Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "I don't think we've necessarily said GAAP only. We certainly would expect to the extent something happened it would be more of a GAAP event than a statutory event. We talked about earlier in the call, the difference between our statutory reserve and GAAP reserves and statutory reserves are considerably more conservative. Probably the note to that would be First Unum and some of their owners statutory requirements would be the only adjunct I would add to that statement.", "Tom Watjen", "And Tom, [indiscernible] First Unum is our New York subsidiary.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Yes, that's right. Okay, and then next question is, in some prior periods when rates have gotten pretty low, I know you all have harvested more liquidity in certain quarters and that's created some short-term NII pressure. I'm just wondering is that partly what we're seeing here as well right now?", "Rick McKenney", "So I think when you think about the overall interest rate environment, I'm not sure harvesting liquidity, but when you think about where we've been able to invest and things like that, they've been in tougher spots. So we've gone into some higher rated assets over that period of time, we've sat on some cash through some periods of time until we see the right investments out there. So that is part of what you're seeing from a net investment income perspective. And I think it just comes back to the choices that we have to invest in and where we've been able to in previous years find asset categories we like that maybe were out of flavor and we were able to get some good yields, that's been a much harder trend this year because most assets are in an overbid situation and that's just the reality of this year. So I'm not sure if it's as much liquidity, it's probably a little bit of that, I think it's just more that it's harder to find places to put money to work.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Rick, specific follow-up to that, so in the last few quarters here have you been investing in more short-term securities at present or has that not been the case, I just want to be clear?", "Rick McKenney", "Not materially, I'd say that's not the case, Tom. I would talk about higher-rated securities which can have a net investment income impact but we're looking at the relative value, and so that's all been part of this pressure that we're seeing from an overall perspective.", "Tom Watjen", "And [indiscernible] buying a lot of short assets.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Got you. And then last question just as a follow-up to Suneet's just on the duration adjusted yield, a little more just to understand how you think about this philosophically, so in the quarter duration adjusted yield went to 6.19%. If I look at cash yield or nominal bond portfolio yield, it's actually all the way down to 4.71%. So that's almost 150 basis point spread. Which one matters to you really? I know you have in the supplement this duration adjusted yield, but the 4.71% is the one that's actually flowing through the P&L. So anyway, can you talk through like why one matters or the other one doesn't to you?", "Rick McKenney", "I think that the duration weighted yield across the portfolio is an indicator in aggregate and the best way to represent what's going on across the Company. The calculation you're doing in terms of the shorter-term perspective of that, that's not really meaningful to me because we actually run it on a line by line basis, right. So whether I'm getting a higher yield than that for long-term care or lower yields from that backing some of our shorter lines, that's how we manage it. It's really a product by product perspective and it's hard to give you that in one metric. So those two metrics you have out there are right and the trend lines on those if you follow them would be similar, but we do manage this on a line by line, product line by product line basis.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "So I have a question about US traditional sort of group insurance sales, and I guess the question is sort of this way, you're not the first to report earnings results this quarter, there's been some that have preceded you, I recognize they don't represent the entire group insurance industry. However, it's just about everybody is demonstrating pretty strong sales growth, [indiscernible] talking about strong sales growth, smaller end of the quarter StanCorp, and just about everywhere in between with maybe one or two small exceptions. But the overall market certainly can't be growing at this kind of pace given what we're seeing economically, lack of employment growth or at least slow employment growth. I guess my question for you is this, who's losing the share? I'm not asking you to name names, just in general like how is this \u2013 it's so significant that it seems very stark?", "Tom Watjen", "Mike, just give a little more color again what you're seeing in the market and how we're competing actually in the market?", "Michael Q. Simonds", "I'd say generally, John, we see a mix really across the board but certainly there are some players in the market that are re-pricing their business. We know that the industry return on equity, I think it came up to one of the questions earlier, is somewhere in the single digits, and so there's work to be done in terms of pricing. So there are actually a few carriers out there where their earned premium is down and they are shutting some business. That business shows up as new sales in other places. So there's a little bit of churn within. I think it's the combination of the economy improving and some market expansion paired with some carriers that need to do some re-pricing which is generating some churn, that spits out the total industry sales numbers.", "So the way we sort of look at it is we're comfortable with the returns we're generating in the business, we're sticking with our underwriting standards, and we feel good about having that 90% persistency. So we are not feeding a lot of the churn back into the market, but I think it's the sum, the total of the two that gets you to the sales number.", "Rick McKenney", "And I think, John, we are also benefiting from our investment in our service infrastructure. So I think the quality of our relationships, I'd say Mike, are pretty much at all time high in terms of customer satisfaction and that obviously plays well into being able to expand lines of coverage and do more business with existing clients.", "The other thing I think we benefit from is our sense of stability. I think as we talk about our results this quarter and talk about the outlook as we get to the December meeting for 2015, there's not a huge change in focus actually, and this has been the case for the last five or six years. So that consistency, that stability, those are the things that I think play very well I think, Mike, in terms of how we come to market now too whereas not everybody has that same set of circumstances.", "Tom Watjen", "I was just going to interject. That seems like a pretty good point because there are some who are going through some pretty significant change.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Just one more question following up on idea of miscellaneous investment income and bond call prepayments, I guess the question I'd ask is this way, to the extent that we see rising rates it seems to me in miscellaneous investment income would stay down or start trending down, obviously on the other side of the equation though you get the opportunity to invest at highly yields which is terrific, but I guess I'm thinking more about just overall portfolio size, I mean how long do you think bond call prepayments can persist? It seems to me there will be a limit to it given once a bond is called it can't be called again.", "Rick McKenney", "Sure, maybe I'll give you some comments on that, John. I have watched this cycle for the last decade and so they do ebb and flow in terms of cycles that they go through. One of the things that I would say is true of our prepayments is while some of them are structural in nature, so it's not just somebody taking advantage of a low interest rate environment, so we have private placements that have structures within them fees, structures within them that happen as a result of M&A as an example and people retire debt.", "So interest rate is not the only reason that there is restructuring in these portfolio, but as we said you would see volatility, we've seen a lot of consistency as you look over the last three plus years but that's not to say that that will continue on that pace forever and it's something we'll call out to you as we see it. But as I've seen the cycles come and go, it's I think that's something you will see across the industry and the portfolio but I don't want to remove the fact that some of it is structural in how we invest and those will not go away.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Okay. And then last one maybe just big picture, Tom. M&A opportunities out there, we have heard now for a very long time everybody wants to own it, everybody wants a group insurance business, nobody wants to give it up. Is that still the same thing that you are continuing to see or do you think there will be an opportunity for Unum to maybe bolt-on something over the course of the next 12 or 24 months?", "Tom Watjen", "It seems like it is a continuation of the theme of what you just said. There's a lot of people who want to be in the business and increase their scale and there doesn't seem to be many who want to part with their business. But as we said earlier, there's an awful lot of challenges for some carriers as they go through sort of trying to sort out how do you actually effectively do this business. It's one thing to say you want to be in it, but can you actually manage the business both operationally and financially.", "And so, I don't think, Rick, we're assuming any M&A activity but we're certainly staying very close to the marketplace. It feels like it's going to be more that there's not as more buyers than sellers, but we're going to continue hanging around the rim to use the basketball term. But I think the other side of that is we don't need to do M&A to fulfil some of the objectives that we have laid out.", "So if it happens, it's great, we do have the financial and operational resources to do things, we are also very, very careful to stay within the framework of the things we know well, and again we don't have to do it for us to achieve some of the objectives that we've laid out, but there's always hope.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Okay. And I guess fair to say too that maybe some of the higher level of sales is effectively a small version of M&A as some of these companies are maybe struggling and losing business?", "Tom Watjen", "Absolutely. And again, I think certainly again, if there is an M&A opportunity, we want to take a look at it, but there's another way also that sees on some of these opportunities which is just in the marketplace, and I think [indiscernible] several of our businesses.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "I want to just dig into sales a little bit more and kind of I guess compare and contrast with some competitors who have had weaker sales this quarter. So kind of thinking of AFLAC and also CNO and Torchmark, a little bit different products, different distributions, but the sense I'm getting from them is a lot of challenges, and so this is really geared towards Colonial, a lot of challenges from distraction from ACA, kind of a better economy means it's harder for them to recruit, and I'm not sure if your independent contractor model shields you from that, hearing there's a lot of competition even for people who are selling life and supplemental health among new entrants into those markets. So I guess I was just kind of curious for more kind of understanding your texture on how you're getting better sales numbers as all these other folks are kind of struggling given all the items I mentioned?", "Tom Watjen", "Yes, Randy, we're always \u2013 as you are alluding to, we're cautious, not to speak to specific competitors, but maybe Randy, you could talk about lots of things we've been doing too because it's really more about I think the things that we've been doing that have been behind the results that you have seen from Colonial and maybe to touch on some of those things in response to Randy's question.", "Randy Horn", "Happy to. I think it really boils down for us to just consistency and focus, and primarily having a focus on our agency distribution system, and this is the channel that we go to market with. We work through that channel on both the direct sales side and the smaller end of the market and then work with them in terms of partnering with brokers as they go upmarket, and we think very importantly, Randy, this helps us avoid any channel conflict.", "So we've not had to deal with any ups and downs and stresses and strains about distribution. It's just been a very singular approach for us and I think that's worked well. From there it's just really a sound execution of the fundamentals in that agency system. Our recruiting continues to be very strong, we're up about 16% with new agent recruits here in 2014, and I think more importantly we're seeing the production from those new recruits very strong, up over 40%.", "So we're very encouraged there, we continue to improve the effectiveness of our training programs and our overall sales support, and again that's led to a strong growth in the number of producing agents and the number of producing sales units that we have out in the field. So, all of that has just led to increasing activity levels, more appointments and a strong increase in the number of closed cases.", "As far as the market environment, Randy, we are seeing a gradual improvement in the economy. Still some pressure in terms of new hires in that small end of the market, but other than that we are seeing more and more employers opening up to changes in their benefit programs, introducing voluntary benefits. Most of them are moving beyond the Affordable Care Act implementation and in fact we're seeing strong growth in a number of our products that very much complement those changes to major medical programs, strong sales of critical illness for example in our accident products.", "So all of this has really led to very broad-based growth in sales force here in 2014, both on new and existing accounts. In all of our market segments we're seeing a very strong double-digit growth. So we're very optimistic about the fundamentals of our business and we have a very optimistic sales outlook. So hopefully that answers it for you, Randy.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Yes, it's certainly helpful. I guess the one follow-up would be, I mean so 16% on new agent recruits, that's also kind of a best in class number, at least among these publicly traded guys, have you changed the way you recruit at all including I mean like covering their expenses or sign-on bonuses or do you have a new IT systems or anything that's kind of changed, or is it all just status quo as far as the recruiting process goes?", "Randy Horn", "I'd put it in the fine-tuning category, Randy. We're always tweaking a little bit around the edges in terms of new approaches and how we connect digitally as well as face-to-face, that type of thing, but in terms of financing or different commission rates or something like that really no significant changes, it's just staying focused on it. We of course have established goals for all of our sales managers to hit when it comes to recruiting, and then I think most importantly then providing a great opportunity with good training and the opportunity to make a great living, and I think the word spreads rapidly out in the marketplace.", "Rick McKenney", "If I could just add too, I think a little bit of what, as I answered to John's earlier question too, just the stability and consistency of the things we do actually is incredibly important in the marketplace and it's also important to Colonial's business. People know what we stand for, they know how we value the distribution system and obviously we continue to innovate and add new things as we go through time, and obviously for those who haven't seen it the sponsorship at Colonial with Shark Tank for example is a good example of those kind of things where we are stepping out. But still I think that stability and consistency is one of those things where I think our organization is certainly domestically is being rewarded for.", "Tom Watjen", "I think we're bumping up against the hour here. I know people have some other things to move to. So let me just say, thank you for taking the time to join us this morning and we look forward to seeing many of you hopefully in our mid-December Outlook Meeting in New York, and operators will conclude our third quarter operating earnings call.", "Operator", "Thank you.

", "And now, I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning everybody. The fourth quarter was a good one for the company, with operating earnings per share, excluding the special items outlined in our release, of $0.90 per share, an increase of 5.9% over last year. This brought our fully operating earnings per share to $3.55, a growth rate of 6.9%, in line with 5% to 10% outlook for growth we provided coming into 2014. These results largely reflect the positive operating trends we have been highlighting throughout the year; that is strong sales momentum, accelerating premium growth in our core businesses, and stable risk experience. This quarter we also took the appropriate actions necessary to deal with the impact of low interest rates on our businesses, particularly long term care, and we\u2019ll cover that in more detail in a moment. ", "But for now let me highlight a few points before turning things over to Rick for his more detailed remarks. First, we again saw excellent sales results across all of our core businesses this quarter, continuing a trend we have been building throughout 2014. Unum U.S sales increased by 25% for the quarter and 21% for the full year, with strong results across all product areas and all sectors of the markets we serve. Likewise the Colonial Life, sales this quarter were also strong, increasing 15.7% for the quarter and 11.6% for the full year, again with solid performance across all market segments. And finally, Unum UK sales continued to rebound this quarter, increasing 27.8% for the quarter in local currency.", "These solid results across all three of our businesses reflects the strength of our competitive position in our markets and today\u2019s generally more favorable conditions. Second, these strong sales trends over the past few quarters, combined with improved persistency in most of our business lines and our ongoing focus on managing renewals in our in-force block, has resulted in accelerated premium growth. For all of our core business segments combined, premium income grew by 5.7%, the strongest we\u2019ve seen in several years and each business contributed. Unum US premiums grew 5.8%, Colonial Life increased 4.2% and Unum UK increased 10.5% in local currency. This growth has not come from any meaningful economic recovery, but instead is primarily the result of adding new customers and expanding our relationships with existing customers.", "And finally, we continue to see strong, stable operating margins and returns in our core business segments. These results help us maintain the financial flexibility needed to both support our business needs, including support the growth we\u2019re having, while also returning capital to our shareholders. Our primary challenge and one faced by all those in our industry is present low interest rate environment, which we don\u2019t expect to abate anytime soon. This quarter we took steps necessary to manage through this environment, both with the Closed Block LPC reserve actions, as well as the new claim reserve discount rated adjustment in our Unum US LTD business. I would add that we do this from a position of strength, with industry leading operating margin and significant financial flexibility. ", "Before I turn the call over to Rick, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the release issued yesterday announcing the leadership changes here at Unum. After 12 of the absolute best years of my life serving as the CEO of this company, I\u2019ve announced that I will be retiring at this year\u2019s annual meeting. This is something that we all are well prepared for. The board and leadership team has spent considerable amount of time on succession planning over the last five to six years. I'm very pleased that Rick McKenney, who as you know is our CFO and internally chairs our operating committee, will become president and join our board, April 1st and will succeed me as CEO at our annual meeting in May. And Jack McGarry, currently president and CEO of our Closed Block, will succeed Rick as CFO on April 1st and we have an excellent plan in place to fill Jack\u2019s current role as head of the Closed Block, which obviously remains a critical area of focus for the company. ", "The board and I have great confidence in Rick, Jack and our whole team and I can assure you that we won\u2019t miss a beat. It will be a very smooth transition and I step back from active management knowing that Unum is in good hands and poised for even better things ahead. Now, to me, the board asked me to continue as part of the board for the next two years and to assume the chairman\u2019s role at the annual meeting. My focus will be on fulfilling my new role as chairman and helping to assure we have continuity at both the board and management levels. ", "Now I'm happy to answer any questions you have here, but for now let\u2019s get back to the discussion of our strong fourth quarter and full year results and for that I\u2019ll turn things back over to Rick.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Tom and thanks for the comments and I very much look forward to the opportunity. As far as our investors are concerned, I expect a very smooth transition. You can also expect continuation of the execution on the strategy which you have become accustomed to with Unum, which is one of disciplined growth. ", "Let me turn back to our discussion on what was a very good quarter. I\u2019ll start first with Unum US, where in total fourth quarter operating earnings declined by 2.2% to $212.4 million, with favorable premium growth that Tom mentioned offset by lower net investment income and our change in discount rate that we talked about. The overall benefit ratio for the segment was stable at 71.3%, which we will dissect by each business line. ", "Operating income in our group disability business declined to $66.7 million from $68.9 million a year ago. Premium income increased by 5.7% on strong sales and improved persistency. While the benefit ratio increased to 83.7% in the quarter, from 83.2% a year ago and 82.1% in the third quarter. As we indicated at our investor meeting in December, we reduced the new claim reserve discount rate in our LTD line in the fourth quarter by 50 basis points, causing a reduction in operating earnings of $6.6 million and elevating the benefit ratio by 1.2%. ", "Clearly, today\u2019s low interest rate environment was the driver of this decision and is also the driver of the lower net investment income as the portfolio yield continues to decline, given the lower new money investment yields. While the impact of lower yields was offset somewhat by higher miscellaneous net investment income this quarter, the interest rate environment continues to create ongoing pressures. As we had discussed previously, we managed this impact by gradually reprising our in-force business through the renewal process, which we\u2019ll continue to do in 2015 and also through pricing adjustments to new business. From an underlying risk perspective, we did experience slightly higher claim size in the fourth quarter that was consistent with our longer term expectations and experience. ", "Group Life and AD&D results also declined slightly year-over-year. Premium income growth continues to accelerate, increasing 6.7% in the fourth quarter, but the benefit ratio was slightly higher at 7.8% compared to 70% in both a year ago and previous quarters. ", "In the supplemental and voluntary lines, operating earnings were relatively flat at $85.3 million, compared to $85.8 million a year ago. Premium income increased 5% while risk trends in both lines were generally stable. Overall, despite the pressure from lower investment income and the discount rate adjustment, it was a solid quarter for the Unum US segment, with operating ROE remaining in the 13% to 14% range, well above industry averages in the group business. ", "Looking at Unum UK, operating earnings were \u00a324.1 million for the fourth quarter, up almost 9% from the year ago quarter. Our risk results were solid in both the Group Disability and Group Life business, which helped the benefit ratio improve to 68.9% this quarter, compared to 73% in the year ago quarter. The margins remain in very good shape for Unum UK, which generated an operating ROE of slightly over 18% for the year. ", "Colonial Life continued to generate strong, consistent results with operating earnings increasing 7.1% in the fourth quarter to $74.3 million. Claim experience remained generally stable with the benefit ration at 52.3% for the fourth quarter, compared to 52.4% in the year ago quarter. Net investment income benefited from favorable miscellaneous net investment income in the quarter. The underlying profitability of Colonial Life remains excellent, producing an operating ROE in the 16% to 17% range for both the fourth quarter and full year. ", "Rounding out the enterprise with the Closed Block; with the completion of our reserve review and long-term care, we booked a reserve strengthening in line with the expectations we provided at our investor meeting in December. The addition to GAAP reserves was $698 million or $454 million after tax. The assumptions behind the change are consistent with what we discussed at our meeting back in December, with the net effect of the charge largely reflecting our expectation that interest rates will remain low over the next four to five years before gradually returning to more historic levels. In addition, the statutory impact from our year end LTC reserve work for $67 million. This is included in our capital position at year end 2014 and reflected on our 2015 capital plans. Excluded in the impact of the reserve charge, operating earnings for the Closed Block were $30 million in the quarter, compared to $26.8 million in the year ago quarter. ", "Risk results were generally in line with our long-term expectations. In the LT block, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 89.6% for the fourth quarter, towards the higher end of our 85% to 90% range due to unfavorable mortality that we saw in the quarter. For the full year 2014, the interest adjusted benefit ratio for long-term care was 85.9%, reflecting the more favorable results we experienced in the block earlier in the year. ", "In the Closed Disability block, we saw much better performance in the fourth quarter, primarily from lower claim incidents after experiencing a higher level of volatility than normal in previous quarters, with the interest adjusted benefit ratio at 81% for the fourth quarter and 83.6% for the full year 2014. ", "I\u2019ll move now to our sales and growth trends across the company. As Tom highlighted in his remarks, we are very pleased with the results this quarter and for the full year. In Unum US, total sales increased by 25% in the fourth quarter and 21% for the full year, a very strong set of results. The growth was well balanced between growth in the core group market under 2000 employees, which increased by 23% this quarter, and our large case business which increased by almost 35%. ", "It\u2019s important to note that the bulk of our large case growth came from existing customer relationships, where our understanding of the case is much better. The growth was also well balanced by product lines, with LTD sales increasing 39% on strong growth in the core market segment, Short-Term Disability increasing 10% and Group life and AD&D increasing by almost 27% on opportunistic sales in the large case market, primarily to existing customers. ", "In addition, sales in Voluntary Benefits grew by 21% and by 3% in the individual disability line. In addition to the strong sales momentum, our persistency for Unum US remains very encouraging, increasing to 90.5% for our group benefit lines, which include long-term disability, short-term disability and life and for the full year 2014, from 87.7% from the full year of 2013. ", "The net results, combined with our ongoing renewal pricing strategy, generated premium growth for Unum US this quarter of 5.8%m the strongest rate of growth in several years. I\u2019d also emphasize Tom\u2019s comments that we continue to see only slight improvements to premium growth from the economy and employment trends. ", "Likewise the Colonial Life, we again had very good sales results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter increased by 15.7%, primarily driven by growth in the core commercial and public sector markets. Full year 2014 sales increased by 11.6%, the strongest annual rate of growth since 1990. New and existing account sales growth were both strong as we focused on recruiting and the development of quality sales reps, along with continually emphasizing reworking our existing account base. ", "Persistency for Colonial Life primary product lines was stable to slightly higher for the year, helping to drive overall premium growth in the fourth quarter of 4.2%, the highest quarterly rate since 2012. ", "Finally, in the UK, sales increased by almost 28% in the fourth quarter, following an increase of 15% in the third quarter. Group Disability sales continued to build momentum, while our group life sales are re-emerging off of low results while we were repositioning that business for better profitability. Also, we are seeing much better levels of persistency in 2014. Persistency for Group Disability improving to 90.1% from 82.2% the year before and persistency in the life block improving to 76% from 66.7% the year before. ", "Overall, a very strong quarter and encouraging quarter for our growth rate in our core business segments. And importantly, we are also happy with the pricing we\u2019re getting on the business that we are selling today. As I said earlier, we are continuing to see some evidence of improved topline growth from better employment and economic trends. However, that benefit does not appear to be accelerating. ", "My comments on our investment results mirror my comments from the past several quarters; that is continuous solid asset quality for the portfolio, but continued declines in our portfolio yield as new money investment opportunities remain difficult. While we remain disciplined in our asset selection, we also remain disciplined in balancing the decisions we make on discount rate changes and associated pricing actions. Our move this quarter with our long term disability business reflects that disciple as we put in place a 50 basis point reduction with an eye towards maintaining a healthy interest margin in new reserves. ", "Looking at capital management, we estimate that the weighted average risked based capital ratio for our traditional US life insurance companies, finished 2014 at just over 100%, and our holding company cash and marketable securities was $575 million. This comes from statutory operating earnings of $680 million for 2014 that are within our range of expectations. ", "Wrapping up, I want to affirm our 2015 outlook for growth and operating earnings per share in a range of 2% to 5%. I wouldn\u2019t say that with the sharp move down in rates we\u2019ve seen since our outlook meeting, it would pressure us to the lower end of that range, but we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out in the coming month. Also in closing, I'd like to remind you that as of January 1, we\u2019ve adopting new accounting standards for investments and qualified affordable housing projects, which will reduce earnings by $0.04 in both 2014 and 2013 restated. We\u2019ll post the details on our website by next week. Overall it summarizes a very good quarter with an improving topline. ", "Let me turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.", "Tom Watjen", "Thanks Rick. Before we move to your questions, I\u2019ll close by just repeating that we\u2019re very pleased with our overall results this quarter and for 2014. Our strong sales persistency and premium growth, along with stable risk experience, set us up well for the future. Without question, the current level of interest rate is challenging, but we are confident that we are taking the necessary steps to manage effectively in this environment. Our focus hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to profitably grow our business to maintain strong margins through our disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management and to generate capital which we can continue to use to support the needs of our business, including investing where necessarily to support growth, but also obviously continue to return capital to our shareholders. ", "Now this completes our prepared remarks and Debbie, let\u2019s move to the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Good mooring everybody. Congratulations, Tom and everybody. I want to talk about \u2013 I guess probably, Rick I should probably know this, but in the statutory operating earnings that you show and net earnings in your capital, is Unum included in there?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes, First Unum is included in there.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay, so my understanding, in the investor day, you talked about $150 million stat charge for First Unum for LTC reserves. I think came out a little bit bigger. How do you get to $149 million that came to operations with that kind of stat charge in First Unum?", "Tom Watjen", "Yeah. Actually the stat charge that we have in First Unum is a direct move to capital. So it doesn\u2019t flow through the operating earnings that you\u2019d see in First Unum .Although it is included in those results, that actually movement in reserves flowed straight through the capital line.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. And then following up the non-First Unum stat charge, the $57 million, it was my impression I think from the investor day that a stat charge was unlikely and that there was significant margin if interest rates stayed where they were for a long time. Do we take away from this that that\u2019s not the case?", "Tom Watjen", "Jack, you want to take that one up?", "Jack McGarry", "Yeah. We talked about it on investor day that this was largely a GAAP charge. As we work through and settled all the reserved numbers across the difference entities, this charge emerged. My view is it really doesn\u2019t change anything we said at investor day. We are still very comfortable with our GAAP reserves. We still have a decent margin between our GAAP and stat reserves. All these charges, First Unum and the $57million were built into our capital plans for 2015 and so were reflected in our estimates for share buyback and free cash flow generation.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. Jack, one more if I may on this topic and then I'll turn it over. The $57 million, was that claims reserves or ALR?", "Jack McGarry", "It was both.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "It was both. Okay, thank you guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Good morning and congratulations from us as well to everyone that transitioned. I just want -- I had a couple of questions on that last night. Can you give us some perspective on why announce the transition now? I know it wasn\u2019t related to the fourth quarter charge, but if you just clarify that, it would be helpful.", "Tom Watjen", "Yeah, and I do run the risk, Jay of over answering a little bit here because I want to step you back a little bit. We as a company have spent an awful a lot of time on leadership development and succession planning actually for a number of years. And not just the management team, but obviously the board has been very heavily engaged in that process and while it\u2019s maybe not glamorous work, it's essential if you are going to have good continuity and continue to maintain the principles that are important to the company, which we believe strongly in. In fact, actually if you look back over the last couple of investor meetings, you would have seen windows into our thought process back in 2013 as you may recall. ", "Kevin McCarthy has announced his retirement. We are going through a good, smooth transition of that responsibility to Mike Simonds. This past year we talked about Randy Horn stepping out of the Colonial C.E.O. position and a smooth transition to Tim Arnold. And so I guess my point is this has been a continuum of work that we as a management team and a board has done. And obviously over the years the succession of the C.E.O. has to be part of the discussion with the board as well. In this case it wasn\u2019t about age or health obviously. It really was more about when it just felt right. And just the three things I think that were important in my mind is when it just felt right were number one, feeling good about the leadership team and having a leadership team in play that has plenty of runway still ahead and they can run this business very effectively for the next five to 10 plus years. Obviously we feel very strongly that\u2019s the case.", "The second thing is where the company actually is on a good trajectory and not just one quarter or one year, but an extended period of time of solid performance. And I think some of us feel very strongly that\u2019s been the case. But then lastly is how do you make the appropriate exit after having been in the role for 12 years? And that\u2019s where I think being able to find some way to stay connected to my board activity was a part of that discussion. I think the point was this is a continuum. It\u2019s one that we\u2019ve been heavy engaged in now for five or six years. And so there\u2019s nothing magic about this particular day other than feeling as though all the stars are properly aligned. Again I feel very good about what we announced yesterday. And as we all said in our comments, we are going to have a very smooth transition of leadership.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "Thank you for that. Okay. On the topic of fourth quarter, sales growth again was particularly strong year over year. I'm just wondering if your 2015 sales growth outlook might prove conservative if any of that momentum continues into this year.", "Tom Watjen", "It might be good to go business by business if we could actually, Jay because obviously the fundamental of each business is different a little bit. But maybe, Mike maybe just speak to Unum US sales outlook.", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah. I think the bottom line, quick answer, Jay is I think that the guidance is still a good guidance. We had a line of sight to what the pipeline for fourth quarter looked like when we established that. So I don\u2019t see the big changes there. Just as a quick refresher, we do anticipate good, solid 6% to 8% sales growth across most of our segments, in particular the core market group insurance segment and our long term benefits segment. The offset to that to a degree is the large case market. We had a very good year in 2014, but we do view that as an opportunistic place to write business.", "We saw rates harden a bit as some competitors needed to re-price their books. We certainly have the capacity and the desire to repeat 2014 in the large case market if we can do so within our disciplined pricing parameters, though our business plan isn\u2019t built around that. We\u2019re anticipating a bit of a decline to the tune of about10% and the net is that sales guidance around 2% to 4%, which I think still holds true. We feel good about what we bring to market. It\u2019s really more where is the market itself going to be? And that\u2019s a little bit of a wild card. ", "Tom Watjen", "Tim, you want to touch on the Colonial Life?", "Tim Arnold", "Sure. Yeah, we feel very good about the results when we finished last year. As Rick mentioned it's the highest growth rate in the company since 1990. With the rate at the market conditions overall, we feel good about our sales team. We feel good about the value prop that we bring to the market and the receptivity there. Good progress across all of our market segments, but we still feel comfortable with the range we\u2019ve given before, 6% to 8% on the sales side.", "Tom Watjen", "And Peter, just last on the UK?", "Peter O\u2019Donnell", "Similar to Mike really, I think in terms of 2014, we actually outperformed a little bit in the fourth quarter. We had a large one off transaction which gave a nice clean through a round the claims buyout which gave us a bit of a following win for that fourth quarter. So that was a little better than we expected. When I look at the sales outlook, we had 7% to 9% in 2015. Still looking at that, I think that\u2019s still challenging particularly given the interest rate environment where our discipline and what we stand for is we will continue to put rate through and it depends on the competitor reaction on that. But How I feel that\u2019s good today.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next Suneet Kamath with UBS", "Suneet Kamath - UBS", "Good morning. Again our congratulations as well to the team. Just wanted to go back to the Unum US LTD sales growth, I think it was 25%. I know you guys manage the pricing of new business relative to the discount rate. But I just wanted to confirm that the discount rate adjustment that you are making here in the fourth quarter, was that already reflected in the pricing that you put out to achieve this 25% sales growth rate?", "Tom Watjen", "Mike?", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah. So we would -- if you think about the sales cycle, it depends on the market segment that you\u2019re in, but if you\u2019re in group insurance you think about the sales cycle in a three months range. Where we see interest rates three to six months back, that\u2019s where sales are coming on. But then we feel actually very good and Rick made it in the opening statements. We feel very good about the pricing level of new business that\u2019s coming on. But just as Peter was saying as we look forward into 2015 and we talked about this in our guidance meeting, we are going to move new business rates up. ", "We have been thinking low to mid and I think probably mid is better in terms of where you\u2019ve been at with interest rates over the period of time since the end of last year. Again feel good about the business that\u2019s coming on. We\u2019ll move it up again and it will depend a bit on the market and the market conditions as how much that slows the sales growth. But again we feel pretty good about where we are at and the ability to price new business and to renew business over the next year or two to where interest rates are.", "Suneet Kamath - UBS", "Okay, thanks. And then I guess on Group disability and the loss ratio, I think there was a comment in the prepared remarks about seeing higher claims maybe relative to the year ago. I just want to get some color in terms of what you\u2019re seeing, where it came from and whether or not you expect that will persist going forward", "Tom Watjen", "Mike?", "Michael Simonds", "Yes, sure. We saw a little bit of volatility in the average size of new claims, but actually pretty much within the long term expectations. Other key factors submitted incidents bounced around a little bit quarter to quarter, but paid incidents has been very steady. And then just recovery performance offsets have been rock solid. I'd say, overall we were actually pretty happy with that continued consistency out of the risk line for LTD.", "Suneet Kamath - UBS", "Okay and then just the last one for me on your capital generation model, I guess for Rick or Jack. If sales are at a level that\u2019s persisting here, the $150 million of capital uses that you guys talk about between interest expense and growth funding, should we still expect that to be a pretty good number at these sales levels or could there be some upward pressure in terms of capital requirements if growth remains strong?", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks, it's Rick. Actually it's a very good question and we are seeing sales results. And I\u2019d go back to the some of the things we talked about from an overall capital perspective. The first place we want to put our capital is back in our business. We are doing that and I think that we\u2019re very happy about the premium growth. I would tell you that where we sit today, we don\u2019t see a noticeable difference in term of how that impacts the capital plan. We continue to grow at these type of rates and you\u2019ve heard that we are a little bit more metered. As we look out over the course of the year, you might start seeing some of that. But that\u2019s a situation that we want to have and actually put more capital right back into our business. But as we sit here today, I don\u2019t think that alters our capital plans.", "Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Good morning and congratulation, Tom. The voluntary benefits, the sales there are quite strong. How does that fit in or is there a connection with the economy pricking up perhaps a little bit, a little more flexibility in terms of insurance arrangements at a lot of small businesses. Is that momentum going to continue in 2015?", "Tom Watjen", "As you know, Mark, we\u2019ve got two windows into that business. And maybe Mike talk to the Unum U.S perspective and then Tim following on the Colonial Life piece.", "Michael Simonds", "Yes, sure. Thanks Mark for the question. On voluntary, we are seeing a little bit of tailwind on a couple of fronts. We\u2019ve seen participation at the plan level improved just a bit. I wouldn\u2019t say dramatically, but certainly as consumers have a little bit more disposable income as the economy improves, oil prices are a bit lower, that helps us. We are seeing good cross selling into our existing group insurance line. That\u2019s been a big driver to expanding voluntary through those relationships. And then new clients coming on to the voluntary benefits line. Sales were up about21% in the quarter. It was a good year. Overall I\u2019d say the pipeline looks good. That will be one of our faster growing businesses within that 3% to 4% range we talked about.", "Tim Arnold", "For Colonial Life, we are seeing improvement in the economy coming through in our sales results, especially in the small case market. We believe that small businesses are beginning to rebound a bit with hiring in the less than 500 life segment last quarter. Our sales growth was north of 22%. And so we are seeing more traction in that marketplace. We are also seeing a continued need for the products that we manufacture based on changes happening in the medical industry. High deductibles create a need for a lot of our products. And we also believe that our mission to protect America\u2019s workers is resonating in the field. We feel good about the marketplace and the momentum.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "I think you made the comment and this is more macro, some evidence of better underlying natural growth, but not accelerating. Anything you want expand on that?", "Tom Watjen", "I was going to say, Mark from the comments we did say that. So you\u2019re thinking that the one percentage type of range, maybe even a little bit under that. We haven\u2019t seen it accelerating. It\u2019s been consistent. Mike, if you could add to that in terms of the natural growth.", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah. The two levers for us in coverage payroll are the number of employees going up and then it\u2019s salary that is covered for disability and life insurance that can be leveraged off of income. And as Rick said, we\u2019ve seen probably a little bit more on the number employed. We\u2019ve seen a little bit weaker in terms of the growth on income.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "On normal times that should be what, 3% maybe?", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah. We would see 2%, somewhere ranging around that, up or down a little bit.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ", "Good morning and congratulations to all as well. When you lowered your discount rates, interest rates were probably 40, 50 basis points higher than they are today. So, if we got the 10 year staying where it is, or 30 year, whatever rate that you look at that have come down from when you set the discount rate for this year, should we look for a headwind going into 2016?", "Tom Watjen", "Rick, you want to take that?", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, certainly, Bob. What I would actually say is and that\u2019s what I was trying to articulate around our overall view o\\in the earnings, I think as interest rates stay here relative to what we talked to you about in December, there are headwinds and we view them as that. And so those are things that we will have to evaluate as we get out on the year because what we reflected in December certainly was the current environment, which was about 50 basis points different than it is today. We will have to evaluate that as we get out towards the back half of the year.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ", "So it would be potentially you might do the discount rate again during the course of the year if rates stay where they are or you wait for the renewals, there\u2019s not much you can do over the year?", "Rick McKenney", "I think that\u2019s going to get an answer as we go through the year. It\u2019s still pretty early, Bob and we just got through that process of going through the discount rate adjustments. So it\u2019s early to speculate on what we are going to do in the back half of the year.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ", "But I\u2019m saying you do have flexibility to adjust pricing midyear as well if you had to?", "Michael Simonds", "Bob, this is Mike. Absolutely. And so we actually -- we looked at it on a semiannual basis and frankly a little bit even more frequent than that on tactical changes. So that\u2019s certainly implied.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ", "And the pound is also a headwind as well after being a helpful item for last year. Is that sort of baked into your accounts and how much of penalty for currency from UK do you see?", "Tom Watjen", "Rick, do you want to touch that?", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah. So we have seen that headwind. So we often talk about our results for the UK on a pound basis because it\u2019s hard to chase around the currency level. But as we roll that through in our EPS and what we\u2019ve factored in going into next year, is a level of 155 on the rate, which I think we are a little bit lower than that as we sit in today. But that\u2019s what we\u2019ve factored into our forward look.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ", "So slight headwind if it stays at 152?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes, slight.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ", "Okay. Got you, thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Jimmy Buhler with J.P Morgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan", "So you reported fairly strong sales across the board, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just competitive conditions in the US disability market as you\u2019ve gone through the January renewals and what you\u2019ve seen competitors do in terms of pricing.", "Tom Watjen", "Mike?", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah, sure. So it certainly remains a competitive landscape and I think that\u2019s true in group insurance and voluntary benefits as well. We still certainly see some players out there that are looking to grow share or in some cases actually recover some share using price as a lever, but on balance. And this is similar to what we would have talked about over the last couple of quarters. We have seen, I would say a gradual hardening in rates in the market. We\u2019ve got some sizeable players that are looking to improve the margins on their books and get their ROEs up from where we think industry averages are sort of in the mid-single digits. On balance it\u2019s actually been a more favorable environment, a completive one, but a bit more favorable.", "Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan", "And then on margins, your results have been fairly stable the last several years. But as the economy recovers, are you seeing any improvement in claims incidence trends, or recovery trends, what is your expectations are there?", "Michael Simonds", "I\u2019d say we work pretty hard to diversify the book. And heading into the downturn of the economic cycle, we begin to see a deterioration in our claim incidents, in recovery rates offsets. And so I think as things begin to improve albeit very gradually, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate a big swing towards a more favorable outcome. Consistency is probably the best guess,", "Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then just lastly a cross-section on your EPS guidance. I think you mentioned you are more comfortable with the low end of the 2% to 5% range given the environment. So I was wondering, are you -- when you talk about growth, are you talking off of the 355 for 2014 that you reported, or the lower number given the change in accounting for low income housing credits?", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, it\u2019s actually -- Jim, when you look at that, it\u2019s actually going to be off of the adjusted number that we are looking at, but that\u2019s going to be re-casted for 2014. So we\u2019ll have that \u2026", "Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan", "You\u2019ll still be around 351 you are guessing?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes. So it\u2019s going to be the $0.04 cents so it should be roughly 351. We\u2019ll have that out there shortly for you.", "Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning and congratulations as well from us here at Deutsche. So a couple of quick questions here. What took up the expense ratio across all the core business segments this quarter?", "Tom Watjen", "Rick.", "Rick McKenney", "Actually, it\u2019s a good news story Yaron when you look at it. Most of that is compensation given the higher sales levels that we saw. So that\u2019s one of those expense lines that we don\u2019t mind paying out there. We\u2019d like to see that as part of our higher sales.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then could you quantify the variable or miscellaneous investment income, what kind of impacted that?", "Rick McKenney", "Certainly. I actually talked about that across a couple of our lines. Just to give you a sense of that. We run roughly in the $15 million a quarter range, at least we have over the last several years. And so this quarter we actually saw an uptick of that in the $7 million, $8 million range, something like that. What I\u2019d remind you, last quarter we saw a down tick of $7 million, $8 million. It varies around that $15 million level. We did see a higher level in the quarter. Maybe a little bit north of that $8 million that I mentioned, but it\u2019s \u2013 we factored it through our results and we\u2019re just going to wait that volatility to go through, but nothing new to note there.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then one final one and I apologize if I missed this, but of the $700 million GAAP preserve strengthening in long-term care, how much of that was interest rate related?", "Michael Simonds", "The $700 million was virtually all interest rate related. There were some pluses and minuses on the liability side. Some of those, they went in opposite directions. They were largely offset. I think you can pretty much assume all of that is an interest rate charge.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Randy Binner with FBR Capital markets.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hey, morning. Congrats too on the long term carry on Unum. I just wanted to clean up a question I think from Steve Schwartz which was a kind of getting into the element of this charge that moved out of GAAP and into stat. I apologize if I missed it. I haven\u2019t been able to parse that out from the disclosures. Was there an element of stat charging? Can you remind us of what that was versus the GAAP items that have been discussed?", "Rick McKenney", "Maybe I'll take a shot of that, Randy. When you look at the $57 million that we recorded that I mentioned, these are a lot of moving pieces as we went through that reserve charge process. On the GAAP side we articulated it and as Jack just said, it's mostly interest rates. As you move around the different pieces as well, you can have some stat impact fall out of that. It\u2019s nothing that I would know more than the amount of movement that happened as part of that charge and the $57 million was very much contemplated as part of our overall capital results in 2014, our capital plans in 2015.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "All right and that 57 is all in the First Unum, the New York?", "Tom Watjen", "It's actually in multiple of entities. That\u2019s just part of the noise that came out of the process with the different entities that moved around.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, but similar to the rates. And then I think one of the topics that\u2019s been discussed in the past is kind of sizing the delta between the GAAP and the stat reserves or capital, either one. And the long term carrier, is that something you can update us on just to kind of think about what the potential risk would be if there was another review? And maybe help us understand what the process would be for another kind of comprehensive review on long term care given that rates are lower than when you went through the planning process on this?", "Michael Simonds", "So the stat-GAAP difference we\u2019re talking about it being in the several hundred million dollar range at the investor meeting. That\u2019s still applicable. That\u2019s where it is. I would say in general over the last several years, statutory reserves have grown faster than GAAP reserves. And so it's likely over the pursuing years that that would continue to grow. We looked at the interest rate charge. There\u2019s a long term charge. We said interest rates would stay low for the next four to five years and then revert to the mean. The view is it\u2019s more of how long that charge lasts given the current interest rate environment which has moved against us even since. But we still think it's a stable place. It has a lot of factors in it including where spreads are, opportunities in different asset classes and things. We are comfortable. We talked about biting off a three to five year horizon. We are still comfortable with that. Clearly the current interest rate environment pushes it towards the front of that as opposed to towards the back.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Erik Bass with Citigroup", "Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi. Thank you. One of the factors that I think you\u2019ve mentioned that\u2019s been driving sales is additional product sale to existing customers. I was just hoping you could quantify the impact there and maybe talk about how much further opportunity you see?", "Tom Watjen", "Mike?", "Michael Simonds", "Sure. So we see about north of 60%. And to give you a sense, actually we see in the large end of the market a number even north of that in terms of the percentage of our sales that comes from existing client relationships. That\u2019s important to us for three reason. One, because we understand the risk of this better. Two, it tends to come in more favorably priced because they know us and we tend to have a good service relationship. And three is each time that we add additional lines of business into our client relationship, it drives the stickiness of that account up a bit. ", "So if you take 2015 as we talked about low interest rates, certainly a product like LTD, we are going to be in there at renewal time with modest increases. Our chances of placing those increases in the context of a broad relationship are significantly improved. It's really the key strategic driver for us. If you think about the runway, it\u2019s actually pretty substantial. So we average right around three products per existing client relationship and we would see a fully integrated client be more like six or seven different lines of coverage as you think about the different demographics within the employee base. We feel like we\u2019ve got a long room to continue to grow within that base.", "Tom Watjen", "Like you were saying, that\u2019s one of the variables I think you and your team are focused aggressively on. Other ones would be increased participation, but you can get pretty granular in terms of operational things that we are doing. And I think that\u2019s probably part of your game plan for 2015.", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah, it's a great point. So in addition to additional benefit offered as part of the plan, you actually look at where you have employee contribute benefits or voluntary benefits in place and what\u2019s the participation level. Even without the additional cross sell, you can drive premium growth and improve the risk outcome that you get a better spread as you drive that participation up of that as well.", "Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thank. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I could ask one follow up on long term care. Just hoping you could go into a little bit more detail on the adjustments you made for mortality and morbidity. And I realize in total that was offset I think by assuming the re-rates that you\u2019ve achieved, but if you could just talk about the dynamics you\u2019re seeing there and how much of the adjustments you made are based on actually claims experience?", "Jack McGarry", "I would say that the vest major of our current assumptions are based on our own calms experience. We were informed by society studies. We had bought some risk guidelines from consultants. And so we measured our own experience against those, but we did look at every assumption, and I would say the vast majority of those assumptions are based on our own experience. ", "Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup", "Got it, but is it correct to read that both mortality and morbidity in isolation were slightly negative versus prior assumptions?", "Jack McGarry", "Not necessarily actually. Things went in different directions within there, but they offset.", "Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thanks. I guess just last on that, you\u2019ve given sensitivity to GAAP reserves for interest rates. Is there anything similar you can provide for either mortality of morbidity such as what a 1% change in either of those factors would mean for the GAAP reserve?", "Jack McGarry", "Yeah. It's clearly that the long term assumptions, so there is sensitivity. But I don\u2019t have a rule of thumb on 1% change.", "Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Kruger with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.", "Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Good morning. Congrats to everyone from us as well. On I guess back to the sales growth in Unum US, can you give us some underlying color on I guess if you think you\u2019re -- in general you\u2019re just the market is growing at a substantially higher level than it was or do you think it's more attributable to you guys gaining market share?", "Tom Watjen", "Mike?", "Michael Simonds", "Thanks, Ryan. Time will tell a little bit because the industry reports lag obviously the company level report. It will take a little bit of time to actually see what happens with the market. I\u2019d say I'm actually encouraged a couple of points on that front. One, we had seen a slowdown in the smallest end of the market and Tim alluded to this from a Colonial Life perspective as well. But we\u2019ve seen a persistent drag in the less than 100 employee market and that over the last couple of quarters has really started to come back. ", "In fact we saw sales over 30% in that less than 100 life group insurance market. Those are often new lines that an employer is adding for the first time. So you\u2019re starting to see a little bit market growth on that front. The second component is we are seeing the addition of additional lines on the voluntary front as health plans, as consumers are buying down health coverage through higher deductible plans. That leaves gaps. And so we are taking what might be a traditional life in the facility client and you\u2019re in there with accident insurance and other supplemental health products. And that\u2019s almost always industry growth versus the swapping of business amongst carriers.", "Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Got it, thanks. And then if I could one on long term care. Can you give us, or remind us what level of future premium rate increases that you guys are projecting within your long term care reserves?", "Rick McKenney", "We don\u2019t have an exact number for you. I would tell you as we did at the investor meeting that we are basing that level on final rate increases. And so the assumption we have going forward is based on filings that we\u2019ve already made related to rate increases. The assumption is also assuming that we get results on currently filed rate increases that are largely consistent with the results we\u2019ve had on previously filed rate increases.", "Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. So just to be clear, your reserves do not to assume any additional rate increases beyond what you\u2019ve already file?", "Rick McKenney", "No.", "Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Good morning and congrats Tom. Just had a question about how we should be thinking about cash flow generation if rates remain low here. The $220 million or some of charges if we add up the New York sub and fair wind, is that a number that we should expect to be recurring if rates remain at current levels and if you guys bake that into your capital plan, i.e. can you still do at least the low end of your buyback assumption even if rates remain low?", "Tom Watjen", "Tom, to answer that I think most succinctly would be to say that we\u2019ve factored in the current environment into all of our plans. So as we\u2019ve updated things and even as I talked about, some of the pressure we are seeing in the range, inclusive of our capital plans reflect what we\u2019re seeing out there today.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "But can we assume though, Rick, that we would see similar levels greater or less of that we\u2019ll call it $200 million or so cumulative for LPC on a stat basis. Is that a number that we should be thinking about as recurring or is there a reason to think that that might abate or change?", "Rick McKenney", "No, I actually expect that would be much lower as we get out towards the end of the year because a lot of what actually came out of what you saw in those results, both the 57 I mentioned as well as the First Unum moves, had to do with the re-shaping that we did over our overall reserves. And so I think interest rates their movement down outwards would be less impactful in terms of what we\u2019ve seen in First Unum and wouldn\u2019t expect things to recur in our other entities as well.", "Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning Tom. Thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify, just to get an understanding of the difference between the 57 and what's going in your New York Company. Should I think of those two numbers, one a charge that went through your statutory income statement and one that I gather from an earlier response that went to surplus? Should I think of those two charges as independent?", "Tom Watjen", "Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "I'm not sure they are independent. In fact they all came out of the same reserve review, but the charge in New York was split. So a piece of it went through the equity line and a smaller piece in showed up in statutory earnings. ", "Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. My follow-up question, my second question, not a follow up question, but a separate question relates to your ability to increases prices and the speed with which you can do it. My understanding is that this is not like many businesses in the sense that once you decide that you need a price increase, my understanding is you can\u2019t do it the next day. You have to notify your sales people. You have to notify the customers. You have to notify your intermediaries and the brokers and then maybe, I'm not sure, maybe you can answer as part of, can you include this as part of your response there, maybe regulatory things that you need to do. There may be IP issues that you need to deal with from a price increase. My question, what's involved and how long does it take to raise process once it becomes apparent they need it?", "Tom Watjen", "Just to clarify Eric, are you talking about the group business or you are talking about the long term care business or both actually?", "Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets", "I'm really talking about group disability. ", "Tom Watjen", "Group disability, okay. Mike, maybe walk through just the pricing cycle processes actually because it's a great question.", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah, it's a really good question. I think it\u2019s actually sometimes a little misunderstood because I think the ability to place [injuries] within your in-force block is actually a competence that has to be built over time. And I think you actually nailed a number of the key pieces. First you have to understand within all the cells that make up a pretty diverse block of business, where do you want those increases to hit and at what level? So there is a fair amount of work that goes into that. But actually the real work comes once you\u2019ve decided where those increases are going to hit and it starts with as you said communication and the ability to effectively communicate with brokers and consultants and ultimately to that end, clients. You want to actually show up with not just a take it or leave it, but you want to have a set of options around changes that they could be making in their plan design that could offset some of those increases so the net is a profit improvement. But you\u2019re given the clients some options to work with. ", "You want to have clear metrics in place so that you understand the balance between placing increases at various levels and risk of termination. And then you want to have incentives lined up. You need to have, as you put a lot of work into ensuring that we\u2019ve got a field force that is properly motivated and understands the importance of placing renewals and having a healthy book of business going forward. It takes some amount of work to build the confidence. I\u2019d say, we look at it. We go through every case, say over 500 employees. Every year that it\u2019s not in a rate guarantee, it\u2019s getting looked at and assessed. In the core business under say 500 lives there\u2019s a lot more transactions there. We are going to go through somewhere between 25% and a third of those cases every year. But you get a sense from the scale of the program.", "Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets", "But as far as new business is concerned, interest rates are now what, 40, 50 basis points lower than they were just a few weeks ago. It\u2019s apparent I think that you need price increases on new business relative to what you were thinking about charging on new business just again two months ago. How long will it be before you can institute price increases on new business relative to what you had planned just a couple of months ago to charge on new business?", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah. You can move actually pretty quickly because you have underwriting guidelines in place that give you some flexibility. So what you do is you need to shoot towards the upper end of that range and effectively you\u2019re placing some increase there. And then twice a year we go through a thorough review of all of our manual files rates and make adjustments. And so again, it\u2019s not a long cycle to think about in terms of pretty quickly on underwritten business and actually getting to the full block within six months. ", "Tom Watjen", "And Mike, I think Eric referenced in his question too regulatory involvement. That\u2019s not necessarily the case I don\u2019t think in the group piece as you think about what\u2019s needed to be responsive to the market.", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah. Certainly it\u2019s a big compare and contrast to individual products of the long-term care business where it is much more the regulatory environment is the driver. Within group insurance you\u2019ve got much more discretion in typically ranges that you can operate within.", "Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Seth Weiss with Bank of America.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "Thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow up on the existing sales to current clients. Is there a general pattern of moving some specifics products lines where now they\u2019re say group LTD, the traditional entry way and then you\u2019ll see that flow through to other product lines or is it generally give and takes across the board?", "Michael Simonds", "I would say it is give and takes across the board. There is -- actually often there is a voluntary benefit relationship in place that we are bringing group insurance in or an employer paid component. Actually our multi life individual disability, which is disability income protection for higher earners tends to be a great place for us to do cross selling into those relationships as well. If you look at it in sum total, it comes from every direction, but certainly having a very large block of long-term disability that\u2019s the base that I\u2019d say most frequently we\u2019re cross selling into. And I\u2019d say most frequently we are cross selling voluntary benefits into those LTD relationships.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then one question on persistency, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the persistency that you reported for 2014, it doesn\u2019t account for any renewals that you may have lost January 1. I think you just quickly discussed the January 1 renewals and how those came through.", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah, sure. You\u2019re correct. So it\u2019s not reflected in that, but as we look forward and you would have seen premium guidance of growth in the 4% to 6% range for Unum US and that reflects on I think pretty strong continued persistency. We did 90.5%. That\u2019s a very high level, but certainly somewhere in that range which we feel really good about. ", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Ken Billingsley with Compass Point. ", "Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point", "Good morning. One of the questions I think I heard the answer to if it was asked, have you disclosed what your new interest rate assumption is and what it was before? ", "Rick McKenney", "I think that\u2019s a broad question, Ken. I think what I would tell you is our assumptions in aggregate across the company would have been what we saw at investor day and they have come down now from that timeframe 40, 50 basis points. As you get to the different parts of the business, that\u2019s all reflected through. It will have different impacts in different areas, but I think the best way to look at it is we are reflective in our outlook for the year now based on what we see for current rates.", "Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point", "I guess another way to ask this and if you don\u2019t have an actual percentage, obviously the charge infers that you made some kind of adjustment. Can you talk about how many basis points adjustments you made from your original long-term expectations to where those expectations are now? Is it 50 basis points, 100 basis points change?", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, I think you can back into it. The charge was a $700 million charge. It\u2019s largely attributable to interest rates. We\u2019d given prior guidance that 25 basis points change in the discount rate was worth about $400 million.", "Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point", "Okay. The other question I have is regarding the sales growth and what you saw this quarter and expectations going forward. You sound I'm positive. A lot of large brokers, even one today, talked about they\u2019re expanding their employee benefits footprint through M&A. Can you just talk about how that\u2019s impacting your future growth prospects? It sounds like a lot of the growth is coming from existing customers. But is there going to be an avenue maybe for even bigger growth in the latter half of 2015 into 2016 as some of these other distributors and brokers are committing to growing that part of their business?", "Tom Watjen", "Mike, maybe you can speak to the broker side, but also [indiscernible] also talk about the Colonial side of the distribution equation too because they are very different, but great dynamic. Mike?", "Michael Simonds", "Sure. Ken, we have seen that in consolidation that you are referring to. I would say it\u2019s been a dramatic acceleration, but a good steady increase in firms coming together. I think as they come together the rate we\u2019ll invest on scale and some of the capabilities that they need around compliance, advisory services, some of the technology components that they\u2019re bringing into employers to help them manage. Generally I don\u2019t see a huge impact for us. We tend to have a good, broad distribution, certainly strong relationships across all the major brokerage firms. But in general I would agree with your read that is that employee benefit in total. But then even outside of healthcare, I\u2019d say the focus amongst brokers and advisors towards things like voluntary benefits and financial protection products like we are in the business in, that level will have some focus and definitely increased the uncertainty around healthcare as well. But Tim is going to talk through that.", "A \u2013 Tim Arnold", "For Colonial Life, about 70% of our sales come from brokers. So 30% are on a direct basis. As we\u2019ve seen consolidation in the broker industry, we\u2019re beginning to see brokers migrating out of the really small end of the market and that gives us a huge opportunity to serve that marketplace on a direct basis. But we I guess 70% of our discussion with brokers we are consistently rated as one of the best businesses for brokers to do business with on the voluntary side. So it\u2019s still a very important marketplace for us, but increasingly see the opportunities to serve the small end on a direct bias.", "Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point", "And just say one point, causing a migration out of did you say the smaller accounts?", "A \u2013 Tim Arnold", "Yeah, especially the both 50 life market with the ACA middle marshal requirement and the impact that has on broker commissions. So we\u2019re beginning to see some migration out of that marketplace, especially as brokers consolidate.", "Tom Watjen", "Tim, that\u2019s why I see I think some good growth because your direct sales efforts are focused on that part of the marketplace where there's a void that\u2019s been created.", "A \u2013 Tim Arnold", "Absolutely. For last year in the less 700 life market we are up 23%. Very strong progress there and a real need in that marketplace too as brokers consider whether they can serve that marketplace on this. As we see some migration, those employees and employers in that segment still need advice. And so we are there to help them with that.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch", "And consolidation on either Unum US or with the Colonial Life has not \u2013 no one has been able to drive higher commissions or anything else to help \u2013 have you pay for obviously the compliance and technology that they\u2019re bringing to the customer.", "Tom Watjen", "No. We have definitely not seeing that.", "Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point", "Okay. And the last question, I may have dismissed comments at the beginning when Tom was talking about the chairman. I thought he was referring to himself for the next two years or was that in reference to Mr. Ryan?", "Tom Watjen", "No. I\u2019ll be staying on as chairman for two years actually, Ken. So again at the annual meeting I\u2019ll step up to the chairman role and stay on the board for two years. Our current chairman Bill Ryan will actually step into a lead director role until he retires at the annual meeting in 2016.", "Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point", "Okay. But your expectation is not to be on the board after two years or just not be chairman?", "Tom Watjen", "I think that\u2019s the thinking right now, yeah. But I think it\u2019s good governance. For a CEO to stick around at the board for too long I think is one of the things we very much don\u2019t want to do. I can serve in a very important role for a couple of years, both with the board and with management in terms of helping assure continuity. But I think right now we\u2019re thinking of it as a two year period.", "Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point", "So I did hear that correctly. All right, well thank you for taking my questions.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James for a follow up.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Hey again everybody. Just a quickie. Looking at the numbers versus my numbers and of course my numbers are estimates. I did notice that expense levels did seem kind of high. I was just wondering in general, Rick, if you can comment on where expense levels may be higher than normal because of the sales and changes in the deck rules that occurred in 2010 and what have you?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes Steven, let\u2019s come back to it. We actually see \u2013 our sales costs were higher. So I think growth you do see more sales out there and deck rule only have much to do with it because when we talk about our operating expense, we are not factoring the decking process into that. Good sales, pay a little bit more in expenses, that\u2019s a good history.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay, thanks.", "End of Q&A", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Steven. I want to thank you all for taking the time. I know this call went a little long, but there was obviously a lot I thought we should touch on.

As a benchmark for full year 2014, our after-tax operating income per share as adjusted for the retrospective adoption of this accounting standard update and excluding the after-tax non-operating retirement related losses and after-tax net realized investment gains and losses, was $3.51 per share.", "A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today\u2019s presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website also in the Investor section. So, participating in this morning\u2019s conference call are Unum\u2019s CEO, Tom Watjen, President, Rick McKenney and CFO, Jack McGarry as well as the CEOs of our core business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum US, Peter O'Donnell for Unum UK, and Tim Arnold for Colonial Life.", "And now for one last time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. We\u2019re off to a good start in the year with operating earnings per share of $0.89, a 4.7% increase over last year and a result very consistent with our own expectations for the quarter. Once again this quarter we saw a continuation of many of the very positive operating trends we have seen in the past strong sales momentum, accelerating premium growth in our core businesses, and stable risk experience in our core businesses as well as in the closed block.", "In addition, our statutory earnings and capital position remain strong, giving us the financial flexibility to continue returning capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $108 million of stock in the first quarter and as we do annually, the Board will be making a decision on our common stocks dividend at our May meeting. Dividends and stock repurchases have both been important parts of our capital management strategy.", "As we outlined last quarter, and as Tom referenced, I\u2019ll be retiring following this year\u2019s annual meeting and Rick McKenney will be assuming my role as CEO of the company. I\u2019m very pleased with how the transition is going and, as planned, Rick became President and Jack McGarry became CFO on April 1. This sets things up well for me to move into the role of Chairman of the Board at the annual meeting in a few weeks. As we said last quarter, we have planned well for this transition and both the Board and I have tremendous confidence in Rick and the entire leadership team and we don\u2019t expect to miss a beat.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rick to cover the highlights of the quarter. Rick?", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to cover several of the key highlights of what was a very good first quarter, and then I\u2019ll turn to Jack to provide an analysis of our results in greater detail. I\u2019ll start first with sales, where again in the first quarter we saw excellent sales results across all of our core businesses, a nice continuation from our 2014 results.", "Unum U.S. sales increased by 17% for the first quarter compared to the year-ago quarter, with strong results in the core market and voluntary benefits. We saw year-over-year growth in all of our primary product lines long-term disability, short-term disability and group life and AD&D which was primarily driven by strong results in the core market segment where sales increased by 21%.", "We did see our large case sales decline by 6% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting our opportunistic approach to that sector of the market as well as the success we saw in 2014. This will create difficult year-over-year comparisons, but we like our positioning in this market.", "At Colonial Life, sales this quarter were also strong, increasing 8% with solid performance in the core, commercial, and public sector markets. And, finally, Unum UK sales continued to gain momentum, increasing 6% for the quarter in local currency.", "These results across our business segment continue to reflect the strength of our competitive position in our markets and today's generally more favorable conditions. Second, our strong sales trends over the past several quarters have been combined with solid persistency resulting from our ongoing focus on managing renewals on our in-force block.", "In combination, these have generated strong growth in our premium income. For all of our core business segments combined, premium income grew by 5%, with Unum US premium growth of 6.7% and Colonial Life at 5%, while Unum UK was essentially flat in local currency. This growth is a combination of adding new customers and deepening our relationships with existing customers. . We are still seeing little benefit from the economic and employment growth environment at this point.", "Next, our risk experience remains in line to favorable relative to our expectations for our core business segments as well as in our closed block. As a result, we continue to see strong, stable operating margins and returns in our core business segments. In fact, our core business segments generated an operating ROE of 14.4% for the first quarter, consistent with our 2014 experience.", "For the Company as a whole, first quarter operating ROE was 11.5%. These ongoing results help us maintain the financial flexibility needed to both support our business needs, including the growth of our business, while also returning capital to our shareholders.", "In the quarter we were again active with our share repurchase program. In addition, our Board will consider an increase in the common stock dividend at the upcoming meeting in mid May.", "And finally, we are running the company well, but we cannot ignore the primary challenge we and the rest of the industry continue to face, and that being one of a low interest-rate environment. Low yields on new money investments continued to pressure the yields on our portfolios and our investment income. However, we are actively taking this on through the pricing actions available to us in many of our products to maintain our profitability.", "So with those highlights on a good first quarter performance, I'll now ask Jack to cover our financial results in greater detail. Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone.", "Tom and Rick have given you a high-level view of what we believe was a solid first quarter, and now I'd like to review in more detail the operating and growth trends we saw in the quarter as well as provide a review of investment performance and capital management.", "I'll start first with Unum US, with first quarter operating earnings increased by 3.3% to $214.3 million compared to the year-ago quarter of $207.5 million, with favorable premium growth of 6.7% that was offset in part by lower net investment income. The overall benefit ratio for this segment was lower at 68.3%, reflecting our disciplined approach to pricing and renewals.", "Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business increased to $74.3 million in the first quarter from $67.6 million a year ago; premium income increased by 6.2%, our strongest rate of growth in many years on strong sales and stable persistency. The benefit ratio was 80.1% for the first quarter compared to 83% in the year-ago quarter and 83.7% in the fourth quarter.", "This is one of the lowest benefit ratios we've reported in several years, driven by unusually favorable new claimants and continued favorable claim recovery experience. We expect the benefit ratio for group disability to revert to more normal levels over the remainder of the year.", "Group life and AD&D operating income declined 1% to $57.9 million. Premium income growth continues to accelerate, increasing 8% in the first quarter, but the benefit ratio was slightly higher at 70.9%, compared to 70.3% in the year-ago quarter, largely reflecting a less favorable experience in the A line.", "In the supplemental and voluntary lines, operating income increased 1.1% to $82.1 million in the first quarter compared to $81.2 million a year ago. Premium income trends remained favorable in this line as well, increasing 6.3% in the first quarter, primarily driven by increased sales in the voluntary benefits product line, somewhat offset by a decline in persistency.", "From a risk perspective, the individual disability line had favorable results on stable claim incidents and favorable claim recoveries. The VB benefit ratio benefited from reserve releases driven by some large case lapses. These reserve releases were offset by the accelerated amortization of DAP associated with the lapsed cases. Underlying risk results in VB remain stable and in line with our expectations.", "Overall, it was a solid quarter for Unum US business, highlighted by accelerated premium, income growth and favorable risk results. The operating ROE remains in the 13% to 14% range, well above industry averages in the group businesses.", "Looking at Unum UK, operating income was GBP25.5 million for the first quarter, down slightly from the year-ago quarter of GBP22 million. These results are within our range of expectations but were impacted somewhat by the lower inflation in the UK this quarter. As we invest in inflation index-linked bonds to support the claim reserves for our group policies that provide inflation-linked increases in benefits. We expect a move in interest income and claim reserves weighted to this inflation adjustment to generally offset over an annual period, but the sharp change in inflation this quarter caused a small impact to the quarter's results. But it does not impact our outlook for the full year 2015.", "Underlying risk experience in the group life line of business was favorable, reflecting the repricing and repositioning actions taken in this line over the past several quarters. Overall, the margins remain in very good shape for Unum UK, which generated an operating ROE of slightly over 16% for the quarter.", "Colonial Life continues to generate strong consistent results with operating income of $77.6 million, a 2% decline from the very favorable year-ago quarter. Claim experience remained generally stable with a benefit ratio of 51.3% for the first quarter compared to an unusually favorable result in the year-ago quarter of 50.5%. The underlying profitability of Colonial Life also remained strong, producing an operating ROE of 16.9% this quarter.", "Rounding out the enterprise for the closed block, operating income was $26.7 million in the quarter compared to $28.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Risk results were stable and consistent with our long-term expectations. In the long-term care block, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 87.3% for the first quarter, in the middle of the 85% to 9o% range we expect, but above the very favorable results of 84.7% which we experienced in the year-ago quarter. In the closed disability block, we had a very good quarter with favorable mortality experience producing an interest-adjusted loss ratio of 80% for the first quarter compared to 81.5% in the year-ago quarter.", "I'll move now to our sales and growth trends across the Company, which, as Tom and Rick have pointed out, were quite strong again this quarter. In Unum US, total sales increased 17% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, a continuation of very strong growth. The growth this quarter was particularly strong in our core market segments, which are under 2,000 employees, which increased by 21% this quarter for LTD, STD, and group life AD&D combined. Large case sales for the same product lines declined by 6%, reflecting the opportunistic approach we take to large case sales, and also the success we experienced in this market segment last year.", "The growth was also well-balanced by product line with LTD sales increasing 14% on strong growth in the core market segment, STD increasing 21%, and group life AD&D increasing 4%. In addition, sales in voluntary benefits grew 28% with very strong activity in the large case sector, as well as solid 9% growth in the core market. In addition to the strong sales momentum, our persistency for Unum US remains strong at 88.8% for our group benefit lines for the first quarter. These results, combined with our ongoing renewal pricing strategy, generated premium growth for Unum this quarter of 6.7%, which was one of the strongest rates of growth in many years.", "At Colonial Life we saw our continuation of last year's strong sales trends with an increase of 8% in the first quarter. Core commercial sales and public sector sales were strong again this quarter. New and existing account sales growth both showed increases as we focused on recruiting and development of quality sales reps along with reworking our existing account base. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly higher year over year, helping to drive the overall premium growth of 5% in the first quarter.", "Finally, sales in Unum UK increased by 6% in the first quarter in local currency. Persistency remained stable in the group disability line at 86.6% and has shown very good improvement in the group life line back to 79.3% for the quarter compared to 69.7% for the year-ago quarter as we move past the re-pricing activities of the past several quarters.", "So, overall we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see in our core business segments. As Rick mentioned earlier, we are seeing only minimal evidence of improved top-line growth and better employment in economic trends at this point.", "Now, quickly looking at investment results, we remain very pleased with the quality of the portfolio, but obviously challenged by the level of new money yields. Our practice is to remain disciplined in our asset selection and also remain disciplined in balancing the decisions we make on discount rate changes and associated pricing actions. With our move in the fourth quarter to lower the Unum US LTD discount rate by 50 basis points, we have been instituting the necessary pricing actions on new sales and renewals in order to maintain a healthy interest margin and reserves.", "Moving to capital management, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for traditional US life insurance companies remains at just over 400%, and our holding company cash marketable securities was $426 million, reflecting the $108 million of share repurchases in the quarter. Statutory operating earnings were $156 million for the first quarter, a favorable quarter relative to the experience of first quarter 2014, reflecting the favorable risk experience we saw in several of our business lines.", "Wrapping up, I want to affirm our 2015 outlook for growth in operating earnings per share in a range of 2% to 5%, up to $3.51 per share operating earnings in 2014 as adjusted for the accounting update. Just as we indicated last quarter, given the drop in rates since our outlook meeting in December, we expect results for the year to be toward the lower end of the range, but we'll need to see how that plays out over the balance of the year. Overall, it was a good quarter and a good start to the year.", "Now I will turn it back to Rick for his closing comments.", "Rick McKenney", "Great. Thanks, Jack. Before we move on to your questions, I will just say again I'm very pleased with our overall results for the quarter and our solid start to the year. Combination of strong sales and premium growth, along with another quarter of stable risk experience, position us well for the balance of the year. While there continue to be challenges, the most significant of which remains the current level of interest rates, I'm very confident we can take the necessary actions to manage effectively in this environment. I'm also pleased with the progress we have made in implementing our succession plan and we look forward to completing the implementation of our plan in a few short weeks at our annual meeting.", "We'll certainly miss working with Tom on a daily basis but will continue to benefit from his experience and leadership in his new role as Chairman of our Board. We have a great team in place and remain in an excellent position to capitalize on the opportunities we see in our markets.", "We'll give Tom a chance to close things out in a few minutes but, first, let's take your questions. Kelly Ann, let's move on to the question and answer session, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Seth Weiss", "If I could start on supplemental and voluntary line, if you could give a little bit more color on the dynamics of sales and persistency, obviously very strong sales quarter year over year, persistency a little bit weak. Any commentary on market dynamics there would be helpful.", "Tom Watjen", "We will turn it over to Mike to talk about what's going on in the US and turn it back over to Tim to talk about Colonial Life as well on the voluntary side", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks, Rick, and good morning, Seth. So, supplemental and voluntary was a strong quarter from a sales perspective and we've alluded to earlier 28% growth. Underlying a big chunk of that growth was one particular large sale. I think if you were to peel that out, you'd see Unum US brokerage voluntary sales results more in that mid to high single-digit growth which is more the longer term trend. It's worth just stopping for a second on that large case sales, so while we wouldn't look for that to repeat, it is indicative of our strategy of growing within our existing client base. That particular client is a long-term group insurance client, and the ability to add voluntary has been a big part of our growth over time.", "We did see a bit of a tick up in lapses, particularly a couple of large cases, and if you dig into it I think we would say it's a little bit more volatility than anything else, actually both the two largest were related to merger activity at the client where they were integrating into a broader benefits program. So, something that we watch quite closely, but I don't think the start of a longer term trend.", "Tim Arnold", "Overall, we're pleased with the results we had for growth in the first quarter of Colonial Life. We saw a very strong growth in our target markets, mid and small commercial accounts as well as public sector. We saw 12% growth in our new accounts which is a really strong indication of the value profit we have in the marketplace, and a very, very strong 37% growth rate in public sector. So, the places that we're targeting, we're seeing good results, and we had nice growth overall despite the fact there was some weakness in our large case segment in the core.", "Seth Weiss", "Just one real quick one on investment income. You highlighted it in the release multiple areas, miscellaneous investment income, lower than last year. It looks lower than the norm. Could you just help us quantify what that impact was on earnings versus maybe a more normalized level and similar question in terms of the UK low inflation, maybe what earnings impact that had specifically?", "Tom Watjen", "Jack, you want to take that one?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. So the miscellaneous net investment income it was lower certainly than first quarter last year at about $10 million. It's slightly below that kind of run rate average we tend to see miscellaneous net investment income in the $10 million to $15 million range. That was at the low end of that range, but it's been volatile all the time. So it's hard to predict and we see these swings. It doesn't change our outlook for net investment income for the year.", "We're expecting the U, typically, when you get lower inflation length investment income, it gets offset in reserves because the benefits come down as well. That little bit unusual this first quarter because the UK actually had a deflationary period and so the index link, net investment income was actually negative. You can't reduce reserves as a result of that and so there was a mismatch of a couple of million pounds in the result. We don't expect the UK to be in a deflationary period over the full year, so we expect to get that back over the remainder of the year and we stand by the outlook for Unum UK for the year.", "Operator", "We will move next to Ryan Krueger with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.", "Ryan Krueger", "I had a question about group sales. Are you seeing better growth for the industry overall at this point or is your strong growth more a reflection of market share gains as some competitors have pulled back?", "Tom Watjen", "Let me turn to Mike to talk about the group markets.", "Mike Simonds", "I think it's a little bit of both. We certainly have seen the economy is slowly improving, and we've also seen the distraction that came with healthcare reform and not that everyone has got ACA figured out, but I think it's starting to settle in a bit. And we are seeing employers and brokers and consultants more focused on our lines of business and that's part of a trend we've seen over the last, I'd say, four or five quarters.", "So, I do think we're starting to see some degree of expansion rounding out benefits programs and then there is a bit of business moving between carriers. We've seen industry level ROEs for the group insurance line sort of in the mid-single digits and so there's some work that's ongoing with a number of carriers and that's putting some business out to market as well.", "Ryan Krueger", "And then one on capital management, so normally you guys have certainly been active in buybacks and in dividends over time. You haven't done much M&A. Do you have any appetite for M&A at this point, just thinking in terms of you have pretty large market shares in a lot of your lines, so would you see any benefit in M&A?", "Rick McKenney", "I think we've been pretty consistent over time talking about M&A and this is a place we would like to put our capital first and foremost. We're going to put it into our business, but to grow our business through M&A is something we desire. You can think of that on multiple fronts. One is that we require blocks because we think we can actually manage blocks very well.", "The second is we look at capabilities we can add across the Company. Those might be smaller transactions that bring us specific capabilities. And, too, we also look to expand our reach and our footprint in different geographies, different product lines, et cetera, realizing that we're going to do so in a very disciplined way. And so I think over time you haven't seen us do M&A and part of that's been because of the discipline we've maintained over that period of time.", "But it is a place we'd want to put our capital and it's a place that we have been very active in the M&A markets and the pipeline of things that have been out there and you'd expect to see us do that in the future as well. And we do it -- just to reiterate, we do have the capital flexibility, as we've said, to act on those type of transactions.", "Operator", "And from Credit Suisse we'll go to Tom Gallagher.", "Tom Gallagher", "Just following up on the capital management discussion, Rick. So if I look at the quarter end cash balance at the holding company, $426 million, at least based on how I'm calculating that, that's about 1.3 times coverage ratio, and I think historically you've talked about one to one and half times, so my question is are you comfortable with this level? Do you need to replenish and build it all at the Holdco? And how does that influence your thoughts on buybacks for the next several quarters?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes, Tom, we are very comfortable with our cash position, but I'll turn it over to Jack to talk more about how we see that over time and in the broader context of our capital management our holding company cash as being one element.", "Jack McGarry", "Tom, so we're at $426 million, it's 1.3 times. Our range now is in the one to two times. One of the things we have, we have a $400 million credit line currently that allows us to run a little thinner on cash than we had historically. You remember it's expensive to hold cash in the current environment because of the rates you get on it, so we are running a little thinner.", "I'd also point out that that first quarter tends to be a low point in the cash in the year because of some of the things that can do. It's heavy -- it's a heavy quarter for interest payments, it's going to be first and third quarter driven. It's also a heavy quarter because we pay a company bonus in the first quarter that comes out of cash, so we do expect that to drift upward over the remainder of the year. That number is very consistent with the capital plan we put together and the guidance we gave you on that at the investor meeting in the $400 million to $600 million range of share repurchases. So we're quite comfortable actually with where we are.", "Tom Gallagher", "And then just as a follow up to that, Jack. So, if I thought about available capital flexibility if there was an opportunity, that would give you -- if you went down to one times that would give you $100 million of excess cash of the holding company. How much debt capacity would you say you would have if something attractive came along?", "Jack McGarry", "We would certainly have debt capacity. We're currently at a debt-equity ratio of 25%. I think for the right opportunity we'd be very willing to go above that. We also have excess capital in our subsidiaries. We're holding risk-based capital ratio in that 400%. We've stated a target in the 350 to 400 range, so for the right opportunity we're very comfortable we could take on more debt. We would have excess capital at the holding company and there are other alternatives relative to how attractive the acquisition target is, so we're very comfortable we could be a player.", "Tom Gallagher", "And then one last one. So, from what I gather the NAIC is proposing some changes to rules and financing related to captive reinsurance and they're targeting variable annuities and long-term care. Just curious if you've watched that proposal closely and what you see the impact or the potential impact for Unum?", "Jack McGarry", "We're actually quite comfortable. If you remember last year we re-domesticated our Bermuda-based captive to Vermont. When we did that, we actually moved the reserve and capital bases to the NAIC reserve model. And so as a result, I think we were ahead of that action, and so we're in a place where we're basically holding the NAIC reserve bases as though it was a domestic insurance company.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Just a couple of questions; first, if you could talk about pricing trends overall in the group disability and group life market and then, secondly, just on long-term care, your progress on raising prices in the block and the possibility of addition to stat reserves. I think the last few years you added to the stat reserves for the New York entity, but what's the possibility of you doing that again this year?", "Tom Watjen", "Jimmy, we'll start off with Mike on the pricing trends in the group business.", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks, Rick. Good morning, Jimmy. What I would say, and you would've seen it reflected in our results over the last several quarters, we've seen a bit of firming in the external environment. I'd say a lot of that attributable to what we were talking about earlier where we've got some loss ratio issue across a number of different carriers in the space. We've seen a more rational environment and you've seen that reflected in some of our growth numbers.", "I think a key issue will be going forward as we continue, as Rick and Jack spoke to, as we continue to price and renew business with an eye toward the current interest rate environment. Will the market continue to move along with us on that front? Universal issues. Our expectation is that it will but we're not going to sacrifice the discipline around our underwriting standards in pursuit of growth. So we are somewhat cautiously optimistic about going forward, but that will be something we'll need to watch pretty closely.", "Tom Watjen", "And, Jack, you want to talk about the long term?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. Long-term care, we're very pleased with the progress we're making on the rate increase front. As we mentioned, we filed a rate increase request with enhanced options for people to basically buy out of the rate increase by reducing their inflation percent in their contract. That has been very well received by regulators. We're seeing good success in getting approvals for that and actually will be looking for. We haven't sent out our first option to policy holders, but we're very comfortable with where we are and very comfortable with the assumptions we've put into the reserve assumptions around rate increases.", "We've strengthened New York certainly. We've not strengthened any other statutory reserves in the Company. As we mentioned in December, we still have a gap between our statutory reserves and our GAAP reserves. We feel comfortable with that margin. New York is still under pressure. Certainly the pretty harsh environment relative to the future outlook for interest rates as well as rate increases, and the guidance that we gave before that if you look to our historical kind of trends in New York as being indicative of what the future may bring, I think we would still stand by it.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Assuming no major changes in rates, most likely you'll end up contributing at least a little bit later this year?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll move on to John Nadel with Piper Jaffray.", "John Nadel", "I had a question for you, maybe a follow up just as it relates to capital flexibility. I know any particular deal can be more or less attractive based on competition for the asset, valuation, et cetera. But, Jack, I appreciate the comment that you can go above a 25% debt to cap if there's some plan in place. Can you give us some sense for how far above that level you think you can go in a relatively short-term period of time?", "Rick McKenney", "John, this is Rick. I think the first thing you have to make sure that the deal makes sense. If you're looking at something, that's the first and foremost, what is the strategy that underlies that type of transaction? How does it fit with the overall fold? What do we do with it?", "Is it something that we can actually improve upon and you have to start there. I think what we're telling you from a capital perspective is that we've proven that to ourselves and we see the types of returns we're looking for, we can make available capital.", "And so without getting into all the nuances of specifics on leverage and things like that, coverage ratios we have out there, cash, other instruments that are available to us; there's plenty of things that we can do, but I take you back to the most important thing is that making sure it fits and making sure we go through the transaction in a very disciplined way.", "John Nadel", "Certainly appreciate that. And I don't suppose with the changes in management given you've been at the firm for now a number of years, Jack's been in place. Despite being in new roles, it wouldn't be fair for us to presume that managerial changes or executive ranks changes would really change the approach to M&A, right?", "Rick McKenney", "I think that's absolutely true and I have Tom sitting here next to me and I think it's one of those things that you can see in this team. The transition is going to be seamless and we're focused on that. We have all been around this table for some time dealing with these different things and I think that what you've seen out of us in the past is what you should expect out of us in the future in terms of how we act.", "John Nadel", "And then my other question is a bit more fundamental. In the Unum US, particularly the group disability side, I think you mentioned in the release very favorable, I believe was the term, claim recoveries in the quarter. I was hoping you could sort of dive into a little bit more deeply, maybe give us a sense -- some way of getting a sense for order of magnitude, what kind of impact that may have had. The 80% benefit ratio obviously is a very exceptionally low level relative to where we've seen it, particularly given the discount rate change.", "Rick McKenney", "Yes. Actually, John, in the script we mentioned very favorable new claim incidents and continued favorable recovery experience. So, our recovery experience was favorable. It's been trending favorable for quite a time now, probably the biggest change was in new claim incidents and severity, very low new claims on volumes in the quarter relative to expectations, and so I think that was more the driver of the change in the loss ratio than the recoveries and, again, we think that's largely aberrations as opposed to trends.", "John Nadel", "Okay. So that's not -- well, clearly you're not altering your view overall for guidance, so it sounds like you're not altering your view for what you think a normal of claims incidents is either.", "Rick McKenney", "John, I think that's right. It was a good quarter and we certainly put that on the books, but we look forward to reverting a little bit to more what we've seen in the past.", "Operator", "And from Colombia Management we'll go to Al Copersino.", "Al Copersino", "The drop in large case sales in Unum US, first I'm happy to see the continued discipline that you guys are showing, you mentioned relating to that drop in sales a tough comp and you also mentioned, I think you mentioned, something about competition level, you said your opportunistic approach to that market. Wonder if we can get a bit more color on those two things and also if there was anything related to a third reason why large case sales might drop which was any desire to shift your mix, your sales or premium mix at all?", "Rick McKenney", "Great, thanks, Al. Mike?", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks, Rick. So good question. I think you read it right, it's an opportunistic market and so in the first quarter of last year we had one large transaction in particular, but a couple on the new business front that did not recur this year. I wouldn't read into it anything other than it's a little bit of a lumpy flow of sales in that market, and we'll absolutely remain disciplined, find opportunities which in a high degree of frequency those opportunities come with existing clients, adding new lines of business.", "We saw north of 60% of our sales in the large end of the market come from existing client relationships. That's great for us because it comes in more favorably priced and even more importantly the deeper the relationship the better the persistency assumption that we have for that client, which is big profitability driver for us.", "In terms of continuing to shift the mix, I think what we would continue to see a little stronger growth in the core, but actually when we look at our margins in the large employer group insurance market compared to the core, we've got them both running right about where we want them. So we would like to see growth where we can have it in large case and don't need to see a dramatic shift in the mix between the two segments.", "Al Copersino", "I have one other question if I could, which is the hit to investment income in the UK from the low inflation and in fact deflation for a while, I may have missed it in the press release, was there a dollar impact that you all disclosed on that?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes. We didn't disclose a dollar impact in the press release, but it was orders of magnitude in the GBP4 million to GBP5 million pound range.", "Al Copersino", "Okay. Great. Thanks so much, and, Tom, congratulations.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Al.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.", "Humphrey Lee", "So, just a follow up on the capital flexibility and the M&A discussion. So you mentioned you would be interested in potentially some acquired blocks of adding capabilities as well as geographic reach. Any specific product lines that you would be interested in and the same thing for geographic reach?", "Tom Watjen", "Sure. Just give you a little bit of color on that, but not too much as we talk about our M&A processes. When you think about the business we're in today and the employee benefit space, we actually have pretty good reach across our product lines, so I would say there's not really any holes we need to fill in through M&A transactions.", "Even in the last several years, we have a dental offering we've done through partnership, et cetera. So, when I think about that, the block transactions would be as opposed to filling larger holes might be in fill in some areas where we could use some help and that's something we'll always look it.", "And then when you think of geographic expansion, if you think of the UK business it was built through a series of acquisitions over many years, and when we look to the dynamics of other geographies around the world that have similar dynamics to what we have today, we'd be interested in expanding there as well, but I put that all in the caveat of we do so in a disciplined way and make sure that things are meeting our hurdles and our growth expectations that we have.", "Humphrey Lee", "And then going to Unum US, the full-year guidance of sales was [2.4%] and based on your production in the first quarter, even if sales were flat year over year for the balance of the year, do you still hit the upper end of your [indiscernible], should we expect sales likely to exceed your target for the year in Unum US?", "Rick McKenney", "Mike?", "Mike Simonds", "I think at this point there's a lot of work between the end of the quarterback and the end of the year. At this point we wouldn't come off the guidance. You've done the math correctly, it would be roughly flat remaining three quarters to be within the guidance and I do think we feel very good about how we're positioned in our market and are very pleased with where sales are coming from: strong core market growth, strong voluntary benefits growth, 60% plus of premium coming in from existing clients.", "No reason to think we won't continue to see some degree of growth, but all that being said two things to keep in mind. One is tougher comps in the quarters to come given the strong results we had in sales last year, and the other is back the pricing environment where we're going to maintain discipline, be sure we're pricing forward based on today's interest rate environment and we'll wait to see what the rest of the industry does along those lines.", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay. If I could just sneak one more in. Given the strong growth of your selling, would you be trading off between buybacks as opposed to deploying [indiscernible] top-line growth?", "Tom Watjen", "Actually, could you repeat the question, please?", "Humphrey Lee", "Yes, sure. So given the strong growth that you're seeing across the lines, are you trading off capital deployment for business growth as opposed to buybacks?", "Rick McKenney", "We are seeing strong growth across the lines. That does take some capital to support it, but the growth is not inconsistent with what we expected when we put together our capital plan, so we're pretty comfortable with where we are.", "Operator", "From UBS we'll move to Suneet Kamath.", "Suneet Kamath", "Just want to follow up on the sales. I think we touched on this last quarter, but as we think about the first quarter results and how you're pricing, are you now fully reflecting in the change to the discount rate that you made as well as the current interest rate environment or do you need to do some more work on pricing if current interest rates remain kind of where they are?", "Mike Simonds", "It's Mike, Suneet. Thanks for the question. What I say is we moved on rates again to the end of last year and into early this year, so what we're putting out for quotes would reflect. What I would tell you though is that the sales cycle is such where it takes a little bit of time to fully burn in. So I would anticipate that actual sales numbers haven't fully felt the latest round of increases given interest rates, but we've begun to see some of that and it'll play out over the next couple of quarters.", "Suneet Kamath", "I guess is your customer base sort of sensitive to that? In other words, are some of the strong sales that we've seen a result of an anticipation on their part that, might as well lock it in now before we get a rate increase related to low rates?", "Mike Simonds", "No. I think they wouldn't have that sort of line of sight. So I don't think they're anticipating rate increases to come at this point.", "Suneet Kamath", "Okay. And then just to follow up on Humphrey's question about capital requires for growth. Jack, is there like a rule of thumb you can give us, even if it's very high level, in terms of a ratio of capital to new sales or something just as we think about the pace of growth going forward and what the capital needs are there?", "Jack McGarry", "We don't typically discuss that in detail. And there's a lot of things that go on in your capital management plan, so it's not really -- it wouldn't be right to just single out one single factor.", "One indication of the strength is the free cash flow generation because a piece of the capital you're putting up isn't just -- it's not just the risk-based capital, it's also the acquisition costs and the statutory reserves and we had strong first quarter on stat income that despite the growth and so we're comfortable with where we're going, going forward.", "Suneet Kamath", "And then just one last one on M&A, and we've talked on these calls about Unum as a buyer, but I just wanted to get Rick and Tom's view of how the Board might think of Unum as a potential target if we live in a world where consolidation US life insurance continues?", "Tom Watjen", "You want me to take that one, Rick?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes, you're the chairman.", "Tom Watjen", "Everyone's looking at me. We got to put them both in. Again, I think nothing has changed in this regard. We're very confident in the business plan we have as a company. I think you get that sense from the things that we've said and done, it's the fact that we've delivered on the results that you've seen us deliver on. The fact that actually we still have tremendous growth the ahead of us and tremendous capital flexibility. So, we will continue to look at acquisitions and as Rick and Jack have said, we'll be sure that we do them in a way that remains disciplined.", "We've looked at deals actually for a number of years. That's isn't going to change as we look forward. You raised the other issue which is in parallel. We can't ignore other opportunities to look at a transaction involving this company.", "It's not something we spend a lot of time thinking about because we have a lot of confidence in the future of the business, you see the growth, you see the returns, you see the return of capital to our shareholders and that's not changing. So, again, most of our time is spent on growing the business organically, it's spent on looking at some acquisitions that could add to that growth potential, and if somebody taps on the door, they tap on the door, but we do it from a position of strength.", "Suneet Kamath", "Got it. Bottom line, if you get the call, you take the call.", "Tom Watjen", "And the Board has the responsibility to do so. So I think every pubic company's chairman and board should hopefully be saying exactly the same thing. You can't ignore those calls, but again in our case we do it with a very solid plan as an independent company and one that really has an incredible future ahead of itself as independent company. So, we do it from a position of strength.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "Could you talk a little more about the UK market, the pricing and competition that you're seeing there. Your operating profit and constant currency was down a little bit, how do you see that playing out through the balance of the year?", "Tom Watjen", "Sure. We'll turn it over to Peter O'Donnell in our UK business.", "Peter O'Donnell", "In terms of the pricing, there's really no change in the market conditions in the UK. It remains very competitive. All of our competitors talk the talk about pricing discipline and ensuring that they right profitable business, but we do still see irrational behavior, particularly at the large end. In the protection world we're focused on growing the markets, most of the competitors are trying to gain market share. They find us very difficult to pitch against and that creates pricing pressure, but in general we can write at a premium because our proposition is strong.", "In the life markets we're focused on the small and medium end. We're seeing small growth there as we continue to invest our distribution, and we're opportunistic at the large end where we can write business at our margins, but that comes and goes really.", "In terms of the overall profits, just reiterates our forecast which was 1% to 3%. We were sort of in that range for the full year. In terms of where we ended the first quarter, what we saw as Jack referred to, was an issue around timing of profit recognition due to inflation, so we'd expect the slight shortfall we saw in the first quarter to sort of come back over the next three quarters.", "Operator", "And we'll take a follow-up from Colin Devine with Jefferies.", "Colin Devine", "Thanks. I'm just curious as we think about the strength of sales, particularly in Unum US, and this is maybe over the last couple quarters but maybe we can focus in on 1Q . And not taking anything from organic growth that you're generating, but I'm just curious how much of that growth on a year-over-year basis, Mike, you might attribute to just simply pricing; the price per $1,000 of coverage being higher now versus a year ago?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes. That's a really good question. We have seen a little bit of -- so we would look at sort of the average premium per life and then that flows into an average case. We have seen that edge up a bit. I wouldn't think it's a huge component driver, but it is reflected in the sales numbers and I think it's consequential in the earned premium numbers and should be, actually, over the next couple of years; particularly in disability as we go through renewal programs that reflect, again, the interest rate but also the aging of that population and the associated risk. So I think that will be a contributor for us.", "Colin Devine", "Maybe a few percentage points of growth or is it not even that much?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, that's probably about right.", "Colin Devine", "Couple questions, first on the investment side, I was wondering if we can talk a little bit about prepayments, what they added across the various business lines, and your outlook for the rest of the year and where you see the core yield for the portfolio going if rates kind of fold here? That's the first one.", "Second, ROE for Tom and for Rick, seems to really have kind of settled in here just 11% to 12%. What can you do to improve that? I certainly appreciate it's a little unique given the size of the closed block and what it represents of your general account. But what are some actions you can take either to strengthen that or alternatively on the CapEx side to improve your back office processing efficiency? And then just a final clarification from Mike. When you mentioned the impact of rates into your pricing taking effect, is the issue really that your second biggest renewal period is mid-year and that's when these should really -- we should start to see them? Thanks.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks, Colin. Jack, you want to talk a little bit about prepayments?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. So miscellaneous net investment income actually comes from two places, the bulk of it tends to be prepayments and we've been running, as I said, in the $10 million to $15 million a quarter range, tends to be pretty volatile. A lot drives that, and in particular, mergers and acquisitions tends to be a big factor in those payments.", "So we were off a little bit in miscellaneous net investment income in the first quarter relative to the mid-point of that range, but we would expect it to be within that range for the full year. The other piece of miscellaneous net investment income is more equity investments that we make and again those tend to be volatile as well, but have been in line with expectations over the year.", "Rick McKenney", "On your second question, Colin. In terms of ROE, I think we have had a very stable ROE where it is today. When you think about the biggest impact towards our ROE and why we haven't seen the growth out of that has actually been the interest rate environment.", "So, every year we kind of come to you with the interest rate headwind that we've got out there has actually slowed the ROE or the return growth that we would have expected. So, that's something we're working through over time as we price forward, et cetera, but it's not something we can necessarily fix on day one.", "The second piece you mentioned is, what are the actions we can take around our closed block which does consume roughly a third of our capital at lower returns because I would remind you that our business lines, our core business operations are generating very strong, very good ROEs and the reality of that closed block is challenging.", "The reality of the situation with the closed block is we would like to take actions to alleviate some of the size of our closed block, particularly the long-term care business we have today. The markets are not that conducive to helping us to do that, although you hear rumblings of that changing over time, more people being interested in alleviating or taking on that risk through reinsurance and other means. We certainly stay abreast of that, but we don't see anything in the near term that will fix that.", "So that's the other challenge that we have is how do we wrestle with that over time, but don't want to minimize how important it is that our good strong ROEs and our core operations maintain their very good levels and the closed block will be worked on over time.", "Jack McGarry", "Possibility. I would not say that's something that's imminent. I mentioned reinsurance as being a one-way gap. Before you can really get to the securitization market you need to start to see some of that develop I think. But I think it's something with the north wind in our individual disability block we have the history and the expertise to do securitizations and it's certainly something in our toolkit that we would like to deploy, but we don't see it necessarily there today.", "Colin Devine", "What about on the back office? Is the other way to connect this to improve your claims processing efficiency or do you feel you're as good as you can be right now?", "Rick McKenney", "Well, there's always room for improvement. We talk about that within our teams and it's something we've talked about maintaining a very good operating expense ratio that the teams have done. But once again, I'd go back to those core operations are generating very high returns, so it's not a problem in there that needs fixing, but it's something we can always get better and I think our teams do a good job of focusing on that continuous improvement.", "Colin Devine", "Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks, Colin. You had a question for Mike as well on the rates.", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, just very quickly. You're right, 7/1, July 1, that's the second effective date, so we'll see how that plays out particularly in small case market where we're generating quotes and pricing renewals. Though I would keep in mind that as you move up market when you're in the large case market, those are being worked on for January 1, effective right now, so we really are going to see it play out not just in the coming months but over the coming two, three quarters.", "Colin Devine", "Okay. Thank you. And I have my comments to Tom. It's hard to imagine how far the Company has come under your tenure and best wishes.", "Tom Watjen", "Thank you, Colin. Thanks for all your support and good counsel over the years.", "Operator", "We'll go to Ken Billingsley with Compass Point.", "Ken Billingsley", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just follow up, one, from the press release. You said that on the long-term care side it was a higher benefit ratio due to a higher level of submitted claims. Can you just talk -- is there a frequency shift, something that's maybe one time in nature or were there more claimants coming into the system than is expected?", "Rick McKenney", "Jack, you want to take that?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. I think that comment was more relative to the first quarter of 2014 which was an unusually favorable quarter. Actually, you remember the first two quarters of 2014 had unusually favorable new claim experience in long-term care, kind of reverted back more to the norm in the second half of the year. And so what we saw this quarter was very consistent with where we ended last year. We're right in the middle of our loss ratio range, so I would point to the first quarter of 2014 being the aberration as opposed to this quarter.", "Ken Billingsley", "Submitted claims, was it like procedural claims or just new claimants coming in and making first-time claims?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. It's just new claimants coming in making first-time claims.", "Ken Billingsley", "First-time claims, okay. The other question was just a follow-up comment and I believe Jack had said -- it was regarding employment growth and I just want to clarify, I didn't quite catch it all. I believe you said it's only seen a slight improvement in trends from employment growth, did I hear that correctly?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, you did.", "Ken Billingsley", "I would imagine that there is an expectation that from a sales perspective maybe -- I'm kind of reading between the lines, that maybe it's a little bit weaker than you expected given employment growth and that if it picks up there's a wider runway to work with?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. It's actually not a number that comes through sales, it's just kind of natural growth that as companies add employees and as wages increase since the premiums are a function of the overall payrolls of the companies; that's the way it would come in, so we call it natural growth because it just kind of happens.", "And it's not just employment growth, it's also wages have a big impact on that and so the economy is growing, it's adding jobs, just thus far it doesn't appear to be adding jobs in the places we have concentration. So there's been a lot of part-time work kind of lower wage jobs that aren't really flowing through to our premium level right now. We're cautiously optimistic that as the economy continues to improve that we will see some lift from that over time.", "Ken Billingsley", "And adding to that a renew effort from the expanded employee benefits practice and brokers who maybe are less distracted by ACA?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. That's definitely been a factor in the sales we're seeing over the past couple quarters.", "Ken Billingsley", "Past few quarters, great. Thank you for taking my question.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks, ken.", "Operator", "And that is all the time we have for questions. I'll turn it back to you all for closing remarks.", "Tom Watjen", "Well, good. This is Tom Watjen. Let me just make one remark. First off, thank you all for joining us today. As I mentioned, this is my last quarterly call. I want to reiterate something I'd said earlier which is, I step away with tremendous confidence in Rick and the entire leadership team and the business plan that they've laid out, that we will do very, very well going into the future. And, as we said before, we won't miss a beat, whether it's miss a beat on operations or whether it's miss a beat on strategic opportunities that we see in front of us. I can assure you of that.", "And I'll close by just saying I want to thank all of you for your support over the 12 years I've been CEO. We covered an awful lot of ground together and I'll miss that exchange and want to wish each of you all the best. Operator, this now completes our first quarter 2015 earnings call.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone.

Please go ahead, Sir.", "Tom White", "Great. Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2015 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements.

Our SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at unm.com.", "I\u2019ll remind you that statements in today\u2019s call speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. As we discuss our financial results this quarter, I\u2019ll remind you that prior period results have been adjusted for our retrospective adoption of the accounting standards update for tax credit partnership investments and qualified affordable housing projects.", "Adjusted prior-period results are available on our website in supplemental exhibit. Also a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today\u2019s presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website in the Investor section.", "Participating in this morning\u2019s conference call are Unum\u2019s President and CEO, Rick McKenney and CFO, Jack McGarry as well as the CEOs of our core business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum U.S., Peter O'Donnell for Unum UK, and Tim Arnold for Colonial Life.", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rick McKenney.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. The second quarter was another solid one for Unum with opertaing eararnings per share of $0.89. slightly trailing the year ago results of $0.90 per share. While our risk results showed somewhat higher volatility in some of our U.S group line this quarter, we also saw the continuation of many of the positive operating trentds we've seen in the past, most notably strong premium growth in our core businesses. In addition our statutory earnings remain healthy and capital position is strong providing us with excellent financial flexibility.", "I want to cover a few of what I believe are the key highlights of the quarter and then I\u2019ll turn to Jack to provide announcements of our results in greater detail. I will start first with sales, where as expected we experienced some moderation from the strong growth we\u2019ve enjoyed over recent quarters to a more normal long-term level of growth.", "Unum U.S. sales increased by 1% for the second quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. By market segment, we saw continued momentum in the core segment, which we define as less than 2000 employees with year-over-year growth of 4%. We did see sales decline in the large case segment which is a market we approach on opportunities phases and where sales can be more volatile.", "At Colonial Life, sales continued at very continued growth at very good levels increasing almost 6% with solid performance in the core commercial segment and public sector and finally Unum UK sales continue to gain momentum increasing 6% for the quarter in local currency, second with continued good sales momentum along with healthy levels of persistency across all of our business lines we continue to experience very good growth in our premium income.", "Our core business segment on a combined basis generated premium income growth of 5% over last year with Unum U.S. premium growth of 7%, Colonial Life at 6% and Unum UK up 1% in local currency. Next our benefits experience overall remains within our range of expectations though we did experience pressure this quarter particularly in our U.S. Group life. On a quarter-to-date, on a year-to-date basis, our disability lines were in line with prior year with the challenging second quarter mostly offsetting a very good first quarter. And in Group life and AD&D we saw pressure as well.", "Other lines of business benefited from favourable results especially the close block in Colonia Life. Importantly, our margins remain very healthy across our core business segments. And Jack will detail these trends by business segments as commentary. With these ongoing solid results and good statutory results, we continue to maintain a very strong level of financial flexibility.", "This enables us to support our growth needs while also returning capital to our shareholders. This quarter we repurchased over $100 million of our shares and will implement a 12% increase in our dividend effective with the payments we\u2019ve made in the coming weeks and finally as we have discussed with you for some time, the primary challenge we continue to face in the ongoing low interest rate environment.", "Interest rates and investment spreads were somewhat higher in the second quarter however they remain well below historic levels. I\u2019m pleased however with how we\u2019ve been able to manage through this low rate environment over the past two years and with the actions we have been able to implement to maintain healthy profit margins in our business segments.", "So with those highlights on our second quarter performance, I will now ask Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. Rick gave the high level view of what we believe is the solid second quarter and I would like to review more detail the operating and growth trends, we saw in the quarter. I\u2019ll start with Unum U.S. where second quarter operating earnings were $202.8 million, a decline of 6% from the year ago quarter of $215.8 million.", "Premium income growth was strong increasing 6.8% over the year ago quarter. The pent up ratio for the U.S. segment increased slightly to 71.2% in the second quarter compared to 70.4% in the year ago quarter as we experienced negative volatility in our U.S. Group Life business. In addition, net investment income declined by 1.1% primarily reflecting the ongoing decline in yields on our invested assets. Within the Unum U.S. segment, operating income in our Group disability business was $61.2 million, a decline of 15.8% from the year ago quarter at $72.7 million, while premium income continues to build momentum increasing by 71.1% over the year ago quarter, we saw continued pressure on net investment income which declined by 1.8% in the quarter.", "In the higher benefit ratio which increased 83.4% in the second quarter compared to 81.9% in the year ago quarter. The benefit ratio was impacted by higher new claimants and higher average size claim in our LTD product line driven in part by the 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate for new claimant implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014. We believe this quarter\u2019s results reflect negative volatility that will occur in this line from quarter-to-quarter including the very favourable first quarter experience, the benefit ratio for the first half of 2015 is 81.8% compared to 82.5% for the first half of 2014.", "Group Life and AD&D operating income was $52.5 million for the second quarter, a decline of 13.4% from the year ago quarter, premium income continues to grow at very healthy levels increasing 7.3% for the second quarter. Earnings were negatively impacted by the increase in the benefit ratio to 73.1% for the quarter up from 70.1% a year ago, primarily driven by an increase in the average paid claim size for the group life line.", "Again this appears to be normal volatility and did not change our outlook going forward. Trends in the supplemental and voluntary lines were favorable with operating income at $89.1 million for the second quarter and increase of 8% compared to the $82.5 million a year ago.", "Premium income growth trends also remain favorable for this segment increasing 5.8% in the quarter compared to last year. With perspective the individual disability line had a favorable quarter has overall risk results remain stable, the voluntary benefit ratios declined to 43.1% in the second quarter compared to 48.2% a year ago as mortality experience was favorable in the life product line and higher policy terminations in the critical illness product line generated release of related active life reserves.", "Moving to Unum U.K, operating income was \u00a325 million for the second quarter and increase is 5.9% over the year ago quarter of $23.6 million. The benefit ratio improved 70.7% for the second quarter compared to 74% in the year ago quarter as risk experience in the group life line business was favourable benefiting from lower new claim incidents and average claim size.", "Unfortunately mortality negatively impacted results in the group disability line although the risk results remain within our long term expectations. Margins remain in very good shape for Unum U.K for the quarter and first half of the year and the operating ROE was 19.1% for the quarter.", "Colonial Life also continues to generate strong results. With operating income of $77.6 million a 3.6% increase over the year ago quarter at $74.9 million, risk experience was favorable over the year ago quarter primarily driven by favorable mortality experience in the life line as a benefit ratio decline to 50.4% from 52% in the year ago quarter.", "Margins remain strong Colonial Life within operating ROE of 16.6% for the quarter. Finally the growth loss operating income was $36.6 million in the second quarter flat with the very strong results from the year ago quarter. This year\u2019s results were strong related to our long term expectations for both the long term care line in the closed disability block with good underlying risk experience in both business lines.", "In the long term care block, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 83.4% for the second quarter favorable related to long term expectation of 85% to 90% benefit ratio but long term care has less favorable claims raise in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the very favorable experience in the prior year second quarter.", "In the closed disability block we have a strong improvement relative to results of the second quarter of 2014. The interest adjusted benefit ratio improved 83.6% this quarter compared to 89.4% a year ago primarily driven by more favorable claim incelntives and mortality experience.", "I\u2019ll now move to the growth trends we experience across the company as Rick pointed are we saw a moderation in our rate of sales growth this quarter. This still was to be expected particularly in Unum U.S where we continue to implement rate increases in the market to offset the effects of growth the low interest rate environment. It\u2019s important to note that our sales growth levels have moderated we continue to see a very strong absolute level of sales.", "I would remind you that it\u2019s the relationship between the size of our imposed renewals business in the volume of sales that drives growth in our premium income. So starting with Unum U.S. total sales increased by 1% in the second quarter compared to a year ago. Well this moderated from recent quarterly sales trends we continued to see good trends in the group visibility lines where LTD sales increased by a 11% and STE sales increased by 39%.", "We saw a decline in the group life Canadian D sales by 22% against a very strong second quarter 2014. By comparison the second quarter of 2014 sales increased by 71% over the second quarter of 2013, a very active large case sales activity. Overall to the claims of business core market sales continued to show positive momentum is advancing by about 4% for the second quarter. Large case sales declined by 7% overall which is typical of the volatile pattern we experience in this market segment.", "Growth in voluntary benefit sales have also been volatile, the sales declining a little over 1% for the second quarter compared to the year-over-year increase at 20% plus for the previous two quarters. In addition, sales and individual visibility line increased a 11% for the second quarter. Persistency for Unum U.S. remained a very healthy levels for the group lines combined persistency was 89.3% for the first half of 2015.", "With these sales trends and persistency levels along with underlying management of imposed renewals we generated premium income growth for Unum U.S. this quarter at 6.8%. A Colonial Life in this sales continue to grow at a strong pace in the second quarter increasing 6% relative to last year. the composition is this growth was encouraging is the core commercial market produced an increase of over 4% in the public sector increased 15% offsetting a slight decline in our large case sector business.", "New account sales declined slightly this quarter so the growth over Colonial Life was overall primarily driven by sales through existing accounts. In addition, new rep contracts increased by about 7% as we focus on building the pipeline of producers.", "Persistency for Colonial Life as high year-over-year at 79.2% helping to generate overall premium growth of 6% in the second quarter, a highest rate of growth in several years. Finally sales in Unum UK increased by 6% again in the second quarter in local currency. Persistency remained stable in the group visibility line at 87.5% and continues on an improving trend in the group life line up to 79.9% for the first half of 2015.", "So overall we\u2019ve made very pleased with the growth trends we\u2019ve seen at core business segments. Quickly looking at investment results interest rates in investments spreads were higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and as a result and new money yields were slightly higher as well. However, our medium new money yields remain well below our existing portfolio yields so they are down with pressure on our portfolio yields and net investment income continues to impact our profitability.", "We are actively raising prices in the market as a primarily means of managing this impact. Moving to capital management, the weighted average risk based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance company continues to be stable from quarter to quarter remains approximately 400%.", "Holding company cash and market hold securities was $481 million at quarter end which reflects our $103 million of share repurchases in the quarter. Statutory operating earnings were $116 million for the second quarter and for the past four quarters statutory operating income totaled $633 million, a healthy level of earnings which has also remain stable over time.", "Wrapping up, I want to affirm our 2015 outlook for growth in operating earnings per share in a range of 2% to 5% after 351 in operating earnings for 2014 has adjusted by the accounting update. Given our first half results we expect it to be towards the lower end of that range but we will need to continue to see how business trends and interest rates play out for the reminder of the year.", "So overall it was another solid second quarter for the company and now turn it back to Rick.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks, Jack. And I\u2019ll reiterate. We are pleased with the second quarter results. Our premium growth remained strong and our margins are healthy. These solid results continue drive good capital generation and strong financial flexibility for the company. This allows us to continue to invest in the growth for our business while we return capital to our shareholders. So we\u2019re happy with the results and now we\u2019ll move to your question.", "So I\u2019ll ask the operator to being the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thanks you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Suneet Kamath from UBS.", "Suneet Kamath", "Thanks and good morning. I want to start with the right actions that you are taking in the US, are you now sort of pricing your business to reflect the current interest rate environment to all that\u2019s going to baked in the cake at this point or is there another round of right action that you need to take on a go forward basis.", "Jack McGarry", "Mike, you want to take.", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, sure. Good morning, Suneet. So I think already two fronts so first is new business pricing and where we would say absolutely new business pricing reflects our best view on interest rates underlying risk, aging of the population et cetera. The renewal is as you know, it takes a little bit of time to work through that. So to just give you a sense, in the larger end of the market, we see about a third all of our large employers come through each year and then in the core market exposure to 20% to 22% that we put through in renewal program, each batch that comes through reflects the current view of interest rates.", "So we\u2019re making good progress but even as we saw rates fall a bit last year that would get reflected in the renewal program this year and in the next two years to come.", "Suneet Kamath", "Okay. Got it, and then I guess for Jack on your comments about I think what you\u2019re getting here was the nominal level of sales relative to the in-force, I mean I guess is the takeaway from that, that even if sales growth rate of sales starts to moderate because just of the large numbers that we should still expect premium growth because essentially you\u2019re out selling your lapses is that kind of where you are going with that?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes that is pretty much and so if we get to that point, normal growth in sales will be reflected in normal growth in premium but we are - we\u2019ve gotten over the tipping point with the size of our sales is big enough to overcome the lapses and generate some really good top line growth.", "Suneet Kamath", "Got it. And my last question on top line is, is it still fair to say that you\u2019re not really getting much of a benefit from either employment growth or wage inflation?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes I mean it turned from - it has been negative in the past, it is positive, it is in the 1% to 1.5% range and so we haven\u2019t seen, we haven\u2019t seen the lives in wage growth that perhaps the general economy is seeing as yet.", "Suneet Kamath", "In a normal period that 1% to 1.5% is typically what again could you remind us?", "Jack McGarry", "I mean 2% to 4% depending.", "Rick McKenney", "I think one thing to add that is we are seeing the Life\u2019s grow, we really haven\u2019t seen the wage inflation and so that is something that I think is true pretty much across the economy, it\u2019s very true in our books. So we\u2019re getting better employment but not seeing what we would expect from overall wage inflation, so that is something we look forward to.", "Suneet Kamath", "All right, thanks.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from John Nadel from Piper Jaffray.", "John Nadel", "Hey good morning everybody. Maybe two quick questions for you, there is some who are reading the DOL proposal to potentially have an impact on group insurance, sales, do you read it that way, if so do you guys have a view on this obviously there is a lot of focus amongst the annuity writers and others selling business into qualified plans but I\u2019m curious whether Unum has a similar view that this could potentially stream into the group insurance business?", "Rick McKenney", "Hey John this is Rick. Thanks for the question. I think the - when you think about the overall, what is going with the fiduciary role and from the Department of Labor, one it is early day, so I think like anything that we look at in Washington, we stay very involved with the discussion that is going on out there and making sure that we have our views around that - around what is going on and where those different roles might go. So I think we have to say it is still early days, I think it is very clear though from the discussion, the questions and the guidance coming out of Department of Labour but this is very much about investment advice that goes on out there which doesn\u2019t include us. So it is one of those things that we stay on top of.", "We don\u2019t think it is going to and we don\u2019t think it should apply to anything we do in the business but it is one of those as you deal with the ways of Washington, we stand on top of it.", "John Nadel", "I totally agree with your view. The second question I guess is there has been M&A activity, there is at least one group insurance business [indiscernible] is very publicly out there potentially other transactions that we don\u2019t necessarily hear about the bankers might be bringing to you, should we read into the fact that your buybacks continue that, that M&A is something you\u2019re not really looking hard out at this point or are they mutually exclusive?", "Rick McKenney", "John I appreciate the question, I think we\u2019ve been very clear on M&A is a core part of our strategy, when you think about that and so you wouldn\u2019t have seen us do any deals but there wasn\u2019t a lot going on in the market, that is how we would have voice that. So as you mentioned the market is seeing greater momentum, we are definitely going to part in the view of what we have out there, we will be close to whatever actions going on out there, I think we are well known, in the market at least that were interesting in growing our business through M&A that\u2019s the core part of our strategy. So, that M&A can look like adding capabilities, it could look like expansion of our all portfolio, but to be very clear M&A is a key part.", "Your second piece of the question is around the capital to do so, and I think that as we look at that we have been able to return capital to shareholders, to share repurchase and through dividends, but at the same time we have kept our balance sheet in the space. So we can react to environment to an M&A become as better and that\u2019s been consistent. So we think we have the prior part to participate in these markets and we will be very active on the firm, and they are neutrally exclusive and we think", "John Nadel", "Okay, as a quick follow up along those lines I mean obviously you are carrying a risk based capital ratio that at least, for your business mix is significantly above I think some tiers and significantly above, your historical levels, shall we think about that Rick is you know exact part of the capacity, if they were to be used for M&A as suppose to you know retiring equity. The risk based capital ratio could, be a source if you will funds.", "Rick McKenney", "I think we have been on over time that we have running of 400%, we have been top of our ranges that we have communicated externally so there is room there, we carry holding company cash as Jack mentioned that just under $500 million there is room there and then when we look to our leverage ratio, we are very clean that leveraged structure that provides this capacity as well. So, we think we have a lot of capacity and I take you back to the capital generation model. Every quarter we keep generating capital as well that can buyback stock or go towards certain type of transactions.", "John Nadel", "Yeah no question, statutory earnings have been traffic. The last one, I have real quick is just that question I guess for Mike. There is been some, other companies talking about some model shifts in competitive environment in U.S. group insurance that utmost notably this morning was more of the commentary from that around the [indiscernible] business which I know is not necessarily something here focused on by can you give us an update on your views on the competitive dynamics.", "Rick McKenney", "Yes, sure John thanks for the question. I\u2019d would say is in comparison we certainly saw more favorable market conditions in 2014 and we had seen in a little while we had few carriers that needed to address profitability issues on that created some opportunity we saw the market shake off some of the distraction from ACA that where we adopted in the end of 2012 and then 2013. I\u2019d say as I look at 2015 we probably see a little bit more of an aggressive stands around pricing in the market. Then we have saw 14 but still reasonably go to and I would say pretty typical conditions.", "John Nadel", "Okay, thanks very much. That\u2019s all I have.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks John.", "Operator", "And will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Hi, good morning. I had a few questions on first on if you could go into a little bit more detail on the two businesses where you say week margins a group disability and then Group Life just talking about what you saw in terms of incidence and severity trends and how do you expect the loss ratios do or margins still emerging those businesses in the second half of the year. And then also on long-term carrier you had pretty good results in this quarter, but given in the level of rates that were at right now, if we stay at this level through the end of the year would you expect to add to your New York\u2019s stat reserves again this year or could you been doing that in the past for the last few years?", "Rick McKenney", "Okay.", "Jack McGarry", "I got Peter. Yes, good morning Jimmy. First from the group disability and Group Life it really, we take a look at there, it really look like just normal volatility on the group disabilities side the new claim incidence rates was up slightly average size was up and so was a combination of those two things that drove the results would again pointing to the first half of the year way to very, very good first quarter and a less good on second quarter, but year-to-date we are pretty much were we could expected the and we would you know in our outlook is not changed going forward. A Group Life it was absolutely an average claim size, so you know just higher paid people happened to be the peoples at that submitted claims or the claim size was up 6% for the quarter, and again that\u2019s something that we wouldn\u2019t view as being the trend and one of you is changing our outlook going forward.", "From the long term care side, where rates are and in the guidance that we\u2019ve given in the past we\u2019ve talked about New York being kind of a steady thing and so we would expect to have contributions to New York at a similar that we\u2019ve had in the past. And actually rates are a little better than they were at year end and so that there has been little modest improvement in that but again, we\u2019d expected the similar levels and it\u2019s clearly something that has been baked into our capital plans.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks, Jimmy", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James and Associates.", "Steven Schwartz", "Yes. Hey, everybody. Now I\u2019m not going to take up much time most were asked and answered. So thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks, Steven.", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction] And we will now go to Colin Devine from Jefferies.", "Colin Devine", "Okay. Thanks very much. So couple of things. Just to clarify on the deal situation because I don\u2019t believe Unam submitted a comment letter on it. But I presume then you just sort of participating with the ACI and using the welfare benefit plan and be carved out is number one.", "Number two, with respect to group life, in terms of if you look over the last six to seven years and I appreciate using I would just a severity issue, how many standard deviations were we sort of off your average. And then lastly on the capital management because gettingthis ROE up seems to me an ongoing challenge. Mind your standing is rolling over the closed lock securitization doesn\u2019t make a lot of economic sense. Can you just sort of walk us through why that is as things getting paid down fairly rapidly. Thanks.", "Rick McKenney", "Good. Thanks, Colin. Let me just follow-up on your first question. We are actually participating when I talked about our activities in Washington. One, there is direct conversation that we have. Second is through our trade associations, ACI would be one of those. So we did not submit our own comment letter but we are very much part in that process. Let me turn over, Jack, talk a little bit about the group life.", "Jack McGarry", "At the group life standard deviation, we did you an analysis of that. It was close to within one standard deviation. So we were clearly within our 75% confidence into on the group life. It was high but not out of the realm. On the securitization of the closed lock, where that\u2019s being paid down we\u2019ll - we will continue to look at capital options for both the close visibility block and we\u2019re actively looking for capital options the long term care block as well. So it\u2019s clearly something that we consider, and we will look for opportunities going forward.", "Colin Devine", "Can we get still little deeper into the close block securitization because if I recall and it was done in time, its come right there and goes back to it as well. You freed up I think it was about $800 million of capital. And my understanding now is if you rolled it the number might be a 100 or something. Life has changed, is it the way you can use reinsurance and how the [indiscernible] regulators you are looking at it, what\u2019s the difference today versus when you did it. If you could be more specific that would be helpful.", "Rick McKenney", "I think Collin its Rick . just couple of things, one is the size of the relative block so I think the cash flow is coming that block that reduce significantly as that block has run down particularly as you look back seven years. So the cash that comes off that we generally is part of the securitizations what you are really securitizing is roughly half of what it was back then. So that\u2019s a biggest thing. So there is no change in the rules, no change in the views around that.", "The second piece is the opportunity around is a much lower interest rate environment, so you think you have much better debt ability to much lower financing cost. It was done on a floating rate basis and so that was matched up early with floating rate assets. So you don\u2019t have that juice if you will as well. So there is benefit and I think there would be some benefits to relooking at that but it\u2019s more what is the magnitude of the those sides that we have out there.", "Colin Devine", "Okay. Well, then if that\u2019s not the option for you practically speaking are you explain selling off if you can part of the long-term care block, since that to me seems to be the only way the ROE is really going to start to move up.", "Rick McKenney", "I mean we would certainly entertain selling the long-term care block or reinsuring it, we\u2019re listening to the market, there are not a lot of buyers currently for particularly for big long-term care blocks. There have been a couple of very small transactions, they tended to be much older, more mature blocks. So we are actively there particularly if interest rates continue to rise, it makes that a more possible option in the market but there from what we\u2019ve seen there, they are just not the buyers yet on it.", "Colin Devine", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Colin.", "Operator", "And we will go now to Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.", "Humphrey Lee", "Thanks good morning, just a quick follow-up on your buybacks. So year-to-date you are running at little bit north of $200 million and kind of towards the lower end of your $400 million to $600 million targets, how should we think about the pace of the buybacks for the remaining of the year and what would make you kind of maintaining a similar pace of the first two quarters or what will kind of push you more towards the upper end of the guidance?", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Humphrey, Jack do you want to take that?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes we are very comfortable with our pace of buybacks currently, it is towards the lower end of the range, I think given our current stock price, given the current interest rate environment and given the activity that is going on within the insurance space, we think our current level of share repurchases strikes a good balance between financial flexibility of a company and good management of our capital levels.", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up on the long-term care cost, you mentioned you have been actively looking and but there assume not too many buyers, kind of in your estimate still talking about the price differences to ways apart and how is that trend kind of over the years, do you see that at least getting closer?", "Jack McGarry", "I think from my perspective, it is certainly interest rate rise the price difference gets closer in addition we have had two reductions in our discount rates on long-term care, so the spread between current rates and our discount rate gets closer that makes that option more viable. I frankly think that it has less to do with interest rates right now and more to do with comfort with the liability side and I think it is going to take some time in maturing of those blocks for people to get comfortable enough with it, that they will consider a purchase.", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay, got it. And then just on the interest rate part for long-term care, I remember a couple of years ago you guys were thinking about potentially keeping in some interest rate for your long-term care block but at the rate - come through, do you see rates improved again, what matter would you consider that we should be putting in some interest rate hedges to shield some of the interest rates to your long-term care block?", "Jack McGarry", "I think interest rates need to rise, rise more, I think we are probably close at the end of 2014, we remember that tenure was just north of 3%, so it is within the realm and again as we lowered the discount rates, the hurdle rate for putting hedges on gets lower as well.", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay, got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.", "Tom Gallagher", "Good morning. Just a question on the relationship and if there is anyone on the 2014 very strong sales growth you had in U.S. Group and whether or not that is contributing at all to the elevated benefit ratios this quarter, do you see that as a pricing issue at all or do you still have even if will remain around this level, is that still a good enough of turn you would necessarily need to see rate actions?", "Jack McGarry", "We actually look at claims by year of issue, and there was no evidence that any of the problems", " that we saw in the group lines where the result of recent sales, was pretty random with that stuff showed up by year of issue.", "Tom Gallagher", "[indiscernible].", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, no Jack said looking, you look at by issued here look at by industry geography and no concentration that was suggest that you had - underwriting quality or pricing issue in terms of what the trajectory of rate I mean if you look at particularly I think the disability market and you look at say look there is still work to be done pretty consistently on the interest rate front through the renewal program, persistence is done - is held up really nicely.", "We would certainly planned to see that continue but, will be audit from our rate increase perspective to the existing clients for next two or three years. And then our new business we moved rates up at the end of 2014 and - up again here at the mid year and that\u2019s just to get its currently as possible on interest rates and also just to reflect that you got a slightly aging population and that\u2019s going to drive into down the road for us.", "Tom Gallagher", "And can you give some perspective on magnitude of a rate further renewals as they come through?", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, so its mid to high single digits its pretty difficult and then for any particular pocket or client, you\u2019re going to see variance around that, but on average as we are.", "Tom Gallagher", "Is that change from were to been to say last year the year before to meet the high single digits?", "Rick McKenney", "Similarly it\u2019s edged update will be [indiscernible] as actually we would be done at extend of the programs, and so we are touching more clients than we had a year or two ago, but the average size increase pretty much in a range.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay, and then I would also just to add a question on supplementary in voluntary business. Margins here have been quite good, and my first question is that you think that\u2019s a reasonable run rate from a margins stand point whether you are look at the loss ration or just the pre-tax earnings margin that you have been experiencing there and I guess the second question is just trying to rap my head around you know looking at how good these loss ratios are individual disability 30% interest adjust loss ratio and granted it\u2019s a much different business and you are close block which is running in the 80s, but I just - trying to think about is that a number that is going to go up a lot over time or is that kind of aware the business form a pricing standpoint.", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, it\u2019s Mike To, across - in that supplemental segment in across both the voluntary individual is actually quite different businesses, but with the [indiscernible] trend around here question which I say wouldn\u2019t expect any dramatic movement I would say in general over time we would see loss ratios about at that level just slightly increasing over time and that would be offset by efficiencies gained and so would see operating expense is come down a bit in those lines and as a net impact is to your question is those are good healthy margins and we would seek to maintain those bottom [ph] mix wills shift over time.", "Tom Gallagher", "And, are there just looking it\u2019s a 43% voluntary benefits loss ratio, I mean are there a minimum loss ratio considerations at all or is that non applicable to these lines of business.", "Rick McKenney", "Yes, I think we are generally, we are good shape there I would say in the quarter particularly elevated lapses in voluntary benefits until there is a release of active like reserves that pushed up more favorable benefit ration there that\u2019s our play in the quarter in particular, but now I think in general we are in pretty good shape in that voluntary benefits portfolio there is product release that are going in a pretty regular stream and there is going through all 50 state filings and looking at experience in [indiscernible] there.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay, thanks.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And now we will go to Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar", "Good mornings everybody. I wanted to go back the elevated disability claims with this quarter and just wanted to got a sense are there any pockets of the market where you are seeking the claim size or incidence rate picking up.", "Rick McKenney", "It really as we look at by industry by size there wasn\u2019t really a pattern to it. So it appeared to us to be pretty much pure volatility. And the underlying piece too is the 50 basis points increase in the discount rate is going to drive your average size up itself now there is a little bit elevated about that. But that had a role to play in it as well.", "Yaron Kinar", "Got it. And then can you also maybe explain why the asset supporting group disability declined. I would have thought that\u2019d be up just given the sales growth and high persistency.", "Rick McKenney", "Yes. I mean that decline because the assets are more related to the reserves part in the business than it is the premium and so claim run offs with good recoveries as a reserves buying the business have been declining slightly and so the assets have been declining as well.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And finally, persistence is clearly still strong but still in the US was starting to see some declines in 2015 in short term visibility group life voluntary benefits. Do you see this is part of a broader trend or just normal volatility?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. I think its normal volatility. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to watch very closely just linking it to back into the reprising for interest rates as we work through the block it\u2019s the balance between placing the rate increases and retaining clients through that process at 89.3% feel very good about where it sits at the moment. But we will continue to watch it really closely.", "Yaron Kinar", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Rick McKenney", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Billingsley from Compass Point.", "Ken Billingsley", "Good morning. I wanted to just follow-up in your comments about the benefits or not giving the benefit from employment growth and a way to inflation, as employers and insurance brokers are not as focused on ACI are you seeing a shift and maybe their interest in pushing the benefit products or has that not actually translated yet.", "Mike Simonds", "Sure. It\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. Actually demand for our products because we\u2019re think them as financial protection benefits is growing and so generally what we see is ACI is just been part of a long term trend towards the consumer or the employee driving benefits decisions. And what we see is when you put a employee in front of a healthcare decision, they are going to buy down on the healthcare and usually that means higher deductable, higher co-pay type insurances lower monthly premium, they use some of that savings to buy products that help fill some of those gaps.", "So in general we see consumers with more interest in living benefits in particular supplemental health products, short term disability and like. Employers I think just as the economy is improving there is some of that slack is coming out of the labor market and so the need to attract, retained talent is hightened until doing so with employee choice option as an economic way to do it, so demand in the employer front is good.", "And then, I think to your point in the question, what we seemed in the distribution channel with brokers is a pretty strong interest to diversify away their revenue from such dependent on healthcare commission. And I would say even as consolidation continues in that health market, that\u2019s going to put further downward pressure on healthcare commissions and creates a demand for other source as a revenue and that\u2019s where Colonial Life Unum products fit very nicely.", "Ken Billingsley", "With the penetration in some of these employers for ACI because they had to, are you seeing that this is transition in opening more doors for your products or maybe they weren\u2019t considered before or it has demand not necessarily increased.", "Mike Simonds", "Yes. I think it\u2019s not an overnight sensation but I\u2019d say it\u2019s been a building sense of demand. One interesting kind of coral area is ACI has brought a pretty step up compliance and regulatory requirements particular around keeping track of time. And so what more and more employers are looking to technology benefit administration, cloud based, HR, IR solutions and the like. Those are platform that we\u2019ve worked hard to build a relationship overtime with until that\u2019s opening up some interesting channels for us. So technology driven distribution of benefits and so again, I don \u2018t think that\u2019s an overnight explosive growth, but at the slow burn which I think is getting parts of the market, we had been too before.", "Ken Billingsley", "Okay, thank you for taking my questions.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Erik Bass from Citi.", "Erik Bass", "Good morning, thank you. Given where interest rates are currently, do you anticipate there would be any need to make further adjustments to the new claims discount rates in the second half of this year?", "Jack McGarry", "We\u2019ll look at it, we will come to the end of the year, we do our annual claim review, reserve review in the fourth quarter, we have healthy margins currently in our interest margin, it is north of 95 basis points, so there is some room in there and we are optimistic that if perhaps the Fed begins to move in the second half of the year there is a little lift in the interest rates would help that a lot. So it is something that we are going to wait and see but we are comfortable with where we are, we are comfortable with our margin being at the higher end of we would like to see it and so I think we have some flexibility coming into the end of the year.", "Erik Bass", "Got it, thank you. And I guess just one question from Mike going back to the competitive dynamic, are you seeing or do you anticipate any impact from the recent or expected M&A in the group market?", "Mike Simonds", "Time will tell, I guess would be the quick answer is generally though when you see M&A it is going to be a pretty considerable distraction both acquiree and acquirer so that usually create some uncertainty and opportunity for players to stay focused through the period but again time will tell.", "Erik Bass", "Got it, thank you.", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks Erik.", "Operator", "We will take a question now from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you, good morning. The commentary benefits sales down a little bit was that consistent with the broader competitive pressure or was it just less take rates from individuals, what was the dynamic going on there?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, great thanks. I think it is a little bit of just quarter to quarter movement in sales trends, we had a really strong first quarter, I think year-to-date we are up 20% in voluntary benefit sales. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it, second quarter tends to be a light quarter in terms of seasonality for that particular line, generally we feel good and you look at the pipeline, it looks good I think demand for products is high and we continue to invest in capabilities around product of distribution and probably it has done a little bit of more investing than we have in years past around consumer centric capabilities and driving up take rates, participation rates for new and for existing plans and we are starting to see some pretty encouraging things there. So little bit of also in the second quarter but I think the long-term trends are healthy.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will now take a question from Ryan Krueger from KBW.", "Ryan Krueger", "Hey thanks good morning. Just want to follow up on the M&A commentary, I think you mentioned that you might have some debt capacity, your debt-to-cap ratio is around 25%, can you help us think about to how high you could bring that up if you done the deal that was attractive that required additional capital to finance?", "Mike Simonds", "Sure. When you think about the 25% we have today, it is kind of pure senior debt relative to our overall capital position, so there are different forms if you could take on and I think that the key about us being able to take it up from there is something we can do but it is also both at the longer term plan. So we say we feel good about 25% longer term if we take it up for a period of time for M&A and it comes back down in a pretty rapid basis we think that is just fine. So I want to approach top end range out there it is much more about the trajectory how we want to run it.", "Ryan Krueger", "Understood and then it has been a while since you have done an M&A, can you just, can you talk about your philosophy when it comes to evaluating M&A and accretion versus buyback and [indiscernible] that?", "Mike Simonds", "Well I think the first thing Ryan is when we look at M&A it is going to be above what is the strategic fit that we have with the overall company, so always at the start there and then very quickly go to the economics of the deal that you see out there. So I think about IRR, think about those things then you come relative to the use of capital, so we do compared to share repurchase which has been very good for us overtime so we\u2019re going to, we doing that as well and then we look at accretion, dilution I think those are important metrics for shareholders, those will be part of the mix as well but I take you back to number one is where is the fitness strategy and number two to the economics of the deal look like.", "Ryan Krueger", "And is else fair to assume that if you ware evaluating the M&A deal relative to buyback but you could probably deployed more capital into an M&A transaction and bring down your balance sheet metrics a little bit lower in an M&A deal then with buyback, from a rate giving our rating agencies and look at this.", "Rick McKenney", "I think it goes back to - the comment about is the long term to, so science about metrics on day one, what there expectations of those trends look like as well so I think - flexibility in there, it\u2019s a on exact science relative to share repurchase things like that but I think those are key [indiscernible] with you to help us think about different M&A transaction.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay, thanks. Appreciated.", "Operator", "Great. I will now take a follow up question from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.", "Humphrey Lee", "Thanks. Just a quick follow up on M&A so you talked about you kind of look at different things and I just talk curious is there any particular business type that you will be more insisted in over analysis so may be, prevent more voluntary over for the share group or anything in terms of the business that will be more interested", "Rick McKenney", "Well, Humphrey as I said we\u2019re looking at how does it fitting with the overall strategy so all of the things that you mentioned our all part of our strategy, we are figuring out how we can reach more customers through the employer so when you take that as a broad scope that\u2019s we\u2019re going to look at. So I want to get more specific in that but we\u2019re going to stay true to working through the employer but there are lot of needs that can provided through the employer which will explore all of those.", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay, thanks and then another thing upon your critical - I know one of your peers talked about, saying unfavorable, claims experience related to critical illness especially in the cancer coverage do you see anything kind of unusual or anything adverse or kind of resulting trend respect to kind of coverage for cancer treatments.", "Rick McKenney", "May be that\u2019s - Tim Arnolds talk about our Colonial IPO around our cancer product..", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, right the cancer products continues to form very well we certainly stay [indiscernible] of developments in the medical field around cancer treatment and the impact that might have on our benefits cost but at this moment we\u2019re pleased with the direction of the product and increasingly it\u2019s a differentiator for us because there are on as many company at their offering as specific product line.", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay so but overall did the claims experience a largely in line with your expectation unless you don\u2019t see that kind of elevated cost related to treatments.", "Rick McKenney", "Correct, no", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay. Alright, thank you.", "End of Q&A", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Humphrey. Operator we\u2019re coming up on time so I think, we\u2019ll thank everybody for taken time to join us this morning and operator that now completes our second quarter 2015 earnings call.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.", "Thomas White", "Great. Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from these results suggested by these forward-looking statements.", "Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Our SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at www.unum.com.", "I remind you that the statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. As we discuss our financial results this quarter, I'll remind you that our prior period results have been adjusted for our retrospective adoption of the accounting standards, update for tax credit partnership investments and qualified affordable housing projects. Adjusted prior period results are available on our website in a supplemental exhibit. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website also in the Investor section.", "So participating in this morning's conference call are Unum's President and CEO, Rick McKenney; CFO, Jack McGarry; as well as the CEOs of our core business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum U.S.; Peter O'Donnell for Unum U.K.; and Tim Arnold for Colonial Life. And with that I'll turn the call over to Rick.", "Richard McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. We finished 2015 on a strong note, with fourth quarter operating income at $0.95 per share. That's an increase of 6.7% over last year, brining the full year EPS to $3.64, which is an increase of 3.7%. We ended the year in the middle of our outlook range of 2% to 5%, which we were tracking to all year.", "I'm especially pleased with the balance performance we continue to show on our core business segments, with good levels of premium growth complemented by stable benefits experienced across all lines. This combination helps to drive strong profit margins and excellent capital generation for the company.", "Our financial flexibility continues to be an important asset to us, as we move into 2016, as we look to take advantage of the opportunities for profitable growth and to expand our leadership positions in the employee and voluntary benefits markets. I'll cover a few highlights for the fourth quarter, and then Jack will provide an analysis of our results in greater detail.", "I'll start with premium growth in our core business segments, which continues at a healthy and well-balanced pace. For the fourth quarter, premiums in each of our three core segments, Unum U.S., Unum U.K. and Colonial Life all increased by more than 5%.", "For Unum U.S. fourth quarter's sales had a difficult comparison given the 25% jump we saw in the year-ago fourth quarter. But for the full year 2015, we generated an increase of just over 4%, at the top end of our expectations coming into 2015. In addition, Unum U.S. persistency trends remains favorable and our ongoing focus on renewals help drive the 5.5% increase in premium income.", "Unum U.K. sales in local currency improved in the fourth quarter, with growth of 11%, driven largely by strong results in the core market long-term disability sales and large case group life sales. Combined with improving persistency and the benefit of a recently acquired dental business, Unum U.K. generated 5% growth in premiums in the fourth quarter as well.", "Finally, at Colonial Life, sales growth continues to be quite encouraging, increasing 5% for the fourth quarter and almost 7% for the full year, helping to generate premium growth of just over 5% for the quarter.", "Next, it's important that we have not sacrificed the profitability of our core businesses to generate this premium growth, as our benefits experiences remain stable across all three business segments. In fact, the benefit ratios for the three core business segments improved for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. Jack will provide additional detail on these trends in his commentary.", "Given these operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. This flexibility allows us to fund the capital required to grow our business, while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as we bought back $427 million of stock in 2015.", "In addition, we have continued to grow our book value per share, with book value now at $35.90, an increase of 8.4% for the year, consistent with the growth we have generated since 2008.", "And finally, the macro-environment, including the ongoing low interest rate environment, continues to present challenges. Interest rates and investments spreads remain below historical levels and below our portfolio yields. Our focus remains on actively managing through this environment by steadily talking pricing actions, but in the near-term, it does continue to dampen our profit growth.", "So with these highlights on our fourth quarter performance, I'll have Jack cover our results in greater detail. Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results, and now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating and business trends we saw in the quarter.", "I'll being with Unum U.S., where fourth quarter operating income was $214.2 million, an increase of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter of $209.5 million. Premium income growth remains very healthy, increasing 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, while the benefit ratio for Unum U.S. segment improved slightly to 71.1% in the quarter compared to 71.3% in the year-ago quarter.", "The profitability of Unum U.S. remained strong with an operating ROE of 13.1% for the fourth quarter and 13.3% for the full year. Within the Unum U.S. segment, operating income in our group disability business was $66.1 million, an increase of 0.3% from the year-ago quarter of $65.9 million.", "Premium income increased 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, but we continue to see pressure on net investment income, which declined by 5.7% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by lower asset levels, lower portfolio yields and lower miscellaneous investment income.", "Benefits experience improved in the fourth quarter relative to the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 81.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 83.7% a year ago, driven primarily by lower claims incidents rates and favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line, as well as favorable benefits experience in our group short-term disability line.", "Group Life and AD&D operating income was $54.3 million for the fourth quarter, a decline of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow at a favorable levels, increasing 5.2% over the year-ago quarter.", "The benefit ratio was 72% for the fourth quarter compared to 70.8% in the year-ago quarter due to a higher average paid claim size for the group life line in the AD&D line of business. While, the benefit ratio was higher on a year-over-year basis, the portfolio experience was generally consistent with the 71.8% benefit ratio for the full year 2015.", "Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was very strong at $93.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11.3% compared to $84.3 million in the year ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong for this line of business, increasing 5.7% in the quarter compared to last year.", "From the benefits perspective, results were in line with our expectations. The fourth quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 33.8% on an interest adjusted basis and 48% for the voluntary benefits lines.", "Looking at Unum U.K., operating income was \u00a324.4 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% over the year-ago quarter of \u00a324.1 million. The benefit ratio was 69.9% for the fourth quarter compared to 68.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher interest claim incidence trends in the group long-term disability and group life lines of business, which were partially offset by improved claim recoveries. Overall profitability of the U.K. segment remains quite favorable with an operating ROE at 20.6% for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year.", "Colonial Life continues to generate strong consistent results with operating income of $77.6 million, a 4.9% increase over the year-ago quarter of $74 million. The benefit ratio improved to 51.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 52.3% for the year-ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experienced in the accident, sickness and disability product line. Margins remain strong for Colonial Life with an operating ROE at 16.4% this quarter and 16.6% for the full year.", "Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $28.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.4 million in the year-ago quarter, excluding the 2014 long-term care reserved charge. The benefits experienced for the individual disability line was in line with our expectations.", "The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 87.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 81% in the year-ago quarter, was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher than normal level of miscellaneous net investment income. For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 89.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 89.6% for the year-ago quarter, excluding the reserve charge.", "The underlying risk experience for long-term care was consistent with our long-term expectations for the full year 2015 interest adjusted loss ratio of 87.6% within our expected range of 85% to 90%.", "Regarding, the reserve position for long-term care, we feel good about where we finished 2015 in terms of reserved adequacy. For the year, our new money yields exceeded our interest rate assumptions and risk results remained within our long-term expectations. In addition, rate increase approvals and implementation are tracking in line with our reserve assumptions.", "One additional comment on long-term care, the cash flow testing reserve addition we recorded for our New York subsidiary First Unum was $68 million at yearend 2015.", "I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across the company in the quarter. Again, starting with Unum U.S. total sales declined by 3.7% for the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. This was not unexpected, as we had very strong sales results from the year-ago fourth quarter and we continue to increase rates during the year. For the full year, Unum U.S. sales increased by 4.2%, which was solidly above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth.", "Looking at the sales results by product line, LTD sales were flat in the fourth quarter, but increased 7.2% for the full year. STD sales declined by 20% for the fourth quarter, but grew slightly for the full year increasing 5.8%.", "Our Group Life and AD&D sales declined 2.5% for the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Also, within Unum U.S. we had strong sales results in individual disability for the fourth quarter, increasing 30.4% to $21 million, driven by success with large case enrollments. Full year sales growth for the individual disability line was 18.8%.", "Finally, in the voluntary benefits product line, total sales declined 7.4% for the fourth quarter. Core market voluntary benefit sales showed very good growth, while large case sales were lower, against a very strong large case quarter last year. Full year 2015 sales and voluntary benefits increased 10.3% with good balance between the core market and large case sales.", "Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum U.S. calls for growth rate in 2% to 4% range again. It's likely that we'll see quarterly volatility, as we did in 2015, particularly given the volatility of timing of large case sales.", "Persistency for Unum U.S. continues at healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was 90.3% for the full year 2015, which was stable with the 90.5% for 2014. Given these sales trends and persistency levels, along with the underlying management of in-force renewals, we generated premium income growth for Unum U.S. this quarter of 5.5%. Full year premium growth was 6.4%, consistent with our long-term outlook for this segment and our strongest rate of growth in many years.", "Sales in Unum U.K. rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, increasing 11.2% in local currency with favorable trends in the core market group long-term disability product line and in group life. For the full year, sales grew by 6.2%. Persistency in the group disability line was 89.2% for the full year of 2015, up slightly from 2014 levels, but in line with our expectations.", "Persistency for the group life line continues to recover at 80% for full year 2015, up from 76% in 2014. Premium income growth for the U.K. this quarter was 5.4% in local currency, including the impact of the acquisition of the dental business in the third quarter and 2.3% for full year, above our expectations of 0% to 2% growth.", "Finally, Colonial Life sales remain on a positive trend, increasing 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 6.9% for the full year. Growth this quarter was again well-balanced between the commercial market sector, both the core market sales and large case sales and the public sector. In addition, each product line showed positive year-over-year growth.", "Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower for the year at 78.5% compared to 79.4% for 2014, but premium growth continues to show good momentum, increasing 5.1% in the fourth quarter compared to year-ago quarter. Full year premium growth was also 5.1%, well above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth. Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see in our core business segments, as well as the profit margins we're maintaining.", "Looking now at investment results, new money yields were slightly better in the fourth quarter compared to the first nine months of 2015. However, to date, new money yields remain below our current portfolio yields, so the downward pressure on our portfolio yields and net investment income continues to impact our profitability. We're actively raising prices in our markets to help manage this impact.", "The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. Our overall default experience relative to the Moody's index was again very favorable at 15 basis points for full year 2015 compared to 80 basis points for the index.", "I'd like to give you an update on our energy-related holdings, which totaled $5 billion or 11.6% of our total fixed maturity securities at yearend 2015. The severe widening of credit spreads in the energy sector during the fourth quarter reduced the net unrealized gain from $302.8 million, as of September 30, 2015, to a net unrealized loss of $51.4 million at December 31, 2015.", "We saw relatively more spread widening in the oilfield services and independent oil and gas sectors of our portfolio. As we discussed with you on our Outlook Meeting at December, these sectors tend to be the most sensitive companies to oil prices. The sectors represent 4% and 29.8% of our energy holdings, respectively, and had a net unrealized loss of $114.9 million as of yearend.", "The remaining two-thirds of our energy holdings are in midstream companies, integrated oil companies and refiners. These holdings are much less sensitive to oil prices and have a net unrealized gain of $63.5 million at yearend.", "Our exposure to below investment grade energy credits declined slightly in the quarter to 14.1% of the energy holdings compared to 14.8% at the end of the third quarter. Approximately three quarters of the below-investment grade exposure is in the more highly rated BB category. Realized losses in energy holdings from both losses on sales and from impairments were $20.1 million pre-tax for the fourth quarter.", "We have thoroughly reviewed our energy holdings and looked at a number of stressed scenarios. While downgrades of holdings and some impairments may happen over time, we feel the impacts are very manageable and do not alter our financial or capital plans.", "Moving to capital management, we continue to see very favorable trends. We repurchased $100 million of our stock this quarter, bringing the total repurchases to $427 million in full year 2015, which is approximately 4.9% of our yearend 2014 outstanding shares. We estimate, we closed the year with a weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies at approximately 400% consistent with the levels we've held throughout the year, and towards the higher end our expected range for the year.", "Holding company cash and marketable securities was $475 million at yearend and statutory operating earnings were $182.4 million for the fourth quarter and $689.2 million for full year 2015, a strong sales level of earnings in an 11.5% increase over 2014.", "Finally, I'll note our tax rate in the fourth quarter of 28.5% was favorable relative to the 30.9% rate that we've recorded for the first three quarters of the year. This was primarily driven by a reduction in deferred tax liability related to our U.K. operations, as a result of the enactment of future reductions in the U.K. tax rate. And also the benefit of the extension of active financing in the fourth quarter that reverse the tax expense we've recorded in the third quarter.", "Wrapping up, our expectation for after-tax operating income per share for 2016 has not changed from what we previously discussed at our Outlook Meeting in December. We did finished 2015 with a higher level of income than we had anticipated, so the growth rate for 2016 off of the $3.64 up 2015 operating income per share is expected to be within a range of 3% to 6%. So overall, it was a very good fourth quarter and a very strong full year performance for the company.", "Now, I'll turn things back to Rick for his closing comments.", "Richard McKenney", "Thanks, Jack. And just to wrap up before we go on to your questions. I'll reiterate from a company operating perspective, it was a very good quarter and year for our company. We've seen the resumption of topline growth for our core businesses and done so without sacrificing our profitability.", "Our statutory earnings are strong, which helps to generate capital to not only maintain a very healthy balance sheet for a troubling macro environment, but also a flexibility to grow and also return capital to our shareholders. This all positions us very well, as we move into 2016.", "We'll move now on to your questions, so I'll ask Cynthia to begin the questions-and-answer session. Cynthia?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.", "Ryan Krueger", "In supplemental and voluntary, the benefit ratios were a little bit higher than they have been running recently? And then DAC amortization was lower. Can you talk about what drove those two things? And if they were, I guess, related to each other?", "Jack McGarry", "There is some relation particularly in the voluntary benefit lines. Some of the products within those lines have active life reserves. And so if those policies terminate, you release the active life reserve and you write up the DAC associated with them. Actually, our persistency was a little better, particularly in those product lines that have those active life reserves and so that resulted in a little bit higher loss ratio and a little bit lower amortization of the DAC balance and net-net the earnings impact was very minimal.", "Ryan Krueger", "And then on long-term care, can you remind us what interest rate trajectory you're assuming in your GAAP long-term care reserves at this point?", "Richard McKenney", "Jack, do you want to take that?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. So as we told you -- actually its been a year ago now in the fourth quarter of 2014, we had assume that interest rates would stay level with the rates they're at somewhere around the 5% range all in for the next years and then would gradually revert to a long-term average over the subsequent five years.", "Ryan Krueger", "So the 5% is a new money rate?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, all in.", "Ryan Krueger", "And then, Rick, you said new money rates were bit better than that in 2015? Do you know where they are now?", "Richard McKenney", "I mean, it's hard to tell with treasury yields have clearly gone down over the last couple of weeks, spreads have widened since the end of the year, so I wouldn't have a spot rate for you.", "Operator", "And next we have John Nadel from Piper Jaffray.", "John Nadel", "I guess, Rick, a bit of a philosophical question for you. I find it kind of staggering, I guess, the market is somewhere around 10% off of its all time highs and yet Unum's shares are trading 30%, 35% below your 52 week high, and sort of staggering discount to book-value per share. I am just curious how you think about the pace of capital management in particular when you think about a 400% risk-based capital ratio relative to your business mix and that coming off of a very strong year of statutory operating income in 2015?", "Richard McKenney", "Sure, John. Just to give you some perspectives on that, I think that one of the things that I'd bring you back to very quickly though is we operate this company in the same way we've been operating it, very consistent. We're growing the company now, margins are still very good. And we as a team here are focused very much on that.", "In terms of what's going on in the market around us, so there's a lot of things out there in the news, continued lower interest rate environment, questions about the economy, there's so many things that impact our stock price, we try not to focus on that from an operating perspective.", "Well, it does actually meet up with how we think about managing the capital of the company, as we are buying back our shares and have been doing so for the last several years. So when you look at that, you think about where we're buying back shares today relative to where we were, even in the fourth quarter and for over the average of the year, and how does that impact for our thinking.", "And what I take you to, and this gets to your philosophical point is, we actually on that front stay very consistent as well. So we think about ourselves as being a steady returner, more capital to our shareholders. We'll buy a little bit more when prices are down and a little bit less when prices are up, but consistency of return is something that we focus on as a general philosophy of the company, but also with regards to capital management.", "So as we look at where our share price is today, we would be buying a lot more shares in terms of the actual dollars that we're putting out, you'll probably see a pretty consistent level to what we've done in the past.", "John Nadel", "So no significant -- if we think about it relative to your outlook for 2016, I think you had formally indicated that dollar amount of buybacks would probably be pretty similar to the level spent in 2015, no significant adjustment there then, Rick?", "Richard McKenney", "I think that's probably fair. And when you think about it, we're buying back shares with the capital, with free capital we're generating, so this isn't something other than as we generate that capital, which we've done so very consistently, we're returning that to our shareholders through share repurchase, and as a result of that our steady operating performance would say that we'll be pretty steady in terms of returning capital as well.", "John Nadel", "And then a quick one on the tax rate. Just is there any implication, as you look out to 2016, Jack, as a result of the U.K. adjustment or do we stick with the 31% to 32% range that I think you guys have expected for this year?", "Jack McGarry", "No, I think that 31% to 32% range that was kind of a one-time shift. It's not going to really move when you've got that much going forward.", "John Nadel", "And then last one is maybe for, Mike, and that's just a question about January 1, very important, obviously, sales and retention period. Any color you can offer as to what's going on in the U.S. market there?", "Michael Simonds", "So first would be, you're right, it is an important date for us on the renewal front, a good news there. So persistency is in line with what our expectations are. That's great, that the big driver of the topline. But also, as you know, we've been putting gradual price increases into the market about every six months over the last 18 months to 24 months.", "So sticky business is always good, but particularly, when you're gradually increasing rates, particularly in group insurance to account for the low interest rate environment that we talked about, so feel good about that.", "On the new business front, you'd sort of see a slight decline in sales this year. I think we're down about 3% in the fourth quarter. But as both Rick and Jack highlighted, actually 4Q came in right in line with our expectations. We faced a really difficult comp, up 25% a year ago. So good to finish for the full year, right at or just over to top of the range we laid out to you guys at the beginning of the year.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "First, if you could discuss the potential for reductions in the disability reserve discount rate, given what's happened with interest rates? And maybe, if you could provide us some sort of sensitivity on what a basis points change in the discount rate would do to your benefits ratio in the U.S. disability business?", "Richard McKenney", "Jack, do you want to pick up?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, so we've seen reductions, we've seen the interest rates fall since yearend. This is very similar to what happened last year, actually too, during this period. It doesn't mean they're going to stay there for the full year. We've also seen spreads widening. I'd point you back to the fourth quarter, where actually our new money rates were higher than we've seen in quite a while. And we're supportive about reserve assumptions in both disability lines, as well as long-term care lines. We keep track of that.", "We keep raising rates in response to the lower interest environment. We look for opportunities to book money to work at good yields. And it's something we'll look at during the year. I'd say that we're pretty comfortable right now that throughout 2015 that we won't be forced to take a precipitous action, because we have a good margin and interest margin now in our reserves, but its something we continue to look at and decide, as we do our reserve reviews.", "Richard McKenney", "And the sensitivity is about 25 basis points, is about roughly $12 million in BTOE on an annualized basis.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then, on long-term care, obviously rates are challenging, but how are the other things going, as the claims trends your success in achieving price hikes versus what you might assumed when you took the reserve charge in the fourth quarter of 2014?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, so actually, since we took the charge in 2014 things have been pretty much in line with our expectations. There has been some volatility quarter-to-quarter, but client trends has stayed in that range of the 85% to 90% loss ratio. And we continue to make good progress on our rate increase assumption, so both the rate of approvals and the actual implementations are pretty much in line with the underlying reserve assumptions.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then just lastly on long-term care. As you mentioned, you're assuming stable rates or you assumed stable rates for five years and then an increase in rates thereafter. So philosophically, if rates remain lower through this year or maybe even next year, you would have gone two to three years into that. Would you review your assumptions again or would you just wait for the first five years to go through and then review them?", "Jack McGarry", "We consistently review our assumptions. So we do reserve reviews at the end of every year based on the assumptions, and I think the question we would ask ourselves when looking at that is has our outlook for the future changed. And it's not going to change rapidly, but certainly something we continue to look at as we do our reserve reviews.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Randy Binner from FBR.", "Randy Binner", "I guess, I just want to follow-up on Jimmy's question there because I guess the mean reversion, I guess, by definition gets worse every year that rates stay low. So just to paraphrase that, are you saying that the mean reversion hasn't changed enough for you to unlock now, but if we're sitting at the similar or lower level rates from a year from now, would that kind of technically lead to an unlock, just because the data is changing?", "Jack McGarry", "No, I wouldn't say, it would technically lead to an unlock. Again, it's something we will look at what our view of the future is when we do our reserve reviews at yearend, but there is no magic kind of we have to do this if this happens associated with it.", "Richard McKenney", "I think unlike, you mention the word unlock, and this is not an unlock. So when you look at it, this is also not a mean reversion. So this is a view on path of interest rate, so over a 10-year period of time. And as Jack said, that's an outlook that we had last year, going to through the process, and it really hasn't changed as of now. And so it's not something that we look at a mean reversion, as you think about traditional method.", "Randy Binner", "And then just jumping over to the credit side. Is there any update -- the disclosure around your energy exposure is very good relative to your peer, so we appreciate that. And as you mentioned in the opening remarks, the unrealized loss really is not that big, at least as of yearend.", "I'd be interested in any update kind of on what year-to-date activities look like there from an unrealized position? And if there has been any action by Unum to de-risk energy or any other credits that are moving out or if conversely you're seeing this as maybe an opportunity to add more at wider spreads?", "Jack McGarry", "We're certainly not starting with the last thing first. We're not viewing this as an opportunity to add more at wider spreads. We always actively manage our portfolio. So we are a credit shop. We're looking at our energy things. Spreads have widened since yearend, so that unrealized loss would be somewhat bigger. We haven't fully valued the portfolios yet, so we don't know what the size of that is.", "But again, probably the important thing to note is we are all over our energy portfolio. We looked at, we stress tested it under a number of different scenarios. When we look at it, we consider both the realized losses that we may have to take, as well as the RBC impact of any downgrades that we would foresee. And because of the strong financial position we go into 2016 with, we view this as a very manageable issue for us. There is nothing we see right now that would change our outlook for capital plans for 2016.", "Randy Binner", "On the stress test is there anything you can share with those? You're talking about ratings migration down and RBC ratio, and then just, I guess, straight credit losses. Is there anything you can share on what you've run from a stress case scenario?", "Jack McGarry", "I mean, we start with an oil price trajectory and a set of assumptions around that. I'm not going to go into the specifics of what that trajectory is, but it's actually consistent with, if not, more conservative than kind of overall market estimates and we've taken some downside scenarios from there. And throughout, it's not that -- there are some things that come up there, but they're very manageable within our capital plan.", "Operator", "The next is Erik Bass from Citigroup.", "Erik Bass", "I guess, as you went through the yearend enrollment season, did you see any material change in consumer behavior, particularly in terms of election rates for voluntary products?", "Richard McKenney", "Mike, you want to start and then we'll go to Tim.", "Michael Simonds", "In general, actually, we saw it's slightly higher participation rates. And while we're still debriefing and understanding, I think a couple of things contributing. First has been across both the Unum and Colonial Life brand continued investments in our enrollment and education capabilities that we always want to be a little bit better each year at what we do.", "And then the other piece was we certainly saw disposable income. You look at where the price of oil that created a little of capacity I think for the average consumers, so that played through as well.", "Richard McKenney", "Tim, on Colonial Life?", "Timothy Arnold", "Yes, absolutely. We saw the same trends. And the only thing I would add aside from what Mike mentioned is we continue to believe that both the Affordable Care Act, as well as employer behavior around deductibles on medical plans are helping drive some increased participation in our products as well.", "Erik Bass", "And then, can you just remind this how much exposure you have to the energy sector or to related sectors from a client perspective?", "Richard McKenney", "Yes, sure. So I think we look at it across all the product lines, but probably most acutely in the long-term disability product line. We've got about 2% of our block in energy. And we've actually gone back and looked at the cycle of energy prices over a couple of decades and haven't really seen much for a correlation with incidence, and we're certainly not seeing any misbehaving risk from this point, but we look at pretty much every industry sector all the time.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.", "Humphrey Lee", "Just a follow-up on the investment yield. You talked about 2015 being a little higher. What are you seeing in terms of value right now, kind of getting you to that 5% range, especially for supporting the long-term care?", "Jack McGarry", "I think it's driven by two things. One of the big ones is spreads widened. And although, the yield curve has flattened at the front-end, it's still stayed pretty steady at the long-end, so the spread between the 10 year and the 30 year is still in that 75 basis point to 85 basis point range.", "And so when you invest in longer maturities, which as a result of some of the M&A activity, there is a lot more long tranches available. And you put the widened spreads on top of those you get up above the 5% range through the end of the year. There is also alternative investments, we put a portion of the portfolio -- have continued to put a portion into high yield where spreads have widened as well.", "Humphrey Lee", "And then some of your peers talked about there is some disruptions in a group insurance marketplace, because of company's exiting the business or consolidations going on. Can you just talk abut in general the overall market environments for Unum U.S. and Colonial Life?", "Richard McKenney", "Mike, you want to start?", "Michael Simonds", "Sure. So we have seen a bit of consolidation with a few names, I'd say, sort of mid-sized coming together and/or being required by an international player. I wouldn't say that that has led to a significant disruption. So if we look at things like, again, the renewal rates for us have been right in line to slightly favorable.", "I think the proposal activity has been generally in line with what we've seen across the segment, so not a big disruption I would point to. But I do think if you think about the market in general, there's sort of the capabilities that are offered and we have seen a few new entrants into the market, but the good news for us is capabilities in terms of the process, the technology, and the people, they take a substantial amount of time to build, so we feel pretty good about the head start we have there.", "The pricing environment, just to give you some color, I would say is pretty typical. We've got a few carriers that are having stepped back and repriced to improve margins. And then we've got a few that are probably leaning a bit more into growing their books, and I think that kind of balances out, so a pretty typical pricing environment.", "Timothy Arnold", "Yes, I think the story is similar. We are now seeing any disruption based on consolidation. Blocks have been very stable. And where I think they will show up first will be in our large case block and we're not seeing any disruption there.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kovac", "A technical question here. I'm thinking about the bond portfolio. When we look at some of the unrealized los positions that have been there for over a year and that grew obviously in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, how do you determine when you take an impairment on those bonds? Is it well, sort of the level at which they're trading below fair value or is there certain time horizon? Just maybe if you could give some help in terms of thinking about when you would take such a charge?", "Richard McKenney", "Jack, you want to share our views on that.", "Jack McGarry", "So, there is no hard and fast rules around when you would recognize an impairment, but there are some guidelines, and we consider four things. The first is, is it money good, so do we believe that we're going to get principal on interest payments out of it. The second thing we'll consider is do we intend to hold it to recovery, and so if we do, that would keep it at book value.", "The third thing you consider is, are they current on interest on principal payments. And then beyond that, it tends to be a security-by-security analysis, its a judgment about whether we believe over time this will recover and be money good, and so there is no hard and fast rules. We work with our investment department, we work with our auditors, and we come to judgments on the securities.", "Michael Kovac", "And then switching gears a little bit, thinking about the environment for rate increases in long-term care, it sounded like it came in sort of in line with your expectations. Are you seeing any change in tone from regulators, as we continue to be in a low interest rate environment, both in terms of your position in the market and in terms of seeing some other companies, maybe we consider whether they are writing new business in long-term care?", "Jack McGarry", "I think we've continued to see a positive tone from regulators. It's certainly better today than it was three or four years ago. Even some of the kind of late adopter states like New York are seem to be coming along and considering rate increases in a different light, given the environment. So I think it continues to get better over time.", "Operator", "Our next comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric Berg", "Jack, in the Investor Day that you held back in December, I was really interested in the whole discussion about how the Closed Block of individual disability business is increasingly looking like a lifetime annuity. And I was also very interested in the distinctions that you drew in the risk characteristics of your group LTC business that is closed versus your individual business.", "My inference was that maybe these businesses could be sellable, re-insurable or that somehow you could free up the capital this year. Was that the right inference? You answered no on that. And was that the right inference? And if it was the right inference, what would be the process that would follow this year to move forward on that front?", "Jack McGarry", "Clearly, looking at capital management opportunities on both of those blocks is something that we actively do and consistently. Whether those opportunities can actually come to fruition this year, it would be really hard to say. So it's something we look at and we're in constant communications with alternative sources of capital, but being able to predict whether something will actually happen or not would be beyond what I could do.", "Eric Berg", "And if I could just ask one follow-up question and that would be to Rick. Rick, if the company is as flexible and as an opportunistic as you say it is, if you have the capital strength to be flexible and opportunistic, then why wouldn't you -- going back to John's question, why wouldn't you with the stock price where it is step up your dollar amount of share repurchase to take advantage of this opportunity?", "Richard McKenney", "Yes, it's a fair question, Eric. I think it gets back to the pace at which we're doing that. We do have that flexibility. We could do that if we so choose. But it comes back to the philosophy we have in the company around, as we generate the capital we're going to return it to the shareholders. Some of the excess capital positions we hold, we think about it using and how we could deploy that to grow the company in different areas. And so it's been much more on that philosophy.", "You have to remember, we've been doing this now, if you go back for the last seven years. And so over that period of time, we've seen our stock price move up and down. Often times it's not related to what's going on in the company. And so we've taken advantage of some low stock prices and at the same time we bought back shares when we were at a higher price.", "And so I think now is the right time to pile in, to buying a whole a lot of shares, I think that that's atypical for our company. We're much more disciplined, much more consistent in how we look at things.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James.", "Steven Schwartz", "First for Jack, I apologize I got cut out on Randy's question with regards to energy. Jack, do you know or did you say, what the market-to-market loss would be on the below investment grade energy portfolio at yearend?", "Jack McGarry", "No, we did not say that.", "Steven Schwartz", "Could you share?", "Timothy Arnold", "The high yield, let's see we were trade out -- yes, so just to breakdown the numbers, we have $51.4 million of unrealized loss at yearend, right. So on the investment grade side it was an unrealized gain of $138.3 million. And so the high yield is trading in an unrealized loss of $189.7 million.", "Steven Schwartz", "And then another numbers question. Jack, that was a $69 million charge that you took at Unum New York for long-term care at yearend?", "Jack McGarry", "Very close, $68 million.", "Steven Schwartz", "And could you remind me is that in the statutory operating earnings that you show in the supplement?", "Jack McGarry", "No, I believe it's a capital adjustment, yes.", "Steven Schwartz", "And then for, Mike, maybe you could talk about kind of fourth quarter, kind of natural growth trends. I know you said elections were up a little bit, but maybe employment as well. Talk about that, any other thing, and also obviously for Colonial?", "Michael Simonds", "Yes, sure. So pretty actually consistent with the last few quarters where it is a positive, but it's a very modest positive, and probably a point or a point-and-a-half lower than what we would see in a healthier part of the cycle. We definitely have been looking at the macro numbers. See good unemployment change and good employment growth. Unfortunately, a fair amount of that is coming in lower benefited part time and non-benefit eligible type employees.", "So it's not flowing through at a commensurate level into our book. One would have to believe that overtime if we're able to sustain reasonable GDP growth and continued strong employment numbers, that will start moving through all the tranches on the employment base, but little bit modest at this point.", "Timothy Arnold", "I think, probably not specific to natural growth, but we are seeing nice results in the small case market, as we shared at the Outlook Meeting. We see a lot of opportunity in that market with almost 6 million employers in the list in the less than 100 states. And we certainly think that that group is benefiting from the economic environment. We think they're growing their employee base, but we're seeing nice results there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS.", "Suneet Kamath", "So I guess to echo John Nadel's question, I mean, segment results here remain pretty strong, but you've not been able to tell from the stock price. So clearly there's something else going on which I think is based on the questions asked is the investment portfolio. So maybe would be helpful, if you give us a sense, as we think about that capital generation model that you shared with us last December, what sort of credit loses do you build into that model?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. In that model, we gave an outlook on the capital plan. We didn't specifically in building out that model put the capital losses in there. We have stressed the model, however, with capital losses under various scenarios and basically the tenants of the model particularly around free cash flow generation and share repurchase hold up very well under the stresses.", "Suneet Kamath", "We focused a lot on the energy portfolio today, but as you think about just the overall portfolio, your high-yield exposure, your BBB exposure, any more color in terms of your watch list and what you're seeing as things develop here?", "Jack McGarry", "The watch list has been pretty consistent. It is mostly energy and commodities at this point. We feel extremely good about the rest of the portfolio.", "Suneet Kamath", "And the last one is again maybe more of a philosophical question. As we think about your capital allocation across your businesses, it seems like the portion that's allocated to the Closed Block is, I don't know, almost a little over a third of your capital, maybe 35%, 36%. Is that factored into your thinking, n other words, is there a limit in terms of how big you want that allocation to be?", "It would seem to me that most of the capital that you're using for share repurchase is coming out of the operating segment, so naturally there would be some upward drift in that allocation. Just want to get a sense of how should we be thinking about that number? Is it a binding constraint at all? Any guidance would be helpful.", "Richard McKenney", "I'm not sure if it's philosophical. When we think about the capital allocation to our Closed Block, that's not where we want to be putting our capital today. So the numbers you see here today are higher than we want them to be. And I think that gets back to the question that Jack was answering is how do we free up that capital, how we reduce the capital behind those lines of business, so that we can continue to do what we've been doing in funneling more capital to our operating companies.", "We're also in a fortunate position that we are generating enough capital as a company that our business lines, our main operating companies are getting all the capital that they need to continue to generate growth. I think the only constraint is more in the market and making sure that there's good profitable growth as opposed to the amount of capital we can put behind it.", "So as we tell everyone inside the company is we want to funnel as much capital as we possibly can to continue to grow our lines of business. And what we haven't found is actually a shortfall to do so and that's one of the reasons we're buying back a lot of stock is because we actually can't put as much capital as we want to behind our growing lines that are generating very high returns.", "So back to original question, I think that the capital allocating to our Closed Block is one that we want to reduce over time. And as we talked about different settings, that's something we're actively working on as a company.", "Suneet Kamath", "And then just on the IDI to follow-up on Eric Berg's question. If you were to pursue a solution, just trying to get a sense of how much capital you think that could free, would it be wrong to assume that would be $200 million?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. I mean, I don't think we can speculate on that until we have a better idea of what a solution might look like.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.", "Tom Gallagher", "First question just on long-term care. So the interest adjusted loss ratio is in the high 80s? And I know that's in kind of the high end of the band that you all have looked at.", "I guess, just a follow-up, as we think about whether it's 2016 or 2017 and potential risk of another reserved charge, is it fair to say that if this moves north of 90%, is that where you'd be potentially vulnerable for a possible reserve charge, which I presume would be more on the claim side, in terms of, if you saw an escalation of claim trends or adverse reserve development. But can you help us think about the numbers, the interest adjust loss ratio and then potentially additions to reserves?", "Jack McGarry", "I would say that it's a lot more complicated than that. The reserve basis of long-term care is very detail. There is a lot of sensitive assumptions that interplay. We're thinking guidance that if you were above 90% for a long period of time that would be an indication of pressure on the reserves. But it wouldn't react to one or two quarters in that range and it would really depend long-term on what the factors were that would driving you above 90%.", "Tom Gallagher", "So I think in the past, you guys have been able to say or give some indication about what at least the next year's outlook would be? Would you say based on what you know today, there would be very low likelihood of a reserve addition in 2016 or is it too early to tell?", "Jack McGarry", "I mean, I don't think we've actually provided outlooks on our reserve position today at yearend. I would say we feel comfortable with where we are today. We just went through a reserve review that culminated in the quarter we're talking about. So we're as close to our ending reserve review as you can get. We feel good about that reserved review and where it ended, but I'm not going to speculate about what next year's reserve reviews are going to generate.", "Tom Gallagher", "And then, just back on the energy portfolio $372 million of growth unrealized losses, it was the number at yearend. And I know year-to-date spreads have obviously gapped out further. Do you have an update on where that would be? And then can you also just talk a little bit about your process of looking at bonds that trade, say, less than $0.80 on the dollars. How does that process work internally? Is there further due diligence at certain levels? Is it $0.80, is at $0.70? Anyway, those are both questions I had on it.", "Jack McGarry", "So clearly, the spreads have widened in the energy sector since yearend, so that $370 million would be wider. We do monthly evaluations on most of the bonds in our portfolio, that's not complete right now and so we don't have a number for you that we can share.", "With respect to what we look at, again, I bring you back to the first one we look at, is it money good. Do we tend to hold it through recovery? And then are they current with interest and principal payments? You talk about the review of bonds that are under a certain percent of market to book. The fact of the matter in our energy portfolio today, we are consistently reviewing those bonds.", "We're looking at all the high yield bonds. We're looking at those bonds on an ongoing basis and actively working to manage through this, so I don't think there's anything special about bonds necessarily by where they're trading relative to book, because we're looking at that entire portfolio on a constant basis.", "Tom Gallagher", "Well, just as a follow upon that, I thought the concept of OTTI was that even if bonds are money good, but it's determined to be trading at an impaired level on a permanent basis, that's where bonds are impaired, at least from a gap accounting standpoint. That sort of what I was getting at from the standpoint of, not so much are you writing it down from a statutory standpoint, but from a GAAP standpoint, the concept of OTTI is a price-driven concept, not a loss-driven concept, if you know what I mean.", "Jack McGarry", "And our view is it's not a bright line loss-driven concept. The big question there is, as you said, is it temporary or not? And so the question we have is do we expect it to -- if its money good it's going to recover, because ultimately it's going to pay off and you'll get all your proceeds.", "And so, again, it comes back to those things, is it money good, do we intend to hold this, is it current? And clearly the longer and lower it trades, kind of the more pressure and the more work you need to do to demonstrate that those first three are actually true and believable, but it is not a bright line issue.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Seth Weiss from Bank of America.", "Seth Weiss", "Just to approach the question on sensitivity to capital on the investment portfolio, if we look at that 45% of the portfolio that's at Baa, could you help us think about how much of that may be at risk to moving to below investment grade? And then on sensitivity to the risk-based capital level, is there a rule of thumb that if you could gave us in terms of every percent increase to below investment grade? And what that may do to RBC, as we have some ratings migrations?", "Jack McGarry", "I can give you a couple of things to tether to. One is if we look at the portfolio, and said, if every single bond in our energy portfolio was downgraded a single notch, so Baa2 went to Baa3 and Baa3 went to BB, what would be the impact be, that's a four point impacts on our risk-based capital. The second tether point I'd give you, if everything dropped a full letter, so all our BBB's went to BB's, all of our AA's went to BBB that would be a 15 point impact to our risk-based capital.", "Calculating the impact on risk-based capital is more complicated than just looking at the change in the RBC factors, because C1 capital gets tax affected and so that reduces the burden. There is also a significant diversification benefit with C1 capital that further reduces the impact relative to those numbers. So it's something that that we really need to don't work through, but it's far less of an impact then just looking at the change in the percent capital holdings and multiplying them by 3.5.", "Seth Weiss", "And then one very quick follow-up on just the interest margin and on LTD. I think last quarter you were at around 85 basis points in terms of that margin. Could you just give us an update of where that stands today?", "Jack McGarry", "It's in the low 80s.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Nadel from Piper Jaffray.", "John Nadel", "So thanks for extending and taking the follow-up. So there's a lot of questions and a lot of focus obviously on given what rates are doing on the long-term care block. I just want to make sure I had a couple of data points accurate. If I think about when you took the fourth quarter 2014 charge, it would have been based on -- if I understand it correctly, it would have been based on where interest rates were at right around that time in the end of the year.", "So the tenure was at 2.17%, it averaged 2.54% for 2015, and it's now down at 1.84% or so. I mean spreads have widened enough to well offset that 30 or so basis point reduction in the tenure, have they not? I mean, it sort of seems to me like this issue of a potential long-term care charge driven by rates necessitates a view that rates fall significantly further from here, is that reasonable?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, I would say that's reasonable. So we're pretty comfortable with where we are right now.", "John Nadel", "And then the last one I have for you is just a follow-up on the mechanism for the IDI Closed Block. There is a elevated level of prepayments income I believe in the Closed Block in the fourth quarter. And then if you look at the interest adjusted individual disability benefit ratio that was up, that is a mechanism by which you're essentially recognizing the faster payment of that investment income by shoring up the reserves with that investment income today, is that right?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, because that money is going to be invested at new money rates, so it's going to put pressure on the portfolio rate underlying the discount rate. And so we reduced the discount rate to likely offset that impact.", "John Nadel", "And then last one is just if I go back to your Investor Day presentation, I think I'm looking at something around $950 million, maybe slightly less than a $1 billion of cash flow to invest in 2016 for the total Closed Block. And I recognize that a 1% difference in the new money yield has more than a one-year impact, right in that investment income, but we are talking about $10 million difference in a single year for 1%, is that right?", "Richard McKenney", "The $1 billion is roughly right, so depending on how it comes in over the year and what rates do over the year, that's pretty rough math.", "Jack McGarry", "But it's also that $1 billion will be invested over the year, so it's not invested one-one, so it would be less than $10 million.", "John Nadel", "I understand, but the differential between investing at a rate 1 percentage point lower on average is literally $10 million pre-tax in a year, correct?", "Richard McKenney", "Correct.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes.", "End of Q&A", "Richard McKenney", "John, thanks for that follow-up. And actually, we're over time now, so I think we'll cut it off here, Cynthia. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to join us this morning. Actually, we look forward to seeing many of you at investor conferences in the weeks ahead. And so that completes our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White.

As well as the CEOs of our core business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum U.S.; Peter O'Donnell for Unum UK; and Tim Arnold for Colonial Life.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Rick for his opening comments.", "Rick McKenney", "Great, thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. We're happy to be taking you through our first quarter results which were a strong start to the year. Overall, we saw first quarter operating income per share at $0.95 which was an increase of just under 7% over last year. There are continued positive operating trends underlying this. This starts with solid levels of premium growth across all three of our core business segments and also included stable benefits experience. This performance continues to drive strong profit margins and excellent capital generation for the Company, giving us lots of flexibility.", "We've consistently said that our financial flexibility is an important asset. I believe our first quarter actions demonstrated that point, as we not only maintained capital deployment through share repurchases at a time when our shares were trading lower, but we also invested in our future growth with an announcement of our agreement to acquire Starmount Life Insurance Company. We believe this transaction will help us capitalize on the growth opportunity in the dental market which is very consistent with our employee benefits focus.", "Now let's get to a few key highlights of the first quarter and then Jack will provide an analysis of our results in greater detail. To begin, I'd like to highlight the premium growth we continue to see in our core business segments. For the first quarter, premiums in Unum U.S., Unum UK and Colonial Life all showed very good momentum, with roughly 6% growth rates.", "For Unum U.S., we generated premium growth of 5.8% for the first quarter, with good persistency trends, strong contributions from our renewal programs and pricing actions and our 2015 sales levels. New sales did decline in the first quarter due to some increased competition we're seeing in the market and also some difficult sales comparisons. It's an area where we will continue to be disciplined and we will continue to take price where we see it is needed. Unum UK premium growth in local currency improved 6.1% in the first quarter, with the benefit of the National Dental Plan acquisition we did in the middle of last year. And, finally, at Colonial Life, premium growth for the first quarter was 5.7%, driven by the very positive sales trends we have seen over the past two-and-a-half years which continued again this quarter, with a new-sales growth of 16%, our strongest rate of sales growth in many years.", "Next, with this improvement in premium growth over the past several quarters, I'm especially pleased that we've maintained the profitability of our core business. I believe this demonstrates our disciplined approach to our markets and how we price, underwrite and go through our renewal process once we have placed business on our books. It can be challenging in today's low interest rate environment to continually move price increases into the market, but our teams are doing a commendable job of managing the balance required between generating top-line growth and maintaining profit margins. With these strong operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of statutory earnings and capital which provides us substantial financial flexibility.", "As I mentioned, this flexibility was especially evident this quarter with the repurchase of $100 million of our shares at very attractive levels. Along with the announcement of our planned acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company which we expect to close in the third quarter. The Starmount acquisition is consistent with our desire to invest in the growth of our core businesses and we believe will provide an attractive national platform for us and its scalable infrastructure to profitably grow in the dental market.", "Starmount also brings a team that has a strong cultural fit with Unum and how we serve our customers. We're excited about the strategic transaction which will help us expand our customer relationships, both within Unum U.S. and Colonial Life operations. In addition to all this, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, continues to grow at a steady pace, ending the quarter at $36.68, an increase of 8.6% from a year ago. Overall, it was a very good quarter with our core operations driving steady, stable growth and our capital management actions continuing to deliver value for our shareholders.", "So, with those highlights on a very good first quarter, let me turn the call over to Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack.", "Jack McGarry", "Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. Rick provided a high-level overview of our first quarter results and now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we saw in the quarter. I'll begin with Unum U.S., where first quarter operating income was $215.9 million, an increase of 0.7% from the year-ago quarter of $214.3 million. Premium income growth remained very healthy, increasing 5.8% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio for Unum U.S. segment was favorable, at 69.3% in the first quarter, although it was slightly higher than the very favorable 68.3% in the year-ago quarter. In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management also contributed to the operating results.", "The profitability of Unum U.S. remains very strong, with an operating ROE of 14.4% for the first quarter, compared to 13.5% in the year-ago quarter. Within the Unum U.S. segment, operating income in our Group disability business was $70.4 million in the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter of $74.3 million. Premium income increased 6.3% over the year-ago quarter, but we continue to see pressure on net investment income which declined by 3.4%, compared to the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by lower portfolio yields. The benefit ratio of 80.6% in the first quarter was at the favorable end of our expectations, although it was higher than the very favorable 80.1% benefit ratio we experienced in the first quarter of last year.", "Group Life and AD&D operating income was $55.4 million for the first quarter, a decline of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow, increasing 5% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 71.5% for the first quarter, compared to 70.9% in the year-ago quarter, due to increased incidence and a higher average claim size. Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was very strong at $90.1 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 9.7%, compared to the $82.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong in this line of business, increasing 5.7% in the quarter, compared to last year. From a benefits perspective, our overall results remain in line with our expectations.", "The first quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 50.9%, compared to 48.9% in the year-ago quarter, as new claim incidence rates were slightly higher. For the voluntary benefits line, the first quarter 2016 benefit ratio was 43.8%, compared to 40.9% in the year-ago quarter. Underlying claims experience for the voluntary line was stable in the quarter, with the increase in the benefit ratio being driven by the change in active life reserves, resulting from fewer policy terminations in the current quarter, compared to the year-ago quarter. Looking at Unum UK, operating income was \u00a323.5 million for the first quarter, an increase of 9.3% over the year-ago quarter of \u00a321.5 million. Premium income increased 6.1% over the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of NDP and growth in the group disability line.", "The benefit ratio was 67.9% for the first quarter, compared to 65.3% in the year-ago quarter. Higher claims incidence trends in the group life line of business and the impact of inflation linked benefit changes were partially offset by more favorable experience in group disability. Overall, profitability of the Unum UK segment remains quite favorable with an operating ROE of 17.7% for the first quarter, compared to 16.1% in the year-ago quarter. Colonial Life again generated strong consistent results with operating income of $77.4 million, compared to $77.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The slight decline in operating income was driven by lower net investment income reflecting lower miscellaneous investment income. The benefit ratio improved to 50.9% in the first quarter, compared to 51.3% for the year-ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experience in the Accident and Sickness and Critical Illness product lines.", "Margins remain strong for Colonial Life with an operating ROE of 17.7%, compared to 16.9% in the year-ago quarter. Finally, for the Closed Block operating income was $33.7 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $26.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher miscellaneous investment income, compared to a very low level of miscellaneous investment income in the year-ago quarter. The underlying benefits experience for the individual disability line was in line with our expectations. The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 84% in the first quarter, compared to 80% in the year-ago quarter, was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher level of bond calls and bond tenders we experienced during the first quarter of 2016.", "For the long term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 88.9% for the first quarter, compared to 87.3% for the year-ago quarter, resulting from a higher average submitted claim size. The underlying risk experience for long term care remains within our long term expected range of 85% to 90%. I'll move now to the growth trends we experienced across the Company in the quarter. Starting with Unum U.S., total sales declined by 4.5% for the first quarter compared to a year ago. This was not unexpected, as we had a very strong core market sales results a year ago first quarter and we continue to see the increased rates offset interest rate pressure. However, we also you saw increased competition in the quarter, particularly in the mid-market. ", "Looking at the sales results by product line, LTD sales were flat in the first quarter, while STD sales declined 32.5% compared to the year-ago quarter. LTD sales improved in the large-scale segment, due to strong sales to existing customers, offsetting lower sales in the core market segment. Group life and AD&D sales declined 4.9% for the quarter, as we continue to take disciplined pricing approach to this market. Our individual disability sales increased 35.8%, compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by strong growth to existing customers. Finally, in the voluntary benefits product line, total sales declined 4.5% against a very strong first quarter last year which included a $25 million single large-case sale. Core market sales for voluntary benefits performed very well in the quarter, increasing 16%.", "Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum U.S. calls for growth in the 2% to 4% range again and it's likely we'll see quarterly volatility as we did in 2015, particularly given the volatility on the timing of large-case sales. Persistency for Unum U.S. continues at very healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was stable at 88.8%. Voluntary persistency of 76.7% was favorable to prior-year results and individual disability persistency of 91.3% improved over the first quarter of last year. Given recent sales trends and strong persistency levels, along with the underlying management of our in-force renewals, we generated premium income growth of 5.8% for Unum U.S. this quarter. Sales in the UK were strong as well, increasing 16.4% in local currency, with favorable trends in core markets for both group long term disability and group life, along with the benefit of the NDP acquisition and an increase in other supplemental product sales. Persistency was favorable at 85.6%, due to improvements across the product lines. Given these trends, premium income growth for the UK this quarter was 6.1% in local currency.", "Finally, Colonial Life sales remain on an accelerating trend, increasing 16% for the first quarter. Growth this quarter was [indiscernible] and well-balanced between the commercial sector, both core market sales and large-case sales and the public sector. In addition, each product line shows positive year-over-year growth trends. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower across all product lines in the quarter, but it remains in line with our expectations. Premium growth continues to show good momentum, increasing 5.7% in the first quarter, compared to the year-ago quarter. ", "Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see across our business segments, as well as the profit margins we're maintaining. Looking now at investment results, new money yields were pressured in the first quarter by declining yields for both 10-year and 30-year treasury, despite this, we're again able to slightly exceed the new-money yield assumptions we have for our long term care portfolio just as we did throughout 2015. Given the recent volatility in oil prices, I'd like to give you an update on our energy holdings. As we told you last quarter, we believe our energy exposure is very manageable within our existing capital plans. The sharp increase in oil prices since we last talked has further strengthened our outlook for the portfolio. The portfolio ended the quarter in a net unrealized gain position of $18.9 million, compared to a net unrealized loss position of $51.4 million at year-end 2015. The size of the portfolio also shrunk modestly.", "During the first quarter, the rating agencies undertook a comprehensive review of energy credits. As a result of that review, along with other portfolio management actions, our below investment grade energy exposure increased by $66 million. The impact of all the rating changes to our RBC ratios for the traditional U.S. insurance companies was only 2 RBC points. It's worth noting that the impact of rating changes to RBC ratio is heavily impacted by a Company's ratio of C2 risk to C1 and C3 risk. Since we're more heavily weighted to C2 risk, the impact of these downgrades to our RBC ratio tends to be lower. Net-realized losses in the energy holdings from both gains and losses on sales, as well as other-than-temporary impairments, were $24 million pre-tax for the first quarter. These losses were partially offset by realized gains in the rest of the portfolio.", "We continue to review our energy holdings and examine those holdings through a number of stress scenarios. Current oil prices are higher than our baseline scenario and our experience in the first quarter was consistent and in some cases better than we expected. In summary, we continue to believe that the capital impacts of our energy holdings are very manageable and do not alter our financial or capital plans. Moving to capital management. It was an active and very productive quarter for us. Our share repurchases totaled $100 million, with most of that activity occurring while the stock was trading up in February, thereby enabling us to buy the shares at an average price of just over $27 per share.", "As a result, we retired 1.5% of our shares making a very productive use of our excess capital. In addition, as Rick highlighted, we announced the planned acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company which we believe will provide us with a platform to begin to develop a substantial national dental and vision business over time, benefiting the growth prospects for both Unum U.S. and Colonial Life. This transaction won't close until the third quarter and is being financed in such a way that we expect to remain well within our capital ranges while maintaining our share repurchase plans. Also on capital management, we typically see a reduction in our holding Company cash in the first quarter. This year we decided to maintain the dividends we take from our insurance companies in 2016 at approximately the same level as 2015, but we decided to adjust the quarterly pattern. Therefore, we took $179 million of dividends in the first quarter, about $35 million higher than the year-ago quarter.", "As a result, our holding Company liquidity position remained stable at $478 million, compared to $475 million at year-end 2015. In addition, we've extended our $400 million credit facility by a new five-year period to provide added flexibility. The higher statutory dividend, along with the growth in previously discussed downgrades, caused our risk-based capital ratio to slightly lower, at approximately 390%, compared to approximately 400% at year-end 2015. We continue to target our risk-based capital ratio in a range of 375% to 400% for the year and holding Company liquidity is at least one times our holding Company cash-coverage needs of just under $300 million this year. Statutory after-tax operating earnings were quite strong for the first quarter at $184 million, compared to $158 million in the year-ago quarter, a nice 16% increase. Wrapping up, our expectations for the growth in after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is unchanged from what we discussed when we reported the fourth quarter which is a growth rate within a range of 3% to 6%.", "Overall, it was a very good start to the year. We're pleased with the operating results and feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and our financial flexibility.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Rick.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Jack. Before we go to your questions, I would just reiterate how pleased we're with the first quarter performance, good premium growth, stable benefits experience, strong capital generation and in addition, we're finding good ways to put that capital to work, both through returning it to shareholders, as well as investing in future growth.", "So with that, we'll move now to your questions. I'll ask Don to begin the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray.", "John Nadel", "I guess the only real area of focus I've got in the numbers is that the last few quarters now, in the closed block, the long term care benefit ratio has been hovering in that 88% to 89% range. So, it's toward the upper end of your 85% to 90% expectation. Is there anything of worry there when you look, underlying that benefit ratio, in terms of some of the underlying trends there?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, John, I'll take that. We're not really seeing anything in underlying trends. There's some volatility in the results we see, but if you look at over the average, it's pretty close to being right in the middle of that range which is where we're comfortable. And we have seen it bounce around quarter to quarter.", "Rick McKenney", "I think, John, you highlighted the last three quarters. But if you went to the beginning of last year, we actually saw very favorable results. So it's like this block with [indiscernible], you've got to take a longer term view to it.", "John Nadel", "Just wanted to check that box. Then the only other question I've got is maybe, Mike, some commentary on what you're seeing in sort of the competitive environment. I mean, I know there are some impact on your sales, probably just from comparisons being tough from the year ago, but can you give us some color around sales and sales outlook.", "Mike Simonds", "I guess I would start by just saying we feel really good about the strengths of the product portfolio and expanding product portfolio. The distribution relationship's rock solid in the service proposition, so, I think that's just important context. As you highlighted, we do have a tough comparison in the first quarter. A year ago, sales were up in the high teens. But even given the tough comparison, if you sort of unpack the aggregate sales number here in first quarter of 2016, there's some pretty encouraging trends within our [indiscernible] and voluntary segment, we saw VB, as Jack highlighted, grow by 16% in the core and actually large case VB had really good momentum as well.", "We had a $25-million sale last year to an existing client. To give you a sense, this year our biggest VB sale was just a little under $4 million. So, broad-based, I think, traction and success with voluntary. And also in the segment, recently issued IDI sales were up 36% and that's been a really good story for us and fits with our strategy of selling multiple lines into existing clients. As you highlighted, the soft spot for us was new group insurance sales and we felt that most acutely in what we would call the midmarket which is sort of employers 250 to 2,000 lives. To give you a sense, proposal activity in that segment was actually up in the low double digits. So, good traction in terms of taking good looks at opportunities, but our ability to close that business was definitely constrained by an increasingly aggressive underwriting environment out there.", "We saw that materialize a bit in the second half of last year and it's definitely persisted here into the first quarter of 2016. We have seen this cycle many times. So, we're going to maintain our discipline. We'll certainly look to write business where we can do so profitably, but we're going to have to, I think, keep a real close eye on it. Group insurance, this is our smallest sales quarter of the year, so a lot of work to transpire between now and the end of the year, but the competitive market is one we're going to watch really closely on the new sales front.", "I guess the final thing I'd say is renewal placement activity, another place where you'd see competition, we were really pleased with the ability to place rate increase due to the interest rate environment and persistency hanging in just a tick below 90%, earned premium growth up about 6%, feel good in aggregate, but watching the new sales environment is going to be really important.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Suneet Kamath with UBS.", "Suneet Kamath", "Just given the current interest rate environment and how much things have changed since the end of the year, Jack, would you envision a discount rate adjustment as we get into the fourth quarter which is when I think you usually take a look?", "Jack McGarry", "Interest rates have gone down. Spreads have moved. It would be early to anticipate an interest rate, discount rate adjustment. Actually, our interest margin and LTD has held in very nicely over the past couple of quarters and so we will look at it at the end of the year. It's always a game-time decision. But there isn't anything startling about the impact of the first quarter that would drive us in one direction or the other.", "Rick McKenney", "Suneet, I think I'd just add to that, our margin, the one metric you could look at, there's a lot of things that go into our decisioning process actually got better. From 81 to 86 basis points. So, we actually saw a little bit of improvement in the first quarter.", "Suneet Kamath", "And then just shifting to the closed block IDI. In the December Investor Day you talked about some strategies maybe to try to get some capital out of that business. Is that really an interest rate driven kind of an event. In other words, in order to execute a strategy you'd need to see higher rates? Or is there -- I guess that's the question.", "Jack McGarry", "No, I would say that's more of a capital-driven event. The IDI closed block reserves get treated as disability reserves, from an RBC Capital perspective. Anyone who is over age 65 in that block and has a lifetime benefit is really an annuity, as opposed to a disability reserve. And so, our view is that given the stability of the risk there, it gets over-capitalized by the risk-based capital ratios. And so, it's trying to figure out if we can do something about that.", "Suneet Kamath", "Okay. So, any strategy that you pursue is not going to be reliant on the level of rates.", "Jack McGarry", "No.", "Suneet Kamath", "Okay. And then just the last one. In the past, you've given us sort of the quarterly view of long term care GAAP versus Stat reserves. Is that something that you could share with us again this quarter?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. So, the difference. It is creeping up. It's probably somewhere around 800 range this quarter.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar", "So, I realize it's only one quarter, but still results came in above the midpoint of guidance despite interest rates coming in as a significant headwind. Can you maybe highlight some of the things that went better than planned and also maybe remind us what the underlying interest rate assumption is for the guidance?", "Jack McGarry", "We actually don't take an underlying interest rate assumption. When we set our plans, we assume that the interest environment we're going to face in the future is consistent with the one we're currently in. That's what went into our 2016 plan. Some of the things that went well, we talked about expenses, were favorable. Our tax rate was not out of the ordinary, but was slightly favorable as well. We had good risk results across the board. So, there was pretty much no dip in the risk that some of the line needed to make up. From our perspective, it was just a quality quarter, throughout.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And then on the expense side, was the decrease in other expenses as a percentage of revenues, was that a function of just lower sales or was there also other expense management initiatives involved there?", "Jack McGarry", "No, clearly, we have a focus as a Company on being as efficient as we possibly can. That wasn't sales related. It was more related to just our ongoing pursuit of becoming more efficient as a Company.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "I had a couple of questions. First, just on group disability margins, obviously, they've improved steadily over the past few years. And improved again in the first quarter. So, to what extent do you think sub-81% level is a sustainable level in the group disability benefits ratio?", "Mike Simonds", "We did have a good risk quarter in group disability, actually, first quarter of last year was exceptionally good. I would say the group disability loss ratio is going to move 1 point or 2 around that 80% to 82% range. There's a little bit of seasonality as we go you through the summer months. I'd expect some of our paid incidents to pick up just a little bit if prior year proves out. Over time the improvement in the loss ratio that you're citing, a lot of that is us taking rate action in the book to account for interest rates.", "So, as our net investment income is falling, we're making up with that through price levels which shows up in our loss ratio. So, I would characterize it as a good, solid to slightly favorable risk quarter and within our targets, looking forward.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And any changes in your views on your long term care reserves if we stay at these types of interest rate levels, what's the likelihood for you looking at your GAAP reserves for long term care and then also is it fair to assume that you'd end up adding to stat reserves for the New York sub, if we're at rates close to these levels through the end of the year?", "Jack McGarry", "I don't think the levels we're at are dramatically different than the levels that we based our last calculation of the New York subs. So, I'm not feeling pressured around that. In terms of the long term care, we said pretty clearly that when we set that reserve, we assumed we'd be in a level interest rate environment for the next four to five years and then we'd gradually revert to a mean over time. We're in that level interest rate environment. Last year for the full year, as well as in the first quarter, we were able to put out new money at a level that was consistent with the reserve assumption that went in there. If it lasts forever, yes, there's going to be some impact. But right now we're pretty comfortable with where we're in the guidance we gave.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Lastly, on group life you saw an uptick in the benefits ratio there. Was that mortality? If you could give us more details on what you saw.", "Mike Simonds", "A little bit adverse, although we talk about that business being a 70% to 72% benefit ratio. We found ourselves just at the top end of that range. It was a little bit of incidence but average size or severity was more the culprit this quarter.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Kovak with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kovak", "Just one on capital here. Can you provide us an update, maybe in a little more detail, in terms of how you're thinking about sort of the uses of capital, understanding you didn't really change your share repurchase plans with the acquisition of Starmount, but theoretically some of these capital could have potentially been used for additional repurchases below book value. Can you just update us on your thoughts there?", "Jack McGarry", "I think our thoughts -- it's pretty consistent with what we've always stated about our uses of capital, that the first place we want to put it to work is in the growth of our businesses. And Starmount through an acquisition provided a great opportunity to do that. We're really excited about the platform that brings to the table and the growth prospects we'll have. We have a large improving distribution system in the dental market. We've had a partnership with united Concordia for some time now.", "And so, we're excited about what that brings to the table. So, when we look at that long term value versus a share repurchase, it felt like the right thing to do for us. Again, share repurchase, we understand is important. We'll continue to return capital to shareholders to the extent we have excess capital, but it's a notch below opportunities like Starmount.", "Michael Kovak", "And then shifting gears, on the long term care business can you give us a sense of any of the progress you've made on rate increases in terms of filings, the percentage of approvals and, potentially, price increases relative to the requests that you've made?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, we continue to make significant progress on rate increases. We had built assumptions about the approvals we would get into our reserve assumptions when we took the charge in 2014. Our experience has been very consistent or maybe slightly favorable to that. We think the market for rate increases is actually continues to improve. More and more the states that aren't allowing rate increases are becoming the outliers, as opposed to the states that are. So, we feel good about where we're, we feel good about our assumptions and we feel good about rate increase prospects going forward.", "Michael Kovak", "And on that, have you seen any shift in terms of whether you're able to get the percent that you're requesting today versus, potentially, I think you've talked about in the past, shifting the benefit, can you sort of give us any of the change in dynamic there?", "Jack McGarry", "In our last rate increase we filed what we called the lending spot, where our person had the choice of either accepting the rate increase or reducing their future inflation option from 5% to 3%. We've had very good success with that as a result of providing that option, I think it's far more likely that states will award us the entire rate increase that we asked for. Some states spread that out over a couple of years, over a three-year period, as opposed to all at once. And we've had very good uptake on that option. So, there's a lot of customers that are availing themselves of it. And that's favorable for us. We're kind of neutral from a financial perspective, but it does reduce the future liability when they take the option. And so, you do get a decrease in exposure as a result.", "Michael Kovak", "So, as that's implemented should we expect that to roll through the financials? Can you discuss how that would be impacting your loss ratio?", "Jack McGarry", "It's not going to impact GAAP results significantly, because it was already assumed in the reserve assumptions. To the extent -- due to rate increases that weren't assumed or we exceed those expectations, you'd see some of that in loss ratio. But I wouldn't anticipate a big change.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.", "Humphrey Lee", "Just a question on the organic growth in the quarter. Can you comment in terms of the wage growth or employment growth that you see in your premium numbers?", "Mike Simonds", "I'll take that one. We've talked about it over the last couple of years, moving from a little bit of a drag to a little bit of a lift. I think he's that's what we saw play out here. I would say while we've seen macroeconomic employment growth, a lot of that growth has come from part-time, nontraditional and contract workers, where that's not as big a part of our block, but we have started to see some of that wage come through. I would sort of be thinking of it in the 1% to slightly under that kind of lift. It varies a bit by product.", "Humphrey Lee", "Also there seems to be an elevation in unemployment rates in the oil patch states. Can you remind us your exposure to those states in general, so in addition to the oil -- to the energy sector, but to the broader employment markets in those states?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, sure thing. I think I got the question, Humphrey but tell me if I missed it. Our exposure we would watch most closely is our disability exposure. It's about 2% or a little under of our book. That's looking primarily in Texas and up in the Dakotas. We've actually been watching the incidence, even on that small sliver and we're doing pretty well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ryan Krueger with KBW.", "Ryan Krueger", "This is one of the best sales quarters you've had at Colonial in quite some time. I was hoping you could dig in a little bit and give us some more color on the underlying drivers.", "Tim Arnold", "I think there are a number of factors, Ryan. Certainly favorable market conditions for the voluntary product are helping us. We believe we have a strong strategy and plan for serving all size segments of the commercial and public sector markets. Colonial Life has a proven track record of working with brokers and serving employers on a direct basis as well. We have a complete and competitive suite of group and individual products, strong portfolio of value-added services for employers and employees. A heavily customer-focused employee culture here in Columbia and throughout the organization. We have national enrollment capabilities and a national footprint for enrollment which allow us to serve new and existing customers with face-to-face telephonic, web chat and Internet based self-serve options.", "Finally and perhaps most importantly, we have a growing focus and highly effective national sales team. So, very pleased with the first quarter results. I would tell you the year is young and so we'd guide people to the upper end of the range that we shared back in the investor meeting in December of around 8% for the year, probably.", "Ryan Krueger", "And then just a follow-up on the new money rate comment. Can you just give us a sense of what type of new money rates you're getting on the cash flows back in long term care at this point. I think you had talked about, I think you got around 5% maybe last year, but can you comment on what you're getting kind of today.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, 5% is the bogie that we have out there that was what was underlying the reserve assumption and we slightly exceeded it in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Eric Berg with RBC.", "Eric Berg", "My first question relates to Starmount and the dental insurance business, in general. It would be my sense that dental insurance is a fairly penetrated marketplace. It would be my sense that pretty much every major corporation in America offers it. Where is the opportunity? Is this, like group life, a takeaway business? I mean, I certainly understand the idea that your distribution is broader and probably deeper than the acquiries at Starmount, but is this a growing business?", "Mike Simonds", "I think your sense is right when you get into the large end of the market, generally, it is a fully penetrated dental and vision business. There is still a reasonable amount of GAAP in terms of coverage as you move down into the small end of the market. I would say one of the key trends I'd point to is the growth in voluntary dental business. Vision is very often voluntary. So, when you think about the opportunity for Unum and Colonial Life, it's about adding two important and employee high demand products into the portfolio and then leveraging client -- distribution client relationships and enrollment capabilities.", "So, when we can sit down and walk an employee all the way through a benefits package and really be able to tick off all of the non-retirement, non-major medical categories, I think we see a lot of upside opportunity there.", "Eric Berg", "One question for Jack and that will wrap up for me. With respect to the closed block as a follow-up to the earlier question, I think you said that the reserves are considered disability reserves. First question of two in this area, that wouldn't relate to long term care. In other words, your comment about, again, the closed block reserve is being treated for statutory purposes as disability reserves, I'm presuming you meant only -- you were speaking only about the disability business.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, I was talking about the old IDI block in terms of that. For long term care, most of the reserves in long term care are active life reserves. They're not disabled claim reserves.", "Eric Berg", "Right. And so just as a follow-up then and this will wrap up for me, just as a follow-up to this question. It's not interest rate related, it's more a matter of freeing up some of the capital associated with what you folks perceive to be reserve, excess of reserve redundancy, because of the age of the disabled individuals. Where are you in this process? We're four months after your Investor Day. Are you further along and are you optimistic about doing -- how would you characterize your sentiment about the probability of doing a transaction this year and where are you in the process? Thank you.", "Jack McGarry", "I would say, Eric, it's a work in progress. We continue to look at options. There's a lot of capital in the closed block between long term care and IDI and we're continuing to look at options on both sides of the equation. So, I think it's early on in the process.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. At this time, we'll go to our next question with Seth Weiss with Bank of America.", "Seth Weiss", "I want to ask about just net investment income again and I recognize it's a challenging interest rate environment. I suppose I was a little alarmed at the differential between your premium growth in the U.S. at about 6% and the decline in net investment income which was 3.5%, so it's almost a 10% differential there. Perhaps I'm thinking about it wrong, but could you discuss the falling net investment income maybe within that context and let us know if it was alarming to you as well, internally?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, Seth, it wasn't alarming to us. Couple of things drive it. One is, particularly in Unum U.S., the change in miscellaneous net investment income. We were kind of average overall, but a ton of it showed up in the closed block with less in places like Unum U.S. and Colonial, that's a piece of the driver.", "The other piece of the driver is because of the risk management efforts in Unum U.S., LTD reserves are actually going down and have been for a while. And so that's a big driver of net investment income, too. So, even though our margins are actually went up during the quarter, the asset base that we earned those margins on went down. So, it's not rate driven as much as it's some other factors.", "Seth Weiss", "And if you could just remind us on the pace of the decline in the reserves in LTD and where that's -- directionally, how that's moving over the next year or two.", "Jack McGarry", "You know, I mean, I don't have that offhand. We can get back to it, but it's been pretty steady, the quarterly reduction. We can get back with a number.", "Tim Arnold", "Seth, you can see the reserves in the statistical supplement. We have those broken out, so you can see that for group disability.", "Rick McKenney", "I think it's important, Seth, the point that Jack made which is our net income or net investment income is going to trend with those reserves, not with premiums. Those are the two things to keep in mind.", "Operator", "We'll go to our next question with Ken Billingsley of Compass Point.", "Ken Billingsley", "Just had one question. MetLife announced that they're exiting individual disability. Can you talk about that, any opportunities there? I don't know how large of a player they were versus what you were seeing, but is there any opportunity or any reasons why they're exiting that's something that maybe is impacting you guys?", "Mike Simonds", "So, we saw that move. I think you can almost think of it the same way that we think about individual disability. There's really two businesses. One is a single life direct to the individual business and you'd have to engage the team at MetLife. My sense is that's the business that they're taking a step back from. There remains an employee benefit, multi-life individual product, that's what's sold at the work site to typically mid to high earners. That's the business we characterize as recently issued.", "It has been a market that's sort of been a slow-growth market that ticked up a bit and it's been a really good story for us here at Unum. I mentioned sales were up about 36% in the first quarter, most of that coming off block growth opportunities. Often, it's cross-sold with our group insurance and voluntary lines and we've got it to a place now where the top line is growing about 5%. It's a good market for us. I don't think that particular move that you mentioned with Met is going to have a big impact for us, but it remains a market that we're pretty excited about.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question and answer session. At this time, I'll return the call to Tom White for any concluding remarks.", "Rick McKenney", "Actually this is Rick. I'll take it. Thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. We're actually over the next couple months going to see many of you at various investor conferences and meetings and we look forward to taking you through some more detail and our progress as we move forward.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President and Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tom White", "Great. Thank you, Gwen. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2016 earnings conference call for Unum.", "Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year, ended December 31, 2015 and our subsequently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.", "Our SEC filings can be found in the Investor section of our website.

This is an increase of 11% over last year. Together with our strong quarter results, operating income per share grew 9% in the first half.", "Our operating trends have been very strong across the company with solid levels of premium growth in Unum U.S., Unum U.K. and Colonial Life, coupled with stable benefits experienced and favorable expense management trends.", "I am particularly pleased that we're achieving these strong results despite what has been a difficult business environment with historically low interest rates. The reason that we can deliver these consistent to an improving results is because we've a sound strategy and business plan in place. It is one that resonates well with our customers and the employee benefits marketplace, both in our existing group solutions as well as the growing voluntary space and it's our execution of the strategy that is generating these strong financial outcomes.", "I'll discuss this in more detail in a moment, but first I want to provide a few highlights on the second quarter. First, the premium growth we're generating in our core operations remains very healthy at approximately 5% in each of our business lines.", "For the second quarter, premium income growth in Unum U.S. is driven by strong persistency trends and our sales trends over the surpassed several quarters. Total sales increased slightly in the second quarter with very strong performance in the voluntary and supplemental lines offsetting a small decline in our employee benefit lines where markets remain competitive.", "Unum U.K. premium growth benefitted from the National Dental Plan acquisition from last year as well as growth in the group income transaction line and finally premium growth at Colonial Life was driven by the excellent sales trends we've seen over the past few years, which continued again this quarter with growth in new sales of 13% bringing first half sales growth to just under 15%.", "Next I am very pleased that we've maintained strong profit margins in our core business segments while building this positive momentum in premium growth over the past several quarters. This shows the discipline we're bringing to our markets in how we price, underwrite and mange customer relationships in order to maintain a balance between producing top line growth and maintaining industry leading profit margins.", "These strong operating results drive a very strong level of statutory earnings and capital, which provides substantial financial flexibility. Our first half statutory operating earnings have been outstanding, increasing 29% year-over-year to $400 million or just over.", "This enables us to continually generate free cash flow of which we've been used -- which we've used to create shareholder value through steady consistent share repurchases and annual dividend increases.", "At the same time, we're able to capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities such as National Dental Plan in the U.K. and Starmount Life Insurance Company, which is also in the dental market and we're able to capitalize on when they're available.", "So in summary, it's been a very strong first half of 2016 for the company. This performance is the result of our steadfast focus on disciplined execution of our business plan. This is reflected in many facets of our business starting with our customers and includes how we're underwriting price business, how we manage claims to help people return to work, how we administer and enroll business and how we manage customer relationships.", "Operationally we also continue to focus on disciplined expense management, which is evident in the favorable expense we've delivered in many of our business segments, which is also net of the investment we're making in our businesses through such things as customer facing technologies.", "When you combine this disciplined execution with our market positioning and growing footprint, we see a continuation of good profitable growth.", "And finally I can't say enough about our people who are responsible for this performance day in and day out. We're committed to developing our talent, building our bench strength and ensuring our people continue to drive the change necessary to remain the leader in the employee benefits marketplace.", "So with those highlights and an excellent second quarter, I'll let Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "Thank you, Rick and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high level overview of our second quarter results and now we want to provide a more in-depth view of the trends we saw in the quarter.", "First I want to highlight the composition of our tax operating income per share growth of 11.2%, which was well balanced between after-tax operating income growth and capital management.", "Operating income grew 5.9% over the year-ago quarter. This quarter was one of the strongest and best balanced quarters we've seen. In addition, the benefit from our share repurchase activity reduced our average shares outstanding by 4.8% compared to the year ago share count.", "A key driver of our success this quarter was the performance of the Unum U.S. Second quarter operating income was very strong at $227.2 million, an increase of 12% from the year ago quarter.", "Premium income growth continued its positive trend increasing 5.1% over the year ago quarter, the benefit ratio for Unum U.S. segment improved to 69.1% of second quarter compared to 71.2% in the year ago quarter. In addition our focus on disciplined expense management was also contributed to operating results, with the other expense ratio declining to 20.9% in the quarter, compared to 21.9% in the year ago quarter.", "The profitability of our Unum U.S. segment remained very strong with an operating ROE of 15.1% for the second quarter of 2016. Within the Unum U.S. segment, operating income in our Group disability business was $74.4 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 21.6% over last year.", "Premium income increased 5% over the year-ago quarter, but pressure on net investment income continues driven primarily by lower portfolio yields. The benefit ratio was quite positive at 80.0% for the second quarter, compared to 83.4% in the year ago quarter as we continue to see lower new claims of incidents and favorable claim recovery trends in our Group long-term disability line along with shorter claim duration periods in our Group short-term disability line.", "Group Life and AD&D operating income improved to $56.9 million for the second quarter an increase of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income grew 3.9% over the year-ago quarter with the benefit ratio improved to 71.5% for the second quarter, compared to 73.1% in the year-ago quarter, aided by favorable Group Life waiver of Premium benefits.", "Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was also very strong at $95.9 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 7.6%, over the year-ago quarter.", "Premium income growth trends remain favorable, increasing 6.7% in the quarter, compared to last year. From a benefits perspective, overall results remain in line with our expectations, with favorable trends in the voluntary benefits line offset by mildly elevated benefit ratios in the individual disability line.", "Looking at Unum U.K., operating income was \u00a325.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2.8% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 5.7% over the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of NDP and its growth of the Group Disability line.", "The benefit ratio was 70.1% for the second quarter, a slight improvement relative to the 70.7% in the year-ago quarter as favorable risk experience in the disability line offset some unfavorable experience in the lifeline. Overall profitability of the Unum U.K. segment remains quite strong, with an operating ROE of 20.9% for the second quarter.", "It\u2019s too early to tell what the long-term impact that Brexit will have on our Unum U.K. operations. The lower exchange rate will impact our results deeply in third quarter. We do not expect to see much if any impact to our risk result. However, if implement trends and wage inflation slow down in U.K. and interest rates remain under pressure, we could see some negative impact to our premium growth and investment income trends.", "We believe that the fundamental need for protection of profit in the U.K. has not changed as a result of the Brexit vote but we'll be monitoring very closely for any impacts on our market over the next several quarters.", "Colonial Life continue to generate strong, steady results with operating income of $77.9 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $77.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 4.6% and the benefit ratio was 51.1% for the second quarter compared to 50.4% for the year ago quarter due primarily to less favorable mortality experienced in the life product line. Colonial Life continues to generate extra margins with an operating ROE of 17.4% for the quarter.", "In the second quarter we completed our GAAP reviews both for Unum U.S. and Colonial Life businesses with minimal impacts on second quarter results.", "Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $32.6 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to the exceptionally strong $36.6 million reported in the year ago quarter. In the individual disability line we saw very favorable underlying experience.", "The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 84.3% in the second quarter from 83.6% in the year-ago quarter includes a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the high level of bond calls and bond tenders during the second quarter of 2016.", "Excluding this reduction in the discount rate, the interest adjusted loss ratio would have been slightly below 80%, one of our most favorable results in years.", "For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 92.6% for the second quarter compared to the unusually favorable 83.4% in the year-ago quarter. This swing in results demonstrates the volatility that this block to subject to on a quarterly basis and the importance of taking a longer-term view of the performance, which shows an interest adjusted loss ratios since our 4Q 2014 reserve review of 88.6%.", "The result in long-term in this quarter were driven by an increase in new claim incidents and severity brought on in part we believe by the rate increase notifications that we delivered to policy holders recently.", "We expect that this is likely to continue in the near-term and is consistent with the claim activity behavior we've experienced in the past following rate increase notifications to policy holders. As before, we expect these higher claim levels to remediate once we're through the rate increase notifications.", "I am pleased that we continue to make good progress on achieving rate increases in our enforced long-term care business. In addition to making good progress with state regulators, we're also seeing strong pickup of the lending spot offset. The lending spot has the same positive impact on reserves as rate increases, but also has the added benefit of de-risking the portfolio.", "Since future claims will be smaller under the lending spot, the reserves will be somewhat less sensitive to future changes and reserve assumptions.", "I\u2019ll move now to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with Unum U.S. total sales increased 1.4% for the second quarter compared to a year ago. We continue to see competitive market comparisons particularly in the core market segment where we continue to increase our rates to offset interest rate pressures.", "In total for LTD, STD and Group Life we saw an overall decline in sales of 3.4% with core market sales down 9.9% while large-case sales increased 12.8% reflecting continued success in our ongoing efforts to increase penetration within existing customers.", "The momentum in our supplemental and voluntary segments remained very encouraging. Our individual disability sales increased 12.3% compared to a year-ago quarter, driven by strong growth to existing customers. In the voluntary benefits front line, total sales increased 14% with a good balance between core market and large-case sales.", "Persistency for Unum U.S. is at very healthy levels, but the employee benefits lines combined, persistency was 89.6%. This is important to us as we look to move price increases into our imports block to offset the impact of low interest rates and reduce discount rate assumptions that are implemented in recent years.", "Our sales force does an excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our in-force business, which is essential to our ability to grow while protecting the strong profit margins that we have in our employee benefits block. Likewise voluntary benefits persistency of 76.7% was favorable to the prior year results as was in individual disability persistency at 91.3%.", "Sales in the Unum U.K. continue to rebound, increasing 19.4% in local currency with favorable turns in the core market for Group long-term disability and Group Life overall along with the benefit of the NDP acquisition. Persistency was favorable at 85.5% helping to drive Premium income growth of 5.7% this quarter.", "Finally, sales trends at Colonial Life remain very strong increasing 13.3% for the second quarter and 14.5% for the first half of the year. Growth continues to be well balanced between the commercial market sector and the public sector and between sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts.", "Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower across all product lines in the quarter, but remains in line with our expectations. As a result, Premium growth is showing steady momentum increasing 4.6% in the second quarter, compared to the year ago quarter.", "Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends that we see across our core business segments and as Rick highlighted earlier, the profit margin that we've been able to sustain.", "Looking now at investment results, new money yields remain under pressure in the second quarter. However, I'm pleased that we were able again to exceed the new money yield assumption we have for our long-term care portfolio.", "We have exceeded our target of investing cash flows at 5% rate, but every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review. We remain well positioned with our Unum U.S. long-term disability business from an interest rate perspective as our interest reserve margin remains very healthy.", "This is a great benefit to us as we navigate the dip in interest rates that resulted from the Brexit referendum. It\u2019s too early to make a decision today on any future changes to the LTD discount rate, but new claim incurs, but we remain satisfied that with our margin at this time in a well custom improvement ability to deliver the offsetting rate increases into the market should an adjustment be needed.", "The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight the further rebounded in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to $433 million at the end of the second quarter compared to a gain of $19 million a quarter ago.", "It's impressive that the gross unrealized loss on energy holdings has declined to $89.5 million at the end of the second quarter, compared to $297.4 million at the end of the first quarter.", "Energy holdings in a loss position we're trading at over 90% of book value at the end of the second quarter. I believe this validates the investment decisions in credit evaluation process we've followed for the past several years, not just for our energy holdings, but for our management of the overall investment portfolio.", "Moving to capital management, it was another active quarters as we repurchased 100 million of our shares, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately $600 million as of quarter end, roughly twice the level we target for holding company cash coverage needs for one year.", "This cash position is net of the $350 million we're holding for the debt maturity on September 30. Subsidiary contributions in the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company. As a reminder, we issued $600 million in senior debt back in early May in part to refinance this maturing debt.", "Our risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance company remained at approximately 319% well within our target range of 375% to 400% for this year. Statutory after-tax operating earnings were outstanding.", "We had $228.4 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to a $161.2 million in the year ago quarter an increase of 42%. This one of the best statutory quarters on record reflecting the favorable risk experienced across our primary business lines. ", "For the first half of 2016, statutory after-tax operating earnings totaled $412.5 million, an increase of 29% over last year. Our outlook for growth and after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is unchanged with an expected growth rate of 3% to 6%.", "We now expect to be at the higher end of that range as our first half after-tax operating earnings per share growth has been a very healthy 9%. While we're not building that rate of growth into our expectations for the second half of the year, we remain very encouraged by our first half trends.", "So to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with our first half results. In fact I would say they\u2019ve been remarkable given the environment. We've executed very well in many parts of our strategy including delivering rate increases and exceeding new money yield targets for long-term care generating strong persistency and growth in our core business segments and maintaining pricing discipline and delivering on renewals to help achieve strong profit margins.", "Given this progress we enter the second half of the year highly confident in our ability to continue to create value in this difficult environment.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Rick.", "Rick McKenney", "Great, thank you Jack. As we go to your questions, I'll conclude by reiterating how pleased we are with the second quarter and first half results. We continue to see good premier growth, stable benefits experience, the benefit of disciplined expense management and strong capital generation. I'm very encouraged by these trends as I believe they will continue to serve us well.", "We\u2019ll now move your questions. So I\u2019ll ask Gwen to begin the Q&A session. Gwen?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Ryan Krueger with KBW Investments.", "Ryan Krueger", "Hey, thanks good morning. First question was the uptick in long-term care claims that you mentioned you expected to continue while you\u2019re implementing the rate increases, is that something that you anticipated and modeled into your reserve assumption?", "Rick McKenney", "Great, Ryan let me turn that first question over to Jack.", "Jack McGarry", "Yeah, we didn\u2019t model it into the reserve assumptions because it's such a small blip, it's only going to go on for a few quarters. So within the spectrum of $7 billion to $8 billion of reserves it wasn\u2019t worth putting in them.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay. But you view it as more -- you view it as something that\u2019s kind of a one-off not changing\u2026", "Jack McGarry", "I think Ryan, I think it's incorporated and whether we specifically model the blip over the timeframe of LTC is probably too refined, but I think in terms of\u2026", "Rick McKenney", "Immaterial relative to the\u2026", "Jack McGarry", "In the context of the broad out I would say, it's inclusive.", "Rick McKenney", "I would tell you though that we anticipated this and implementing the rate increases, it happened back in 2012 after the 2011, 2012 rate increase and these rate increases are actually larger and more targeted than those were.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay, thanks and then on group visibility the benefit ratio has kind of been in the 80%, low 80% range for the first half of the year, is that a level you think is sustainable going forward.", "Rick McKenney", "Ryan, we have great group disability results Jack and then may be Mike can comment on some of the\u2026", "Mike Simonds", "Yeah, we're very encouraged by the trend. We\u2019re not necessarily declaring victory right now. We\u2019re continuing to actively manage that block with rate increases and price increases on new business, but again it's been happening for a couple of quarters now. We\u2019re very encouraged by it and the fact of matter is there is actions that we've taken over the past year and half that would support that trend.", "Ryan Krueger", "Thanks and then just one quick clarification, I think Jack you mentioned that the subsidiary contribution, is that material or what is that related to?", "Rick McKenney", "I would say relative to our capital position, it's not terribly material, it's kind of the balancing of risk-based capital across our subs.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Ryan.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Suneet Kamath with UBS.", "Suneet Kamath", "Thanks and good morning. So just wanted to start with long-term care also, so as you mentioned since the charge you\u2019ve beaten your bogie of 5% every quarter, your average loan loss ratio is 88.6% that\u2019s right in the range of what you assumed and you're not seeing the benefit of the rate increases yet although I think you expressed some confidence there.", "So if I take all those things together, wouldn\u2019t that push out any kind of charge that you might have to take towards the latter end of that typical three to five year timeframe that you\u2019ve used in the past.", "Jack McGarry", "We\u2019re very encouraged by where our investments have been over the last six quarters. I\u2019ve talked about we\u2019ve exceed the 5%. We\u2019ve exceed it by a healthy margin. It certainly gives us latitude in terms of when we may face the charge. The thing we haven\u2019t seen is the reversing to the norm as yet. So we're still hoping on for that, but I think it gives us some flexibility.", "Suneet Kamath", "What does that mean reversion to the norm and what?", "Jack McGarry", "Well, we never -- when we set the charge we anticipated a 5% flat interest rate environment for four to five years and then reverse to the long term average over the next five.", "Suneet Kamath", "Okay, but we're still in that first\u2026", "Jack McGarry", "We\u2019re still in that five-year period and so we still feel -- we feel very good about where we are and we do believe that the investment results we\u2019ve managed to achieve to date do provide us some added cushion.", "Suneet Kamath", "Okay. And this may be a tough one of Rick, but just it seems like no matter how good your core results are, the focus is always on the long-term care business and I guess I\u2019m just wondering does it make sense for this company to be part of a larger organization where you just don\u2019t get that volatility from this business that is a non-core business but it's still sizable portion of your capital base.", "Rick McKenney", "It's a fair question Suneet and I think that when we look at the company overall, we focus very much on our core operations to make sure that we just run great companies in terms of the ongoing and I think you see the quarter-in, quarter-out you\u2019ve certainly seen it over the last several years and we're going to continue to focus on that.", "On the Closed Block and more particularly on long term care, it is a frustration to answer a lot of these questions. We think we do it very well. We're taking all the actions that we need to with regards to price increases, thinking about capital solution everything else.", "And so I think we're executing where we want to on that block, but it certainly does garner it's fair share of question and although a frustration, we're going to be keep working the same we've been working.", "To get to you broader question about the volatility and how that wheeze into our position as a company overall, I think we've been clear over time that if you want to look at what's in the best interest of our shareholders, as well as all of our other constituencies.", "And when we think about running our standalone company that's how we think about it because we have the wherewithal the capital and the opportunity to do so. So that's where we focus first.", "But as we think about other opportunities if they came at us, we certainly would do our -- do the right thing from a governance perspective and entertain those, but we're still very focused on running those core operations through the best business they can and take all the actions necessary with regards to our Closed Block.", "Suneet Kamath", "Got it. I appreciate that, Rick. And then just lastly for Jack. Any update on the Closed Block IDI. I know we talked about this last December in terms of some sort of capital relief solution, just wondering six months after if there is any developments there?", "Jack McGarry", "Nothing specifically, we continue to work on it. It's our complicated thing given that we already have securitization behind the block, but it's something we continue to actively pursue.", "Suneet Kamath", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner", "Hey, good morning. Thanks. Just a couple on the yield, you've been able to earn against the long-term care. You mentioned it was over 5%. I was wondering if you could specify exactly what it was in the quarter?", "And you mentioned you were very encouraged by the yield and so that would be more bullish in the commentary we're getting from a lot of companies on yield. So I'd be curious what kind of assets you're buying that are able to give you good confidence around the risk adjusted yield there?", "Rick McKenney", "So, you got to remember in the long-term care business we're long-duration buyer. So our sweet spot is in the 30 year, the 30 year you can still have a reasonably steep yield curve. There is a -- there has been a 70-day basis point pick up in the 30 year.", "There is also a credit curve and so credit spreads at the 30 year are significantly higher than credit spread at the 10-year, the Barclays Index over the past six quarters for BBB 30-year issuance has been it's well above 5%.", "Historically, we also use some other risk classes -- asset classes whether it's private placements or other things to help boost that yield. So largely it's the fact that the longer end of the curve has maintained decent margins.", "Randy Binner", "Just a couple of follow-ups, so what was it specifically in the quarter, just so we can track better the new money rate?", "Rick McKenney", "We don\u2019t do that for both our new money rates\u2026", "Randy Binner", "Okay. But it was well over 5% and then are the other asset classes the alternatives you're looking at there, do they have a similar 30-year maturity, or do they -- would they be higher yield but shorter maturity than you have with a 30-year?", "Rick McKenney", "Just about the curve, I think one thing Randy, I think you're isolating a small piece of investment, although very important to us and something we're focused on. You have to look at the overall construct of our portfolio as well and I think you won't see major shift in our investment philosophy and how we run the portfolio, how we think about credits, how we incorporative private placements and other non-liquid assets in that mix.", "And when we take all those things together, I think as Jack said we feel very good about how we've done it over the last 18 months. Even in the quarter, we invested a little bit early as our investment team does when they see the good yields out there they capture them.", "And so all those things come into play and we are not going to get into dissecting every investment we put behind a particular line of business particularly not in any particular quarter.", "So I think those comments are good. The interest rate environment is challenging. We mentioned that, but our team continues to outperform and we'll keep you up to date every quarter on how we did.", "Randy Binner", "All right. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Humphrey Lee with Dowling and Partners.", "Humphrey Lee", "Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Jack, in your prepared remark you talk about the competitive landscape for the traditional line seems to be picking up a little bit. Can you go into a little detail in terms of what you're seeing in the traditional lines and then also can you comment on the voluntary business as well that would be helpful?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, Humphrey, I'll actually look for Mike to respond to that.", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks and good morning, Humphrey. So you've heard us start talking about the new client acquisition pricing market in the group lines probably about three quarters ago, we started to see it -- get a little bit more aggressive and certainly we've seen this cycle many times before. We're not going to chase market share using price as a lever and so we have seen some pressure on new clienteles.", "We can't really control the competitive pricing environment. So we stay very focused on what we can control, which is first and foremost take care of our clients and Rick and Jack mentioned it before but persistency is over 90%, sales into these relationships were actually up 10% in the quarter and helped to drive an overall increase in sales and you put that together with persistency and you got really nice earned premium growth.", "A big part of what we're bringing into those client relationships as you highlighted is the voluntary line of business, 14% growth in the quarter really over the last several years, it's been a consistent growth story for voluntary as more and more the employee the decision maker. We see that in the Unum branded business. We also see that in the really strong results coming out of Colonial line.", "Humphrey Lee", "And you mentioned in terms of the aggressive pricing, is it a factor of you guys raising prices for the interest rate or people actually lowering to get share?", "Jack McGarry", "Yeah, Humphrey, I'll give you the wholly owned satisfactory answer of little bit of both. So we have put low-to-mid single digit increases particularly on the long-term disability, but on the other group line as well into our new business pricing every six months or so over the last two years and that\u2019s been gradual in our sales and client management teams have done a great job in taking that into the market.", "We would certainly anticipate given rates that if the competitive environment would need to follow the suite, we haven\u2019t seen that happen. In fact we've seen a few carriers come back a bit more aggressively into the market and try to recapture some share they\u2019ve lost over the last few years and the combination of the two I think is what's putting some pressure on new clientele. But again the aggregate when you put it together is actually consistent top-line growth, which we're pleased about.", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay. Got it. And another question on long term care, Florida recently announced they're going to do another public hearing for long-term care increase, it seems to be following Pennsylvania's footstep, do you expect more these kind of hearings from regulators that they try to strike a balance between protecting consumers and keeping the LTC business viable? And how does these kind of hearing affect some of your rate increased position going forward?", "Jack McGarry", "In general, these hearing have been positive. Our rate increases I know Pennsylvania held the hearing they approved the rate increase shortly thereafter. There was a successful hearing in Massachusetts. Maine actually held a hearing, it was one of the first.", "So we're happy to attend those hearing. We're really engaged in them. We have a very good story about where our block is, the reason we're chasing that we're pursuing rate increases that just application for them.", "I think the fact that we're not trying to restore original pricing profitability into the block that we're pursuing a sustainability strategy resonates well in the lending spot option that gives people an option to maintain their kind of premium level while continuing to maintain extremely valuable benefits resonates well. So we're encouraged by the hearings and we think it's a catalyst for action.", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay. Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Humphrey.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Seth Weiss with Bank of America.", "Seth Weiss", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jack, I wanted to follow-up on the commentary on the LTD discount rate. You mentioned in your prepared remarks you remain satisfied with the margin at this time, can you just remind us where that is at this point?", "Jack McGarry", "We haven\u2019t typically disclosed that margin, but it's in the upper brand of that 60% to 90% range.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay. Great. And you mentioned it's too early to make a decision, typically when do you think about making those decisions? Is it kind of going into at December outlook call, is that when we should think about perhaps an update on that?", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, we do our reserve review. We got in the third quarter and it culminates in the fourth quarter. So that would be difficult. And maybe actually Seth it's helpful to set back to, so this experience, actually Mike maybe you want to talk a little bit about how the block is performing overall inclusive of anything we may look at on that front.", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, thanks Rick. I appreciate. Thanks for the question. So I think we look at the discount rate on new claims incurred for LTD, but we look at it in the context of the overall health of the business. As well we continue to see good, strong and favorable paid incidence trends both in terms of count and severity.", "Very importantly the recovery experience our benefits team they are clinical in both resources. We continue to invest there and to good effect. So recovery trends have been very good as well. So there is no crystal ball it is a risk taking business, but as we look forward, we feel very, very good about those fundamental and that even if we weren\u2019t need to make an adjustment on that new claim incurred discount rate that it wouldn\u2019t have a material impact on the earning trajectory for that group disability business.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay. So I just want to make sure I am interpreting that correctly. Is that similar to saying that as underlying experience underwriting is improving, you're willing to maybe move little bit lower in that range to be part of that range in terms of the margin and the discount rate.", "Jack McGarry", "I think that we've been continuing to place rate increases. We had favorable underwriting results. I think more of what we're saying is if you look at the trend we entered the year on the experience that\u2019s emerged underlying that block would keep us on that same trend even after taking discount rates are.", "Seth Weiss", "I see. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.", "Tom Gallagher", "Hey. Good morning. Wanted to start it off just on the long term care claims side. So the higher claims that you're seeing following the rate increases, I guess you\u2019ve seen that before. So the expectation here is that you expect it to be a temporary blip.", "My question related to it is aren\u2019t you coming back though and you\u2019ve been coming back at least every couple years on these rate increase filings and so should we except if that\u2019s in fact the cause of effect here on higher claims when you file for rate increases. Shouldn\u2019t we think about that as more of a recurring issue if you keep coming back for future rate increases?", "Jack McGarry", "First of all, I don\u2019t think internal rate increases is forever, we've kept on coming back because the interest rate environment has deteriorated. You get more recent experience of not only within Unum, but industry tables and things.", "This isn\u2019t always get worse forever thing. I expect we will get very close in the current filing to being where we need to be to support the sustainability of the business. There may be some rate increase filings in the future. Those would be predicated on changes in our view of what the future of long term care will be.", "So I don\u2019t see rate increases being forever in our future thing. You do get a mild blip on rate increases when you do them and that\u2019s what we're seeing now, but we believe it's temporary.", "We actually think, we're much more confident in where we are in long term care in our ability to manage through not only the short term with our current reserve position, but manage through long term current general and I think others are.", "Tom Gallagher", "And Jack just related to that, are you then in terms of the level, I don\u2019t know, may be just a broad question, the level of rate that you're asking for, you\u2019re actually getting around what you're requesting, it sounds like you're based on that the way you responded to it because I guess what I've heard from some others is that they might request 50% and they might get half of that, but then its spread out over three years, is that, is my example still more the situation for you or you're getting much closer to what you\u2019re requesting in terms of rate increases?", "Jack McGarry", "We\u2019re getting what we expect to get which is less than we request, but we didn\u2019t put what we requested into our reserve assumptions. We put our expectation, so in some states you'll get 50%, in some states it will be spread out over three years. In the scheme things that\u2019s not terribly material, if its spread out over three years given the 40 years the rest of its going to run.", "So, it depends by states and many states have approved the full rate increase. Other states have approved the full rate increase but required it to be implemented over three years, but we have good data on how different states react and we\u2019ve built that data into what we are assuming in our reserve assumptions.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful and then as you think about -- can you just remind us your process for this year all timing, is the actuarial review for long term care is that conducted in 3Q and do you -- as part of your process, do you factor forward interest rates, do you look at the forward curve or you look at trailing because obviously forward rates matter a lot more than what you\u2019ve accomplished over the last six quarter?", "And based on I guess the claims you\u2019ve gotten to date, how much does that factor in or is that less impactful? Is it really more of an interest rate issue at this point?", "Rick McKenney", "We do our reserve reviews in not only on long term care, but across the Board all of our reserve reviews in the company. We start those in the third quarter. They culminate -- they come to conclusion in the fourth quarter, so we're confident in our yearend results. That would be the same timing for long-term care.", "In terms of what we look at going forward for the assumption on long term care. We told you exactly what it was. First time it was 5% for four to five years and a reversion to the long term mean thereafter we will come up with -- should we -- when we test, we'll come up with a reasonable assumption that we believe in and that its audited by external auditors. It\u2019s not necessarily the forward curve, but it\u2019s a reasonable assumption.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. And then just my final question is I guess one of the things that surprised me a little bit was the increase in financial leverage. So pro forma the debt pay down that you expect in 3Q you're going to be at a 27% debt-to-cap.", "And I guess what surprises me a little bit is, there hadn\u2019t really been much in the way the extraordinary views need, so you\u2019ve done a few small acquisitions but nothing too big.", "So, why has the average gone up certainly and it also stands out when you just had a great statutory earnings quarter where the cash generation looked pretty good, but why the increased financial leverage? Is there a need for cash more or what\u2019s happening?", "Jack McGarry", "No, first of all we feel very comfortable with where we are. At 27% there is -- it\u2019s a comfortable place. We have great coverage ratios. So we don\u2019t view 27% as being problematic. With that said we did prefund the debt maturity in September when we purchase -- when we announced the Starmount acquisition, we talked about funding a portion of that and debt.", "And just when we looked at our capital plans and where our leverage would end up it made sense, it made sense that to make that a little bit bigger debt issuance given the rates at the time and where things were and given what we thought our equity growth would be through 2017. So we're very comfortable where we are. We expect it to come down over the ensuing few quarters, but there's nothing remarkable about it.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. So no issues with the rating agencies with the\u2026", "Jack McGarry", "Whatsoever.", "Tom Gallagher", "The higher level. And then sorry, last question if I could sneak it in, do you guys expect to contribute to the long term care cap to bit off this year in terms of fair wind or the New York sub as well. And if so, what size should we expect in terms of capital contributions?", "Jack McGarry", "Yeah, we would expect to contribute to the New York sub. Our guidance on that has always been look at the levels that we've historically contributed as guidance. We will keep the sub well capitalized, that's our commitment. We'll see how much capital that requires when we get to yearend. ", "Tom Gallagher", "And how about the captive?", "Jack McGarry", "I just talked about the captive.", "Tom Gallagher", "Oh! You just that that's the TBD?", "Jack McGarry", "Yeah, we'll see whatever it requires at yearend.", "Rick McKenney", "Well, I think the key things Tom is our capital plans remain very much intact and so how things move around between new parenthesis is a move point. We feel very good about our capital plans, where they are, how we\u2019ve talked about them going all the way back to last year and we'll see -- you'll see as execute on those?", "Jack McGarry", "And all of those have built into our expectations in the underlying free cash flow generation has actually exceeded our expectations.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Rick McKenney", "All right, thanks Tom.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Michael Kovak with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kovak", "Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Could you help us think about maybe some of the potential knock-on effects in the U.K. from the Brexit? I know you mentioned clearly NFX headwind and potentially some premium and net investment income, but as your team works through the last month in terms of what you're seeing from future sales and also thinking about as well potential impact on the benefit ratio visibility line in particular if the U.K. does enter some recession, thing that within the context of other GDP slowdowns that you\u2019ve seen either in the U.S. block or in the U.K. historically?", "Rick McKenney", "Okay Michael, it sounds like a full analysis of our U.K. business, I'd step back one thing and make sure that investors, analysts remembers it's just about 10% of our company. We\u2019ve very much like our U.K. business. It's a fantastic business, but relative to the enterprise it is 10%. And with that maybe I'll turn it over to Peter to just give a quick overview of Brexit and how it\u2019s impacting us.", "Peter O'Donnell", "Thanks Rick, and thanks Michael for the question. So just to take you back, we decided to vote for exit late June and the immediate impact was quite volatile. So we saw equities drop both for the 250.", "They\u2019ve pretty much come back now to where they were pre-Brexit. We did see the risk free rate drop as well that hasn't come back yet. And obviously the thing you're seeing in our results is the exchange rate dropping to around about $1.32.", "I think one of the things that if it stays there you will see continued pressure because our average exchange rates we're using at the moment in the $1.40, so that would come down if it's sticks at $1.32.", "What I would say it's an uncertain environment and it's new for remainders, leavers to now we're waiters to see what's going to happen to the economy. Looking to the U.K. if you take our investment portfolio, Jack talked about this already, we're very well positioned to finance the stocks and feel very good about the investment portfolio and the robustness of that.", "And if you take revenues, we've got exposure to keep some of the keep financial services friends. In talking to them though, very few have definitive plans about what they're going to do yet. Again they're more cautious I would say and we saw a bit of that come through our premiums in the first half and so therefore they're not investing in recruiting people perhaps to having more of an eye for cost control on their benefits plans, but nothing material I would say yet coming through that would affect us.", "To answer your question on benefits, actually in the last recession we didn\u2019t see a lot of impact on our benefit ratio. We saw something called presentism, people worried about their jobs and actually not going off. So that was a bit of a counter cyclical aspect for us.", "This all brings very robust. So we're pretty happy that we've got a good focus on the risk free rise and what the impacts of that might be. The area that is more difficult to call is the new money rates. As I said risk free clearly the 10-year bond is below 1% for the U.K. And again like the U.S. we've got a proven track record of putting rate through.", "Clearly that will probably dampen growth a bit because not all our competitors are as disciplined as Unum is both in the U.S. and the U.K. but we'll have to see how that works out and really as we go through the next few months and the government begins to set out its position we'll get a clearer picture and be able to update you on the impacts as that becomes more clear. I'll just finish that. We've got a strong business model that\u2019s well positioned to manage Brexit. That was all I was going to say Rick.", "Rick McKenney", "That was great. Thanks Peter.", "Michael Kovak", "Great. Very helpful. And are those changes particularly the FX and investment income impact in the forward EPS guidance that you gave for the second half of the year?", "Rick McKenney", "Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "We understood when we gave that guidance that that was an impact. So yes.", "Michael Kovak", "Yeah, great thanks and then one last one, in terms of shifting gears to the U.S. as you think about growth, can you may be give us a little bit more detail in terms of what is driving the large case market success that we've seen for the past couple quarters? Is it mostly with current customers or are you winning share with some new customers?", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, great question. I appreciate it and you hit the nail on the head, it's almost entirely selling into those existing client relationships and we talked about an aggregate persistency rate of about 90%. We\u2019re actually taking too higher than that in our large employer market.", "So these are long term clients that we've been able to grow within quite effectively cross selling re-enrolling contract changes and the like. So we're encouraged about that, this is also selling season for the large employer market. Many of them make changes to their benefit plans with a January 1, effective date and to be implemented those decision need to be happening now and we feel like we\u2019re competing effectively, but maintaining our discipline here through the new case sell season.", "Michael Kovak", "And are you seeing any divergence in terms of the comparative landscape between the large case and may be the core middle-to-small case markets.", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, I would say across the Board it's reasonably competitive where we feel at most acutely would be in the middle market. So that\u2019s typically employers in the say 250 employees of the say 5,000.", "Typically you\u2019ve got competitors in the space that are focused in the large case but they will go down into the mid and then you have small employer focus carriers that will go elephant hunting and that takes them up into the mid.", "And so pretty much I can get a crowded space and when prices get a little bit soft we find it's a difficult place to write business within our pricing parameters, but again its much work to be done between now and the end of the year and we feel like we get a good value proposition to take into the market, but that\u2019s where we probably felt it most acutely. Thank you, Michael.", "Michael Kovak", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. ", "Yaron Kinar", "Good morning, everybody. I have couple of questions first I heard you talk about the claims impact from raising pricing in the long term care, can you explain the relation between the two?", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, it\u2019s been something we're seeing and it\u2019s kind of like waking and sleeping dog, when they get the rate noticed and it\u2019s not only the policy holder but it\u2019s very often that caregivers or children of the policyholder that would oftentimes no person can go into and assisted living facility and not even realize that they have the coverage even know they're still paying for it and that rate increase comes out as a reminder.", "That reminder sparks people to apply for the benefits. You get some rate applications with that, people who are already -- have been in a facility for a while who are looking for back payments. So that affects the loss ratio and it just becomes an increase.", "We actually looked over that past couple of quarters at the incident rates on people who received the notification versus the incident rates on people who will be receiving but haven\u2019t received them yet and there is a 10% to 15% difference between those two with the ones being notified being 10% to 15% higher.", "It impacts severity of claims as well because that lending, that notification is focused on people with inflation riders and so they tend to have higher benefits. We\u2019ve seen it in the past, it's going to last for a while as we work through those rate increases, but we do believe it's something will abate over time.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And I guess when speaking to other I often here when I discuss shock lapse once the great increases come in, in the grand scheme of things, are you seeing more of a favorable impact from shock lapse or more of a negative impact from kind of waking these sleeping dogs?", "Rick McKenney", "I think shock lapse is relative. If their lapse rate go up 0.1% or 0.2% it is big relative to the lapse rate but I\u2019m not sure I would go out of shock lapse. We really don\u2019t see a kind of lapses with rate increases maybe a little blip and in particular because the lending spot provides the option to maintain their counter premium. We would expect to see even a less of a persistency impact from these rate increases.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And then one quick clarification if I can with regards to the updated guidance and I think you talked about it in the prepared comments, but is the move up to the top end of the prior guidance, is that pretty much predicated on better than expected results in the first half of the year or is there also some expectation that relative to how you start of the year developing when you gave the initial guidance, if there is some expectation that the second half results will be better than initially expected?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes we've assumed that the second half of the results will be on plan which is very consistent with your consensus estimates.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Yaron.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Rick McKenney", "Good morning, Eric.", "Operator", "Mr. Berg, your line is open.", "Eric Berg", "Yep I'm ready. Sorry I was on mute. I was surprised to hear that in response to an earlier question that in the last recession in the U.K. there had not been a material increase in claims experience because that would be announced with the U.S. experience? Did I hear and interpret you Peter's response correctly and if I did, what was different back that would explain this different from U.S. experience.", "Rick McKenney", "Eric, maybe I will take that from an U.S. perspective first. We actually did not see the increased level of claims coming through some of the financial crisis, but we would have seen maybe as higher level of submitted but our paid claims were very stable through that period of time. So I don\u2019t actually think there was a difference. I think the U.K. experience was actually quite similar to that which we saw in the U.S.", "Eric Berg", "Okay. And then secondly finally in the long term carrier, Jack I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the decision by many customers, many policyholder to accept this landing, landing script option would have implication for either the volatility or the way that fill the reserves prospectively, could you just go over that concept and maybe explain it a little bit further. Thank you.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. So if you pay the rate increase, your benefits continue to grow at 5% compounded annual rate. So those who pay the rate increase have a bigger benefit out there and that additional premium pays for that benefit bucket.", "If you take the landing spot, they compound at 3%. So the ultimate benefits that you pay down the road are significantly smaller than they would have been had you paid the premium.", "As you realize fluctuations whether it's interest rate fluctuations or underlying experience fluctuations, they don\u2019t affect premiums. They affect the benefits much more severely and so by having a smaller pool out there you're less sensitive to interest rates or mortality fluctuations.", "Eric Berg", "Which will also have lower premiums than would otherwise have been the case.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes but the premiums are not as low -- they're not as sensitive to those things as the benefits are. If you're going to have higher incidence down the road, premiums don\u2019t react to that benefit.", "Eric Berg", "All right, thank you. Go ahead.", "Jack McGarry", "It's a little like de-risking a pension plan.", "Eric Berg", "In general are you -- have you said that you have been neutral towards, agnostic towards the landing, does the landing spot leave you better off than if a customer does not elect the landing spot neutral or worse off?", "Rick McKenney", "It's relatively neutral. But you do get that benefit of being less sensitive to future changes and assumptions.", "Eric Berg", "Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Eric.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "Yes Colonial sales have been quite strong. I wonder if you have any commentary on recruiting in sales force trends, what that might mean for second half sales?", "Rick McKenney", "Great, thanks Mark. We're happy to take that as our last question. I'll flip that over to Tim Arnold.", "Tim Arnold", "Yes Mark thanks for the question. We feel great about results that we're delivering. To your point about recruiting -- we're seeing very nice uptick in recruiting and probably more importantly have very strong growth in our sales management team. So the new recruits that we're recruiting are getting a lot of attention and the success rate in the new recruits is improving.", "We like the market environment a lot right now. The market dynamics are very favorable. Employers increasingly need the solutions that we offer. It's certainly working and they need the solutions that we offer. Feel very good about our strategy, terrific execution of that strategy especially in field distribution growth, very disciplined activity levels, incredible capabilities including what we believe is unparalleled enrollment capabilities.", "We do a lot of core enrollments for every dollar of claim life benefits dollars of other benefits which comes with creating a very strong value prop for small employers especially a tremendous depth of our products, capabilities and services.", "And finally outstanding leadership team, strong capital implementation. So we feel very good. We had a very, very strong second half of the year in 2015. So we're up against some good numbers, but we're optimistic.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Mark for the last question. I would like to thank all of you as well for taking the time to join us this morning. We look forward to seeing many of you at various investor conferences and meetings in the weeks ahead and so operator this nor completes our second quarter 2016 earnings call.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead.", "Tom White", "Great. Thank you, Karina. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the third quarter 2016 earnings conference call for Unum.", "Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as well as our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "Our SEC filings can be found in the Investor section of our website at unum.com.

A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation, can be found in our statistical supplement on our website, also in the Investor section.", "Participating in this morning's conference call are Unum's President and CEO, Rick McKenney and our CFO, Jack McGarry as well as the CEOs of our core business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum U.S.; Peter O'Donnell for Unum U.K.; and Tim Arnold for Colonial Life.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick for his opening comments. Rick?", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone.", "The third quarter was another excellent for Unum with after tax operating income per share of $0.99, an increase of almost 9% over last year. For the first nine months of 2016 after tax operating income per shares also increased close to 9%. The performance exceeds the upper end of our outlook range for the year of 3% to 6% and is driven in large part by solid premium growth in Unum U.S., Unum U.K. and Colonial Life along with very consistent benefits experience.", "I\u2019m very encouraged that we\u2019re delivering the strong results despite today\u2019s difficult business environment with historically low interest rates and more recently the sharp decline in the value of the British pound. The reason we\u2019re delivering these results begins with the leadership position we\u2019ve established in the employee and voluntary benefits marketplace over many years. These markets offer good opportunities for growth over the long term. And we believe that our longstanding and focus commitment to serving our customers and advisors sets us apart from the competition. Our industry leading expertise and our disciplined approach to the fundamental operations of our business have enabled us to grow our business with the high level of consistency and profitability. We\u2019ll cover these strategic points with even greater detail at our upcoming investor meeting in December.", "This morning we will focus on the strong financial results we\u2019ve achieved in the third quarter as a result of an execution of this strategy. So, now let me move to provide a few highlights on the quarter. First, the premium growth we\u2019re generating on our core operation remains healthy at approximately 4%. This trend continues to be driven by strong persistency levels in all of our core business lines and the volume of sales we\u2019ve been generating over the last several years.", "While new sale trends are currently challenging in the Unum U.S. markets due to competitive pricing conditions, we continue to see excellent sales trends at Colonial Life and experienced a strong level sales growth at Unum U.K. this year. Specifically Colonial Life sales grew by 9.3% this quarter and 12.7% for the year-to-date.", "Next, I continue to be very pleased with the strong profit margins we\u2019re consistently generating in our core business segments. This demonstrates the discipline we employ in all aspects of our business including the pricing and underwriting of new business and the management of our enforced business relationships. All this helps to provide a good balance between producing top line growth and maintaining industry leading profit margins.", "From the capital perspective these strong operating results have continued to produce a strong level of statutory earnings and capital which is the lifeblood of our financial flexibility. The third quarter was another excellent quarter for statutory earnings which increased 13% and now exceed $800 million for the trailing four quarters. This capital generation enables our capital deployment strategy which starts with the opportunity to grow our business both through the organic growth we\u2019re generating and the ability to capitalize upon attractive acquisition opportunities.", "It also has resulted in delivering steady repurchases of our shares and annual dividend increases. On the acquisition side we closed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company during the third quarter providing the platform to grow what we believe will be a substantial dental business overtime. Dental is a good fit because it is a volume product that customers value. It is sold often at the workplace and as a voluntary product it fits well in our existing product portfolio and distribution channel.", "Another indicator of our performance is the growth we\u2019ve seen in book value per share which for the third quarter is $40.33 an increase of 14% year-over-year. Book value excluding AOCI also increased 9.2% year-over-year to $38.39 at quarter end. So in summary, it\u2019s been a very strong first three quarters of 2016 as I said earlier, I believe the success is largely a result of our steadfast focus on disciplined execution of our business plan. This execution has multiple facets from underwriting and pricing to paying claims to helping people return to work, all the while serving our customers very well. The combination of both operating and markets provide good opportunities for growth and disciplined execution of our strategy leaves us very well positioned to deliver great value to our shareholders in the future.", "So, with those highlights on an excellent third quarter I\u2019d ask Jack to cover our third quarter results in greater detail. Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "Thank you, Rick and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high level overview of our third quarter results and now we want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we experienced in the quarter.", "First, I\u2019m very encouraged by the composition of our after tax operating income per share growth of 8.8%, as after-tax operating income grew 3.7% over the year ago quarter and our share count declined by 4.9% due to our ongoing capital management initiatives. This continues the favorable trend of balanced growth to earnings growth and capital management activities we\u2019ve seen throughout 2016.", "One of the primary drivers of our overall results this quarter was the performance of Unum U.S. Third quarter operating income was very strong at $231 million, an increase of 5.6% from the year ago quarter. Premium income growth continued its positive trend increasing 5.9% over the year ago quarter helped in par for the inclusion of our dental acquisition. The benefit ratio for Unum U.S. segment improved to 69.4% in the third quarter compared to 69.8% in the year ago quarter with excellent results in the group disability line.", "In addition our focus on disciplined expense management continued to contribute to the favorable operating results. The other expense ratio declined to 20.9% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the year ago quarter, the profitability of the Unum U.S. remains very strong with an operating ROE of 15% for the third quarter of 2016. Within the Unum U.S. segment operating income in our group disability business was exceptionally strong this quarter at $85.4 million, an increase of 20.6% over the last year.", "Premium income increased 2.8% over the year ago quarter while pressure on net investment income continues as low new money yields pressure the portfolio yield. The benefit ratio was exceptional at 78.6% for the third quarter compared to 80.5% in the year ago quarter. This improvement in the loss ratio was driven by strong renewal results over the past couple of years and continues favorable in claim recovery trends. These results leave us well positioned to absorb any discount rate pressures that may arise from today\u2019s low interest rate environment while maintaining our group disability loss ratio and are expected 80% to 82% range.", "Group Life and AD&D operating income declined to $53.4million for the third quarter down a 11.3% from the year ago quarter. Premium income grew 5.5% over the year ago quarter but the benefit ratio increased to 72.6% for the third quarter compared to 71% in the year ago quarter as a result of higher average claim size. Net investment income was negatively impacted by lower yields as well as lower asset levels resulting from reduced capital in the Group Life line.", "Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines results are very strong at $92.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.1% over the year ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remain very favorable particularly with the addition of the dental business increasing 12.1% in the quarter compared to last year. From the benefits perspective our overall results remain in-line with our expectations. Benefits experienced in the individual disability in the third quarter was generally consistent with the year ago quarter and benefits experienced by voluntary benefits was slightly less favorable relative to the year-ago quarter primarily driven by less favorable experience in the life product line.", "Looking at Unum U.K. operating income was \u00a321.5 million for the third quarter an increase of 1.9% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 3.9% over the year-ago quarter. The growth benefit of last year\u2019s Dental acquisition was partially offset by pressure on growth from existing customers resulting from the current economic uncertainty. The benefit ratio was 71.8% for the third quarter relative to a favorable 67.8% in the year-ago quarter. The majority of the increase in the benefit ratio was driven by higher IFTI adjustments which were offset by stronger net investment income on the investment portfolio.", "We also saw some pressure to the higher average claim size in both the Groups Life and Group long-term disability line. Overall profitability of the UK segment remains very strong with an operating ROE of 20.7% for the third quarter.", "It\u2019s still too early to tell what the long term impact of Brexit will be on our UK operations, the lower weighted average exchange rate of 131 in the third quarter compared 155 in the year-ago quarter adversely impacted the translation of UK earnings back into US dollars. We do not expect to see much if any impact to our client experience, however it\u2019s important trend and slowdown in the UK, and Sterling and interest rate remains under pressure we likely to see some negative impact to our premium growth and investment income trends.", "We started to see some slowdown in underlying life\u2019s growth of weight inflation in the third quarter as companies appeared to be in a wait and see mode for further clarity on the details and implications of Brexit. We believe that the fundamental need for protection products in the UK is not changed as a result of the Brexit vote, but we will be monitoring very closely for any impacts in our markets over the next several quarters.", "Colonial Life continued its trend of producing strong steady results with operating income of $79 million in the third quarter 2016 compared to $76.3 in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth accelerated to 6.3% and the benefit ratio was 51.6% for the third quarter compared to 51.2% for the year-ago quarter. Colonial Life continues to generate excellent margins with an operating ROE of 17.3% for the quarter.", "Finally, the Closed Block, operating income was $28.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $27.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line the interest adjusted loss ratio was 81.5% in the third quarter compared to 80.8% in the year-ago quarter reflecting normal volatility.", "For the long-term care line of business, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 93.8% for the third quarter compared to 89.9% in the year-ago quarter. The long-term care loss ratio was elevated due to the termination of our largest group case which also had a unique auto portability feature. I will explain the impact of this termination in more detail in a moment. In the absence of this event, the long-term loss ratio would have been in the upper end of our 85% to 90% range.", "Similar to the second quarter, we continued to see some pressure on new claims incidents and severity from rate increase notifications to policy holders that have been delivered recently. This impact was significantly diminished in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, but we would expect and continue to see some impact over the next several quarters, also we experienced less favorable mortality experience in the long term care line this quarter. As I mentioned long term care results were negatively impacted this quarter by the termination of our largest group case. Normally, when Group long-term care termination occurs we experience a small positive benefit to our financial results. This case was unique and that had an auto port feature whereby employer funded coverage automatically ported and policy holders had to opt out in order to terminate their coverage.", "As life support, we changed the persistency assumption underlying the reserves from the group assumption to a significantly lower individual assumption which results in a much larger reserve. The unusually large number of ports coupled with the corresponding increase in reserve adversely impacted our loss ratio this quarter. In the absence of this unique case termination our long term care loss ratio would have been in the 85% to 90% consistent with our long term expectations.", "I continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re experiencing on achieving rate increases on our imports long term care business.", "In addition in making good progress the state regulators and receiving several new rate increase approvals this quarter, we are continuing to see strong take up of the landing spot off chain. The landing spot has the same positive impact on reserves as rate increases but also has the added benefit of de-risk in the portfolio. Since future claims will be small amount at the lending spot, the reserves will be some of less than todays the future changes and reserve assumptions.", "I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with the UNM US, total sales declined 11.5% for the third quarter compared to a year ago. We continue to see competitive market conditions particularly in the core market segment where we have increased our rates to offset interest rate pressure. In total for LTD, STD and group life, we saw an overall decline in sales of 19.7%. Core market sales decline 13.7%, while large case sales were down 36.2% reflecting a very tough comparison for large case in the year ago quarter.", "I will remind you that the third quarter is the smallest sales quarter for the year. So, quarterly volatility can be amplified. We remain committed to pricing discipline and maintaining strong margins in our business. The momentum in our voluntary and supplemental segment remains very encouraging with sales roughly in line with the strong year-ago quarter driven by continued demand for supplemental products in the Starmount acquisition. Our individual disability sales declined 23% against a very strong year ago quarter which benefitted from several large cases.", "In the voluntary benefits product line, total sales were in line with the year-ago quarter. Persistency for here and in the US is at very healthy levels. The employee benefits launch combined, resistancy was 89.9%. This is important to us as we looked to move price increases into our enforced block and to offset the impact of low interest rates and pressure on discount rates.", "Our salesforce client management in underwriting teams do an excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our enforced business. This is essential to our ability to grow while protecting the strong profit margins we have in our employee benefits block. Likewise, voluntary benefits persistency of 76.8% was favourable to prior year results as was individual testability persistency at 91.2%.", "Sales in Unum UK, continue to rebound, increasing 15.6% in local currency with favourable trends across all segments. The inclusion of sales from last year's dental acquisition contributed 2% to this growth. Persistency was favourable at 86.5% helping to drive premium income growth of 3.9% this quarter. We expect sales to moderate in the wake of Brexit and we will continue to be disciplined in the UK market.", "Finally, Colonial Life turned in another great quarter for new sales increasing 9.3% at the third quarter and 12.7% for the first nine months of the year. Growth remains well balanced between the core commercial markets sector and a public sector as well as what sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts. We have now achieved 12 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales growth reflecting our continued investment in the business and a favourable environment.", "Strong leading indicators such as new sales rep recruiting and new sales rep productivity give us confidence that we can maintain this positive sales momentum as we look to invest more on our colonial life distribution system to build our territories and expand our presence geographically. Persistency for colonial life was improved in the quarter to 79% from 78.6% last year. As a result premium growth continues to build momentum, increasing 6.3% in the third quarter compared to the year ago quarter.", "Overall we remain pleased with the growth trends we see across our core business segments. We feel it's important that we remain disciplined in our new business pricing in order to sustain the profit margins we have in our core business lines, particularly in Unum US. Well, it can be tempting to push for sales growth, we do not believe that this is the appropriate time to do so.", "Looking now in investment results, new many yields continue to come under pressure in the third quarter. Fortunately we were able to meet our new money yield target of 5% for our long-term care portfolio again this quarter, using our typical mix of investment classes and investment strategies and we have exceeded this target every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review.", "We conclude this year's reserve review for long term care of the next several weeks and currently believe that no special reserving will be necessary for yearend 2016. If interest rates remain depressed when extended period of time, we could see pressure in future years, but I have to remind you that we have a substantial cushion between our GAAP and statutory reserve for long term care, which means that any future reserve increase would most likely be a GAAP event with little or no impact to statutory reserves and then show a little to no impact on our capital deployment plans.", "With respect to Unum US, long term disability business, well we continue to maintain a healthy interest margin in our reserves all in yield have formed significantly from year-end 2015 levels. On the other end, the underlying profitability of our group disability business has improved significantly as a result of rate increases and disciplined risk management. At the risk of standing redundant, we are confident that that business can absorb any potential discount rate changes while maintaining an expected loss ratio in the 80% to 82% range. We will provide more clarity on this at our December outlook meeting.", "The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight and further rebound in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to 546 million at the end of the third quarter compared to 433 million at the end of the second quarter and 19 million at the end of the first quarter. I believe this validates the investment decisions in credit of valuation process we have followed for many years, not just for our energy holdings but for our management of the overall investment portfolio", "Moving to capital management, we repurchased a 100 million of our shares in the third quarter, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately 600 million as of quarter end, which is at the higher end of our range for holding company cash coverage needs.", "During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company and paid up 350 million of maturing debt on September 30th. Because of the higher debt level we have been carrying since our debt issuance in May of 6th, 2016, our interest expense which we put in the corporate segment was 7 million higher this quarter compared to the year ago quarter. With the debt maturity, our quarterly debt expense will decline by approximately $5.5 million in the fourth quarter relative to this quarter.", "The risk based capital ratio for a traditional life insurance companies improved to approximately 395% to the upper end of our target range of 375% to 400% for this year. Statutory after tax operating earnings for our traditional US insurance companies were again outstanding at 211.5 million for the third quarter at 2016 compared to a 187.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 13%. This continues as a strong trend in statutory earnings which on a trailing four quarter basis now toggles 806 million.", "Throughout 2016, our outlook for growth and after tax operating income per share has been expected growth rate of 3% to 6%. For the first nine months of the year, we are beating that expectation with growth of 8.9% driven by good premium growth, solid risk results in a focused on expense management. Therefore for the full year of 2016, we now expect to be at if not slightly above the upper end of our outlook range. We will provide and outlook for 2017 at our December 15th Analyst meeting and while we're very encouraged by the operating trends we see in this year in the momentum it creates for next year.", "We will face headwinds created by low interest rates on our portfolio yields and discount rates as well as the impact of the decline in the British pound. So, to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with the results for the first three quarters of 2016. We're executing very well on our strategy particularly in critical areas such as maintaining pricing discipline despite increased competition in the US market, generating strong persistency in growth in our core business segments, delivering on renewables to help achieve strong profit margins despite interest rate pressure and achieving rate increases and meeting new money yield targets for long term care.", "I believe that our success in these areas positions us well to continue to generate value for our shareholders in today's difficult environment. Now, I turn things back to Rick for his closing comments.", "Rick McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Jack. And as we move to questions, I'd like to conclude the prepared remarks by really iterating how pleased we are with our third quarter results. I continue to be encouraged by the good premium growth we are generating which along with stable benefits experience drives our strong capital generation. I believe these trends will continue to service well as we manage through this challenging business environment.", "We'll now move to your questions and so I'll ask Kareena to begin the Q&A session. Kareena?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Humphrey Lee from Dowling and Partners. Please go ahead. ", "Humphrey Lee", "Thank you for taking my question. Maybe you can talk about the kind of the market competition that you are seeing in Unum US, it seems to be getting more competitive as coverage in your sales activities in the quarter. Can you just talk about the overall competitions from the competitors and the pricing environment in general?", "Rick McKenney", "Great, Humphrey. Thanks for your question. Mike you want to answer?", "Mike Simonds", "Sure. Thanks Humphrey great question. And I would start by referencing a point that Jack made in his comment and that third quarter is our smallest quarter, fluctuate a bit year to year but typically about 15% of the year. So it's subject to a bit more volatility. I think I would certainly take the sales results and put them into two buckets and the first would be around volatility and when we look at the large case group insurance business voluntary benefits and IDI, I think we saw little bit of volatility against some good large sales in the year ago quarter. I feel really good about the traction we have got in the market at our value proposition and how we are competing. On the other side though I would say core group insurance it\u2019s less about volatility and it's more about sustained trend we have seen over the last several quarters.", "And to your question well we have been moving rates up on new business slowly over the past I would say two and half years. We have not seen the corresponding increase from the market and so we have seen closed ratios fall off a bit particularly around new client sales and while certainly we would expect that given low interest rate the market will eventually move to where we are. We just have not seen that yet and us well enough to know that when the market allows us to write business at sustainable rates in the core we will be there with all the capacity that's available.", "Just in concluding what I would say is persistency remains really high. So not just to focus on new business, we are doing a good job keeping clients and that's helping to fuel some really nice earned premium growth almost 6% in the quarter.", "Humphrey Lee", "Well, you mentioned the your competition is not moving the rate as you guys are doing right now so do you feel like it is more of a timing issue or do you feel like there maybe some under pricing in the market in general?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, I would say our point of view is that new business rates don't reflect the full impact of the low interest rate environment in the market. What I would say is we have come in to each of the last couple of years as I mentioned with plans to sort of gradually move new business rates up. We feel like \u2013 actually we pretty much arrived given low interest rates that where we need to be on new business so as we look at the coming quarters and we will spend time on this at our Investor Day. I feel more optimistic that the market will come in line as the quarters come and like I said we will wait until that occurs.", "Humphrey Lee", "Okay. And then just maybe sneak one more in. I think it's also question for Mike, you mentioned in the interview recently that you target to more than doubling the size of Starmount operations to kind of $500 million revenue over the next five years. Can you maybe share some of your thoughts in terms of how you can achieve that and then also kind of with some of the weaker sales in Unum US how would that play as a headwind since detail of pros tend to sell as a package?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, we are really excited about the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana felt like from the very set of management meetings we had great alignment around the focus on customers and on the people down there. So we are really excited about adding this platform to the portfolio and it's right on strategy for us. We talk all the time about delivering a strong client experience keeping clients and seeking growth through those existing client relationships. And we feel like with the addition of Starmount we bring a really strong growth opportunity to bring dental and vision insurance into those brokerage and client relationships over the next several years. It's going to take some time to get it to national scale. And we don't expect it to be a meaningful contributor to earnings as we continue to invest in that platform in the short term but we are excited about it for the mid and long term.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you Humphrey.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Ryan Krueger with KBW.", "Ryan Krueger", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was on Unum UK, I guess from here maybe over the next intermediate term, do you think premiums will actually start to decline on it a year-over-year basis on a constant FX basis or given some of the pressures could you provide any more color on the outlook there?", "Rick McKenney", "Ryan, I would turn it to Peter O'Donnell on the U.K. Peter?", "Peter O'Donnell", "Ryan thanks very much for your question. So to give a little bit of background to what\u2019s happening in the UK as you know we have voted to exit Europe in June and since then there has really been what I would call an interim period where people have been trying to work out what that means. How that's impacting our business if you look at our results, sales going well, persistence going well. But natural growth which is really live and wage inflation as basic is anemic, which is actually a bit lower than the last year whereas when we were planning we saw the economy would be getting to sort of start to motor. And really that's what I see happening in 2017 as well. As people are uncertain about the future and I think the negotiations will go on in 2017. I think there will be discerning about bring new staff on and putting wage inflation into the economy and we will see that remain low. So we might get 2% to 3% on lives and wage inflation in a good economy. I think it will be 1% to 1.5% which is pretty much what we are seeing this year.", "So I think premiums will be lower than we expected. But it will still get a better growth as we look forward on the scenario that we are planning. Although I would also say that it is uncertain. And it depends on how the market reacts to those price negotiations. So we are monitoring that. We are also taking action around the interest rates because they have dropped off a bit and again because the ten year fail quite significantly. And the most obvious example of where our competitors will be impacted is the exchange rates. So while on constant currency I think it will a lot lower than expected on an exchange rate we are going to see that to the one dollar 20 if it sticks there come through each quarter for the next two or three quarters when we do relative comparisons. So you need to factor that into your analyst models.", "Ryan Krueger", "Great. Thanks and then could you give us an update on the delta between statutory and GAAP long term care reserves and then would you expect similar impacts in first Unum from year end testing as we had in kind of last few years?", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Ryan, Jack you want to add to it.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. So in terms of GAAP stat I think last quarter I said was around 800 million. It's grown a little bit. It tends to grow on a quarterly basis so it's a very comfortable margin particularly when you think about pretty much in the context of level of interest rate, discount changes we have taken over the past couple of periods. So a very comfortable stat GAAP difference we would expect. Any movements we take in long term care in the future could be logically GAAP adjustments as opposed to cash adjustment and will allow us to maintain our capital plans and share repurchase at its current level.", "With respect to first Unum we will expect kind of similar types of adjustment in first Unum that we have seen throughout the period. We don't expect anything outsized relative to that and it's something that is built into our capital plans and our cash models and we are confident that it will be a pretty smooth transition that in the fourth quarter.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Ryan.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from John Nadel with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.", "John Nadel", "Good morning everybody. Mike I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the commentary around competition in Unum US and maybe pricing still needing to catch up a bit. We know that several carriers had to go through a process of sort of fixing their books of business and I guess that's the process that's been ongoing I thought anyway for the last couple of years. Would you characterize sort of the overall markets as still needing to take a lot of rate because it seems to me some of those companies were really taking significant rate playing some catch-up? I just wonder what your commentary is around that?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes. Thanks John good morning and I think your read is largely accurate. I think at any point in time you have got some carriers that are steady as it goes. Some that are moving to fix issues that have worked their way into their books and more aggressively moving up rates and some that are looking to take share by underwriting more aggressively and it's really when you have a condition like I would characterize the current market it isn't that everyone is out of whack. I think what we have is just enough carriers that are more interested in share than improving margins such that we are not seeing enough opportunity to show sales growth. We are still writing business certainly and as I said, I am probably more optimistic heading into the next year than I have been in the little while, but it will take time. And again we will wait to see how it plays out.", "John Nadel", "Without naming names I mean would you be willing to at least say those who are in your view more focused on taking share than they tend right now be publicly traded or private?", "Mike Simonds", "That's a clever way to get out John, yes so I probably would stick to avoid giving too much color on this specific names but generally I would say, when you are seeking growth and you show growth for sustained period of time purely on new clients coming in it can be very tricky to maintain margins. So we see a pretty strong correlation over the long run between new client sales growth and profit margins.", "John Nadel", "Okay. And then just a follow-up for Jack on group long term care case reported over to an individual case, should we expect that to have an ongoing impact on interest adjusted loss ratio or is it more of a discrete impact in the third quarter only?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes thanks John. Now that's done. We wouldn\u2019t expect that they have an ongoing impact.", "John Nadel", "Terrific. Thanks.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.", "Tom Gallagher", "Good morning. Jack just first question on holding company cash just so I understand this so $600 million of whole co cash is that the total number or do you have an extra amount for planned contributions to the New York subs and Fairwind for the year. Is that all an extra amount sitting at the holding company or so anyway that's my first question?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, Tom I think I noted in our Q that is net of anticipated contributions to our subsidiaries.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. And then Jack if I look over to the last three years you have averaged about 300 million of contributions between the New York sub and the LTC capital Fairwind. So is it fair to assume that the number would be in excessive 600? Would be closer to $900 million of whole co cash right now?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes Tom can I talk about that for a second because you looked over the last three years. That's 13, 14, and 15. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we re-domesticated our Bermuda captive into Vermont and when we did that we made a contribution because we stepped the reserves up on a statutory basis to the NAIC level. So we \u2013 so that was an unusual event in the fourth quarter of 2013 that recorded cash. In 2014, we took the reserve charge. And as a result of the reserve charge, there was a change in statutory reserves related to claim reserves and so there was an unusual contribution in 2014 resulting from that. So I think if you look at the three year average those aren't average periods. There were significant advanced that we identified in each of them and we don't have 300 million of cash needs in the fourth quarter or we are anticipating if you go back and you look at our cash holdings by quarter, if you back out those significant event sheet don't see a drop in cash in the third quarter. And also I mean in the fourth quarter and also note that the fourth quarter is a wider cash need from an interest expense perspective because most of our coupons are doing in the first and third quarter and so you can't just look at that funding. There is a reason those funding take place in the fourth quarter it's because we have other cash needs in the fourth quarter that offset.", "Tom Gallagher", "Just to be clear you wouldn't expect to have any cash needed Fairwind this year?", "Jack McGarry", "I wouldn't expect to have any extraordinary fourth quarter event that significantly changes our holding company cash.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. So between New York and Fairwind if I think about the amounts that would be needed there on a run rate basis you would not expect if I look at the last three years including last year there to be any meaningful amount that\u2019s need for Fairwind. Is that fair? ", "Jack McGarry", "It will be similar to our normal amount, clearly under a $100. The other thing note about of these things, we fund them over the year, it\u2019s not a fourth quarter event, you will see it for Fairwind in the fourth quarter because when the [indiscernible] gets filed, but it\u2019s something that happens on an unknowing basis.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. Thanks and then just my follow-up on the group case that got converted on the long term care side how big of portion of your total group business was that, was that \u2013 that was your largest case you said. What percent of the total was that?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. It's like 5% of the total I mean it was a large case. It was four to five times bigger than our second largest case. In our average case size on the group business is like a 100, so it was a very, very big and relative to the block.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. Alright. Thank you. ", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Rick McKenney", "Hey Mark.", "Mark Hughes", "Your benefit ratio on the US group disability business was quite low this quarter. Was that just some natural variability or is that has been trending in that direction and you finally just sort of getting more credibility? ", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks for noticing Mark. Mike you want to take that on?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes. Thanks. Good morning Mark. I think it's a little bit of both so certainly we had favorable new claims incidents and has had favorable new claimants over the last several quarters but maybe a little bit more so here in the most recent period, I do think probably proportionally those the bigger driver is just the continued impact of the strong risk management. So when we talked about new price discipline leading to a difficult new sales quarter for us I would link that directly to being conservative in our pricing and so as we have worked that through in terms of new business and through our renewal programs that has had the effect of lowering the benefit ratio and what I think is a sustainable way and if you put good risk management at the front of the business and we are really strong consistent high quality benefits organization at the backend of the process, I think we are really pleased with the outcome. And so sitting where we are at this point is really good and as we look forward to the fourth quarter and think about as Jack alluded to any necessary changes to the discount rate on new claimants occurs in LTD should that be necessary we feel really comfortable that the business is healthy enough to be able to absorb that and maintain that targeted range for us which is in the 80% to 82% loss ratio range.", "Mark Hughes", "And then, your natural growth kind of the wage headcount growth any body language on whether that was little bit better, little bit slower this quarter?", "Mike Simonds", "Pretty consistent with what was have seen over the course of the year. So muted from what we would see as a healthy and strong margin but it is a net contributor for us.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Mark. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from [indiscernible] please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning Unum. I am just curious if you had any reactions to January series of announcements specifically the charge for monitoring care related to more longer duration claims which I think you have commented you have been seeing to some extent but are they ahead of behind the curve in your view and do you have ruling interest on the success of their actions and any general commentary and their strategic move would be appreciated? ", "Rick McKenney", "Great. Thanks Bob. This is Rick, just we don't like to comment on other people's transaction obviously. I would highlight we have a very different business model but there are some things environmentally probably that's worth noting around the long term care market. We have been discussing for some time the transactions in the space particular it's a long term care will come in due course. We have seen some reinsurance transactions now, we see a situation where there is a buyer and a seller in the space and so this doesn't mean anything. Eminent for us, but I certainly think it does mean progress in terms of the capital markets, long term care and looking at different solutions.", "The second piece I note is well in this environment we have been discussing the need Jack mentioned it again in terms of what we have been doing around rate actions in the market, the need for those rate increases in our book of business. We have been doing those actions taking that on and I think the environment given some of the things that we highlighted is becoming a least more knowledgeable about the need for rate increases and what's going on and I think that's the environment that we are looking for. So those are couple of things going on in that environment.", "And the last thing I highlight is we also as a company have significant strength across the board. That gives us a whole lot of flexibility to do what we want to do any options to pursue either structurally, buying back our shares as we are doing consistently and making sure that we are taking actions ultimately benefit our shareholders. I think you had a question specific to some of the things they did, some of the things they are seeing in their long term care block and maybe Jack you can make couple of comments on who it would translate or it doesn't translate to our book of business.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. And so I don't really going to talk about what Genworth is seeing. I will tell you what we are seeing and I think probably the most fundamentally important point is we are not scrambling to keep pace with long term care. We are working through the long term care issue and we are making significant progress as a company to doing that. We feel like we are still much in better shape today than we were even three years ago and a lot of that is because of that active management of the block.", "So let me talk to you about what some of things have been. In 2014 we reset reserves assumptions. We placed those reserves assumption on a best estimate basis using our current phone experience and our experience since then has been consistent with those expectations. We also established those, when we established those reserves we built in currently filed rate increases using historical approval rates. Less than the third of those rate increase assumptions remain outstanding. We are making significant progress against them. And feel very good about where the assumptions lie with only a small portion remaining. That not only helps to support our reserve assumptions but it also gives us room in the future to react future adverse claim experience should emerge.", "The third point I would make is that our block is unique and long in the long term care business is approximately half of the block is group longer term care with employer funding an extremely conservative planned designs. And because of that group coverage and employer funding, most employees terminate their employer funded coverage when they leave the employer. As a result our group long term care has a lapse rate of closer to 10% versus less than 1% lapse rate from those individual long term care policies. And our group long term care has substantially lower risk profile, but I think that the thing that really sets us apart as a company is the vibrancy of our company in its market leading position and strong profitability. We have great free cash flow generation from our core business. We have consistently over the last six years funded our long term care capital needs. We are still allowing us to increase our dividend and maintain consistent level of share repurchases. As a result our long term care charges have largely been GAAP events and not cash events and we would expect that to continue into the future.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Can we summarize Jack by \u2013 the earning guidance to the above the range and your answer to Tom and Ryan's questions on funding and accounting for long term care that probability of a charge in a way you are pretty high confident so you can get through the fourth quarter without an event?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. We mentioned in the script that we don't answer. From what we are seeing right now we don't anticipate anything unusual in the fourth quarter with long term care.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Bob.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner", "Hey good morning. Thanks. I just have a couple of follow-ups on the termination. First can you tell us what the circumstances were of that group case terminating?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes. It was terminated because of rate increases so we had filed group long term care rate increases in that state. They had been approved and they were being implemented over a three year phase approach it was significant rate increases. And so the customer once faced with their first line decided they don't want to fund the employee benefits any longer and so they terminated the case. But it was driven by the rate increases.", "Randy Binner", "Rate increases specifically on the LTCP spread than the other aspects of the case. Is that right?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes. It was rate increases on the group long term care.", "Randy Binner", "Then the other one there is just so I understand it is that you had a large auto port component and so you shifted a lot of folks to individuals versus group policies and so the persistency assumption there goes lower meaning you have a higher lapse assumption. So if I am getting all that right \u2013 ", "Rick McKenney", "Lapse assumption goes lower. So lapse is on the group side are on the 10% range. On the individual side they are well less than 1%.", "Randy Binner", "Got it. So as they \u2013 as each person individually goes to a lower lapse and then \u2013 that's the headwind. Okay got it. I had that backwards. Perfect. Thanks a lot.", "Rick McKenney", "Okay. Thank you Randy.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Hi, good morning. So my first question was just on the likelihood of discount rate reduction on the disability side. Assuming rates are where they are, how would you approach that over the next few quarters?", "Rick McKenney", "Jack you want to take that?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. So I think we talked about in both the press releases as well as our comments that rates are significantly below where they were in 2015. If they stay where they are we will anticipate taking a discount rate change in long term disability. We feel very comfortable on that given the performance of long term disability of not only this quarter but over the past three or four quarters that we can take that discount rate change without well maintaining the loss ratio on that EBITDA 82% range. So we will talk more about that at our Investor Meeting in December 15th but given current conditions it's certainly something we are looking very hard at.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And I think the last time you adjusted it was maybe on 50 basis points. So would you assume a similar reduction or would it be larger than that?", "Jack McGarry", "It's in the ballpark. It maybe a little larger, rates have fallen on the yields of practice they have recovered a little bit recently but spread just coming as well. And so that's one of the things that we will wait until we have a better idea of where rates are in the fourth quarter. What are our investment strategy is and we will act accordingly. But certainly we didn't believe that any action we will take no matter who big it is, we will take outside of that 80% to 82% range.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "On the loss ratio?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then lastly just on long term care you did mention that you don't expect the charge this year. Assuming that rates don't move materially from current levels, how long can you go without taking charge based on your current assumptions? Would 2017 necessitate a charge given if rates are where they are given what your assumptions are on reserves?", "Jack McGarry", "It's so volatile because rates don't stay where they are. Rates move, spread moves, supply and demand in the marketplace move, assets classes don't all move in sync and so without it is really hard to predict exactly where your new money rates are going to fall in any year. Clearly, there is pressure but we do have a good margin currently and our discount rates for long term care versus our portfolio yield. We had the expectation that it would be 5% for 4-5 years. And 2017 will be three years into that. So it's going to be judgment call whether it's 2017, 2018 and a lot of it will depend on what the outlook is a year from now given that we can't even predict what the outlook is going to be at the end of this year.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Jimmy.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Michael Kovak with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kovak", "Great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to first on sales to maybe follow-up a little bit. As you looked at and as you begin to think about 2017 outlook that you are preparing for in the coming weeks and month, Unum US has obviously been weaker than you expected. Anything that changes sort of long term growth in terms of where you are expecting both sales and premium in that line given challenges in 2016?", "Rick McKenney", "Mike.", "Mike Simonds", "Yes sure. Good morning Michael thanks for the question. I think we are sticking with the strategy so I don't think your question is there are material change outside of the acquisition of Starmount I think we will begin to contribute first to sales growth over the course in particularly towards the back end of next year. And I will translate into top line growth and then ultimately into earnings once we get passed the first kind of series of investments into the platform. So that's going to play out over a really kind of a series of years and we are really excited about it and then in general we continue to feel very good about growth in the voluntary benefits market and our unique proposition there. So I would expect growth in voluntary to be there next year in individual disability that continues to be really strong contributor as well. And I think it just comes down to again given that we feel pretty good about our current position on new business pricing. We don't see need to move on that next year wherever the market be.", "Michael Kovak", "Okay. That's helpful and then if I could on long term care, with this group auto portability feature can you give us a sense of what percent of your overall group policies have this type of portability feature?", "Mike Simonds", "That was the only one. So there isn't another group policy holder in our portfolio that has that feature.", "Michael Kovak", "And then sort of a follow-up on that if I could so this sounds like you are kind of one time gap type adjustment that you made. Anything on the statutory basis given the lower lapse rates?", "Mike Simonds", "No.", "Michael Kovak", "Thanks for the answers.", "Operator", "I am sorry and we will take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar", "Thank you. Good morning everybody. I have a couple of questions on the long term disability business. So assume the pricing action that you have taken recently already anticipation of the low rate environment and the potential decrease of the discount rate?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, thanks Yaron it's Mike. I appreciate the question and you are correct. So we are trying to price forward for where we believe we need to be from an interest rate perspective. So when Jack talks about being very comfortable about maintaining that target loss ratio of 80% to 82% it's because we put the price renewal actions in place and feel good about that for the health of the business.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And then conceptually I am still trying to understand why you would need to lower the discount rate. I understand that interest rates are coming down but at the same time if I remember correctly you have quite a nice margin, reserve margin there. So why can't you just see some of that margin erode while keeping discount rate unchanged?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes I think the reason is you don't the margin to erode because that's earnings. And so I don't think you don't want to see your earnings erode. You want to be able to maintain that margin and the way to do that is to price business based on a current environment you are selling it in.", "Mike Simonds", "Yes I wanted to add real quick. It's Mike is this pricing strategy links to the value of proposition in the market and so for us it is about keeping clients for the long term and growing those relationships so sustainability of pricing is really, really important to so we always want to be on balance conservative so that we don't end up on situation where we are trying to play catch up and disrupting relationships.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Seth Weiss", "Hi, good morning. I just want to ask question on expenses Rick in your comments you mentioned that the expense ratio in the US was down about a percentage point. And you referenced the headwinds to the businesses that we are all aware of. Is there a more room on the expense side to help offset some of the business pressure that you are seeing?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes I think it's a fair question. And what we have seen over the last couple of years really actually is good management across the board by our teams on the expense side and we think about it as relative to our overall base. So the team has done a really nice job and that expense ratio has come down. I don't see that as a major driver in terms of how we take profits forward or how we run the company. I think it's something we have been doing very consistently and it's nice to see some of that come through over different period but make no mistake we are investing in our business as well and so when you think about the acquisition that we did what we are putting into our systems to connect better with our customers we are making a lot of investments in our business today. So don't take it as an expense story. It's much more a balanced efficiency and investment back in the business.", "Seth Weiss", "So what you think this expense margin that we have now is [indiscernible] run rate or should I read into your comments on investing in the business that maybe see that tick up a little bit after it's ticked down the last year?", "Rick McKenney", "No I think actually stay pretty consistent. It might come down a little bit lower. You know what I think that we benefit by as well as scale. So as our premium lines growing and the business continues to grow, we could do so little bit more efficiently. So it's flat probably down, you won\u2019t see it tick back up and I am talking about longer term trends not actually going to happen in fourth quarter or any particular quarter.", "Seth Weiss", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from [indiscernible] research.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, thank you. How much more room do you have to grow with existing clients in either cross selling or increasing penetration and how does dental on vision play into this overtime?", "Rick McKenney", "Mike you want to start?", "Mike Simonds", "Sure. Thanks. I appreciate it. So we got a lot of runway is the quick answer. So we average around three benefits per client and we feel like certainly we have got 5, 6, 7 relevant products depending on the client. So it's good opportunity there and the actually highlighted one of the other big opportunities. So the long term trend in the market is from employer funded to more employee choice and so deepening penetration into the employee basis is really important and I would say a big chunk of our product and marketing efforts has been around increasing participation in employee elected plans and we see today on a 100% voluntary plan you may have one in five employees fully participating and so we see a lot of run way there to find good sustainable and profitable growth as well.", "Rick McKenney", "So that's on the US side. I think I would add as well you have heard from Peter on the UK side. Now they are in dental business, they will be expanding their portfolio. But I\u2019ll also give Tim Arnold the chance on the Colonial Life side which has seen tremendous sales growth to talk little bit about his efforts too to expand the portfolio. Tim?", "Tim Arnold", "Yes. Thank you, Rick. And I think questions around growth from existing customers at Colonial Life about two-thirds of our sales each year come from existing customers we have a national footprint of benefit counselors you can go out and re-enroll existing customers each year which is a major competitive advantage for us. We are also seeing very strong growth in new customers which bodes well for the future as we go back out and re-enroll those customers as well. We feel great about this. The sales success we are having overall that's very broad balanced as Jack said in his comments. We have leading indicators that suggest that the strength we have seen recently in sales will continue lot of new people on the ground having good success. Lot of new officers will get success and also making investment in our existing offices. So a lot going well currently and encouraged about the future.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks for the question Eric. Operator any other questions.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Tom White", "Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call for Unum.", "Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact.

Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter was another excellent quarter for Unum, capping off a very good year. On the quarter, after-tax operating income per share increased over 5% to $1 per share and bringing our full year 2016 operating income per share to $3.92, which is a record for our company. This represents an increase of just under 8% over full year 2015, which was also above the upper end of our original outlook range of growth of 3% to 6%. This performance was broad based and driven primarily by solid premium growth, especially in Unum US and Colonial Life. There was also a very strong operational performance across all of our business lines. I remain very encouraged by our ability to deliver these results in an environment of still relatively low interest rates and more recently, a weaker British pound. ", "I am equally encouraged by our company's potential to generate even stronger results, as the economy improves and potentially as interest rates move higher. As we discussed with you at our outlook meeting in December, I believe the primary reason we are delivering these strong results and doing so on a consistent basis is that we are well positioned strategically in the Employee Benefits market. We excel at the fundamentals of our business in three primary areas; distribution and relationship management, pricing and risk selection and claims processing and management. You will see this expertise come through in the premium growth we are generating in our core businesses, while also maintaining very attractive profit margins. The reason is that as we pursue this growth, we do so in a disciplined way. Jack will cover this in each of our business lines in his comments in a moment, but let me first provide a few highlights on the quarter. ", "First, our premium growth remains very healthy. For Unum US, our fourth quarter growth was up 6% relative to last year. Colonial Life\u2019s growth continued to build momentum as premium growth for the fourth quarter was just under 7%, the strongest rate of growth since 2008. Sales were also very encouraging in the fourth quarter, as Unum US sales rebounded to increase by 8.5%; Unum UK increased by 6.7% in local currency and Colonial Life sales also grew 6.5%. In addition, we are very pleased with the persistency rates we are experiencing across all of our segments, which helped generate this premium growth.", "Second, our profit margins remain quite strong in our core business segments with ROEs running in the mid to high teens. The discipline we follow in the fundamentals of our business from the pricing and underwriting of new business relationships to the management of our current customers. This provides a good balance between producing top line growth and doing so in a profitable way. As you would expect, given these growth trends and strong profit margins, we\u2019re also generating excellent statutory earnings. In fact, for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, we generated record levels of statutory income, that is 885 million in after-tax statutory operating income for the full year 2016, an increase of 28% over 2015. ", "As a result, our risk-based capital levels and holding company cash position finished the year above our expectation. This provides good choices for our capital deployment strategy. We start with backing the growth we're seeing in our business as well as investing to enhance our position in the market. This is true on both a core basis as well as acquisitions such as Starmount and NDP. This healthy cash generation has also enabled us to increase our dividends and consistently repurchase our shares with the excess over our growth needs. Another indicator of performance is the steady growth in our book value per share, which for the fourth quarter, increased year-over-year by 8.5% to $39.02. Book value, excluding AOCI, increased 9.3% year-over-year to $39.24 at quarter end.", "So in summary, it was an excellent year for Unum in 2016. It was a year that saw a lot of volatility in the markets. Through it, we remain steady with our intense focus on the disciplined execution of our business plan and serving the needs of employers and their employees. We are optimistic as we enter 2017 with a great market position, a recipe for top and bottom line growth and a great team. ", "So with those highlights on an excellent quarter and full year, I\u2019ll ask Jack to cover our fourth quarter results in greater detail. Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "Thank you, Rick and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high level overview of our fourth quarter results. And now, I want to provide a more in-depth view of the themes we\u2019re seeing in our business. ", "First, it was an outstanding quarter for Unum overall. Our tax operating income per share of $1 is an increase of 5.3% over last year. We achieved these results, despite the 33% tax rate in the fourth quarter, which was driven in part by the sharp rise in interest rates in the UK. Our before-tax operating income increased 7.6% to 346.9 million, the strongest rate of growth we've experienced in many years. As in prior quarters, we continue to be pleased with the strong balance between the operational performance drivers of our EPS growth and the capital management drivers. Leading the growth in before-tax operating income was our flagship Unum US segment, which produced record operating income for the fourth quarter of 240.1 million, an increase of 12.1% over last year. While each of our Unum US business lines performed well, group disability had an outstanding quarter with before-tax operating income of 89.5 million, an increase of over 35%. ", "The earnings growth was driven by a sharp improvement in the benefit ratio from 81.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 77.7% in the current quarter. The current benefit ratio includes a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate for new claim incurrals and is consistent with the 76% to 79% range that we communicated at the December investor meeting. The improvements in the group disability benefit ratio that we've seen throughout the year continue to be driven by favorable incidence trends in the cumulative benefit of rate increases on renewals over the past several quarters. Group disability premium income growth was 3.7% over the year ago quarter, driven by continued strong persistency levels. ", "The group life and AD&D line continued a steady performance with operating income of 56.1 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 3.3%. Premium income grew 4.9% over the year ago quarter and the benefit ratio improved slightly to 71.5% for the fourth quarter compared to 72% in the year ago quarter. Lower incidence, lower average claim size and favorable waiver premium benefits experienced throughout the improvement in group life. The supplemental and voluntary lines continued to perform well, producing after-tax operating income of 94.5 million, an increase of about 1% over the year ago quarter. Premium and growth trends remained very favorable, increasing 11.1% in the quarter compared to last year. ", "It's worth noting that we executed a reinsurance transaction in the individual disability line in the fourth quarter. This transaction lowered premiums by about 25 million, which was offset by a reduction in the sum of benefits and expenses of about 25 million. It caused a slight elevation of the benefit ratio, but had no material impact on the operating income of the line. The transaction improves the capital efficiency of the product line, thereby improving the future ROE of the line by about one half percent. Also in the supplemental and voluntary lines, this was the first full quarter with the acquisition of Starmount and results were in line with expectations. We're excited to now actively offer Unum branded dental and vision products in the market. ", "We're very pleased to see the rebound in sales growth for Unum US in the fourth quarter. Our sales increased 8.5% over the fourth quarter of 2015, after showing year-over-year declines in the previous three quarters. Total group sales increased by 8.2% with very strong growth in short term disability and group life, driven by sales to existing customers in the larger cases segment. Overall, we continue to see strong persistency across all of our Unum US lines of business. Obviously, this is a key driver of positive premium growth. ", "For Unum UK, operating tax -- before-tax operating income was slightly lower at GBP24.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to GBP24.4 million in the year ago quarter. Benefits experience was generally favorable, with the benefit ratio improving to 67.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 69.9% a year ago, due primarily to better group life results. We experienced about a 1% decline in premium income, which was mostly attributable to slower growth we're seeing in the imports block of business, likely a result of the economic disruption created by the BREXIT vote in June. Clearly the exchange rate is a negative for our reported translated results. With an exchange rate of 1.24 for the fourth quarter compared to 1.52 in the year ago quarter and 1.31 in the third quarter of 2016. We expect this to continue to impact reported results in 2017.", "Sales in Unum UK remained favorable, increasing 6.7% on a local currency basis in the fourth quarter. The increase was well balanced by product line and by segment. We were also pleased with the improvement we saw in persistency, which was 87.3% for 2016 compared to 86.3% in 2015. ", "Colonial Life again produced very strong and consistent results with before-tax operating income of 79.9 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 3% over last year. Premium income growth continues to accelerate, increasing 6.8% for the quarter. Our benefits experience remained generally in line with expectations and recent trends. In addition, our sales trends for Colonial Life remain positive with an increase of 6.5% for the fourth quarter. This increase was driven by success in the larger end of the commercial market and the public sector. We also saw a very good balance with account sales increase -- with new account sales increasing 6.9% in the quarter, while existing account sales grew by 6.3%. For the full year 2016, Colonial Life sales increased by 10.3%, which is the fourth consecutive year we've seen year-over-year growth, a very strong result through a difficult economic environment. Persistency also improved in 2016, increasing to 79.3% from 78.5% in 2015.", "Finally, for the closed block, operating income was 34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 28.1 million in the year ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 84.7% in the quarter compared to 87.2 in the year ago quarter. The underlying benefits experience was in line with our expectations, but the reported benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was impacted by a reserve discount rate adjustment we made as a result of unusually high bond call activity and related miscellaneous investment income. ", "For the long term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 89.1% for the quarter, improved from the year ago ratio of 89.7% in the third quarter 2016 ratio of 93.8%. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by favorable mortality experience and the impact of persistency on active life reserves. I'll point out that since the fourth quarter of 2014 reserve adjustment, the interest adjusted loss ratio has been 89.4% within the long term ratio of 85% to 90% that we expect. Adjusting for the impact of a large group case termination which impacted the loss ratio in the third quarter of 2016, this two year cumulative loss ratio would be 88.1%.", "I continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in the closed block, particularly in the long-term care line. The yields achieved on new money for the long-term care business have consistently exceeded the assumptions we've built into our reserves. Also, we continue to make good progress in achieving rate increase in our in force long term care business. We received some notable approvals recently and continue to make good progress against the assumptions we use in our reserves. The landing spot whereby a policy holder can avoid a rate increase by electing to slowdown the policy benefit inflation rate has been viewed favorably by consumers and regulators alike. These actions combined with the underlying performance of the block improved the statutory results for the Fairwind captive. As a result, we\u2019ve been able to maintain the strong capital position of Fairwind, while reducing the level of cast contributions for 2016 relative to 2015.", "So to summarize, our overall financial performance for the fourth quarter was outstanding, highlighted by good premium growth, favorable persistency trends, very good benefits experience overall and favorable expense trends. These trends in turn generated excellent statutory income. After-tax statutory operating income for the fourth quarter was 260.6 million, a 43% increase over the year ago quarter. For the full year, our after tax operating statutory income totaled 884.6 million for 2016, an increase of 28% over the 2015 total of 689.2 million. These results reflect our strong benefits experience across the majority of our business lines. ", "As you know, statutory results drive capital strength and free cash flow generation. We finished 2016 with a risk-based capital ratio for our traditional US insurance companies in excess of 400%. This strong 2016 statutory earnings will result in increased dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and will allow us to continue to build holding company cash next year. Our holding company\u2019s cash position totaled 594 million at year end 2016, which was slightly ahead of our Investor Day outlook. We repurchased $103 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter and our full year repurchases totaled 403 million.", "Looking now in investment results, new money yields have improved since the election in early November. While the ten year and thirty year US Treasuries rallied by 85 basis points and 75 basis points respectively during the fourth quarter, we've seen some giveback as corporate bond spreads are somewhat tighter. All considered, we're feeling better about the environment for new money yields. ", "So in summing up 2016, we reported after tax operating income per share of $3.92, an increase of 7.7% over 2015. This exceeded our outlook for the year for growth of 3% to 6%, primarily due to strong operating performance across many of our businesses, which more than offset the negative impact from the decline in interest rates in the British pound. All three of our core business segments showed year-over-year growth in before-tax operating income for the full year 2016 with Unum US increasing 7.6%, Unum UK increasing 3% in local currency and Colonial Life increasing 1.6%.", "As we outlined for you at our outlook meeting back in December, our outlook for growth in 2017 also calls for growth in after-tax operating income per share of 3% to 6%. I\u2019d say that our view on earnings potential for 2017 has not changed, but with our outperformance in the fourth quarter and the higher starting point for earnings going into 2017, we would be looking for growth rate to be a little lower in that range as we begin the year. To wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. It was an outstanding year. We are executing very well on our strategies with focus on maintaining pricing discipline, generating strong persistence in growth in our core business segments, delivering on renewals to maintain our profit margins and meeting new money yield targets for the long-term care. This success gives us a great foundation to continue to build and grow upon as we move into 2017.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Jack. We'll now move to your questions and as I conclude our prepared remarks, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with our overall results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. I'm encouraged by the positive momentum we have going into 2017 which will serve us well as we manage through the year.", "So let me now ask the operator to begin the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "I have two questions. First on the US business, if you could just discuss the operating environment and whether you are starting to see a benefit from wage inflation and hiring in your numbers. And also just how pricing trends were as you went through renewal season for the past year? And then secondly on UK, how susceptible do you think your business is to Brexit and the like potential workforce reduction at some of the large financial services companies, whether you\u2019ve seen it already or are you expecting that and how much is it - of that is baked into your guidance for \u201917?", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Jimmy. Let Mike start with the view on the US market.", "Mike Simonds", "Thanks and good morning Jimmy. So, two parts to your question I'd say, we continue to see a nice gradual increase to the tailwind of natural growth that shows up just straight directly into premium on the employer funded business and it shows up in our voluntary plans as well where we had really strong re-enrollment results for the fall and headed into 2017. I think in terms of the market, to the second part of your question, first and foremost for us is the ability to renew our existing client base and we saw persistency just north of 90% in the group lines again. And we\u2019re able to hit our pricing targets through the renewal cycle, so we feel very good about that. Encouraged to see little over 8% sales growth as well, now a good chunk of that came from existing client sales both cross-selling and enrollment. But the very smallest end of the market, small case group insurance we actually saw an increase year-over-year on new client sales those are the shortest sales cycle clients and so that's probably the most current view. And as we mentioned at the outlook meeting, this is the first year in a few where we're not going in with new business price increases on the group side. So reasonably optimistic that we've got a rational marketplace out there probably tempered just a bit by the mid market which remains quite competitive.", "Rick McKenney", "Probably maybe we'll go over to Tim Arnold at Colonial Life to hear his view on the market as well.", "Tim Arnold", "Thanks Rick, we're encouraged by the growth we're seeing in the small case market especially, the employment growth and the wage inflation also helps us when we go back out to reenroll an existing client. We have employees who are earning more and maintain more income protection and more protection through some of our other products as well. So we're optimistic about the environment.", "Rick McKenney", "And you\u2019re second question was on UK Brexit, Peter O'Donnell, do you want to hit on both what we're seeing today and then how we're thinking about that going into \u201917.", "Peter O'Donnell", "Yeah, thanks for the question, so in terms of what we've seen in 2016 is basically a slight slowdown. So you've seen in our premium numbers that we had very strong sales, we also saw very strong persistency, but wage growth was relatively weak as was employment growth and we think that business investment is sort of damp at the moment and people are being cautious about the future. What we haven't seen is a significant exodus and what I'd say is that's quite unlikely moving large parts of complicated financial services to the EU is incredibly complex and high risk you know. So if you move from our derivatives trading, it's hugely complicated to manage and regulate. And the city of London remains a good place to do business. What we are hearing from some of our clients is they may set up some offshore sites where they will move some jobs but relatively low at the moment to enable them to sort of continue trading in Europe, but we're not seeing any indication of any mass exodus at the moment. So I think in our outlook what we factored in was really a continuation of what we saw in 2016. We think wage growth will remain slow even with inflation going up and we also think that people will be cautious about business investment until we\u2019re clear on the exact Brexit implications.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And financial services as a percentage of your premium base in the market, is it, I think it's about 20%, 25%.", "Peter O'Donnell", "Yeah, it\u2019s around 20%, but it's spread across a lot of non-investment banks, so we would have a lot of the retail banks that will be very UK oriented. So it\u2019s not quite as significant as that when you sort of look at what's truly affected. And you think about industries exporters, they were also exposed you\u2019re going to do well because of weak sterling. The tech sector stay well over here, so we got a pretty balanced portfolio really.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll take our next question from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "Could you talk about the Starmount acquisition just thinking about how the sales would be distributed over the four quarters, it's obviously making a nice contribution, dental and vision there. I think you did a 10 million in new sales in the quarter. How should we think about that number for next year in terms of overall sales and how would it be distributed through the year.", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah Mark, we appreciate the question, we're very excited to have Starmount as part of the fold and how that fit strategically with us. And I'm sure they\u2019re listening in, many of our new employees there, so we certainly welcome them. Mike you want to talk about our outlook and how we see the business overall?", "Mike Simonds", "Yeah, good morning Mark, delighted to talk about Starmount. So the way I think about it is what you see in the fourth quarter is the Starmount branded and Starmount distributed results. We are now in the market as of the first of January with Unum branded dental and vision products and so I would expect that the sales would ramp up through the course of the year as we bring it out to initially about half of the 50 states and begin to bring Unum sales people and client managers to bear on the portfolio. The seasonality of the business will track with our group insurance more broadly, so you'll see in general fourth quarter being our strongest sales quarter which is another reason why it will ramp up as we go through the year.", "Mark Hughes", "And then the - when we think about the sales outlook for Colonial, double digit growth for the full year kind of high-single digits in the fourth quarter when you look at the kind of your recruiting, your pipeline let's say, how do you think we should look at 2017.", "Rick McKenney", "Tim?", "Tim Arnold", "Yeah, thanks Mark. We are optimistic about 2017, the leading indicator is that we evaluate for ourselves progress are all turning favorably, the recruiting that we experienced in 2016 was strong and above our internal plans. The growth in our sales offices was also very strong. Growth and sales measures are very strong and we continue to see great opportunity in the marketplace. ", "Rick McKenney", "I would add that we\u2019re actually making investments in the expansion of our footprint in the Colonial Life salesforce and are very encouraged by recent success there and we\u2019ll continue to do that in 2017 and beyond.", "Operator", "Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Seth Weiss from Bank of America.", "Seth Weiss", "Just wanted to follow up on the reinsurance transaction and supplemental involuntary. And sorry if I missed this in the prepared commentary that $25 million impact on premium offset on the expense line, should we expect that to be ongoing or is that just something unique to this quarter.", "Jack McGarry", "I would expect it to be ongoing that's the seated premium. The benefit in expense piece that offset is ceding commissions as well as some risk sharing. So I would look at that as affecting those lines at that level but having no material impact on really the operating income of the line and just improving the capital efficiency.", "Seth Weiss", "And if we think about your topline guidance that was given for 2017, should we just adjust that down accordingly or was that contemplated the reinsurance transaction when you gave that guidance.", "Jack McGarry", "That would have been in there.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Sean Dargan", "At the December Investor Day, Jack mentioned the possibility of basically paying another party to come up with a LTC solution and you did build the cash balance at the holding company. I'm just wondering if you've gotten any closer, have you have any more insight about what type of appetite there might be from traditional or nontraditional counterparties?", "Rick McKenney", "Jack you want to hit on that?", "Jack McGarry", "It is a complex thing with long-term care. I would say we're not imminent in terms of having a solution. The rise in interest rates certainly helps the bid ask spread and that you know so we continue to be active in the market we continue to talk to people we continue to work with our regulators. It\u2019s clearly something we've focused a lot of attention on, but I wouldn't say that anything imminent.", "Rick McKenney", "And to add to that Sean, you also talked about the increasing cash position and capital build up that we have and I wouldn't equate those two, but Jack maybe you want to talk about our capital generation where it is today and how we're thinking about it?", "Jack McGarry", "So we feel really good about our year-end capital position based on extremely strong statutory earnings that we had in 2016 which will drive 2017 dividends. We expect that position to continue to build. As we look at our capital position I\u2019d say our uses for it have remained very consistent that\u2019s continuing to invest in our core businesses. We\u2019ll continue to look at the M&A market for our opportunities. We continue look at our dividends and support our dividends and continue to maintain our payout ratios. And then finally we look at share repurchase. Our stock price is run up, but we will tend to be very consistent and predictable in our share repurchase and capital plans. We're not going to overreact to current stock prices. Actually we still feel that at $46 a share that our stock is a good investment and that we will put money into. And we will be building cash this year and would expect to build cash into the future as well. We will be looking very closely at what to do about it. There's a lot of unanswered questions out there on interest rates, tax reform, the economic environment, but as we get more clarity about where those things are going to land and take stock of where we are, expect we will be communicating more in the future about our capital plans.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Billingsley from Compass Point.", "Ken Billingsley", "I had questions, one on the investment portfolio looking at the balance sheet. Total investments from third quarter and fourth quarter were down about 2 billion, looks like reserves were off, were down 1.5 billion and then the AICO adjustment was 500 million. Was this related to the reserve, I\u2019m sorry the reinsurance transaction or could you just explain to me what the moving parts were?", "Jack McGarry", "That had more to do mark to market basis in the balance sheet with the rising interest rates we saw in the third quarter. Reserves were down but the market value of assets were down a commensurate amount.", "Ken Billingsley", "But not a connection between something that happened from a reserve?", "Jack McGarry", "No, it\u2019s nothing in the underlying performance of the business or the reserve level.", "Rick McKenney", "Or the reinsurance [indiscernible].", "Jack McGarry", "From a book value perspective things were pretty consistent.", "Ken Billingsley", "And my next question, having - I\u2019d just you guys to look back to 2013, I'm just trying to get an idea of what you think ACA reform may have on the impact of sales and persistency and looking back at 2013, I guess that was the year before the mandate went into place. There was a decline at Unum US and Colonial Life and nearly every segment for sales and persistency. Now it bounced back in 2014. Was this a distraction for customers as they were focused on what was going on with ACA and could we see that in the future as reform is in place and they have to focus on how it's going to back their business maybe less focused on employee benefits.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Ken. We'll start with Mike and then we\u2019ll go over going to Colonial Life.", "Mike Simonds", "Ken, you have an excellent memory, 2013, we absolutely did see markets freeze up a bit as employers and their advisors tried to sort through the implications of ACA, a small tweak to the commentary though, it was a slowdown in sales, persistency was actually strong through the period because business didn't tend to move. As we look into 2017, you are right, there is uncertainty around the administration and the future of the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s something that we're watching really closely. I'd say though on balance, we're quite optimistic that we won't see a slowdown like we did back in 2013. It seems more unlikely given the fact that we will be unwinding requirements versus putting new complex requirements in place. So in that regard it's likely to be less disruptive. And I say in general as you\u2019re unwinding, employers are slow to make broad-based benefits changes unless they're compelled to by new regulations. So I can see a more conducive environment than we saw back in 2013. Now Tim, I don't know if you got a view on Colonial Life.", "Tim Arnold", "I agree with that Mike, the slowdown on Colonial Life sales in the third quarter of 2013 was also amplified by the fact that we were making a number of changes in our distribution system and leadership which have helped us become more effective but created a little bit of a slowdown in that same period when ACA was being implemented. So like Mike, we are pretty optimistic that any changes at this point would be less impactful. The need for America's workers to have the kinds of benefits that we offer has never been greater. We've talked to you guys before about the 30% of American households have no life insurance and significant under-insurance and disability increasing medical deductibles which all play in our favor as we think about the marketplace.", "Operator", "And at this time that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you. We appreciate the questions this morning. I think that it\u2019s a little bit reflective that we had a very straightforward and very positive quarter which was a great wrap to the year. So we thank you for all for taking the time to join us this morning. We also look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks. We're going to be quite active out in the market at various investor events over the next several weeks and look forward to telling you our story in greater detail as we do that. So I appreciate the time and we'll talk to you soon. Operator, that now completes the fourth quarter 2016 earnings call.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tom White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Tom White", "Great, thank you, Jennie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2017 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and our subsequently filed Form 10-Q. Our SEC filings can be found in the Investor section of our website at unum.com.", "Also, I'll remind you that statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements and a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation, can be found in our statistical supplement on our website also in the Investor section.", "Participating in this morning's conference call are Unum's President and CEO, Rick McKenney; CFO, Jack McGarry; as well as the CEOs of our business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum U.S., Peter O'Donnell for Unum U.K., Tim Arnold for Colonial Life, and Steve Zabel for the Closed Block.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Rick for his opening comments.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone.", "The second quarter was another excellent quarter for our company. The positive business trends and favorable momentum we have been experiencing over the past several quarters continue through this one as well.", "Our after-tax operating income per share was $1.05, another in a series of record highs for our company and a very healthy increase of 7% relative to last year's second quarter. For the first half of 2017 our after-tax operating income per share increased just over 8%.", "This performance exceeds our expectations coming into the year of growth of 3% to 6% and as a result, we are increasing our outlook for the growth in the operating income per share to a range of 5% to 8% for the full year 2017. Jack will discuss the drivers of this performance in a moment.", "Our financial performance remains very well balanced across our business segments. Unum U.S. and Colonial Life continue to produce very strong results with good sales momentum fueling the company's 6% premium growth adjusted for the individual disability reinsurance arrangement and FX.", "In addition, we continue to see favorable benefits experience and well-managed expenses. Our Unum U.K. results continue to run slightly below our expectations, driven by the challenging U.K. economy, but I would highlight that Unum U.K. continues to produce strong margins and an operating return on equity in the 15% to 16% range.", "And finally, the Closed Block operations were stable again this quarter. When you bring it altogether, our capital generation was excellent, allowing us to raise dividend by 15% buy back $100 million of stock while still building on our excess capital position.", "Our first half results are a continuation of the solid momentum we have built coming into the year and our focus on the disciplined execution of our business plan. Our strategy has kept us in step with the changes occurring in the employee benefits market and the investments we're making in our business as part of that strategy are clearly paying off.", "Our recent acquisitions of dental businesses in the U.K. and in the U.S., have given us a foothold in the dental market, which is a natural extension of our business. Colonial Life's territory expansion work is also showing positive trends towards accelerating the rate of sales and premium growth for that business.", "And our emphasis on improving the customer experience across the enterprise has made us easier to do business with, while leading to better and more efficient ways of operating. More broadly, our singular focus and continued reinvestment in the employee benefits market continues to be an advantage for us and is unique among our peers.", "As an example, as the market has shifted more and more towards employee engagement and shared funding, our business model has kept pace. The scale of our business is also increasingly an advantage. It gives us depth of data in the pricing of new business, scaled operations in the administration of our in-force business and industry-leading management of clients.", "And finally, the strength of our combined Unum U.S. U.K. and Colonial Life distribution systems provide unique reach into the broker and business-to-business benefits marketplace, allowing us to effectively serve employers of all sizes and industries.", "Equally important driving results in the execution of our strategy are the quality of our people and the strength of our culture. Because of our ability to deliver on the promises we make to customers and shareholders, rest with our employees, we continue to ensure they have the tools, technology and training to exceed expectations.", "We also understand the benefits of building a more diverse workforce and while we're proud of where we are, we still have opportunity as we build out our culture of inclusion. It's a business imperative as we look to mirror our customer base and serve an increasingly diverse workforce.", "At the same time, social responsibility is important to us, in particular our commitment to making our communities better is a cornerstone of our business. Last year alone, we contributed nearly $13 million and our employees volunteered more than 87,000 hours to charitable organizations throughout the U.S. U.K. and Ireland.", "And finally, we continue to elevate our stature as a voice for our industry, building partnerships with industry groups and policymakers that can move us closer to our goal of protecting the financial security of more working people and their families.", "Now I'll turn it over Jack take on some of the details of the quarter, Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "Thank you, Rick and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high-level overview of our second quarter results and I will provide a more in-depth view of the themes we're seeing in our business.", "Overall, the second quarter was an outstanding one for Unum. Our after-tax operating income per share of $1.05 is an increase of 7.1% over the year ago quarter. We continue to experience strong balance between the operational performance drivers of our earnings per share growth and the capital management drivers.", "Our after-tax operating income increased 3.2% to $240.4 million for the second quarter while our share repurchase activity contributed 3.9% to our after-tax operating income per share growth relative to last year.", "Our before-tax operating income increased 5.6%, while our tax rate was higher this year at 32% compared to 30.4% in the year ago quarter. Our Unum U.S. business segment continues to be the biggest driver of this performance. Before-tax operating income for this segment increased by 9.1% over last year to $247.8 million.", "Within Unum U.S., group disability had another outstanding quarter with before-tax operating income of $92.4 million an increase of approximately 24% relative to last year. This growth in operating income was primarily driven by a strong improvement in the benefit ratio from 80% in the second quarter of 2016 to 76.5% this quarter.", "The benefit ratio includes a 50-basis point reduction in the discount rate for new claim incurrals that we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and remains within the 76% to 79% range that we communicated to you at the December Investor Meeting.", "The favorable performance this quarter was primarily driven by lower incidence trends in the group LTD product line and lower prevalence rates in the group STD product line. Group disability premium income increased by 1.2% over the year-ago quarter as the benefit from recent quarter sales offset slightly lower persistency.", "The group Life and AD&D line produced a strong quarter with operating income of $60.9 million in the second quarter and increase of 7% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 4.4% over the year-ago quarter and the benefit ratio improved to 70.6% in the quarter compared to 71.5% last year, primarily driven by lower average claim size.", "The supplemental and voluntary lines contributed $94.5 million to the earnings this quarter, a decline of 1.5% relative to last year. Premium income continues to grow at a healthy pace increasing 10.5% in the second quarter compared to last year.", "I'll note that we executed a reinsurance transaction in the individual disability line in the fourth quarter of 2016 and this transaction lowered revenues by about $25 million, which was offset by a reduction in the sum of benefits, commissions and expenses of about $25 million.", "This results in a slight elevation of the benefit ratio, but no material impact on the operating income of the line. Underlying performance in the individual disability line was favorable relative to last year as new claims in this line were lower.", "Our voluntary benefits business continues to show good growth trends with premium income increasing 5.6% for the second quarter. The benefit ratio was slightly higher at 43.4% compared to 42.4% in the year-ago second quarter as benefits experienced in the light product line was less favorable.", "Also, the acquisition of Starmount contributed $41.2 million in dental and vision premium income to the supplemental and voluntary lines.", "Sales in the Unum U.S. segment for the second quarter increased by 10.7% over last year with notable strength in the voluntary benefits large case segment and the group core market segment. Voluntary benefit sales in total increased by 10.7% for the second quarter as large case sales improved by 15%.", "For our group product lines, overall sales increased 4.6% over last year with our core market segment increasing by 5.7%, a nice improvement over recent quarters. The addition of the dental and vision product lines increased sales this quarter by $10.4 million and we're very pleased with the productivity being generated in this product line.", "Persistency for our group product lines and Unum U.S. remained lower than the year ago levels, but improved relative to the first quarter levels and remain well within our expectations.", "Unum U.K. continues to operate in a challenging economic environment brought on by last year's Brexit vote. Second quarter before tax operating earnings reflected this challenge declining by 12.1% to \u00a322.6 million compared to \u00a325.7 million in the year ago quarter.", "Our premium income grew by 1% in the second quarter in local currency as favorable sales and renewal trends were largely offset by pressure on the in-force block. This trend is likely to continue as the U.K. works through the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.", "The Unum U.K. benefit ratio was 75.6% for the second quarter compared to 70.1% in the year ago quarter driven by higher inflation in the U.K. this quarter relative to last year. Higher inflation impacts the inflation linked benefits in certain of our products, but this is likely offset by higher net investment income generated from inflation index-linked bonds, we hold back these benefits.", "The benefit ratio was also impacted by the 80-basis point reduction to our discount rate for new claims, which we implemented in the first quarter and I expect this to continue to pressure year-over-year earnings growth for the second half of 2017.", "The underlying risk experience was unfavorable for the Group's long-term disability product line due to lower claim resolutions, while group life performance was favorable driven by a lower volume of new claims.", "The pressure on earnings we're experiencing in Unum U.K. is likely to continue for the second half of the year and repeating though that even with these growth challenges, the Unum U.K. segment continues to generate very good profit margins and an operating return on equity in the 15% to 16% range.", "Despite the economic headwinds, Unum U.K. sales for the second quarter were very strong increasing 24% relative to last year in local currency. This increase was primarily driven by its success in the dental and group critical illness product lines.", "Our group LTD sales were down for the second quarter, following a very strong first quarter. Overall persistency for our U.K. segment is in line with the year ago and improved from the first quarter of 2017 and is also in line with expectations.", "Moving to Colonial Life, we again had an excellent quarter with strong consistent and stable results. Operating income increased 5% to $81.8 million in the second quarter. Premium income growth continues to build momentum, increasing 7.1% for the quarter, driven by the strong sales trends we've seen over the past several years.", "Colonial Life's benefits experience remained generally in line with our recent trends as well as our expectations with a benefit ratio of 51.3% for the second quarter compared to 51.1% in the year ago quarter. In the second quarter, we also completed our deck reviews for our Unum U.S. and Colonial Life businesses with minimal impact on year-over-year results.", "Sales momentum for Colonial Life continues to be very strong, increasing 7.5% in the second quarter. Sales growth in the core commercial market segments was a big driver of this performance, increasing 13% in the second quarter, following growth of 13.2% in the first quarter.", "We also continue to see good balance with new account sales increasing 16.7% in the quarter, while sales to existing accounts increased by 3%. Persistency for Colonial Life remained stable at 78.7%.", "Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $32.6 million in the second quarter of 2017, in line with the year ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 82.3% in the second quarter, compared to 84.3% in the year ago quarter.", "The improvement was primarily due to the reduction in the claim reserve discount rate in the year ago quarter to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher levels of phone call and tenders realized.", "For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 89.4% for the second quarter, compared to the year ago ratio of 92.6%. This improvement was driven primarily by lower claims incidents relative to last year's second quarter.", "Looking at interest rates and new money yields for the long-term care portfolio, we continue to exceed our new money yield objective of 5% in the second quarter. With these strong operating results across the company, we again generated very strong statutory income with after-tax statutory operating income for the second quarter totaling $225.2 million.", "Over the past four quarters, we generated $877 million of after-tax statutory operating income, which is driving excellent capital strength for the company. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies is in excess of 395% and our holding company's cash position excluding amounts committed for subsidiary contributions has increased to $757 million at quarter end compared to a year-end 2016 total of $594 million.", "Our capital position and cash generation capability are a source of great strength for the company. It provides us tremendous financial flexibility to grow and invest in our business, while we continue to generate shareholder value by returning excess capital to our shareholders.", "Again, in the second quarter, we repurchased 100 million of our shares consistent with the trend of past several quarters and in line with our outlook for the year. I'll also remind you that at our Annual Board Meeting in May, we raised our common stock dividend by 15%.", "Moving now to investment results. interest rates and corporate bond spreads were both somewhat tied during the second quarter. Despite this time the challenge this presents we continue to maintain healthy interest reserve margins in our U.S. LTD product line and meet the new money yield assumptions for long-term care.", "In addition, our investment quality remains in very good shape. Our exposure to retail investments and asset class increasingly under scrutiny lately is very manageable and well below industry average exposures.", "Wrapping up, I'm very pleased with the second quarter and our first half performance for the company. Given our strong first half operating results, we're increasing our outlook for after-tax operating income per share growth for the full year 2017 from our original range of 3% to 6% to a new range of 5% to 8%.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, Jack. As you can tell, we are very pleased with second quarter and our first half results. At the same time, we\u2019re also very encouraged by the financial position of the company and our strategic position in the Employee Benefits marketplace and we are looking forward to the second half of 2017.", "We will now move on to your questions. I\u2019ll ask Jenny to begin the question-and-answer session. Jenny?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will hear first from Seth Weiss of Bank of America.", "Rick McKenney", "We can\u2019t hear you very well.", "Seth Weiss", "I am sorry. Do you hear me or no.", "Rick McKenney", "That is better enough.", "Seth Weiss", "Thank you. Expanding on the U.K. and the pressure that you classified there. Would you classify this primarily as a function of lower interest rates and the lower discount rate or are you seeing adverse claims pressures there given maybe by employment trends similar to what we may see in the U.S.?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. It\u2019s a little bit of both. We do have pressure from the discount rate. We also saw actually in the first quarter and the second quarter, some volatility and underlying risk results. The first quarter was driven by higher average claim sizes and good disability, that the second quarter was driven by claim resolutions.", "We continue to think that most of that volatility and would expect things to level out over the year. But again, I think most of it is growth issue relative to the economy as well as lower interest rates.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay, great. Just a follow-up question on the timing of the cash position in cash means. So, with the cash position up over $150 million from the year end level. Is there perhaps an opportunity to accelerate share repurchase or you holding a little bit of maybe added buffer at the hold code for cash contributions or any other timing needs?", "Jack McGarry", "As we mentioned at our December outlook. We expected that we would generate additional cash in 2017. WE thought it was prudent given the kind of the uncertainty around tax legislation and other things to hold that buffer. We don't expect that\u2019s a permanent thing that we need to do and we anticipate giving a lot clearer guidance about future capital on plans at our coming December investor meeting.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay. Thank you for the answers.", "Rick McKenney", "Great. Thanks, Seth.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Suneet Kamath of Citi.", "Suneet Kamath", "Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to start with Unum U.S. just looking at the persistency there. It looks like you are down maybe 160 basis points first half of \u201817 versus first half of \u201916. Just wondering what the outlook there is, maybe when do you think persistency could stabilize or are you okay at these levels?", "Rick McKenney", "Mike?", "Mike Simonds", "Sure. Good morning, Suneet, it\u2019s Mike. Yes, persistency is down. If you recall we talked a little bit about the abnormally high persistency that we had last couple of years actually, and so, where we find yourself today is actually well within what we would we see as historical norms.", "That being said, we were encouraged to see a little bit of an improvement in 2Q over the first quarter of this year and probably most importantly we feel really good about the underwriting approach through the renewal process. So, to give you a sense of the business that we lost ran about nine points worse profitability perspective than the business that renewed through the cycle.", "So, continue to feel good in a competitive market that customer see real value in the Unum proposition. I'd certainly say, we\u2019re in a range that we\u2019re comfortable with and probably if there's any trajectory it\u2019s slightly positive.", "Suneet Kamath", "Got it. And then just maybe shifting to the U.K. given the potential for Brexit to impact various sectors. Can you give us a sense of maybe what your distribution is in terms of exposure to different corporate sectors particularly financial services?", "Rick McKenney", "We\u2019re going to Peter O\u2019Donnell for that. Peter?", "Peter O\u2019Donnell", "Thanks very much Suneet. We have a sort of reasonable portion of the business around 20% that\u2019s with financial services, but that covers quite a broad set of financial services. So, it cover local banks as well as those with international exposure.", "I think our view on Brexit is, what we\u2019re seeing as Jack referred to, on the economic pressure is that, the banks aren't adding jobs and where they are -- where they can they are subtracting jobs and that\u2019s what given us the pressure in the enforce.", "A number of the made announcements around transferring work, but it\u2019s quite small number of jobs to places like Frankfurt and Dublin. So, we\u2019re not seeing any significant shift of jobs as yet and no one's talking about that. What they are talking about is, perhaps cutting back on desks and things they were set up on and you know setting up small branch outlets are legal entity outlets allows them to trade overseas, those contingency plans.", "We need to watch that because obviously Brexit is still pretty uncertain exactly how it\u2019s going to work. So, it\u2019s import we get a deal. At the moment that's the kind of scale of the change we\u2019re seeing.", "Suneet Kamath", "Great. Thanks.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks, Suneet.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ryan Krueger of KBW.", "Ryan Krueger", "Thanks, good morning. I guess I had a follow-up. To the persistency\u2019s, it does seem like it\u2019s starting to get a bit better again sequentially, also had better sales in Unum U.S. this quarter. I guess just curious an update on competitive conditions and are things starting to improve a bit?", "Mike Simonds", "Ryan, I can take it. It\u2019s Mike. Good morning. I think read the good one. It remains a competitive market for sure, I sort of comment at the last question about some of the persistency losses that we've seen at very low margins to actual losses. So, competitive but we are encouraged. Sales were up 11% in the quarter.", "Importantly if you unpacked that a bit, core market sales were up 6%. We saw coverage count increase nicely in the quarter which is very encouraging as we turn toward the second half of the year.", "Voluntary benefit continues the to roll along up double digits at 11%. And importantly, while not a big contributor yet, the dental and vision lines are exceeding our expectations, which were pretty aggressive here for the first half, and usually when we are writing dental and vision that's coming package with other lines as well. So, that's been a nice contributor.", "Rick McKenney", "Let me talk a little bit formulation there. The market for voluntary benefits continues to grow broadly. So, there's a capacity for more competitors come into the space. We really like our value proposition across all of the market segments and we particularly like our ability which we believe is somewhat unique to serve all market segments with our field distribution system being an agency distribution system.", "We have a great reach across the U.S. across every segment and we can efficiently and effectively serve each segment. Jack, pointed out that our core market sales were up 13% again in the second quarter after 13.2 in the first quarter. We really like that segment and we think that our distribution system gives us a unique opportunity to reach it. So, we feel pretty good about the competitive environment.", "Ryan Krueger", "Thanks. And then follow-up for quite a number of years you\u2019ve been pushing through rate increases in Unum U.S. Are you still a little targeting in terms of mid-single-digit rate increases given kind of the strength and profitability in that business at that point?", "Rick McKenney", "I don\u2019t think, you can think about the pricing two ways. One is just good care and maintenance of the book of business. So, we will always have a good robust renewal plan in place where we\u2019re sort of calibrating to the risk experience at a client level and I wouldn't see that changing for the balance of this year or for the years to come.", "If you think about the aggregate pricing of the book, I think we\u2019re really well tethered to that, our point of view of what we've experienced in looking forward on the fundamentals of interest rate and new incidents and risk trends. So, say in aggregate we\u2019re in reasonable shape but with you ongoing care and feeding.", "Ryan Krueger", "Understood. Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Now, we will go to our next question from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, just if you can talk about your view on your long-term care, there is, I think you've been earning yield relatively close to what you'd assume but you are assuming a ramp up in the next few years in interest rates. So, what your confidence in reserve adequacy.", "Secondly, just if you can comment a little bit about the initial reception you\u2019ve seeng in the market to your getting into the medical stop loss product line and how -- what sort of the long-term potential do you see in that market?", "Rick McKenney", "I\u2019ll start out Jimmy. Jack, you want to talk about\u2026", "Jack McGarry", "So, from long-term care perspective we've actually exceeded our new money rate bogey in every quarter since we took a reserve charge at year-end 2014. You know that help build some margin relative to the initial reserve assumptions we do have interest rates increasing beginning soon and increasing over time where we\u2019re still hopeful. We will see that happen but time will tell in any case, we feel very comfortable with where we are right now.", "We would also note as we said many times that we have a good buffer between our statutory reserves and our GAAP reserves and so even if interest rates don't rise according to that projection. We feel comfortable that any of that would be a GAAP event as opposed to a capital event.", "Rick McKenney", "Mike, you want to take on stock op.", "Mike Simonds", "So, we officially entered the medical stop was market as of 71, taking proposals for 11-18 affective. WE are taking a slow entry into that market. But we do like it overall it", "So about $14 billion industry. It\u2019s growing at a low double-digit clip and importantly for us a lot of the same underlying fundamentals of understanding the data that goes into actuarial pricing translating that into good discipline case level underwriting having a field force that understands the importance of balanced growth and profitability.", "We feel like, we've got some capabilities to bring to bear in that market. Also, importantly it gets us insight into what employers planning to do with their overall employee benefits program earlier in the cycle. So, we get a good look at what the employee base looks like from health perspective as well as what we are planning to do with health plan design/ ", "Many if we not most of our products wrap around that health decisions. So, it\u2019s a good strategic insight at a case level. So, I don't expect we\u2019ll be talking about large impact to our P&L here in the next 12 to 24 months. In the long term, I think it's got the potential to be a nice business for us.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then lastly just on your higher EPS guidance. Can you give us a little bit more generally on what really caused -- decidedly beat this quarter how are you thinking about the next the second half of the year and is it more margin driven or premium driven the upside versus what you initially guided?", "Jack McGarry", "Yeah. I would say that beat this quarter is, both you know we have strong, strong premium growth, we saw BTOE grow both within Unum U.S. as well as colonial consistent with that premium growth that's what we've been shooting for a while now kind of fighting the headwinds of interest rates and other things we feel great about this quarter was just a really sound fundamental third quarter where contributed as the way we would owe in any gives us no optimism as we go into the second half of the year.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go to our next question from Thomas Gallagher of Evercore ISI morning.", "Thomas Gallagher", "So, Jack, in terms of thinking about capital management, you\u2019ve been generating more, more than you been spending on buybacks and dividends, building whole co-cash and I know you mentioned short of taking a wait-and-see approach based on tax reform et cetera.", "But if we sort of fast-forward to next year's plan and assume you keep building at a similar rate issued in the first half would that be enough of an offer where you could then at least commit to 2018 higher cash flow being committed to the higher buybacks and dividends.", "Is that sort of the way to think about that you\u2019re -- the reason for accelerating the buyback now is more building a bluffer in case there is tax reform. And from that point of forward, you would be able to use something or is it more multi varied than that?", "Rick McKenney", "So we have a buffer now, but we\u2019re extremely pleased with statutory earning that we\u2019ve been generating 225 million this quarter. That's been consistent \u201816 and \u201817 that builds free cash flow generation. We\u2019re not in a position where we think we\u2019re going to build a cash buffer forever.", "So, we need to decide you know and understand. We need decide what to do with that capital. We expect to make that decision at the end of this year. And so, we have excess capital and we will we will put that to work. We\u2019re not going to save it forever.", "Thomas Gallagher", "And with buybacks\u2026", "Rick McKenney", "I think timeframe 2018 as Jack said, over the course this year. But just to reiterate what Jack said. We have good capital buffers. But we will make sure that we are using that capital effectively and also to the advantage of shareholders.", "Thomas Gallagher", "And so, would buyback be the most logical source of you know if you do end up moving to a higher level?", "Rick McKenney", "Let me remind you of our capital management philosophy, the first thing we want to do is grow our organic businesses and make sure we're investing in those. The second thing we would look at from a party perspective is mergers and acquisitions and being able to increase our shareholder value through those.", "Third, we look at dividend. We increased our dividend 15% this year which is continuation of the of a trend of increasing dividend. And the final thing, we will look at a share repurchase but in the absence of you know an acquisition opportunity or some other event I think share repurchase would be a reasonable place to the use our excess capital.", "Thomas Gallagher", "Just curious, if you guys have spent any time on NAIC developments regarding the long-term care transfer solutions and some potential there and what your thoughts are?", "Rick McKenney", "Steve Zabel, will answer that.", "Steve Zabel", "Thanks, Tom. We have been tracking activity there. I would say it\u2019s very early days. I know there was a meeting recently with the LTC task force. Those types of discussions have gone on before the NAIC. Never really got any traction as you can imagine that be a pretty complicated structure to try to put in place.", "But we will continue to track it. Definitely would not be a priority item for us as we\u2019re thinking about our action plan. So, we continue to work the initiative that we have and we\u2019ll continue to monitor it. But I think it\u2019s pretty early days.", "Thomas Gallagher", "And then just one final question. Should we still think of the U.K. as being a source of cash flow for the next few years. When I heard you describe what's happening in the environment, to me it sounds like an earnings issue, not capital issue, not a balance sheet issue. Even if things got a lot worse on the claim side. I still wouldn\u2019t view that really as a balance sheet issue. But just wanted to confirm that?", "Rick McKenney", "Tom, this is Rick. I think that\u2019s certainly the case. So, what we\u2019ve talk about the U.K. the pressures, we\u2019re having are about growth pressures. The capital flow has been very consistent. We\u2019ve been taking dividends from the U.K. for a long period of time. That\u2019s been stable. The team here did a great of working to solvency too.", "So, we gone through the regulatory changes. Still able to grow capital to the company. So, this is not a capital discussion. It\u2019s one of growth and it\u2019s one of the great business that we would like to continue to grow. We\u2019re just feeling the headwinds of Brexit in the U.K. economy.", "Operator", "And then moving on we will hear next from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners.", "Humphrey Lee", "Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Looking at U.S. group visibility on the writing, continues to be very good. When I think about -- when I think about the performance. Do you think is a reflection of your price and risk discipline and claims management.", "So, without asking for kind of any update you guidance, do you think you are enjoying the full benefits of all the things that you've put in place and all the pricing that you are ready to put through or do you feel like there is some more room to levers to extract more margin?", "Mike Simonds", "It\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. Very consistent with the guidance we gave you guys heading into the year. We just got to the lower end of that range quicker and that's how I would describe what's driving that on the underlying.", "I\u2019d say, we would have seen ourselves sort of probably more gradually moving down through that range to the course of this year that\u2019s as a reflection of the underwriting approach being sure that we\u2019re price for interest rates and incidents in the like.", "I would say getting to the range quicker is the volatility which has been favorable for us particularly around new long-term disability incidents.", "Humphrey Lee", "And then just looking at your overall businesses, everything seems to be humming along pretty nicely. Just kind of thinking ahead, do you see anything that is on the horizon that could peak your interest, peak your cautious kind of, looking a little bit longer term?", "Rick McKenney", "There is lot of things that peak our interest. As we look longer term, first of all, reaffirm what you said, the business is run extremely well, it\u2019s broad-based, the team is doing a great job. We\u2019re going to continue to be focused on that. Our plans are still good and aggressive as we look out over the next 18 months and beyond.", "We\u2019re going to pursue those plans, certainly thinking about where the future opportunities. But we don\u2019t rest and I think that\u2019s the important thing. We are always looking beyond what changing, what's emerging in our world in the employee benefits world, in the world of technology that we need to take advantage of.", "So, at the same time we\u2019re executing well today, we\u2019re investing for the future. So that\u2019s what you'd expect of us and that's what we\u2019re doing. But we are happy with how the businesses performing today. But to be performing in the next year and the year after that, we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re constantly looking to the future.", "Mike Simonds", "Humphrey, I think good examples of that would be our investment in dental business, dental and vision businesses in both the U.K. and the U.S. and our entry into the stop loss market, on both we view as tremendous growth opportunities for the company.", "Humphrey Lee", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Eric Bass of Autonomous Research.", "Eric Bass", "Just wanted to talk a little bit about voluntary benefits. I was hoping you could talk about the penetration rates for voluntary both in terms of the adoption by employers as well as the number of employees who are electing voluntary benefits?", "Rick McKenney", "We see both the adoption rates at the employer level and at the consumer level improving. The dynamics in the industry that create need, haven\u2019t changed, in fact, we\u2019re accelerating. So, more employers are moving to high deductible healthcare plans. We\u2019ve shared statistics with you in the past. Roughly 40% of America's workers have adequate life insurance and disability insurance. So, there is huge opportunity there.", "As employers are looking to continue to pass on cost to employees for benefits, they are increasingly looking at voluntary solutions. Our broker partners are increasingly looking to voluntary solutions as an opportunity to supplement their income as they\u2019ve seen their income from health insurance backup. So, we're excited about the opportunities. We think that the penetration rates both employer and consumer level continue to increase.", "Mike Simonds", "Talk about Unum U.S.", "Rick McKenney", "What I would add to Tim\u2019s comment which is within voluntary benefits, maybe two categories of products with more traditional employee benefit lines, life insurance, dental, vision insurance, so, we see penetration of those benefits pretty high once you get over 100 employees. So, you'd be up in the 75% to 85% range.", "What\u2019s happening there though is more-more of the premium is going to employee base is becoming a more voluntary benefit. So, things like the Starmount acquisition, that's exciting to us because we bring those employee paid abilities into a well-established, highly penetrated business.", "And then the other half is what Tim is speaking to the supplemental health products that wrap around health insurance as those deductibles go up. So, really strong growth but a lot of runway left in terms of penetration in lines like critical illness, accident, hospital indemnity. ", "Eric Bass", "Thank you. And can you also just quantify what the natural growth trends for premiums are both in the U.S. and U.K. businesses?", "Mike Simonds", "Yeah, maybe I'll start and this is Mike on the U.S., in the U.S. it's the continuation of what we've seen over the last several quarters. So, a little bit of job growth, a little bit of wage increase probably not as aggressive as we would like to see in that 1% to 1/2% tailwind to us in our traditional group insurance businesses.", "Rick McKenney ", "And Peter, do you want to touch on the natural growth trends in the U.K.?", "Peter O'Donnell", "Yeah. So, as I said referred to earlier, it's split actually between our larger clients which would be 1,000 plus employees 2,000 plus where what we've seen is we would normally see around 2% 2% to 3% natural growth we're seeing slight negative minus 1%.", "It hasn\u2019t gone through to the smaller markets, the SME as such we call it, which is under 1,000 and it's a little bit sectoral as well because if you're exporters, you're doing better than if you're exposed to the local market.", "Eric Bass", "Great. Thank you.", "Rick McKenney", "Thanks Eric.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Nadel of Credit Suisse", "John Nadel", "All right. Good morning, everybody. Mike, I found one of your comments I think it was in response to an earlier question, pretty interesting. I think you were talking about the portion of the block that had not renewed had them I guess it's the margin -- I'm assuming it's a margin of about nine points lower than the portion that had renewed.", "Could you just dive into that a little bit more? Do I have that right that it's nine points on the margin or is it -- how do we think about that?", "Mike Simonds", "So, if we look at what's the terminated premium and where did that business run relative to the active, that comes through the renewal cycle and process. There is a ninth point spread between the two and let me just add a little color.", "Where we feel that most acutely is in, I would describe the midmarket, I would say 100 employees up to 2,000 employees that's where we see the most competition. You have carriers that focus at the small end that are trying to move up into that midmarket, carriers that have traditionally been in a very large employer space investing to try to move down and gets pretty choppy there in the middle.", "It was nine point spread in total, but the business that we lost in that midmarket was actually at a loss and a notable loss. So those are typically being taken at enforced rates. We're looking to move them up and someone's willing to take them on where they're sitting currently.", "John Nadel", "And just as a -- is that 100 different cases? Is it a 1,000 different? How big is that piece? Would we be able to actually see it, if it showed up at one competitor, I'm assuming it doesn't show up at just one, but if it did, would we be able to actually see it?", "Mike Simonds", "I think you'd see it come through. We've got a pretty decent market share in that mid but still it's going to be in the 12% to 15% market share range. So, there's business moving that's certainly not coming just from Unum.", "So, it will be hard to draw it linearly, but John we've talked about it in the past. Anytime in the group insurance space, you see a carrier that outgrows the market out of multiple for an extended period of time. It is usually a lag effect to a pretty significant loss ratio hit.", "John Nadel", "You know, I am in agreement on that. Thank you, Mike. The only other question I have is Jack, this is about 10 quarters now since the long-term care charge at the end of '14 and an update on the next several years pass of targeted new money yields and then the increase thereafter.", "Can you just -- I know you've said you've exceeded the 5%, but what's the actual number that you guys have achieved over the last 10 quarters or so? How much upside have you actually achieved relative to that five and can you just remind us at what point does do we start to need to see that gradually increasing from that 5 to I think it's sort 6 or 6.5?", "Mike Simonds", "I would say we haven\u2019t shared the actual number. We're not going to get in the business of sharing our actual quarterly new money rates against our portfolios, but it's been a reasonable beat and so we feel good about where we are.", "If you look at our history over the last 10 quarters. The good news is our actual results are a little bit further up that curve than the 5% and so we have a buffer, but in the next one, two, three years, we're certainly going to need to see an upward movement in interest rates or we're going to have to look at the reserves.", "John Nadel", "Okay. And then maybe one more follow-up on the LTC just and I know you guys have been having a decent amount of success on the Landing Spot program. Can you just give us an update on how things are going as it relates to rate increases and I guess we could characterize the Landing Spot as essentially a buydown of benefits?", "Steve Zabel", "John, this is Steve. I'll take that one. So, we continue to be very pleased with the take-up rate. I think we've mentioned in the past adoption its north of 50% on those increases. It clearly varies by the level of increase that was actually approved where the higher increases, the adoption rate is going to be a bit higher.", "We continue to feel good about the regulatory environment. There's been a lot of education, a lot of awareness over the last several years. I think regulators are much more open to the conversation.", "There's also a lot of alternatives that are put out there about how these rate increases are approved and implemented and we've seen a lot of flexibility by the regulators and we work with them at construct. So, we're pleased. We're still on pace with our original assumptions related to rate increases and we'll just continue to work that with the regulators.", "John Nadel", "Appreciate that. Thanks for the responses.", "Rick McKenney", "Thank you, John.", "Operator", "And we'll hear next from Mark Hughes of SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you. Good morning. Rick, in your comments, you had alluded to improvement I think at Colonial that you suggest it should support acceleration in sales. Any specifics you can share on that, when, how much?", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, I think the sales growth that we've seen in Colonial Life is a result of a lot getting more feet on the street and how we're working that. I was referring to we're continuing to focus on that.", "We really like our Colonial Life business, but I'll Tim talk about the things we're doing to continue to accelerate the growth of that company?", "Tim Arnold", "Yeah, thank you Rick. Thanks for the question Mark. We have a plan to accelerate growth through territory expansion primarily, but also through some initiatives around persistency improvement.", "We did open three new territory offices in the first six months of this year, bringing us to 45 total offices and we expect that to continue to grow and over the next few years we'll be in the upper 50s.", "Each of these new offices is already exceeding expectations that we had for the very early part of the tenure. We're excited about the talent available in the marketplace. Currently we're excited about the people we're bringing into the organization and we're excited about the opportunities we see in some places where I wouldn't call it exactly wide space, but we see some underpenetrated parts of the country where we have opportunities to go and make a difference.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And with no further questions at this time, Mr. White, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rick McKenney", "Yeah, this is Rick actually. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing many of you at investor meetings here over the next several weeks.", "For our investor friends, we know you have a busy day today. So, we will end the call promptly, but we thank you for joining us and we'll leave it at that, thanks.", "Operator", "And again, that does conclude our conference for today.

Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2017 earnings conference call for Unum.", "Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact.

Our third quarter results are strong, building up the positive business trends and favorable momentum we've been experiencing over the past several quarters. Our after-tax operating income per share was $1.09, another record high for the company and a very strong increase of 11% relative to the year-ago quarter.", "In fact, for the first 9 months of 2017, our after-tax operating income per share has increased by 9%. This exceeds our expectations coming into the year. We now expect our full year growth to be at to slightly above the upper end of the range of growth of 5% to 8% we established last quarter. Jack will discuss the drivers of the performance in a moment.", "From an overall growth perspective, we also feel positive about the top line, which saw premiums grow 5.5% in our core operating segments this quarter, excluding a reinsurance transaction, and our overall benefits performance remained stable. This financial performance continued to be driven by our Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments.", "Both businesses are producing great results, with good sales momentum and persistency driving solid premium growth. Combining our stable benefits experience and well-managed expenses, we continue to produce leading profit margins.", "Our Unum U.K. results are running slightly below our expectations due, in large part, to the uncertain U.K. environment. And finally, Closed Block operations showed some underlying volatility this quarter in long-term care, although earnings results for this segment remain within our expectations.", "These results are a continuation of the trends we've seen for the last several years, trends that have accelerated in 2017. Our strategy is a simple one, a singular focus on the employee benefits market, taking care of our customers at time of need and consistently executing on our plans.", "Over the years, we've built strong positions in the market where we compete. We've focused on what we're good at, helping people through difficult times in their lives, and this has enabled us to become a leader in employee benefits. We also pride ourselves on delivering consistency. While we know there will always be challenges and volatility in the marketplace, we've demonstrated an ability to execute and course-correct through whatever the external environment throws at us.", "A key to our success is a commitment to investing in our future. Customer expectations are only increasing, and we understand that these expectations are being set not necessarily by our peers in the insurance sector but by leading consumer companies across all industries. We're investing in capabilities that will enhance the experiences our customers have with us, and we're already seeing these investments pay off in persistency and effective risk management.", "As you've heard me say before as recently as last quarter, the quality of our people and the strength of our culture are the backbone of our company. The financial protections we offer mainly deal with people at difficult times in their lives in a very personal way. An empathetic positioning is critical to ensuring we deliver on the promises we make to our customers and, in turn, we will be a company that also delivers for our shareholders.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Jack to take on some of the details of what was a very strong third quarter. Jack?", "Jack McGarry", "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone.", "As Rick stated, the third quarter was another outstanding one for Unum. Our after-tax operating income per share of $1.09 is an increase of 11.2% over the year-ago quarter, with a strong balance between operational performance drivers and capital management drivers. Our after-tax operating income increased 7.6% in the quarter, the best performance in many years, while share repurchases contributed 3.6% to upper share growth.", "Unum U.S. continues to be the primary driver of this strong performance with another excellent quarter highlighted by improved sales trends, good premium growth, favorable benefit ratios in each business line and lower expense ratios. All these trends are driving strong profit margins in an operating ROE of 16.6% for the quarter.", "Within Unum U.S., group disability produced an outstanding quarter, with before-tax operating income of $90 million, an increase of 5.4% over last year. Premium income increased 2.2%, and the benefit ratio improved to 76.7% from 78.6% a year ago.", "As expected, favorable incidence trends in LTD and lower prevalence rates in STD have more than offset the impact of the 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate for new claim incurrals that we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "The group life and AD&D line produced a strong quarter, with operating income of $60.1 million, an increase of 12.5% over last year. Premium income increased 4.8%, and the benefit ratio improved to 71.4% from 72.6% last year, primarily driven by lower incidence and average claim size in our group life product line.", "The supplemental and voluntary lines had a record quarter, with $108.3 million in operating income, an increase of 17.5% over last year. Premium income continued to grow at a healthy pace, with voluntary benefits line increasing 7% and the individual disability line increasing 2%, excluding the impact of the reinsurance treaty we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "In addition, the dental and vision line, which we acquired in August of last year, contributed $42.2 million of premium income versus $20 million last year. The improvement in operating income for the segment was driven by improved benefits experience in both VB and IDI, favorable expenses and favorable DAC development.", "Sales for Unum U.S. for the third quarter rebounded strongly, increasing 21.1% over last year. Sales were particularly strong for LTD, increasing 28%, STD increasing 76.9% and individual disability increasing 24.4%. We saw a decline of 1.8% in voluntary benefits sales in the quarter, primarily driven by volatility in the large case sector. For the year-to-date, our VB sales were up 12%, and we expect to see better growth in the fourth quarter, given our pipeline of activities.", "The addition of the dental and vision product line contributed $9.7 million of sales versus $4.5 million last year, and we continued to see a strong level of quote activity being generated in this product line. Persistency for our group product lines is lower than the year-ago levels, but has improved relative to the first half of the year and remains well within our expectations.", "Unum U.K. continues to be impacted by the uncertain environment brought on by last year's Brexit vote. Third quarter operating earnings reflect this challenge, declining by 6% from last year to GBP 20.2 million. Our premium income did pick up slightly this quarter, increasing 3.6% in local currency due to growth in the in-force block resulting from prior-period sales and stable persistency.", "That Unum U.K. benefit ratio was 74.9% for the third quarter, an increase from 71.8% last year, driven by higher claims incidence and lower claim recoveries in the group disability line and the impact of inflation-linked increases in benefits as well as the 80 basis point reduction to our discount rate for new claims, which we implemented in the first quarter.", "Risk experience in the group life line improved over the year-ago quarter due to a lower average claim size. Although the quarter was an unusually difficult one for Unum U.K., we believe that business will continue to feel pressure as the U.K. works through the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.", "Unum U.K. sales for the third quarter declined by 14.2% in local currency. This decline was driven by lower group long-term disability sales, which was only partially offset by sales growth in the group life and supplemental line, particularly dental and group critical illness.", "Looking now at Colonial Life. We saw another strong and steady quarter, with operating income of $81.7 million, an increase of 3.4% over last year. Premium income growth remains healthy, increasing 6.9%, driven by the positive sales trends we've seen over many quarters as well as stable persistency.", "Colonial Life's benefit ratio ticked up to 51.8% this quarter from 51.6% last year, with less favorable experience in the cancer and critical illness lines, offsetting improved experience in the life and accident, sickness and disability lines.", "Sales momentum for Colonial Life continues to be positive, increasing 2.6% over the year-ago quarter. Sales growth in the core commercial segment helped to drive this growth, along with increased sales in the public sector. We also continued to see good trends, with new account sales increasing 4.7%, while sales to existing accounts increased 1.5%. Persistency for Colonial Life remains stable at 79%.", "Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income declined to $26.6 million in the third quarter from $28.6 million in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest-adjusted loss ratio was 82.4%. This is slightly unfavorable relative to last year's 81.5%, but continues to be in line with expectations. For long-term care, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 93.3%, above our expected range of 85% to 90%, although slightly favorable to last year's 93.8%.", "As you may recall, last year's benefit ratio was elevated due to the impact of a large group case that moved to an individual ported status. The elevation in the current benefit ratio is largely attributable to unusually unfavorable policyholder lapses. Although we'd rather than not see this volatility, we're encouraged that the underlying claims experience was consistent with historical norms.", "Other important factors related to long-term care line continued to trend favorably this quarter. Our new-money yield in the quarter was again above our 5% assumption, just as it has been since resetting of that assumption in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "In addition, we continue to make good progress with rate increases on the in-force business, with several additional approvals, keeping us on pace to achieve, if not slightly exceed, the rate increase expectations assumed in our reserves.", "We continue to have productive discussions with our state insurance departments, and it's worth noting that other than the small amounts outstanding from our 2014 filings, no future rate increases are built into our current reserve assumptions. With that said, we plan to actively pursue the future rate increases were justified.", "So overall, we had a very strong financial and operating results this quarter. We continue to see strong risk results across the majority of our businesses, coupled with favorable top line growth. We also experienced very favorable expense trends this quarter across all 3 of our core business segments. While we are actively managing our expense base, I would caution you that some of the benefit this quarter was a timing issue and is not likely to recur at the same level in the fourth quarter.", "Our financial performance has also continued to generate strong statutory earnings for the company. Net income on a statutory basis totaled $190.3 million this quarter and has totaled approximately $850 million over the trailing four quarters. This creates significant financial flexibility for us, as the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies is now at approximately 410% and our holding companies' cash position, excluding amounts committed for subsidiary contributions, is $771 million.", "Both of these metrics improved relative to the second quarter, while we again repurchased $100 million of our shares, consistent with the trend of the past several quarters and in line with our outlook for the year.", "Wrapping up, I'm very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. As we look to close out 2017, we expect full year after-tax operating income per share growth to be at, if not slightly above, the upper end of the 5% to 8% range we established last quarter.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments.", "Rick McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Jack. And as you can tell, we're very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. We think our strategic position in the employee benefits marketplace remains very strong, and we are successfully translating that into solid operating performance with - on top of our strong financial foundation.", "So now I would like to move to your questions. I'll ask Diana to begin the question-and-answer session. Diana?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "First, had a question on just the voluntary and supplemental business. I think earnings in this segment, $108 million, that's the highest level you've had as far back as I can see in your history, and it's significantly higher than it's been in the last few quarters. So what's your view of the sustainability of that number? And I'm assuming that there might be that expense benefit you referred to in there as well.", "Rick McKenney", "Great. Thanks, Jimmy. We'll have Jack.", "Jack McGarry", "So the earnings were higher than we've seen in a while. Two factors that, I think, are drivers, the growth in the business. It's growing 7% a year. So of the 17% growth, that would be 7% of it. We did have a favorable quarter from an expense perspective, favorable from risk and favorable from DAC development. I'd say those factors were kind of pretty consistent levels. I think they may settle back.", "Even though we had very favorable expenses in the third quarter, we've been on a good trend as a company with our expense ratio, and we'll continue to actively manage expenses going forward. So I'd say, it's probably a little higher than the go-forward rate. But we're really pleased with the performance of the line.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then you've contributed to the New York long-term care block, I think, every - most of the past few years, a little bit each quarter - each year in the fourth quarter. Should we expect a similar contribution this year as well?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, I would think it'll be of a similar magnitude.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then lastly, can you give us some sort of initial indications on this consumer reception due to new medical stop-loss product? And what do you see as sort of the long-term growth potential in that market for you guys?", "Rick McKenney", "Mike?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, sure. So we entered the market officially quoting 1/1/18 effective business a little over 60 days ago. And we've actually been very positively surprised, actually, with the rapid growth in quote activity. So those decisions tend to be made very close to the effective date. So we'll have to wait and see how the fourth quarter plays out. But we're excited about that as an extension of our brand and a new way to leverage the distribution relationships that we have out there in the market.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Suneet Kamath with Citi.", "Suneet Kamath", "First question just on the M&A environment, given the large transaction that was recently announced. In the past, when we've seen deals like this, has that, historically, been a pretty favorable environment in terms of your ability to win business as a major competitors in transition?", "Rick McKenney", "Yes. Let me give you a couple of comments on that, Suneet. First of all, when you think about M&A and us, it's something we'll continue to be active in. It's something that we'll be disciplined on. I think it's probably the first and foremost. So I think I'd mentioned that about the environment. You mentioned a specific deal that was announced this week. I mean, I won't get in too much detail, but these are two competitors that are consolidating in the large case market.", "And I'd say, they have similar capabilities. And so when you see that out there, I think that we're going to continue to be very competitive in that space. Ultimately, we'll see in the market. But I think that the team out there today on a large case basis has really been on a good run. We're providing a lot of value to our customers, and we'll continue to do that.", "Suneet Kamath", "And then on the Unum U.S. business. Can you remind us just how much of a drag are you seeing in the benefit ratio from the discount rate adjustment you made last year? And where are your thoughts in terms of potentially making a similar adjustment in 2017?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. So I think we said the discount rate adjustment was worth about $7.5 million a quarter when we made it last year. We expected that the favorable trends we're seeing both in recoveries and incidence would more than offset that. That's played out according to our expectations.", "We feel comfortable at least at this point with where our investments are and where our interest rates are. We're still doing our reserve adequacy work, but there's nothing there that would lead me to suspect we would take another action this year.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI.", "Tom Gallagher", "The first question is the individual disability in terms of the voluntary and supplemental segment. 48% benefit ratio was quite good. Do you see that more as a bit of an anomaly? Or is there an analogy here in terms of what you've seen on the group disability side for the last several years? Or maybe we start to see a significant improvement versus where you've been in recent history? Anything going underlying with regard to that business?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. I don't think we see anything underlying that. That benefit ratio has hovered in there around the 50% mark for a while. It is a smaller block than LTD block, so it's subject to more volatility than the LTD block. But we're very pleased with this quarter's results. We've been very pleased for a long time with the results that block has been generating, and I wouldn't say there's anything unusual about it.", "Tom Gallagher", "But I guess, Jack, would it - would you assume it's going to be back in the 50s? Or do you think there is - is there anything that you're seeing underlying the claims trends that might suggest you could stay in the 40s or at least below 40%?", "Jack McGarry", "I'd say, it's slightly under 50%. I think kind of the historical trend is probably a good marker for it.", "Tom Gallagher", "And then next question. Just you had good sales growth in group, I guess, based on where you're pricing new business now. Do you think you can sustain the favorable margin you've had overall in group? What do you think as you look out over the next couple of years with those? Based on your pricing new business, would there be any pressure on margins? Or do you think you can sustain them?", "Rick McKenney", "Mike?", "Mike Simonds", "I would say, the quick answer is, we do feel comfortable about that. If I take you back a year ago, we guided to about 8% to 10% sales growth overall. And part of the reason that we felt like sales momentum would pick up is some of the new capabilities we're putting in the market like our Starmount dental offering. But it was also because we felt like the pricing level that we took into the year didn't need an increase, and that was for the first time in several years. And what we've seen emerge over the course of the year is a reasonably favorable market.", "We feel real confident that the prices that we have put out there reflect the underlying economics, the risk and the interest rates like Jack alluded to. So while 3Q sales are our smallest sales quarter of the year and, therefore, subject to a bit more volatility, I'd say, the outlook to continue to drive strong sales growth and maintain margins is good.", "Tom Gallagher", "And then just final topic on long-term care. Just the - Jack, I heard your comments on, it sounds like, you feel comfortable heading into the fourth quarter review. Is there - just looking at the fact that it's year-to-date, on the benefit ratio side, been above 90%. Is that - is the higher than 90% threshold not really the right way to think about it? Is it that there is significant offset from rate increases? How would you think about dimensioning that? Because - I guess, my question is, if you look into 4Q and if the benefit ratio remained elevated north of 90%, would that be a trigger or not necessarily?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. I don't think what happens in the fourth quarter is going to be a trigger. Essentially, we're through our Res work before the fourth quarter is actually finalized. So this is a long-term business. In fact, no single quarter is going to drive what happens to it. I'd say that the loss ratio has been a little bit elevated. But on the other hand, our interest margin and the success we've had in placing new money has been higher than we anticipated in 2014 and has done a lot to kind of offset some of that impact.", "Tom Gallagher", "And just a follow-up on that. So is it fair to say - I think you've requested a fairly big rate increase in - for California, I think, 75%. Is that not even a relevant factor when you think about your reserve review? Or does that play into it at all?", "Jack McGarry", "No, it really isn't. I'd view that more as upside than anything. I don't think we need California to hit the assumptions that are in our reserves. But we've been very active in speaking with California, and we're hopeful we'll get a rate increase there. But it's not a reserve element.", "Tom Gallagher", "And then if I could just sneak one more in. Actuarial Guideline LTC, any initial thoughts on impact for you or the industry related to that?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. I can't talk for the industry. I don't anticipate any impacts for us. We've always tested our long-term care on a stand-alone basis. So that's nothing new for us. In addition, our treatment of both rate increases as well as investment results have always been consistent with the actuarial guidance. We think it's positive that the guidance - we support the goal of having better consistency and clarity around actuarial matters, but we feel really good about where we are and don't anticipate any changes as a result.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "Couple of quick ones. Any comment on the natural growth in payrolls in the quarter? Are you seeing any uptick there? And then secondly, the Colonial sales were a little bit slower this quarter. What do you anticipate going into next year?", "Rick McKenney", "Mike, do you want to start on natural growth, and then we'll ask Tim.", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, sure. Mark, I'd say, pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of quarters, we are seeing a bit of natural growth come through a bit, more so on the salary side, given our mix, than on the job growth, but a bit muted still from what we've seen in prior expansion cycles. I would note, though, that on the earned premium side, persistency continues to improve a bit quarter-over-quarter. And as we look forward, I'd expect that sort of slow improvement to continue as well.", "Rick McKenney", "And, Tim, do you want to mention on Colonial Life and sales growth?", "Tim Arnold", "Sure, yes. Thank you, Mark. We feel great about the market opportunity. We still feel very good about our value proposition. We like the strength and effectiveness of our team and our distribution system. We've had a strong year so far and despite the third quarter headwinds, which were largely driven by our large case segment as well as some weather-related issues, we feel good about the year, and the leading indicators we're looking at are positive for the remainder of the year.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Scott", "Had a quick one on the long-term care, I guess, more specifically, on the lapse rates. Some of the disclosure in the statutory filing suggests that you're running a little less favorably on lapses compared to peers. I was just wondering if you'd already adjusted some of those. I think some of the reserve work in the past has been related to interest rates, but I wasn't sure some of it was already reducing lapse rates.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes. I mean, at this point, this is one quarter. It was fairly unusual. I think we're comfortable with where our lapse rates are. There - our assumptions are under 1%, which is pretty consistent with where, I think, the industry is. So there's nothing shocking in here. There's a lot that goes into the statutory filings on long-term care, mortality and lapses and other things. So it's hard to single out a single assumption based on that information.", "Alex Scott", "And one other quick one on Unum U.K., the discount rate change that you made there. Can you quantify the impact that, that will have on earnings going forward?", "Jack McGarry", "I mean, it's already in there, so it's already having the impact on earnings for the first 3 quarters. It was kind of a - it was in the neighborhood of around GBP 2 million a quarter.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.", "Erik Bass", "Both you and the industry have been experiencing favorable underwriting results in U.S. group for a number of quarters now. I guess, do you think this is just a function of disciplined pricing in recent years and the improving economy and employment picture? Or has something else changed in terms of risk assessment or claims handling that's improving results?", "Rick McKenney", "Mike, do you want to take that?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, sure. So I think it's probably much more the former than the latter. We have seen a bit of improved submitted incidents kind of very gradually over the last 8 or 10 quarters. But when I look at industry reports on profitability and the like, it does appear that pricing and underwriting discipline as some players have had to recover has been a driver as well.", "Erik Bass", "And I guess, on that note then are you seeing any evidence of people factoring in recent favorable experience in their pricing? I know this sort of gets at what Tom was asking to. But do you view margins, I guess, broadly sustainable at these levels? Or is there kind of risk that we're approaching sort of a cyclical peak?", "Mike Simonds", "I'd say, it's insurance, so you can't predict too far out. But where I've got a line of sight to, I would suspect and believe that margins won't come under any unusual kind of pressure over the coming periods. So that's probably not going to be a big issue.", "Erik Bass", "So you're not seeing any sort of increased competitiveness or aggressiveness in the pricing at this point?", "Mike Simonds", "It's a pretty competitive market, but I think that's kind of the norm that we are accustomed to.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners.", "Humphrey Lee", "A question on the Unum U.S. I think in Jack's prepared remarks, he talked about the voluntary benefit sales is looking good in the coming fourth quarter. And I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit in terms of what you are seeing for that line of business?", "Mike Simonds", "Yes, we've really been pleased with voluntary benefit sales. We had a bit of an off quarter. It's a small quarter for voluntary benefits. We did see good growth in the core and the number of clients added. It was the large case VB market where we see a tick down, but on a year-to-date basis feel really good about double-digit sales growth. And like pretty much every line in the portfolio as we look forward and work through fourth quarter, which is when a lot of business comes in for 1/1 effective dates, we feel good about some momentum in voluntary.", "Humphrey Lee", "So would you say the quoting activity is better than last year level or is it comparable?", "Mike Simonds", "I'd say we are seeing a bit increased number of proposals. And we're seeing deeper, broader interest in some of the supplemental lines as well. So your standard group insurance lines have disability and life insurance has a tick or 2 of growth there. But a lot of increased interest in supplemental health voluntary lines in the new dental and vision lines of business and I mentioned quote activity in stop-loss is ticking up.", "Humphrey Lee", "And then just a question on long-term care. So for these unfavorable lapses, do you see any kind of concentration in vintages or whether that's individual or group? Just any additional color that you can share.", "Jack McGarry", "I mean, the impact was more individual than it was group. But within the individual, there was no specific vintage. But it was an individual based - the lapse dynamics in the group business are very, very different than the individual and continued kind of on track with where they had been.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo.", "Sean Dargan", "Jack, just going back to the Closed Block long-term care. So it sounds like you've been putting new money to work at higher yields than you assumed in 2014. Can you remind us what, I guess, the slope of your longer-term interest rate assumptions are? Do they move higher at some point?", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, they do. So in 2014, we assumed new money rates would be 5% for the ensuing 4 to 5 years and then over the following 5 years would grade back toward a long-term average, which is in, all-in rates, in the high 6s, the 6.50%, 6.75% range. We've exceeded that by a healthy margin in each quarter since 2014. But next year, we'll start to hit the point where those assumptions are expected to start grading upward. We actually are encouraged by the march of the treasury yield over the last quarter or 2, which is good to see. It's approaching where year-end 2016 was.", "Sean Dargan", "And what are you buying to support that block? Is the securities different than what you have backing other liabilities?", "Jack McGarry", "I mean, it's somewhat of a different mix. It's longer term. So we're out at that 30-year rather than the 10-year that most people are focused on. We do have some alternative investments back in the line as well and some high yields. So it's longer. It's probably a little bit lower on the quality side from high yield than perhaps our other book.", "But overall, we're very comfortable with our high-yield exposure. We're comfortable with our alternative exposure, which we think is probably lower than most of our competitors and feel good about the performance of the portfolio.", "Sean Dargan", "And then I just have a modeling question on Unum U.S. supplementary and voluntary. So you had a number of favorable items, but the - how should we think about the DAC amortization going forward? Because that seemed very low.", "Jack McGarry", "Yes, it was. Frankly, it has a lot to do with who persists and who terminates. So overall persistency wasn't out of line with the voluntary benefits. But the persistency, the people who terminated and cases that terminated tended to be kind of older cases where the DAC had already been written off. And we had more favorable persistency on newer cases where they still had a hefty DAC balance going forward. And so it was more about where - the location of where the lapses took place than it was overall lapse.", "Operator", "With no further questions, I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rick McKenney", "Great. Thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. We do look forward to seeing many of you at our outlook meeting, which will actually be in New York on December 13. We'll take you through a good look into 2018 and all other things that we're working on. So we hope you'll join us there.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tom White. Please go ahead.", "Tom White", "Great. Thank you, Savannah. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2017 earnings conference call for Unum.", "Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. It was a busy fourth quarter for all, with the initial impacts from the enactments of tax reform reflected in our financial results. Through this, I am very pleased with our underlying results, which continued many of the positive trends we have seen throughout 2017.", "Our net income for the quarter was $1.19 per share compared to $1.07 a share in the year ago fourth quarter. Adjusting for tax reform, a settlement on unclaimed death benefits and the net investment gains on our investment portfolio, our adjusted operating income per share was $1.13, up 14% compared to $0.99 in the year ago quarter.", "I would note that this result includes a reserve release in our individual disability line of business, resulting from our annual review of reserves, which benefited our adjusted operating income by $0.06 per share. Overall, this was an excellent quarter for the company and a strong finish to the year.", "The drivers of these strong results remain consistent throughout the year and again through the fourth quarter. We saw solid top-line growth in our core businesses and excellent operational performance. From a growth perspective in the fourth quarter, we experienced 4% growth in premium income for our core, with 3% premium growth in Unum US, 6% in Colonial Life and 2% for Unum UK in local currency.", "A highlight was that that our fourth quarter sales were also very strong, particularly in our US business, where Unum US posted 28% year over year growth, and Colonial Life increased sales by 10.4%, giving us confidence that our premium growth trends can continue in 2018. With the sales growth, we have been firm in our underwriting discipline and we expect to continue to drive strong profit margins in our core business segments.", "Our optimism for 2018 is further enhanced with the enactment of tax reform legislation, as Unum will be a significant beneficiary. From a GAAP earnings perspective, our tax rate will decline substantially from a 31% to 32% rate we have been reporting to a new expectation in 2018 of 19% to 21%.", "This will also create additional cash flow in 2018, which will accelerate over time. While we expect much of the benefit will accrue to our shareholders, we also expect opportunities for enhanced investment in many aspects of our business. This includes infrastructure and technology spending to better serve the needs of our customers, further investment in our workforce, and finally, investment in and support for the communities that we call home.", "And finally, we're looking to see how tax reform drives accelerated economic growth in the broader U.S. economy. For us, employment growth and wage inflation mean incremental growth for our customers and our business. Our optimism is also evident in our announcement last week of the acquisition of Pramerica \u017bycie, a financial protection provider in Poland. This strategic acquisition expands our geographic footprint into Poland, a very attractive market for us.", "This is a good profitable business with an excellent reputation, strong management team and a successful distribution model. We believe that over time as we expand the product portfolio and enhance the delivery capabilities with Unum's and Colonial Life's expertise, we can help build on its growth momentum.", "We continue to feel very good about our direction as we move into 2018. Based on solid positions in our markets, we continue to look for opportunities for growth through product expansion and geographic expansion. This includes opportunities to further serve the needs of both employers and their employees.", "The results we're generating and the flexibility that these strong results provide us, drive us as we look to further expand our business. We do this from a position of having great purpose in what we do. Our strategy is to provide more employees access to products and services, to protect their financial wellbeing in difficult times.", "The need for this has never been greater and it's threefold: providing protection gaps when people need us most, helping individuals return to work and helping employers attract and retain employees. Now, let me turn the call over to Jack to cover some of the details from our fourth quarter results. Jack?", "John McGarry", "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Following on Rick's comments, the fourth quarter was another strong quarter, concluding an excellent year for the company. In my remarks this morning, I'll provide more detail on our financial performance and discuss some of the financial implications of tax reform.", "In addition, similar to others in the industry, we reached the settlement with a third party concerning unclaimed death benefits, which impacted after-tax net income by $25.4 million in the fourth quarter. This special item affected the Colonial Like segment, the group life and AD&D segment, and supplemental and voluntary business lines of Unum US.", "In my remarks this morning, I'll exclude the impact of this settlement to make for a more consistent basis of comparison with the year ago quarter. Our strong financial performance continues to be driven in large part by the positive trends we're experiencing in Unum US, including strong sales growth, solid persistency and favorable benefit ratio trends. These trends are driving strong profit margin and adjusted operating ROE of 16.8% this quarter.", "Within Unum US, group disability produced very good results for the fourth quarter with before tax adjusted operating income of $86.7 million. This is a decline from the year ago result of $89.5 million, primarily driven by lower net investment income and higher expenses. As a reminder, we had an exceptionally low expense ratio in the third quarter, which we expected to come back in the fourth quarter.", "I'm encouraged that the premium income increased by 2.2% over the year ago fourth quarter, and that the benefit ratio improved to 76.3% from 77.7% in the year ago quarter. The improvement was driven by the ongoing favorable instance in claim recovery trends in LTD. So we continue to see very positive trends in this business.", "The group life and AD&D line produced good results as well with adjusted operating income of $57 million in the fourth quarter compared to $56.1 million in the year ago quarter. Premium income increased 2.8% and the benefit ratio improved slightly to 71.3% compared to 71.5% in the year ago quarter as claims incidence was slightly improved.", "The supplemental and voluntary lines produced very strong results with adjusted operating income of $120.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $94.5 million a year ago. Income in this line benefited by $19.5 million from an annual reserve review in the individual disability line, recognizing updated morbidity assumptions in the disabled life reserves.", "Premium income continue to grow at a healthy pace. The voluntary benefits line increased 8.1% and the dental and vision line increased 8.5%. These increases were partially offset by a 3.6% decline in the individual disability line.", "Risk experience was generally in line for the individual disability line and stable for the voluntary benefits lines, excluding the impact of the unclaimed death benefit reserve increase. Risk experience for the dental and vision line was favorable relative to the year ago quarter.", "Sales for Unum US for the fourth quarter were excellent, increasing 28.7% for the quarter relative to last year. The increase was widespread across product lines and between core market and large case segments. Sales were strong for LTD, increasing 17.2%. And for group life increasing 25.1% over the year ago quarter.", "In STD, sales increased 57.8%, but benefited by approximately $22.6 million from an update to the New York disability law for paid family leave.", "Adjusting for this one-time benefit, sales still increased by 22.8% for Unum U.S., in total. We also saw strong trends in the supplemental and voluntary lines. Our voluntary benefit sales increased 11.9% and dental and vision jumped 148% from $10 million last year to $24.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.", "We're very pleased with the rollout of the dental product to half of our Unum U.S. sales channel. And we look forward to the further gains in 2018, as we rollout our dental offering to the rest of the Unum U.S. sales force and to the Colonial Life distribution channel.", "Persistency for our group product lines was lower in 2017 relative to 2016, but improved throughout the year and was in line with our expectations. We're also seeing encouraging trends for persistency early in 2018.", "Unum UK continues to be impacted by the uncertain business environment related to Brexit. Fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings reflect this challenge declining by 7.1% from last year to $22.4 million. Premium income increased this quarter growing 2.3% in local currency due to growth in the in-force block resulting from prior period sales, which offset a decline in persistency.", "The Unum UK benefit ratio was 75.8% for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to 67.6% last year. The increased loss ratio reflects higher claims incidence in the group disability line. The impact from the 80 basis point reduction to our discount rate for new claims, which we implemented in the first quarter and the impact from inflation linked increases in benefits, which were largely offset by higher income from our inflation index linked bonds.", "Unum UK sales for the fourth quarter declined by 3.7% in local currency. This decline was driven by lower group life sales and supplemental product line sales, which offset higher sales in the group long-term disability line. Last year's fourth quarter sales results were very strong making for a tough comparison. All-in-all, our UK business is performing well and the difficult environment and produced an adjusted operating return on equity of 15.5% for the quarter.", "Colonial Life was again a strong contributor to our overall income though adjusted operating income was 1% lower at $79.1 million relative to last year's fourth quarter. Premium income growth remains healthy increasing 6% driven by the positive sales trends we've seen over many quarters. Colonial Life's benefit ratio, excluding the unclaimed death benefits reserve increase was stable at 51.6% this quarter compared to 51.4% last year.", "Less favorable experience in the life product line was largely offset by improved experience in the cancer and critical illness and the accident, sickness and disability lines. The expense ratio was slightly elevated in the fourth quarter driven in large part by strategic investments in our business and higher IT expenditures. The adjusted operating return on equity for Colonial Life remains very strong at 15.4%.", "Sales momentum for Colonial Life continues to be very strong increasing 10.4% over the year ago quarter. Sales growth in the core commercial segment help to drive this along with increased sales in the large case corporate sector, we also continue to see good trends with new account sales increasing 13.2% and sales to existing accounts increasing 8.7%. We continue to invest in territory expansion and we'll begin to rollout the dental product to our Colonial Life agents this year. This should led to accelerated sales growth in 2018.", "Finally for the Closed Block adjusted operating income declined to $33.1 million in the fourth quarter from $34.6 million in the year ago quarter. In the individual disability product line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 81.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 84.7% last year, primarily resulting from lower submitted claim incidence and a lower average size of new claims.", "The long term care interest adjusted benefit ratio increased to 93.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 89.1% in the year ago quarter. Risk results this quarter showed unfavorable policy terminations, primarily driven by unfavorable mortality experience. I remind you that at December outlook meeting, we indicated that long term care ratio will likely exceed our prior expectation of a range of 85% to 90% over the near term. This quarter's results are in line with our revised expectations.", "Two important factors related to the long term care line continue to trend favorably this quarter. First, our new money yield this quarter was again above our assumption of 5%, just as it has been since resetting that assumption in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Again as we said in December, we're nearing the point where our reserve assumptions begin to reflect our rising new money yields. While long duration treasury yields have moved somewhat higher recently, credit spreads on bonds remain tight.", "Second, while it's a quiet quarter for rating increase approvals on imports business, we still have a few large rate requests yet to be decided. Even without these, we're confident we will achieve the rate increase expectations assumed in our reserve assumptions. It bears repeating that we assume no future rate increases in our current reserve assumptions then we intend to actively pursue future rate increases were justified.", "So in total, we saw strong financial and operating results this quarter. We continue to see very good risk results across the majority of our businesses along with favorable top line growth.", "Now I would like to provide some commentary around tax reform and the implications for Unum. In short, we feel the impacts are largely very beneficial for the company. In the fourth quarter, we reported two immediate impacts. First, the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability at the newly enacted rate of 21% resulted in a tax benefit of $97.7 million or $0.44 per diluted common share. Second, one-time tax on undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings generated a tax expense of $66.4 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. This tax expense will be amortized into cash taxes over the next eight years.", "We'll see additional impact as we move into 2018. First, we'll have a substantially lower GAAP tax rate. Our current reported tax rate is generally in the 31% to 32% range with the new U.S. corporate tax rate being lowered to 21%. We expect our reported rate for 2018 to be in the 19% to 20% range.", "Next, from a cash flow perspective, we estimated cash tax savings equal to approximately one half of the GAAP benefit. This cash tax savings will move closer to the GAAP savings over time. For 2018, we estimate that our free cash flow will benefit by approximately $90 million and this benefit will grade up to $200 million over the next 10 years. Clearly, this has very positive implications for the company.", "Finally, as you know tax reform will have negative impacts on company's risk based capital ratios. For our traditional U.S. based life insurance companies, we are estimating our year end 2017 risk based capital ratio to be approximately 390%, which compares to 405%, a year-end 2016 and about 410% at the end of the third quarter.", "In the absence of tax reform, we would have expected our year-end 2017 risk based capital ratio to be consistent with the fourth quarter - with the third quarter levels. The difference of about 20 points is primarily driven by the $236 million reduction in our statutory deferred tax asset allowed to be included in bidding assets for total adjusted capital.", "The 390% RBC is within our targeted range of 375% to 400% and a very comfortable - and we're very comfortable at this level. The NAIC is still grappling with how and when they will modify the RBC formulas to reflect the new tax environment. In addition, the anticipated 2019 C1 factor changes made further impact RBC calculations. It's unclear how the rating agencies will treat these changes, particularly those agencies that utilize proprietary capital models with before tax rather than after tax adjustments.", "Given our strong and growing free cash flow generation, we're very confident in our ability to rack as their views become clarified.", "Moving on, we continue to deliver healthy levels of statutory earnings at our traditional U.S. insurance companies. For full year 2017 statutory after tax adjusted operating earnings totaled $812.4 million, down from $884.6 million in full year 2016. 2017 results were impacted by some one-time items. But after adjusting for these, our 2017 results were in line with the year ago total. Another good year of statutory earnings in 2017 will of course drive strong dividend capacity for us in 2018.", "Holding company cash ended 2017 at $864 million. Our annual need for interest expense and shareholder dividends is approximately $366 million. So we have ample comfort. We will be paying for Pramerica \u017bycie acquisition with cash at the holding company and do not expect this transition to impact our plans to repurchase $400 million in shares in 2018.", "For the fourth quarter, our share repurchase was again totaled $100 million, putting full year 2017 repurchases at $400 million. It really shows the strength and flexibility of our capital position and capital deployment plans, when we can execute on the strategic expansion opportunities. Growth in our core businesses either through organic growth or acquisition is our number one priority for deployment of excess capital.", "Wrapping up, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance. At our outlook meeting in December, we indicated our expectation for growth and adjusted operating earnings per share for 2018 to be within a range of 4% to 7%.", "With the enactment of tax reform legislation, we are revising our outlook to a range of 17% to 23% from a base of adjusted operating earnings per share of $4.24 for 2017. This change in outlook reflects the lower tax rate, as well as our desire to use some of the tax savings to accelerate investments in our infrastructure and capabilities.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Rick, for his closing comments.", "Richard McKenney", "Great. Thank you, Jack. As you can tell, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, which significantly exceeded our expectations coming into the year. I believe this is a result of the positive momentum we're seeing in our core business lines and the strong operational trends we are delivering.", "Our strategic position in the employee benefits marketplace remain strong and we're successfully building on that through organic growth as well as the opportunities we are seeing through acquisitions, both product expansion with dental acquisitions in the UK and US, and geographic expansion with last week's acquisition in Poland.", "We'll now move on to your questions, so I'll ask Savannah to begin the Q&A session, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Krueger", "Thanks. Good morning. I guess, given the significant magnitude of the GE long-term care reserve charge, could you discuss some of the key difference you see with your block versus theirs that you see more comfort with the reserve adequacy.", "John McGarry", "Yeah. Sure.", "Richard McKenney", "Yeah, absolutely. Good morning, Ryan. So we feel like we're in a very different place than GE is. First, I'd point out that the blocks are very different. GE's block was a reinsured block, which removes them one step from the customer block. Our block was direct written, so we directly control the underwriting and benefit guidelines in that block.", "The other big difference is 85% of our insured lives are group long-term care. They have a much younger profile. They - and most of those actual group long-term care insurance are employer funded as opposed to employee funded, much smaller benefit levels, much more conservative plan designs.", "The other - by comparison the GE block was 100% long-term care. And it was a much older block than our block is. Second, we aggressively and actively managed block over time. Since - I know, we've had ten full-time actuaries dedicated to the block since 2012. And for a period, I was one of them.", "Between reserve increases and reserve charges, we strengthened reserve margins over time by $4 billion in the block. And I will tell you, within long-term care timing matters. The earlier you move the better off you're going to be. And so, we have been an early adopter in that, in the block.", "The third thing I'd say is we did our comprehensive review of the long-term care block in 2014. We provided a lot of resources to build sophisticated models. We set our assumptions to be consistent with our emerging experience. And on an ongoing basis, monthly we track our actual to assumed assumptions and we provide you quarterly updates with that on an ongoing basis.", "The fourth thing I'd point out is we just concluded our 2017 reserve accuracy studies. We had margin in our reserves, as a result of that analysis. The other thing is we have no future rate increases assumed, although we intend to pursue them. And then, finally we have $1 billion difference between our GAAP results and stat reserves.", "We believe these buffers insulate our capital plans. We've been dealing with this problem for a long time. I think our dealing with it is characterized, but there's been no surprises. As a result, we've kept you apprised on an ongoing basis of where we are. And there's been no impact to our capital plans along the way. And we would expect that to continue into the future.", "Ryan Krueger", "Right. Thank you for taking the questions.", "John McGarry", "Thanks, Ryan.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.", "Erik Bass", "Hi. Hi, thank you. Can you talk about how you expect pricing across your businesses to respond to the tax rate changes? And are there different dynamics for different lines of business?", "Richard McKenney", "Yeah, Erik. This is Rick. There are different dynamics that are happening. I think that when we look at the - the short answer is we don't see much impact certainly in the near-term. But let me - we can dimension that for you and then hit it by each for a line. So, Jack, do you want to talk a little bit about kind of the overview, why we say that?", "John McGarry", "Absolutely. Good morning, Rick. The first thing I'd say is that our success as a company has been predicated on providing exceptional value to our customers and we do not expect that to change with tax reform. Price isn't the all-in thing in terms of how we go to market. But within that we have pieces of our business that will react very differently.", "First, 10% of our earnings come from the Closed Block. We're certainly not going to be reducing prices there. The second thing I'd say that may come as a surprise to people, 53% of our earnings as a company come from IDI voluntary benefits in Colonial Life & Accident. If you look at those products, they are much different than group products. First of all, they file the rates. And so, that file process - filing process is a long and arduous process.", "And so the re-pricing horizon is a five-year pricing horizon rather than a one or three year. The second thing about those is we price those products on a free cash flow generation model as opposed to base on GAAP ROE and as you know with some of the timing differences that emerged in the tax reform. Free cash flow did not benefit as robustly as GAAP earnings did.", "And then the final thing I'd say about those is those are issue age rates. And so, if you did change rate over that time horizon, it would only impact new business coming onto the books. The back book wouldn't change rates and would continue to generate strong earnings for a very long time to come.", "Probably the most impactful place is kind of our group term product. So group life LTD and STD. 41% of our earnings as a company are generated by that. And let me talk about some of the underlying characteristics of that. The first one would be in terms of pricing within the industry we would only need to respond to the industry tax savings, rather than our tax savings, and because the industry has a significantly lower margin than we do.", "We don't see that as being terribly material maybe in the 1% to 1.5% of premium range. Frankly, 1% to 1.5% of premium isn't within the precision window of the group benefits business. And if you want to be convinced of that, look at a chart of all the group competitors, group margins over the last four or five years. I will tell you, it looks like a spaghetti chart. It would suggest that pricing of 1% really isn't much of a factor.", "The other thing I'd say is not everyone was at a 35% tax rate going into this. If you were heavily invested in tax exempt bonds, you got no tax savings on that income, as a result of tax reform. And if you're using those bonds to back liabilities at a tax equivalent discount rate, you may actually be feeling some pressure as a result of tax reform.", "The other thing is the capital impacts of tax reform are still uncertain. If people need to rebuild capital to come back up to the same levels of risk-based capital after the formula changes as they were before they may not see ROEs improve and wouldn't be pricing any of that back into the market.", "And then the third thing is even in the group business although it's a term business, it's still a three to four year pricing cycle, because of how renewals come up and rate guarantees are in place. So some of that may get priced back over time, but we think it's going to be very muted relative to the current expectations.", "And so right now I'd like to turn it back to Rick for a second.", "Richard McKenney", "Yeah. So I think it's instructive, Erik. Jack's given you a lot of reasons, why we just don't see it right now. I think, it's probably good to pull it up a level two, and just talk to you about what the pricing environment looks like in general, which we think is seeing some positive trends. And maybe we'll start on Unum U.S., Mike can talk about what's going on in the general pricing environment.", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah. Thanks, Rick. I'd say we have a pretty typical pricing environment out there right now, but I'd say gradually it's been moving up. And Jack made the point, if industry margins sits somewhere in the mid-single-digits. They're still probably some room to go for the industry to be consistently earning at least their cost of capital there. And so as we did not need to move rates up as we talked about coming into 2017, we find ourselves positioned, I think, pretty comfortable in the window. We're never going to be the most inexpensive option out there, certainly though we need to be competitive.", "So what you see reflected in our new sales numbers, what you see reflected in strong and improving persistency number, and Jack alluded to it at the outset, our early read on January 1 renewals here in 2018 also reflect that. We're positioned pretty comfortably competitively.", "Richard McKenney", "And Tim, you want to talk a little bit about Colonial Life and the pricing and competitive environment?", "Timothy Gerald Arnold", "Yeah, absolutely. So as Jack mentioned in the voluntary benefit space. Rates are filed and guaranteed renewable it is a long process for changing rates and would only apply typically to new products or new issues moving forward. Product is going to be very affordable in this space. And then the VB market rates are less important than other elements of a value proposition like enrollment capabilities and the customer experience at both the employer at consumer level. And we feel we're really well positioned with our overall value prop, so we are concerned about this.", "Richard McKenney", "Hopefully, that's a good answer for you, Erik.", "Timothy Gerald Arnold", "Yes. I appreciate all the details. Thank you.", "Richard McKenney", "All right, Erik.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.", "Humphrey Lee", "Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. On the expenses in group visibility, supplemental and voluntary, and Colonial Life in the quarter, as you mentioned they were somewhat elevated. But I was just wondering, what portions of those expenses were higher, because of higher variable compensation due to strong sales in the quarter as opposed to business reinvestment.", "Richard McKenney", "Yeah, so the very specific question, Humphrey, and Mike will answer that. But let me just hit at the highest level. So we did see some more expense in the fourth quarter, we are actually pretty happy about that overall, we are investing in the business. But I would tell you that as a company we still are focused on our efficiency. Our expense ratios have been stable to down over several years, we'll continue to focus there. But getting to your specific question, Mike, you want to hit on that.", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah, thanks, Humphrey, and good morning. I think, you hit it right. We talked about a little bit of favorability due to timing in the third quarter ratio and that came back as we expected a bit in the fourth quarter. And so I think there's a good chunk of it that you can attribute to timing. And then the balance of it, if you think the other half in those particular segments is a combination of the expenses incurred in a very strong sales year, so that's a good expense to take as well as the investments that we're making in the business. And I'd highlight a couple of things around the client experience.", "We have recently rolled out new capabilities around leave. Corporate leaves are picking up, you'd see a lot of that in the headlines as corporations are extending maternity and paternity leaves and other protective leaves that layer on top of statutory leaves at the municipal state and federal level. That's a lot of good news for employees, but complexity for an employer and that's where we come in, and those kind of capabilities certainly give us a little tailwind in 2017. But I think really the benefit is to come in 2018.", "So we're actually pleased with the earnings coming out of those segments, particularly because underneath and inside those are investments that, I think, are going to propel us here in 2018.", "Humphrey Lee", "Got it. And then on the long-term care. At the Investor Day, you talked about you expect them to be a little bit elevated in 2018. Can you remind us, why you feel comfortable that there would be a near term observation for 2018 as opposed to something that is more structurally challenge.", "John McGarry", "So - part of the reason is we did our reserve review, our margin during 2017 and reserves. Actually grew a little bit, because we've been outperforming on the investment side. But if you look at the big picture around long term care, and where we are with the reserves. There are a couple of factors: one, 2017 was a very good year for the living, you saw that in favorable individual life results across the industry. Our risk in long term care is a longevity risk, not a mortality risk, so we were the other side of that coin that put pressure on long term care results.", "I would tell you old age mortality is very volatile. We had low mortality in the fourth quarter, which contributed to that benefit ratio. Today, we find ourselves facing one of the most virulent flu seasons in a decade. And we're already seeing some signs of that in our currently emerging results. So the business is volatile, we're not going to react to a single quarters. We're going to look at that long term care trends, we've been looking at that over time, we will continue to do so.", "And the one thing I will tell you is, we'll keep you apprised of that as it emerges, and we'll see how 2018 plays out, keep you posted along the way. And if we do have to adjust reserves as a result of emerging experience, we're confident that it will be - that will not affect our capital plans, because of the margins we have, because of the rate increase latitude, and because of the gaps that difference we currently have built into our reserves.", "Humphrey Lee", "Got it. And then, I guess, just in terms of the elevated experience, how much of that was - can be attributed to you kind of pushing through the rate increases, and then the policyholders receiving the notices and have kind of the waking of the sleeping dog that you [finally saw] [ph] coming through?", "Richard McKenney", "There may be some minor pieces to that, but most of it was a mortality story. And you got to remember in long term care, weaker mortality results affects both the disabled claim reserve and the active life reserve, because policies don't terminate. And so that's what we saw in the quarter.", "Humphrey Lee", "Got it. Thank you.", "Richard McKenney", "Thanks, Humphrey.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Suneet Kamath from Citi.", "Suneet Kamath", "Great, thanks. Just to follow up on Humphrey's questioning on the long term care, obviously, the loss ratio is something we all look at every quarter. So could you provide some more specificity around what you expect for 2018. Should we thinking 90% to 95% or 90% to 93% above 90% leaves it somewhat vague and I was just hoping you could be a little bit more specific?", "Richard McKenney", "Yeah, I thought, we kind of directed to the low-90%, so that would put you in between the 90% and 95% range. And again I'd remind you that we expect it to be volatile as it has been over time.", "Suneet Kamath", "Got it. And then just in terms of the price increases, I'm assuming that what you've asked for so far was assuming in the 85% to 90%, so if we are elevated 90% to 95%. How much of an incremental price increase would you need, if we're at those loss ratios?", "Richard McKenney", "I'd say it's more complex than that Suneet, the - you make assumptions in reserves that it's not purely a one-to-one like price hits the loss ratio. There are a lot of factors around, how the incidences of things emerge and how they hit you reserve factors.", "So I want to say it's a direct tie. I think we're comfortable that with the dry powder we have on rate increases given emerging experience and the buffer we have between gap and stat that we wouldn't see the remedy to this causing any impact on our capital plans. But if - in long term care it's a long term thing, it's not what happens this quarter you're predicting things out over the next 40 and 50 years. Really that has to do with how a lot of different assumptions interplay.", "Suneet Kamath", "Yeah. That makes sense. I mean the reason I asked the question, if I thought that some of the larger state approved some price increases in the recent past, but one of the deal they struck with that that carriers wouldn't come back for five years or so. So that the case, I mean, are you going to be able to build in incremental pricing, if the loss ratio space at 90% to 95%?", "Richard McKenney", "Well, some of those large states, we still have outstanding, so we haven't heard back from them. I'll give you an example of New York gave us a long term care rate increase. Several years ago they did put do not return sign on it for a while. That's expired at this point. And we will go back to New York going forward. So the fact of the matter of five years is a drop in the bucket in the long term care business. And really that trade off we would hope that any reserve assumptions we built into requests for a rate increase would survive a five year period.", "Suneet Kamath", "Okay.", "Richard McKenney", "Thanks, Suneet.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Alex Scott", "Thank you. First one just on capital generation, uses of capital I mean it sounds like even though the cash taxes are a bit higher than GAAP taxes, there's still incremental free cash. So could you talk about just the potential uses particularly with the cash balance of the holdco? Would you favor MNA verse potential upside the capital management you played out?", "Richard McKenney", "Yeah. So fortunately, we've entered this period in a really strong capital position we do have $864 million of holding company cash. At holding company, even after our DTA write-off, our RBC ratios are still comfortably in our 375 to 400 range. And actually we've entered this period with lower leverage than we've had in quite a long time. So we do see the impact of free cash flow we purchased a Polish company. Just recently, I think we will continue to look for merger and acquisition opportunities either to expand our reach, or frankly also capabilities that help to sort of support and complement our offerings in the marketplace.", "But the other thing is, we're being understandably cautious at the moment, because it isn't clear yet how the NAIC is going to react, what they're going to do with their capital formulas whether it's going to be a phase-in or an immediate impact and what the follow-on on the C1 factor changes would be.", "It's also unclear how rating agencies are going to react S&P, and A.M. Best have come out and said, we use our own capital formulas that are not tax adjusted and don't expect to react to RBC formulas, Moody's still kind of a wild card out there. That will have to wait and see. And the one that's really unclear, is how you and other investors are going to react. Are you going to feel comfortable with RBCs, dropping as a result of the formula changes or not, so we're going to. stand around, we're going to maintain a strong balance sheet, irrespective of what happened we're really confident that we can respond to it quickly without necessarily impacting our - the strength of our balance sheet as a company.", "And so I think we're in a wait-and-see moment, but it's great to be coming into this with such a strong capital position to start.", "Alex Scott", "And the follow-up on long term care. I think in the past, you've had a larger amount of interest rate hedges going back a few years. Now with interest rates starting to move up, would it potentially become attractive for you guys to reimplement a more about hedging strategy run rates there?", "Richard McKenney", "Yeah, we've had hedges, we haven't put on new hedges in a very, very long time. And there's two factors that happens there. As interest rates move up and become closer to our portfolio rate, we would certainly consider putting hedges on. The other thing is - at the same time, our discount rate has been coming down, because of some of the charges we've taken. So the gap between current interest rates and where I discount rates are - is closing, and if we get the opportunity to lock that in a favorable environment, I think we'd certainly take it.", "Alex Scott", "Thank you.", "Richard McKenney", "Thanks, Alex.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.", "Thomas Gallagher", "Good morning. Just a follow up-on long term care, Jack, your comment on old age mortality, I just want to get a better sense for what's happening there from what I gather at least, but what I'm just guessing is that that would be something like Alzheimer's patients living longer. And is that, what's happening do you think behind the scenes here and is that something that you think might need to be permanently changed in assumptions or is it not that clear, what the trend is there?", "John McGarry", "No. I didn't talk about old age mortality extending, I don't think there's a ton of evidence of that happening. What I said is it's volatile. And so you can't judge old age mortality, but what - by what happens in one or two quarters, you need to go through full cycle, judge it on annual and quinquennial kind of looks at it. And what we saw particularly in the - we had - the way of it would pretty good mortality in the first quarter of 2017. We had very poor mortality in the following three quarters one of the top comparisons between fourth quarter 2017 and fourth quarter 2016, is the flu season hit earlier in 2016.", "We saw an uptick on mortality and that resulted in more favorable results. But you're going to go through the cycle. You have to see how the years unfold it's not something you'd react to on a quarterly basis. And again kind of the improvements in mortality that doesn't happen one or two years, that's something that happens over decades.", "Thomas Gallagher", "Okay. And then, is - do you still - it sounds - Jack, from your comments it sounds like you guys are still comfortable this won't be a cash situation regardless of what the outcome is on a GAAP basis. You still feel pretty good about that, and I'm guessing with the GE charge, the regulators are going to take more notice. Do you think there's going to be any impact and reaction here more broadly, whether that's to your captive structure or anything else that you would say might be some kind of reaction to that.", "John McGarry", "Yeah, we're not anticipating a reaction to that. As I said, we're in a different - very different place than GE Capital. We talk regularly with our regulator that, as we have no surprises with you, we have no surprises with them either. So we're not anticipating an impact.", "Thomas Gallagher", "Okay. And then final question, just on the social security death master file charge, you took one in 2013. Why did that recurred. I would have thought, if you took care of it in 2013 I would expected you to be checking it every year or maybe I'm not thinking about that in the right way.", "Richard McKenney", "Yeah, now, it's a little bit different than that now. I mean, it's not a checking every year. I think it's a process change. And you're right, that back in 2013 we went through a process internally of assessing of how we want to go back and find claimants that have not actually filed a claim. So we did that, went back, several, several years to do that. That was the increase in reserves that we did back in 2013.", "Since that point in time, our process has been good. We've been finding these claimants and continuing to go back further than we're required to. I think what you've seen since that period of time, you've had dozens of companies out there that have gone back even further in the process. And so, as we've looked at it, we're going to reflect that as well. And that's what you saw on the fourth quarter. So it's not a process differential. Our process is very good. This is going back several decades to find claimants that actually never filed a claim.", "And so, we feel good about doing that. And this should be the last time you hear about this.", "Thomas Gallagher", "Got it, Rick. So really this was just because they - they request and you go way, way back. This wasn't - this had nothing to do with like the go-forward process.", "Richard McKenney", "No, think early '90s. So this is something that we had gone back a decade. Last time we looked at it and now we're going back to the early '90s. That's why I say I don't expect to go back further than that.", "Thomas Gallagher", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Mark Hughes", "Yeah, thank you. Good morning. The corporate segment was little better this quarter. How should we think about that going forward?", "John McGarry", "Yeah, so two things drove that about half-and-half. Half of it was just better net investment income performance in the corporate segment. And the other half was pure expenses. We actually had higher expenses. Last year in the corporate segment, we were dealing with some - a little bit of disruption and that - in staffing that we accounted for in the corporate segment last year.", "We didn't expect that to repeat it. It didn't repeat. And so, I think the expense level in the corporate segment is at a good level, net investment income, because it's kind of a leftover bucket, may fluctuate from time to time. But I would say last year was elevated as opposed to this year being low.", "Mark Hughes", "Right, yeah, tax rate outlook, is at 19 to 20 or 19 to 21?", "John McGarry", "We think it is kind of\u2026", "Richard McKenney", "Near term 19 to 20.", "John McGarry", "2018 will be 19 to 20. As some things happen it's going to float up slightly over time. So that 19 to 21 is more of a longer term outlook.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you.", "Richard McKenney", "Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo.", "Sean Dargan", "Hi, thanks. I just have a question about any differences between the guidance given in December and then the - the post-tax-reform guidance given last night. So it sounds like there's some additional investment. Just wondering where that's going to come through. And also wondering if you changed your UK or how you're thinking about UK earnings in dollars, given the movement of the pound.", "John McGarry", "Yeah, so in our guidance if you just took pure tax reform and grossed it up, we'd be at the top end of that 23% range. We are planning on making investments in our business to accelerate some things that we were - had in the works anyway, and will take this opportunity to do - and so that brings it down a little bit in the range. It's not outsized in terms of amounts.", "It's a fraction of what the savings were. The other part of that question\u2026", "Richard McKenney", "It's in the UK, that's about the UK outlook, because\u2026", "John McGarry", "Yeah, and so we did not change the UK. We have not changed the foreign exchange rate in our outlook. That may provide a little bit of upside within that range.", "Sean Dargan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Richard McKenney", "Thanks, Sean.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Randy Binner from B. Riley.", "Randolph Binner", "Hey, thanks. I just want to go back to your comment, just on UK segment and headwinds from Brexit. I don't think that got followed up on in these questions. But I guess the benefit ratio is a little bit higher there. But nothing there seem dramatic.", "So with Jack's comments, so is that - is it more like a premium production challenge from Brexit kind of in the southern part of England or is it - are you seeing shades of what we saw when there is financial pressure there last time around, where you see a little bit higher claim incidents? What is the Brexit pressure that you're seeing in the UK business exactly.", "Richard McKenney", "Yeah, Randy, let's go to Peter O'Donnell in the UK to get our Brexit update. Peter?", "Peter O'Donnell", "Great. Thanks very much, Randy. So the way I describe it is, the UK is doing well in a tough environment. So actually our results as you say, there's nothing dramatic happening where we're sort of performing recently well. If the market was better, I think we'd be forming a lot better. And, of course, the relativity to the US world is one of the things I guess that influences that commentary.", "In terms of what we're seeing, really going back to what were the implications of Brexit, so there's three things I'd point out to you. One is those lower interest rates, interest rates are lower for longer, which means for us our interest rate sensitive products we've been putting right through in 2017.", "I think there is some chink of light there in that. We are seeing the market begin to move as well. So, some of the competitors are starting to put rate through, which gives me some confidence going into 2018 that that will be a slightly easier environment to be more competitive in. But in saying that, our sales numbers and our premium numbers were pretty good last year.", "The second thing is this political uncertainty and economic uncertainty. So what we are not seeing is that natural tailwinds you get from wages and you get from sort of employment growth, particularly at the large employer end. That's been muted in 2017. And I think that will continue in 2018. The uncertainty is continuing and until we have a clear plan that companies can plan for in terms of the exit, that's just a headwind for us.", "And the third thing as you pointed out, we have seen slightly higher incidents across the industry on our income protection side. That's something that we are factoring into our pricing. So we're putting more rate into sort of rectify that. But that's been something that's been a little abnormal in 2017. We probably think that will continue good in 2018, but nothing dramatic in terms of what we're seeing.", "And I think if you remember our guidance, flat to slightly up earnings is where we're positioning our numbers.", "Randolph Binner", "Yeah, that's great. And on the higher incidents is there a particular type of claim you're seeing?", "Peter O'Donnell", "No, it's across the piece. Just - we just think it's one of those abnormal years. And just a little bit of I think uncertainty in the environment causing people to perhaps be a little bit more tendency to have a bit more sickness in their operations. Eventually, we think that will revert to a norm. But again, it goes down to that uncertainty.", "Randolph Binner", "Very good. Thanks a lot.", "Richard McKenney", "Good. Thanks, Randy.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Joshua Shanker", "Thank you very much. And good - I want to ask a question about the group dental expansion. I'm trying to understand the customers that you are targeting. Is this a pie that's getting bigger and you're going to take a greater share of it? Or is this - customers you're dealing with on the life and disability side, potentially who you might be able to get to also by the dental product?", "Where does the growth come from most general insurance, not one thing, but as you expand how should we think about that?", "Richard McKenney", "Mike, you want to take that?", "Michael Simonds", "Sure. Thanks, Rick. I appreciate the question, Josh. So I think it is absolutely both. If you take a step back, the premium production in terms of new business approached about $50 million this year and built momentum all the way through the year. That was the introduction of the group dental product into roughly half the country.", "As of January 1, we've introduced that through pretty much the rest of the country under the Unum brand. It targets our core market and really in particular the small to mid-sized business that's under 250 employees. And in that segment, you'd certainly find a great deal of in-force dental that might be with a standalone provider.", "And to your point, we very often write it in concert with life disability and voluntary benefits. And in fact, we saw about ten points better growth in those products in the regions where we had group dental in 2017. So it's a real lift for us outside of just the dental premium and the profit that will follow.", "In the smallest end of the market, you actually find employers that aren't yet offering a group data plan. So you are actually growing the pie to use your analogy in that case. And so, we feel really excited about what the prospects are as we continue to add capability network and product into that dental suite.", "Also in January, excited to bring the star-month [ph] capability for dental and vision into the Colonial Life distribution. Tim, you'd like talk about early returns there.", "Timothy Gerald Arnold", "Yeah, absolutely. So we actually began selling the product in April, so said it'll be - start showing up in second quarter. We're very excited. Dental is the number two most requested product in the voluntary benefits industry. So we're excited to have a solution there. Our solution will be an individual PPO product. There's tremendous energy and excitement in our field about it, because in addition to being able to offer that product into our 85,000 plus employer customers, we're very excited about penetrating the 6 million small businesses that have fewer than one hundred employees, who desperately need not only this product, but we think this will be a door opener to some of our other products as well, so lot of excitement about it.", "Joshua Shanker", "And along those lines\u2026", "Richard McKenney", "We appreciate it. Josh - Josh, as I said, we appreciate the question, because that's an acquisition that we did with leverage of what we already do well on the distribution side. And it's a good example of how we can take some of the things that we're very good at and bring them out in a different way to our customers. So I appreciate the question.", "Joshua Shanker", "Are there of life and disability sales that you can make now that you have done till that you couldn't have made before, that people wanted all three and since you only had two and made you limited in your audience?", "John McGarry", "The answer to that is, yes. It's a little bit difficult. We actually spent some time with field folks and brokers to try to glean exactly what that percentage is, but we're estimating. When we write the disability and life insurance with the group dental product, fully a third of the time we would not have been invited to quote on that opportunity.", "Joshua Shanker", "Thank you very much for all\u2026", "John McGarry", "We're not for the dental, yeah.", "Richard McKenney", "Good. Thanks, Josh.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up with Mark Hughes from SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "A quick question, on the long-term care, Is there are an opportunity to do any sort of risk transfer or reinsure - the insurance of that block?", "John McGarry", "From what I've seen, there's been a lot of activity on the variable annuity blocks. I think long-term care is still a ways away. They're still a bit out spread on the interest margins and long term care. And quite frankly, it's just - it's still an immature product. Underlying experience is emerging.", "It's not well understood. It's volatile. And I think until either interest rates rise and you get some margin protection as a result of interest rates or the liabilities are better understood. I think we're still a ways away on a transaction.", "Mark Hughes", "Thanks.", "Richard McKenney", "Savannah, any other questioners in the queue?", "Operator", "And we have one follow up with Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.", "Richard McKenney", "Okay.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "I had just a couple of questions. First, on long-term care, if you could talk about what the environment is for price hikes. And whether you see any risk that with lower taxes it's going to be harder to get regulators to approve the price size either in long-term care and similarly in some of the other products where you have to file with regulators for prices?", "Richard McKenney", "Great, Jimmy. Let me turn it to Steve Zabel, who'll take you through that environment.", "Steve Zabel", "Yeah, thanks for the question. This is Steve. I would say from the standpoint of the regulatory environment. It's good. We've seen it really improve over the last, say, half a decade. I think regulators are becoming more educated on what the issue is. We've seen in even some of the more problematic states that there's more dialogue and more openness.", "So we continue to have good relationship with our regulators and we feel pretty confident about how that will play forward. From the standpoint of tax reform and I'll handle it from the LTC side. The actuarial maths to support those are pretax loss ratios. So just from a kind of a regulatory construct the tax rate really doesn't factor into the conversations that we do have with the states.", "The other thing is just based upon how profitable the block may be. Not all these blocks are making money. And so the tax reform may actually drive you to higher rates. And so, we haven't really had that conversation with any of the regulators yet. But we feel pretty good that that's not going to really impact how we think about LTC premium levels.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then, just on any of the other products where you're filing with regulators that you - do you have any thoughts on how taxes if - I realize cash taxes are going down less than GAAP. But do you have any thoughts on how that will affect?", "Richard McKenney", "Mike, go ahead.", "Michael Simonds", "Yeah, it's Mike. It's very little. And for the reasons that Jack and I talked about earlier on the call. For most of the products we're talking about, pretty de-minimis impact on the actual percentage of premium that might be impacted. So anytime, we're going to take a new product or a rate filing on active business to department of insurance. Much more important is going to be what the trends on the underlying risks are, how expenses have emerged, then the tax rate.", "John McGarry", "I'd say, Jimmy, too I don't think there's any place in our company other than the Closed Block, where we're filing for increased rates.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then just lastly on the - if you could just talk about competitor behavior and pricing in the disability market? And how much of an opportunity do you see from this consolidation that we've seen in the market with a couple of competitors being eliminated by - through the Hartford and Lincoln acquisitions?", "Michael Simonds", "Right. It's Mike. I think you hit on a very good point. And so, our philosophy is always, we're going to be a disciplined underwriter when it comes to the group insurance market. And we find ourselves positioned in a spot, where we're in a window. We're competitive as I said.", "We're never going to be the least expensive, but we feel very, very good about the value prop that we're bringing to market. And the stability with which we are bringing that value into our brokerage and employer clients. And so, yeah, to your point, there is a bit of consolidation and certainly the associated disruption that's happening, particularly in the mid to large end of the market.", "And our folks are long tenured. They've got great relationships. The brand is very strong. And so, I think among other companies I think we're well positioned to take advantage of that.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. Thank you.", "Richard McKenney", "Great. Thanks, Jimmy.", "Richard McKenney", "And we're up on time here. I think we've exhausted all the questions. I would like to thank everybody for taking the time to join us this morning. We do look forward to seeing many of you at various insurance conferences and investor meetings over the next several weeks. And, Savannah, that now completes our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's conference.
